1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,030
In this video I'm going to introduce you to the order of operations.
1

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,330
This is an important principle in arithmetic and I'm also going to show you the importance of spacing
2

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,960
in Python and the importance of parentheses and you will see the difference between spacing, which is
3

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,750
used for visualization and parentheses which is used for grouping.
4

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,910
So let's begin with this equation here.
5

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,210
Four plus three times two minus one equals... what does it equal?
6

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,010
Now it may seem strange that I don't already know the answer because this seems like it should be a
7

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,180
pretty trivial arithmetic equation.
8

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,890
However, there's multiple ways that we can interpret this so we can get very different answers depending
9

10
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,490
on how we group these numbers, these arithmetic operations, together.
10

11
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:01,430
For example if we would grouped together 4 and 3 that would give us seven times to minus one equals
11

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,680
13 because seven times two is 14 minus one is 13.
12

13
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:12,710
Or we could group together the three times two, that would give us the four plus six from three times
13

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,730
two minus one, and then four plus six is ten minus one is nine.
14

15
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,660
Or we could grouped together the two and the minus one.
15

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,820
And that gives us one so then we have four plus three times one.
16

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,290
And now here we could either group the seven, the four plus three times one or the three times one plus
17

18
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:33,560
four.
18

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,030
So in this case because this is a one that ends up working out seven either way.
19

20
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,310
OK.
20

21
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,140
So it seems like there is some ambiguity and this isn't good.
21

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,070
We have the same collection of numbers we shouldn't be able to get very different answers like this.
22

23
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,360
Now it turns out that the correct answer in this case is this one here, the correct answer is nine.
23

24
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,890
We grouped together the three times two.
24

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,140
And that takes priority over the addition and subtraction.
25

26
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,030
So how do I know that this is the right answer
26

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,120
and this is the wrong answer?
27

28
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,300
Well, that is because of the order of operations.
28

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,270
So this is the order of operations parentheses come first.
29

30
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,620
They take precedence over all the other operations, and then exponent and multiplication and then division
30

31
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,960
then addition then subtraction.
31

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:31,310
Now this seems like it's a really difficult list to memorize and that's why we have these little shorthand
32

33
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,350
memory tricks or mnemonics.
33

34
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,530
So we have P E M D A S.
34

35
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:44,300
Some people will remember this by PEMDAS and some people remember please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.
35

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,030
So parentheses exponent multiplication and so on.
36

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,690
So now when you look at this equation you see there's addition, but addition is all the way here in the
37

38
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,810
back, then there's multiplication which is comes before addition and then subtraction which is all the
38

39
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,850
way at the end.
39

40
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,110
So we have to do the multiplication first because that comes first in this order.
40

41
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,600
Please excuse my dear and Sally.
41

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,610
And that gives us four plus six minus one.
42

43
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,190
And then there's a question of whether we should group four plus six or six minus one.
43

44
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,460
Now in this particular case with these numbers it turns out it doesn't matter.
44

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,390
You can do four plus six.
45

46
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,450
That gives you ten minus one is nine.
46

47
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,320
Or you can say six minus one is five plus four is also nine.
47

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,480
So in this particular case it works either way.
48

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
However, the correct order is to group the plus signs together.
49

50
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,000
And that's because of this -- Aunt comes before Sally.
50

51
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,320
All right.
51

52
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,800
So let's switch to Python and see how this gets implemented and in particular I want to show you how
52

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,640
to use parentheses to basically override any other order.
53

54
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,620
The first thing I want to do is confirm that without applying any parentheses I'm going to be able to
54

55
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,270
reproduce the answer that I claimed was correct in the slide because it's one thing for me to say that
55

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,550
some mathematical equation is true but it seems much more convincing when a computer does it.
56

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:26,350
So let's say print and I'm going to say so that was four plus three times two minus one.
57

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,630
All right.
58

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,320
So now we get nine.
59

60
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,680
Now I would like to show you that spacing actually has no effect whatsoever.
60

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,950
So when I wrote it out here I put spaces between each number and each operation but I'm going to say
61

62
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,730
four plus three.
62

63
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,710
And then with spaces, so maybe I'll even do it here as well... two minus one.
63

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,610
So now when you, as a human,
64

65
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,510
look at this line of code, what you see -- what your brain is doing is grouping together the four plus three
65

66
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,470
and it's grouping together the two minus one.
66

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,250
And those are separated by multiplication so in your mind you might be thinking that this should now
67

68
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,900
be seven times one.
68

69
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,480
However when we run this code again we still get nine.
69

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,430
So the point here is that spacing is really important for humans.
70

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,260
For you looking at your code and for other people to be able to interpret your code and read your code
71

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,390
However, the computer -- Python -- doesn't care about spaces. You can have as many spaces as you want like this.
72

73
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,890
And python is going to completely ignore all of these spaces here.
73

74
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,020
However, we can override everything using parentheses.
74

75
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,850
So remember parentheses was the first order of operations in.
75

76
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,680
Please excuse.
76

77
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,820
So now I put four plus three in parentheses and now.
77

78
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,300
Okay.
78

79
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,190
Get rid of a little bit of this spacing... it's a bit excessive.
79

80
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,650
Okay.
80

81
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,100
So now we have four plus three times two minus one.
81

82
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,750
So now we get a different answer and let's see if we can figure out why we get this answer here.
82

83
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,300
So this comes because we say four plus three.
83

84
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,690
Now this gets grouped together.
84

85
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,930
So this is seven.
85

86
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,010
And now what gets grouped over here.
86

87
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,660
So we still have the multiplication.
87

88
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,640
So actually python is grouping together the seven times the two.
88

89
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,960
So this gets run next and seven times two is 14.
89

90
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,220
And then we say minus one is 13.
90

91
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:41,140
So again we can override this by saying by adding parentheses here and now we are really going to get
91

92
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,470
an answer that is consistent with the visual grouping.
92

93
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,000
So now the answer is seven.
93

94
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,570
And that's because this gets grouped together as four plus three equals seven.
94

95
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,950
These get grouped together and the two minus one gets evaluated first and that's one of course.
95

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,550
So seven times one is one.
96

97
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,010
Here are your two exercises for this video.
97

98
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:15,430
What you see here is two exercises and each one contains four numbers and three arithmetic operations.
98

99
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,070
And I also give you two answers here.
99

100
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,080
So what you need to do is write these expressions write these equations into Python -- actually not the
100

101
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,320
whole equation, just the first part, just the left hand side of this equation. And then figure out a way
101

102
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,900
to add parentheses to make the following equations true.
102

103
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:41,140
So you need to add parentheses wherever appropriate to get this first expression equal to two.
103

104
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,430
And this second expression equal to zero.
104

105
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:51,030
So now is your opportunity to pause the video, switch to Python on your own, work through these two exercises.
105

106
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,560
And then when you're finished you can come back and watch me solve these problems.
106

107
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:08,850
OK so let's add a new cell here and let's start with the first one. So let's see, that one was four times
107

108
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,920
five divided by seven plus three.
108

109
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:20,700
So if we just run this on its own without any parentheses then we get some answer: five point eight
109

110
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,050
five whatever.
110

111
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,700
This is definitely not equal to two.
111

112
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,430
So that means that the default order of operations is not going to give us the right answer.
112

113
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,530
We need to add some parentheses.
113

114
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,920
So there's essentially two ways you can go about solving this problem.
114

115
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:41,410
One is you can just kind of randomly poke around and add parentheses wherever you feel like you know
115

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,670
maybe here and.
116

117
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:42,980
OK.
117

118
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:49,470
That doesn't change anything but that's not necessarily the best way to go about solving problems in
118

119
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:56,670
math or in programming. A better way is to sit down and first think about what the answer should be.
119

120
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,670
Now in this case we have only four numbers and three operations so it's not so hard to try to do some
120

121
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,660
mental grouping, mental arithmetic.
121

122
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,400
So I know that the answer needs to be two.
122

123
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,100
And so looking through this I can see four times five is twenty, seven plus three is 10.
123

124
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,330
OK.
124

125
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,690
So we want to have an expression that equals twenty divided by ten.
125

126
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,240
So it's pretty clear that we need to group these together. And then the question is do we need to group
126

127
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,220
the four and five together or can we just leave it like this?
127

128
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:37,360
And to think about that we can write down the PEMDAS, so please excuse my dear Aunt Sally and so here
128

129
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,050
you see that multiplication comes before division.
129

130
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:48,100
So that means that Python is going to group four times five together first and then it's going to apply
130

131
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,260
the division.
131

132
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:55,540
So that means we don't actually need parentheses here in order to get the correct answer of two.
132

133
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,050
Now this is already the correct answer.
133

134
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,980
However if this were my code I would do a few other things.
134

135
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,860
I would remove these spaces here so that it's really clear not only to Python but also to humans who
135

136
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,740
are looking at this code that this is grouped together in the denominator of this fraction.
136

137
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:22,540
Secondly I would also remove the spaces here also just to make it clear that the four and five are clearly
137

138
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,160
grouped together as the numerator.
138

139
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,440
Okay.
139

140
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,460
And now if you like for additional readability you can add parentheses to the numerator here.
140

141
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Notice I'm going to run this code again.
141

142
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,490
That doesn't change anything because multiplication already came before division.
142

143
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,960
However, I think you will agree that with the parentheses in the numerator it just looks a little bit
143

144
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,350
easier to parse, compared to without the parentheses.
144

145
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,200
All right.
145

146
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
So that was the first one.
146

147
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,990
Let's now try for the second one.
147

148
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:01,170
That was nine divided by three plus six minus one.
148

149
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:09,030
And somehow we have to get this to be equal to zero and it is not equal to zero, it's equal to eight.
149

150
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,530
So again one thing you could do is just kind of randomly poke around and start adding parentheses here
150

151
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,880
and there and see what happens.
151

152
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
But I don't think that's really the best strategy.
152

153
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,820
A better strategy is to just kind of look and be inquisitive about this problem and see if we can figure
153

154
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,240
it out in our heads.
154

155
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:32,560
So this is nine and then divided by three plus six of if we group these together we get nine divided
155

156
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,320
by nine which is 1 and then minus 1.
156

157
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,810
And that'll give us zero.
157

158
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:45,010
So I'm going to put parentheses around here again unnecessary spaces but this helps visually group and
158

159
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,040
then we have a question of whether we need to put parentheses around all of this to make sure that python
159

160
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,720
will say nine times nine minus one as opposed to nine divided by nine minus one.
160

161
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,190
And the answer is we don't need parentheses because again division comes before subtraction.
161

162
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,800
So I believe that this will give us the right answer.
162

163
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,720
Again this is technically correct if you like to remove some spaces to group these things together then
163

164
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,500
that's great.
164

165
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:25,910
I definitely encourage that. So in this video you learned the mnemonic -- that's a memory trick -- for the order
165

166
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:33,440
of operations. That was PEMDAS or please excuse my dear and Sally. And I also highlighted the importance
166

167
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:40,790
of spacing and Python for ease of visualization and parentheses for actual grouping in code.
