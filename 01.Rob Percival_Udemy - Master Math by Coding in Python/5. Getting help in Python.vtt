00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.050
If you are already an amazing python programmer with years of experience with Python programming then
1

2
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.920
that's great.
2

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.630
You don't have to worry about the little details of coding in this course but I'm guessing that you
3

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.990
probably are not a total expert in Python.
4

5
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.520
Maybe you are completely new to Python.
5

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.390
Maybe have a little bit of experience with Python but you're not really so comfortable.
6

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.160
So I want to have this video that is just going to tell you a little bit about how to get help when
7

8
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.270
you are stuck in Python.
8

9
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.330
And this is the kind of situation where you know what you want to do you know what you want the computer
9

10
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.000
to do.
10

11
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.800
You're just not really sure exactly how to implement it in Python.
11

12
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.600
So here's the correct order for getting help when you're stuck in Python.
12

13
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.930
First of all you try things in Python.
13

14
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.350
Next you search online and then you look through the Q&A forum -- the question and answer forum -- in this
14

15
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.710
course.
15

16
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.450
So let me spend a moment talking about each one of these options.
16

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.660
So your first line of defense should be going directly to Python and just you know trying out stuff
17

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.800
in Python.
18

19
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.370
It's only going to help. One of my favorite things about coding and one thing that makes coding better
19

20
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.370
than real life.
20

21
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.530
There's always an undo; you can always go back and undo your changes. So never hesitate to just start
21

22
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.360
trying stuff when you're confused.
22

23
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.090
Just try a bunch of stuff and you know make sure you have a backup of the good code, the working code,
23

24
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.910
so you don't lose anything.
24

25
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.320
And there's also ways to get help on specific functions as they're called help files or sometimes they're
25

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.130
called Doc strings and you access these Doc strings by pressing shift tab inside of a function.
26

27
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.010
So I'm going to switch to Python now and show you what I mean by these two points. So here we are in
27

28
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.450
Python in a Jupiter IPython notebook.
28

29
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.790
And here's this function abs.
29

30
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.250
And then there's just an empty set of parentheses so whenever you see a bunch of letters and then parentheses
30

31
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.270
afterwards that indicates that this is a function.
31

32
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.340
So what does this function abs mean?
32

33
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.860
Well, we're not at the gym so I'm guessing that this is not something about doing core workouts.
33

34
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.920
Maybe it's something about the absolute value of a number.
34

35
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.430
So I'm just going to try; I'm just going to put in the number four and now to run this code I'm going to press
35

36
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.620
control enter on my keyboard and then we get the answer for ha.
36

37
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.210
So that's the same thing.
37

38
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.960
Now what happens if I type minus 4.
38

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.370
Then the answer is still 4.
39

40
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.010
So that seems to be the absolute value of this number.
40

41
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.250
And now I'm just going to try some other random things.
41

42
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.750
What happens if I type.
42

43
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170
Maybe just some strings in here.
43

44
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.570
Aha.
44

45
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.000
Well now I get an error and it says that name SDF is not defined.
45

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.660
That's because there is no variable called SDF.
46

47
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.440
So I'm just trying to illustrate a few different ways of testing out things in python just to see what
47

48
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.510
happens and to read the error messages.
48

49
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.070
So here I put in two separate numbers to input arguments and the error was that this function abs
49

50
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.400
takes exactly one argument.
50

51
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.740
All right.
51

52
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.820
So you can do a little bit of trial and error testing and that will help you figure out stuff.
52

53
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.800
And then if you put the cursor inside the parentheses here then press shift and then tab on your keyboard
53

54
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.720
and that's going to bring up this little window here.
54

55
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.370
This is called the help file or the doc string.
55

56
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.230
Now sometimes these help files are really really helpful and they explain things very clearly.
56

57
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.290
Sometimes they give you examples to follow and sometimes they're not really so helpful.
57

58
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.220
Sometimes they're a little bit hard to interpret but it's always worth checking the help file just to
58

59
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.090
make sure.
59

60
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.270
So this thing says, so it gives an overview of the function with the possible inputs and then it says
60

61
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.620
return the absolute value of the argument or the input.
61

62
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.410
OK.
62

63
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.050
So that's actually pretty clear for this example.
63

64
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.360
Now there's also this plus sign here.
64

65
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.830
You can often click on this plus sign and usually, not always but very often, there's more information
65

66
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.250
there's more help.
66

67
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.730
Now in this case there is no more information.
67

68
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.380
Okay so I'm going to close this.
68

69
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.010
Here's another function called range and now I'm basically just going to press shift tab and get some
69

70
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.950
more information about this function.
70

71
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.980
And so this actually does have a lot more information including suggestions for how to come up with
71

72
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.330
examples for testing this function.
72

73
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.970
So this is just illustrating some of the ways that you can already get help yourself in Python. Another
73

74
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.610
way to get help is to look online.
74

75
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.080
So Python has a huge worldwide community.
75

76
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.870
There are many many questions that have already been answered so it's likely that your question is already
76

77
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.150
out there on the Internet.
77

78
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.540
A lot of these questions are asked and answered in English but you can also find Web sites in German
78

79
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.330
and Spanish and Turkish and Chinese and all sorts of languages where people are getting help from each
79

80
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.150
other in Python.
80

81
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.340
So when you're searching online make sure to use appropriate and specific key search terms.
81

82
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.470
That's going to help you get the right answer.
82

83
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.730
And my little tip is not only to search the Web sites using text but also search for image results so
83

84
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.230
let me give you an example of how to search for something online. So here we are at our friendly little
84

85
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.400
Google home page.
85

86
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.940
Let's say I'm a little bit stuck with some plotting.
86

87
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.730
Maybe I have a plot that has a line color that I don't really like the color and I want to change the
87

88
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.420
color.
88

89
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:06.800
So I'm going to search for how to change the line color in python.
89

90
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.320
Now notice that I have a lot of specific keywords here.
90

91
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.670
I have change and line color and python.
91

92
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.400
These are all important key terms.
92

93
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.110
So now I can search and look at this.
93

94
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.750
Look how many results I get.
94

95
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.150
This is already telling me how to set the line color.
95

96
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.070
So here's from Stack Overflow.
96

97
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.320
Always great answers on Stack Overflow.
97

98
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.970
This is the official Python Web site from the plotting engine.
98

99
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.040
Here is some other Web site and another Web site.
99

100
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.480
Look how many different answers we get.
100

101
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.240
Okay so your answer is likely to already be here.
101

102
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.750
And here's my little tip: click here on images so you can do an image search.
102

103
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:53.120
And particularly if you are asking questions about visualization and modifying plots then the image
103

104
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.810
search is great because you can see exactly what you're looking for.
104

105
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.960
Maybe this is the kind of thing that you were looking for.
105

106
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.360
So then you know what to click on.
106

107
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.910
Another reason why it's really cool to do image search is here.
107

108
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.930
When looking for questions that you might come across some really interesting things that you didn't
108

109
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.340
even know existed that turn out to be really interesting and fun.
109

110
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:22.820
So for example maybe you didn't know that you can change the line the color of a line as you're going
110

111
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.080
through the line like this.
111

112
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.010
So you can learn something new that you weren't even thinking that you needed to know.
112

113
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.780
Now let me be clear that I am happy to engage with you in the Q&A forum, the question and answer forum,
113

114
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.810
on this Web site.
114

115
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.940
However, I do encourage you to use the Q&A forum after you have already done some investigations
115

116
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.720
yourself in Python and online.
116

117
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.890
So before you post the question you should already search through the Q&A forum for your question
117

118
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.690
and try using different search terms.
118

119
00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.330
It's very possible that someone has already asked the same question or a very similar question to what
119

120
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.920
you are thinking about.
120

121
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.060
And then if you post a new question please be specific include a screenshot or paste your code.
121

122
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:13.830
And if you're pasting your code into the Q&A box then you can use the code formatting tool so you
122

123
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.730
select the code that you've pasted in and then you press this little,
123

124
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:24.030
there's gonna be a little button at the text formatting options that will allow you to paste your code
124

125
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:30.030
in a way that looks like code that that makes it really really easy for me to copy and paste your code
125

126
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.030
into my computer so I can help you out.
126

127
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:38.970
The thing is if you post a generic question then I'm not really going to be able to help you.
127

128
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.200
So if you want my help then you have to help me by including screenshots and or code and even better
128

129
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.940
if you are referring to a specific part of the video.
129

130
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.960
Then make sure you give a timestamp so I can refer back to exactly that point in the video.
130

131
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.640
Again this is your way of helping me to give you a best answer.
