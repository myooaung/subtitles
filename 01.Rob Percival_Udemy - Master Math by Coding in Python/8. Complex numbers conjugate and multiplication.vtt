00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.490
Now that you know a little bit about complex numbers it's time to move on and learn about multiplying

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.240
complex numbers and whenever you talk about complex numbers and multiplication you are often going to

3
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.500
come across the complex conjugate.

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.110
So therefore I'm also going to introduce you to the complex conjugate.

5
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.950
It's actually a pretty neat little trick to multiply a complex number by its complex conjugate and I

6
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.560
will show you exactly what that means.

7
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.970
So let's get started.

8
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.510
Here we have two complex numbers Z and W..

9
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.190
And to multiply them together it's not quite as simple or straightforward as with additions.

10
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.460
So you might initially intuitively think that multiplying z times w should be a times c and then b times

11
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.850
D.

12
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.260
However the way that it actually works is you think about these like a set of numbers.

13
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.000
So here's a set of two numbers times a set of two numbers.

14
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.380
So then you actually have to distribute all of the individual multiplications.

15
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.550
So that means that z times W. is actually a times C..

16
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.180
That's this multiplication here and then a times D I.

17
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.590
Which is this term.

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.610
Times this term and then C times b i.

19
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.240
Which is this term times this term and then b times D I squared which is B times D I.

20
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.120
And now it's pretty interesting to see what happens these two terms can be combined because they are

21
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.360
both multiplying the imaginary operator.

22
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.390
However this term actually drops out so the imaginary part drops out because I squared is minus one

23
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.360
and that's because I is the square root of minus one so the square root of minus one times the square

24
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.530
root of minus one gives you minus one.

25
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.220
So this actually this term reduces to a real number.

26
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.240
So minus BD again the minus sign is because I squared equals minus one.

27
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.470
Okay.

28
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.910
So this is for multiplying complex numbers and in a moment when we switch to Python but I'm going to

29
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.740
show you is that doing all of this individual multiplication.

30
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.720
So separating out these four terms manually gives you the same result as just writing z times w..

31
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.050
Okay.

32
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.800
Now I'd like to introduce you to the complex conjugate.

33
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.770
So if Z is a complex number then a complex conjugate is indicated either using an asterisk in the superscript

34
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.760
or with a bar on top of the number like this.

35
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.100
Either one of these is acceptable.

36
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.390
These both mean the same thing.

37
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.080
So what is the complex conjugate.

38
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.260
How do you compute it.

39
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.800
It's actually really simple.

40
00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:01.760
So if said is a plus b i then the complex conjugate of Z is a minus B I know what you're doing here

41
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.030
is you're flipping the sign of the imaginary part.

42
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.350
So it's not just that you're making the imaginary part negative.

43
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:17.750
So for example if the original said was a minus B I then the complex conjugate of Z would be a plus

44
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.350
b I noticed here you're also not doing anything to the real part.

45
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.270
So the real part stays the same the sign stays the same.

46
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.670
And it's just that the sign of the imaginary part flips.

47
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.280
So it's pretty simple.

48
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.720
And that is the complex conjugate and now something interesting happens when you multiply a complex

49
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.550
number by its complex conjugate.

50
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.880
So let's see what that is.

51
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.410
Let's work through the multiplication.

52
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.130
So z times Z.

53
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.470
Here I'm using a start to indicate the complex conjugate and actually if you like you can pause the

54
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.020
video here and work through this multiplication on your own and see what happens so working through

55
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.280
all the individual multiplications we get a squared and then minus A times B I because of the outer

56
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.550
terms here and then plus a times b I from this inner term here and minus B I squared.

57
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.090
Now this is not B times I squared.

58
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.920
This is actually the quantity B I.

59
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.270
And then all of that squared.

60
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.530
And that's because you're multiplying this b I by this minus B.

61
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.840
So then a couple of interesting things happen.

62
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.940
This a plus b.

63
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.770
This is minus and plus a B.

64
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.560
So these two terms actually cancel out and this.

65
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.880
So the I's squared becomes minus 1 which also cancels out this minus sign.

66
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.030
So you end up with a squared plus B squared.

67
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.070
So that's actually pretty cool you could multiply a complex number by its conjugate and that is equivalent

68
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.670
to taking the real part squared and adding the imaginary part squared and basically ignoring the imaginary

69
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.970
number.

70
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:05.560
So a squared plus b squared so what I'm going to do here is show you multiplication between two complex

71
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.010
numbers.

72
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.430
Let's say Z 1 is known pi complex.

73
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.730
How about four and five and then let's make Z too complex.

74
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.650
No.

75
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.850
And how about 6 and.

76
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.030
Minus two.

77
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.750
OK.

78
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.120
So what I'm going to do now is multiply z 1 times Z 2 and I'm going to do this the really slow really

79
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.950
painful really meticulous way by writing out all four of those individual products that I showed in

80
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:36.520
the slides.

81
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.730
So we have.

82
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.930
OK.

83
00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.820
So that one took so long to write out I decided to go back and edit the video to make it go twice as

84
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.120
fast.

85
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.650
So apologies for the chipmunk version of Mike X. Cohen.

86
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.890
All right.

87
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.560
So now let's see what this number is.

88
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.100
So print w.

89
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.140
So this happens to be thirty four plus twenty two J.

90
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:20.560
And now what I want to show you is that that's still the same thing as writing z 1 times Z 2.

91
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.920
Okay.

92
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:28.060
Now given that why would you ever in this universe or any other alternate version of reality write out

93
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.580
all of this code which is highly prone to errors when you could just write out this.

94
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.730
The answer is you would never ever do this.

95
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.300
I'm just doing it once to illustrate to you the concept.

96
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.520
And of course you will never do this again.

97
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.100
Okay.

98
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:50.680
And I just want to show you that we can easily convert this complex number into simply into a simple

99
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.690
object so let's write some that simplify W.

100
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.000
And now notice that simplifies actually using I as the imaginary operator.

101
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.270
So thirty four plus twenty two.

102
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.380
I and of course you could also do this as simple I said one times Z two.

103
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.140
And that gives the same answer.

104
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.540
Okay.

105
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.790
So now let's talk about the complex conjugate.

106
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:22.270
So we already have this complex number here said 1 so I'm going to write and P that carnage that's the

107
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.780
function for the complex conjugate and that is for minus 5 J.

108
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:34.840
Remember this was for 5 J and then just to show you to illustrate that the complex conjugate is not

109
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.200
simply making sure that the imaginary part is negative.

110
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:44.690
I will also display the conjugate of Z 2 and that is now 6 plus to J.

111
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:53.950
Whereas before it was 6 minus 2 J the exercise for this video is to use simplify to show this rule that

112
00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:01.180
I already proved algebraic Lee So z times Z conjugate complex conjugate equals A squared plus b squared

113
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.360
where A is the real part of Z and B is the imaginary part of Z.

114
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:12.010
Now it's actually this seems like it's really simple but it's actually a little bit tricky to get this

115
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:19.780
to display like this in simple simplify and it actually uses a few methods in simple simplify that I

116
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.870
haven't explicitly told you about yet but you should be able to figure out based on what else you learned

117
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.590
in this video anyway.

118
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.700
Now is your time to pause the video and get to work in Python.

119
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.310
Now I am going to switch to Python and show my solution.

120
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:42.490
So let me start by showing you how to create a complex number in Python.

121
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:49.660
Essentially what you do is you say A plus B times the imaginary operator and you'll remember that the

122
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.930
imaginary operator was sim that I introduced this in the previous video.

123
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.840
Now of course I haven't created a and b.

124
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:05.490
So let's say a comma B equals sim that symbols a comma B.

125
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.190
All right.

126
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.690
So that line runs.

127
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:13.200
And now let me print out z so you can see what it looks like and it's well it's not surprising.

128
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.550
It's basically just what I created over here.

129
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.450
Okay.

130
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:22.760
Now I didn't tell you how to compute the conjugate of a complex number in simple.

131
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.220
But I guess you probably started by thinking it should be something like this.

132
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.850
So let's let's try some dot coms.

133
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.840
Z Mm hmm.

134
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.220
And here we get an error.

135
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.140
This is simply has no attribute carnage.

136
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.580
So maybe it's something else.

137
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:45.100
So what I'm going to do is actually put the cursor here at the end of college and then press the tab

138
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.790
key on the keyboard and that auto completes to conjugate.

139
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:54.790
So it turns out that the function in simplify is called conjugate.

140
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.080
Okay.

141
00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.640
So now we get something that doesn't really this is not really exactly what you might expect.

142
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.640
It says the conjugate of a minus i.e. times the conjugate of B.

143
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:13.450
Now what's going on here is that simply doesn't actually know enough information about A and B for all

144
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:19.950
simple knows a could be also a complex number and B could be a complex number.

145
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.380
So simple I just doesn't really know how to conjugate these two variables.

146
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:33.040
So we have to do is explicitly tell simply that we want these to be considered as real numbers not as

147
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.900
complex numbers.

148
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.420
So therefore I'm going to write real equals true.

149
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:46.750
And that forces simplify to consider a and b to be real numbers only so non complex numbers.

150
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.080
Now when I run this again we just get a minus times B.

151
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:51.520
Okay.

152
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.440
So with that in mind what I'm going to do now is start multiplying.

153
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.930
So let's say Z times sim that can't you get Z.

154
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.130
All right.

155
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:10.270
So this looks kind of right except what we want to do is complete all of this multiplication in order

156
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:14.390
to show that this reduces down to A squared plus B squared.

157
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:22.690
And so to do that I'm going to write some thought expand to force simplify to expand this operation

158
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.190
here.

159
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.640
All right.

160
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.260
So this is starting to look good.

161
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:33.190
Now we get that z times the conjugate of Z IS A squared plus B squared.

162
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.500
So the only thing I would like to do now is just to print this out with latex code just to make it look

163
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.390
a little bit nicer.

164
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:50.800
So let's write display math and then I'm going to say said Times said and then I want this to be with

165
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.920
an asterisk in the superscript.

166
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.650
So I will say carat star equals percent.

167
00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.750
Yes.

168
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.850
And then I substitute.

169
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.420
Percent S for this thing.

170
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.860
Except it's not exactly this thing we need this to be converted into latex code.

171
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.390
So Sim dot latex.

172
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.060
All right.

173
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:18.130
Now I think this might crash because I don't believe that I've imported the display in math functions

174
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.300
yet.

175
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:24.510
Okay so I just have to go up here quickly and write from I python.

176
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.910
Display import import display comma math.

177
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.520
All right.

178
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.910
Now I think this is going to work.

179
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:33.550
All right.

180
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:41.900
So that's pretty cool we see z times said conjugate equals a squared plus B squared.

181
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.310
So in this video you learned a little bit more about working with complex numbers in particular multiplication

182
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.900
and the complex conjugate.

183
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:56.800
And this pretty interesting phenomenon that happens when you multiply a complex number by its complex

184
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.120
conjugate.

185
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.360
Now that may seem like a kind of weird academic thing but actually multiplying a number by its complex

186
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.290
conjugate is quite important in many areas of engineering and signal processing for example in the 48

187
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.880
transform.

188
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:17.320
So there's quite some useful applications of the complex conjugate.

189
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.410
Now what could possibly be better than multiplying complex numbers.

190
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.150
You guessed it it's dividing complex numbers.

191
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.350
And that comes up in the next video.

192
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.610
So stay tuned.
