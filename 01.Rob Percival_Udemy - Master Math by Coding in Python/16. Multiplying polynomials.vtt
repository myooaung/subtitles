00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:10.610
In this video we are continuing on our exploration of polynomials and working with polynomials in python.
1

2
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.820
In particular, here I'm going to focus on multiplying polynomials.
2

3
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.220
Now before I tell you how to multiply polynomials I want to give you a quick reminder of the law of
3

4
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.970
exponents.
4

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.850
This is something that I covered in a previous video, in a previous section actually.
5

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.280
So the idea is that if you have multiple variables that are multiplying each other and that have exponents
6

7
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.020
you can add the exponents as long as the base is the same.
7

8
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.150
So this is X to the A and X to the B and that equals x the A plus B.
8

9
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.100
However, the Y and the X cannot be combined here Because Y is a different base from X.
9

10
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.240
So with that as a quick reminder of the law of exponents, multiplying polynomials is actually pretty
10

11
00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.820
straightforward.
11

12
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.880
So if have one polynomial here and this is a second polynomial.
12

13
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.390
Then the product between these two polynomials is this.
13

14
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.020
It's pretty long but it's not really difficult to compute.
14

15
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.480
Essentially what you have to do is expand all of the multiplications.
15

16
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.030
So this term X to the five, times this term gives you x to the six, and then you have this term times
16

17
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.080
this term.
17

18
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.270
Now the X is the same here.
18

19
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.120
So we get X to the six and then of course the minus three and the Y. And then you keep going through
19

20
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.740
this procedure methodically.
20

21
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.800
It takes a little while but eventually you will get to the final answer.
21

22
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.330
And then if you have any like terms then you can combine them.
22

23
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.630
But in this case there are no common terms that are combinable.
23

24
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.980
For example, if this were X times Y to the two, if this were y squared, then these two terms could be combined.
24

25
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.220
However it's not possible to combine them because this is y squared and this is y cubed.
25

26
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.420
Of course if these were multiplying each other you could combine them.
26

27
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.440
But these are being subtracted. So once you know how to create polynomials and you know how to add them
27

28
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.110
and subtract them from the previous video, multiplying polynomials isn't really too much different.
28

29
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.280
So let's start by importing the sympy module as well as the display and math functions for nice
29

30
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.070
printing.
30

31
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.580
So let's start by creating a symbolic variable, so I'll say sym dot symbols X. And then just to show you the law
31

32
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.710
of exponents again.
32

33
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:41.390
So here I have X to the fifth power times X to the let's say x to the third and now the result here
33

34
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.050
is going to be X to the eighth power, because these two terms are multiplying each other and
34

35
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.210
their bases are the same.
35

36
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.740
Of course if we were to add them then we just get the same thing.
36

37
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.770
Basically we get X to the fifth plus X of the third.
37

38
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.930
It's not possible in this case to reduce this expression any further.
38

39
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.140
Okay.
39

40
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.120
So this was a pretty simple multiplication between two polynomials.
40

41
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.180
Let's try something slightly more complicated, so I'll say P1 for polynomial 1.
41

42
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.310
Let's set that to be four times X squared minus two times x.
42

43
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.210
And then let's set polynomial two to be.
43

44
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.930
How about X cubed minus one.
44

45
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.490
So now I can write P1 times P3 -- oops! P2.
45

46
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.500
Now in this case sympy didn't actually write out all the expansion; it just left it exactly how I
46

47
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.860
wrote it.
47

48
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.690
So this polynomial times this polynomial. If you want this to be expanded you can use the sympy function
48

49
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.660
expand.
49

50
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.700
So sympy dot expand and that will actually multiply out all the terms and we can have a quick look
50

51
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.210
to make sure that this is all going as we expected it to.
51

52
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.410
So you have this term times this term and that's going to be four times x to the fifth power because
52

53
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.450
you have X squared and X cubed here.
53

54
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.490
So that's this term over here.
54

55
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.850
All right.
55

56
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.050
So now I think this looks kind of ugly.
56

57
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.690
So what I'm going to do is expand this out using LaTeX formatting.
57

58
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:30.490
So let's say I want display and then math and then sympy latex and then the expand function.
58

59
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.760
All right.
59

60
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.420
So this looks pretty good.
60

61
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.350
And then just out of curiosity I'm going to get rid of this expand.
61

62
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.130
So now these two lines are almost exactly the same except here I'm explicitly expanding the multiplication.
62

63
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.000
And here I just have the multiplication in here like this.
63

64
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.510
And here you see the difference in the output between just multiplying the polynomials versus putting
64

65
00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.540
the product of the polynomials through this expand function.
65

66
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.640
The exercise for this video is to implement these two polynomials here.
66

67
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.440
So I'm calling it f of x and y and G of X and Y.
67

68
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.370
These are just two functions of x and of Y.
68

69
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.720
So implement these two polynomials and then what you want to do is first multiply the polynomials together.
69

70
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.850
So like I showed in the previous slide before switching to Python code.
70

71
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:37.250
So multiply these two polynomials and then in the product, substitute X for five and y for minus two
71

72
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.370
and you'll get some answer.
72

73
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.840
It's going to be some number.
73

74
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.320
And then what you want to do is substitute the same numbers.
74

75
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.320
So X equals five AND Y equals minus two.
75

76
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.290
But now you're substituting into each polynomial individually and then you multiply those two numbers
76

77
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.120
so this.
77

78
00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.270
So you substitute these two numbers for these two variables into f of x and y.
78

79
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.570
That's going to give you... whatever number it is.
79

80
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.520
And then you substitute these numbers into G of X and Y and then we'll give you some other number and
80

81
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.020
then you multiply those two results. And then the goal is to test whether those two numbers are the same.
81

82
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.080
So whether it matters whether you multiply and then substitute or substitute and then multiply.
82

83
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.440
All right.
83

84
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.580
So good luck.
84

85
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.540
I hope you have fun working through this exercise.
85

86
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.210
And now I'm going to switch to Python and show you how I solve this. All right so let's see.
86

87
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.030
So the first thing I'm going to do is we need to create another symbolic variable for Y.
87

88
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.540
Let's say X comma Y equals in that symbols X and Y.
88

89
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:52.100
And now what I'm gonna do is create these two polynomials using these symbolic variables.
89

90
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.230
So F of X and Y was four times x to the fourth power.
90

91
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.540
I'm rearranging some of the terms a little bit here just to get the terms with the highest order the
91

92
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.780
highest degree to be on the left.
92

93
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:21.780
So then we had nine times Y cubed minus three times X squared plus X times Y squared.
93

94
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.260
All right.
94

95
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:31.650
And then we had G of X and Y and that was point eight times y cubed.
95

96
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:41.700
And again I'm rewriting these terms slightly and then we had X cubed and then plus six times X squared
96

97
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.760
times y.
97

98
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.220
Okay.
98

99
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.030
And again if you are uncertain about whether this is X squared,
99

100
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:57.630
so whether this is X squared times Y, or whether python is going to implement X to the power of two times
100

101
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:07.380
Y, then you have to remember the PEMDAS, so please excuse my dear and Sally: parentheses exponent multiplication
101

102
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.570
division addition and subtraction.
102

103
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.500
Okay.
103

104
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:17.930
So if we leave out the parentheses then the exponent takes priority over the multiplication.
104

105
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.850
So this is going to give us the right answer.
105

106
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.580
Okay.
106

107
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:31.200
Now out of curiosity I would like to print these, so let's say display math and now I'm going to write
107

108
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:31.990
percent
108

109
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:38.310
s times the second very polynomial.
109

110
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.720
So this one's going to be four G of X equals.
110

111
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.860
And then whatever this happens to equal.
111

112
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.360
All right.
112

113
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.120
So we need sym
113

114
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.840
dot latex f of x and y.
114

115
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:58.510
And then we need sym dot latex G of X and Y.
115

116
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:07.870
And then we need sym dot latex and then sym dot expand F of X and Y times.
116

117
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.880
G of X and Y.
117

118
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.600
OOOOFF!!!
118

119
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.650
What a long long long polynomial this is!
119

120
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.400
Wow, that's really long.
120

121
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.110
All right so now let's get to the main part of the assignment.
121

122
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.050
So we want to substitute xval
122

123
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.780
was 5 and the y value was minus 2.
123

124
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:36.650
So the first thing that I'm going to do is multiply the polynomials and then substitute for x and y.
124

125
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.220
So let's call this F G equals.
125

126
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:48.470
Now I could create a separate variable and say F X Y times g x y and then in a different line I could
126

127
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.180
say the answer is f g that subs and so on.
127

128
00:09:53.180 --> 00:10:00.320
But actually, it's a little bit easier than this and that is because I can actually put these two -- the
128

129
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:07.820
product of these two polynomials -- inside parentheses and then create this or treat this as a single sympy
129

130
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:14.990
object and then dot subs and now here you'll remember that this can be entered as a dictionary.
130

131
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:24.320
So the x gets replaced with XVal, and the Y is replaced as yval.
131

132
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.400
So let me first run this and make sure that this works.
132

133
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.740
Okay so we get some answer and I think I'll even print this out right away.
133

134
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:37.180
So let's say print multiplied solutions is and then
134

135
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.560
percent G.
135

136
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.990
And then here we have percent f g.
136

137
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.780
Okay so this is the answer here.
137

138
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:50.740
And actually I will change this to a string so it formats using a nicer looking number.
138

139
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:57.850
By the way, if you are confused about how to interpret this thing -- so minus 1 and then there's the E plus
139

140
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.540
0 6.
140

141
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.380
This has to do with orders of magnitude and scientific notation.
141

142
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.570
I'm going to have a whole video (maybe even two videos) about that in a later section of the course, in
142

143
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.570
algebra 2.
143

144
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.840
So you don't really need to worry about this too much.
144

145
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:17.710
now. Essentially this is just pushing the decimal point six places over to the left.
145

146
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.080
Okay.
146

147
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.900
So anyway for now I will leave this as s, so it prints out as a full number.
147

148
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.880
So that was the first step.
148

149
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:34.120
Then what we need to do is substitute for x and y in each function separately so let's call that f x
149

150
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.040
y and maybe ans, equals f x y
150

151
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.070
subs, and actually this is exactly the same substitution.
151

152
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.290
I'm just going to copy and paste here and then.
152

153
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:55.920
In fact I will copy and paste this entire line, being really careful to change the F's for G's.
153

154
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.910
And then I will print this out.
154

155
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:13.480
Let's say print separate solutions comes to percent s and then we say F X Y and times g x g x y ans.
155

156
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:19.270
So that's pretty interesting: we get exactly the same results whether we multiply the polynomials and
156

157
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:24.280
then substitute or first substitute and then multiply the answers.
157

158
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:30.700
Now the reason why this is the case is that these are linear operations -- we've just been doing all linear
158

159
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.640
operations here: multiplications and additions.
159

160
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:39.220
And in general, when you are performing linear operations the order of operations tends not to matter.
160

161
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:45.920
And when you're doing non-linear operations, nonlinear computations, then the order actually does matter.
161

162
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:52.590
So in this video I showed you more about polynomials and working with polynomials in Python and sympy.
162

163
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.750
And in particular I focused on multiplying.
163

164
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:02.140
Of course the inverse of multiplying is division, and I will show you in the next video how to divide
164

165
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.020
polynomials. I look forward to seeing you then.
