1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,330
In this video I'm going to discuss the natural exponent and the logarithm.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,090
I'll show you a little bit about what these functions look like and then in the exercise you will get

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,150
to use python as a tool to help you visualize the fact that these two functions and natural exponent

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,440
and the logarithm are in verses of each other.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,600
So the natural exponent or e to the X and the natural logarithm or the log of x are nonlinear functions

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,510
that have this kind of curved shape like this.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:45,720
So if we look at the function Y equals E to the X then for various ranges of X E to the X gets arbitrarily

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,580
close to zero.

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,000
So it never gets to be zero but it becomes really really really close to zero as X goes to minus infinity

10
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,150
and then up here y.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,440
So the function each of the X goes up to plus infinity as x gets larger.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,820
So that's the function e to the X.

13
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:10,170
And now if we look at the log of x of the natural logarithm of x you can see it also as kind of a similar

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,280
shape in the sense that it's bent and it looks like it's going to infinity in both directions.

15
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,450
However in this case the log of x goes down to minus infinity on the y axis.

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,070
You can see these numbers are getting smaller as X goes towards zero and now the log of x is not defined

17
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,130
for any negative numbers.

18
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,730
So if you would try to take the log of a negative number you would end up getting a complex number.

19
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:44,280
And that's why on this graph here you only see positive values of x and going up this way.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,920
The logarithm basically continues to grow up to infinity here as x gets arbitrarily large.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,060
However it grows to infinity slower and slower and slower unlike either the X which grows to infinity

22
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,090
faster and faster.

23
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not going to demonstrate to you these two functions in Python so we're going to use the NUM pi module

24
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,650
and the map plot lib dot pi plot module.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:17,640
So I'm going to start by creating a variable X and let's set that to be linearly spaced numbers go from

26
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,580
minus three to plus three.

27
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,880
In How about a high.

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,660
Actually no.

29
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,650
Hundred is too much of a nice round number.

30
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,280
Let's go for ninety nine steps between minus three and plus three.

31
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:39,810
So now I'm going to generate a plot of X by e to the X which is N.P. num pi dot X and then X in parentheses.

32
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,340
So in the mathematical formula you have e to the power of x.

33
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:52,230
And here in Python this syntax would be exp and then in parentheses is whatever would go into the exponent.

34
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,530
All right.

35
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,060
So let's see what this looks like.

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,580
All right.

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,730
So this is the function each of the X and it's essentially just what I showed in the slides.

38
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,340
So I'm just gonna attach a Y axis and an x axis labels so plot the X label.

39
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,720
This was facts and then plot that y label.

40
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,990
Now I could write e to the peoples e to the power of x like this.

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,700
However this doesn't really look so great.

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,130
What I would like to do is convert this to latex to get the x into the exponent of E and so to do that

43
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,170
you will recall that inside just a bit of string in here for graph labels you can use a dollar sign

44
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,820
on either side.

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,290
So that converts to later code but the latex code for getting exponents or suit prescription is not

46
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,570
a double asterisk.

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,860
Instead it is the carat symbol like this.

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,900
Okay so now we get e to the x all right.

49
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,420
So that looks pretty good.

50
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,940
Now what I'm gonna do is plot the natural log of x.

51
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,820
Now I could plot this in a separate cell a separate cell of code however I want to show you that you

52
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:09,010
can use the same cell of code and generate a different graph so get a different axis.

53
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,910
As long as you have the dots show in here to display this plot.

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,800
Okay.

55
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,420
So in fact what I'm gonna do is copy and paste.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,430
And now this is going to be n p dot log of x.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,180
And of course this has to be the log.

58
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,920
And for this we don't really need latex code I'll just write log of x like this.

59
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:38,190
Okay so now notice we get two separate plots so this one corresponds to either the X and this lower

60
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,410
one corresponds to the log of x.

61
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,870
Now we're also getting a warning notice.

62
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,610
This is not an error message.

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,250
This is just a warning.

64
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,920
And remember that error messages are things that you urgently need to deal with.

65
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,500
There is something wrong with your code.

66
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,330
If you get an error message if you get a warning message it doesn't necessarily mean there's anything

67
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:57,990
wrong.

68
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,890
Python is just saying hey you better check this out because your code could be different from what you

69
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,460
expect.

70
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,260
So here are these two warning messages are related to negative values of x and also zero values of x

71
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,290
in the log function.

72
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,700
Now I already know that the log of x is not defined in the real numbers for zero or negative numbers.

73
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,380
So therefore I'm just going to ignore this warning.

74
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,950
I think it's fine.

75
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,410
Okay.

76
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,450
And then the last thing is just to drive home this point about generating two different plots in the

77
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,100
same cell.

78
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:42,110
If I were to comment out this line plot that show then we would actually see both of these lines plotted

79
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,280
on the same graph.

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Now of course this can also be useful if you want to see them on the same graph.

81
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,180
But this shows the importance of this plot that show function.

82
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,260
Now it turns out that e to the X and the log of x are inverse functions of each other.

83
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,540
And that means that if you would embed one function into the other function you basically did the two

84
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,510
functions will cancel each other out.

85
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,920
So for example if you would say e to the X where you're replacing X with the log of x.

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,500
So in other words eat the log of x then that ends up just being equal to x.

87
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,110
And that's really the main point of this exercise here.

88
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,900
What you want to do is generate two data series two time series.

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,490
Here I call them Y 1 and Y 2.

90
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:37,430
And you said why one to be equal to the log of each of the x and y 2 to be equal to E 2 the log of x.

91
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:45,890
Notice here the entire logarithm is in the exponent and you can use X ranging from point 0 0 0 1.

92
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,890
So basically just a little bit above zero going up to 10 and then you want to generate a plot that looks

93
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,640
like this.

94
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:59,280
And the reason why you see a straight line here is that you're plotting X by Y 1 or y two.

95
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,490
But as I just mentioned the log and the natural exponent cancel each other out.

96
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,240
So these two cancel out.

97
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,970
So in fact y one equals x and y two equals x.

98
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,610
So really you're just plotting X by X here.

99
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:13,910
All right.

100
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:20,730
So now is your opportunity to pause the video switch to Python and write some code to produce this graph.

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,180
And now I will switch to Python and show you how I would go about solving this.

102
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,810
All right.

103
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,310
So let's start by creating our variable X so that's known pi.

104
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,980
Lynn space point 0 0 0 1 10.

105
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:43,520
And I didn't actually tell you how many increments to go between point 0 0 1 and 10 but let's just say

106
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,820
10.

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:54,590
Okay so now I'm going to write why 1 equals num Pi the log of num pi exp x.

108
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:02,930
So this is now the natural logarithm of E to the X and we want y to to be essentially just the opposite.

109
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:09,910
So number pi that he XP and then inside here we get none paid out log of x.

110
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:17,870
Now notice again how I'm using spaces here none of these spaces are necessary but I think having spaces

111
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,340
inside these functions helps the reader.

112
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,620
It will help you and other people who might be reading your code in the future understand that this

113
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,770
is one function embedded inside another function.

114
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,870
Okay.

115
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,220
So that's for y one and Y two.

116
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:44,420
And now we just need to make a plot so P L teed up plot x by y 1 and let's make this one a blue line

117
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,950
and I'll give this the label of log of E to the X..

118
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,530
Now I want this to be latex code and actually you know let me get back to this I want to make sure that

119
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:03,200
we get a nice looking plot first and then we can come back and worry about some of the finer details

120
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,020
here.

121
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,390
Okay.

122
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,870
So then the second one was basically the same so why are X come up Y two.

123
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:17,900
And this one was orange dots so I'll just leave that as a circle and the label here is going to be e

124
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:25,550
to the log of x and again I'm going to worry in a few moments about making this look a bit nicer.

125
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:25,850
Okay.

126
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,840
So BLT that show.

127
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,360
And this looks good although actually the colors are different from what I showed in the slides.

128
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,910
I mean just get rid of the blue.

129
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,670
Okay so now the colors look good of course we don't see the legend here and you already know why and

130
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,570
that is the answer is that we have to activate the legend like this.

131
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,140
All right.

132
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,910
So this is basically finished.

133
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,590
Maybe I'll make this access Square actually that should look a little bit nicer appeal to you that access

134
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,220
square.

135
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,090
Okay now the last thing I want to do is just touch this up a little bit so that the legends look a little

136
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:10,090
bit nicer so let's make this latex code like this so therefore we get X in the superscript of E.

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:19,610
So that looks good except now the log is in italics so we can actually write slash slash here and that's

138
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,610
going to activate the latex version of log which is actually just going to make this b normal upright

139
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,690
text.

140
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,860
Okay so then here let's see if this is working.

141
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:31,950
Mm hmm.

142
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,550
This actually looks like it says the dog and you can see there's a tiny little sliver of a lineup here.

143
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,780
This is actually the L up here.

144
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:47,730
So what we need to do is tell latex that all of this text should go into the superscript not just the

145
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,100
first letter after the carat symbol.

146
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,150
And so to do that we use curly brackets as you will remember and then I'm also going to put slash slash

147
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,530
here for the log.

148
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,180
All right so that looks pretty good.

149
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,540
I think so in this video you learned about the natural exponent and the logarithm and plotting them

150
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,810
in Python.

151
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,730
And importantly you learned how to use python as a tool to show that two functions in this case the

152
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,080
natural exponent and the natural logarithm are inverse of each other.

153
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,120
So when you in bed one into the other they end up canceling each other out.
