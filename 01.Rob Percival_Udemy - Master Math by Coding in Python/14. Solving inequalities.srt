1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:09,140
In the beginning of this section of the course you learned how to solve for variables in an equation
1

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,430
using sympy.
2

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,960
So for example if you say like two x equals three then you can solve for x.
3

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:23,140
What you're going to learn in this video is an extension of solving using the same function in this
4

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,360
sympy toolbox so sym dot solve.
5

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,440
But now you are going to learn inequalities instead of equalities.
6

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,940
And I'm also going to show you how to indicate infinity in sympy.
7

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,670
So let's get started.
8

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,320
An inequality is an expression that looks something like this: four x is greater than eight.
9

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,830
And so the question is what range of x will make this expression true?
10

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,270
Now the answer here is fairly easy to compute.
11

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,790
All you have to do is isolate X on the left hand side of this equation, and you can do that by dividing
12

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,840
both sides of this equation by 4.
13

14
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,850
So that gives you x is greater than 2.
14

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,290
So as long as X is greater than 2 this expression will be correct.
15

16
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,840
Now we get to an expression like this, and your first thought when you see something like this might
16

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,370
be to expand this multiplication and get X squared plus two X minus three greater than zero.
17

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,410
Now that's not really the wrong way to do it but that's not super helpful.
18

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,700
In fact, it turns out the answer is that there are two ranges of X that will satisfy this equation and
19

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,430
the way to think about that is that you have a multiplication of two terms.
20

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,390
And basically you want the multiplication of these two terms to result in a positive number, so greater
21

22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,950
than zero.
22

23
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:52,460
Now two terms multiplied together will be positive either when both those terms are positive or when
23

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,670
both of those terms are negative.
24

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,420
So as long as one term is not negative and the other one is positive then this will be the case then
25

26
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,880
this will be true.
26

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,570
So we can think about this term, if this term,
27

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,430
so if X is greater than one, this will always be positive.
28

29
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,290
And this of course will be positive.
29

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,300
So that's one of the conditions.
30

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:22,790
The other condition is that if this term is negative and this term can be negative if X is smaller than
31

32
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,490
minus 3, to cancel out this plus 3, then of course this term will be negative as well.
32

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,290
And then both of these terms are negative leading us to a positive value, which will definitely be greater
33

34
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,660
than zero.
34

35
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,950
So that's the two answers to this solution.
35

36
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,060
Now what I'm going to do is show you how to implement these in a python so that once you've finished
36

37
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,250
thinking about this problem and working through the answer in your head you can then switch to Python
37

38
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,150
and confirm that you have thought of the correct answer.
38

39
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:03,380
So for this video we are going to need these sympy toolbox and say import sympy as sym, and we are
39

40
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,580
also going to need the nice display functions that I always use in almost every video.
40

41
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,480
So import display and math okay.
41

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,090
And now we need a symbolic variable let's go for X because X is a great letter.
42

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,420
It's possibly one of the greatest letters ever invented.
43

44
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,300
I happen to be partial to the letter X..
44

45
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,830
So anyway let's define this expression.
45

46
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,560
So  four times x is greater than eight.
46

47
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,320
This was the first expression that we started off with.
47

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:46,310
Now first, I haven't yet showed you that it's even valid to put a greater than or less than sign in an
48

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,640
expression, in a sympy expression.
49

50
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:55,070
So first thing that I do is run this code and then print out this expression just to make sure that
50

51
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,700
this is really a valid operation, which it is.
51

52
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,940
And so to get the solution to this we type sym dot solve just like you did before when you were solving
52

53
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,510
for x for example.
53

54
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:14,860
But now we just write the equation in here, or the inequality, and that's going to give us this answer.
54

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,680
Now in the slides I only actually showed you this part.
55

56
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,950
I said as long as X is greater than 2, it might look initially a little confusing, because here it says 2
56

57
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,260
is less than X but that's the same thing as X is greater than 2.
57

58
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,300
This is what I showed on the slides.
58

59
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,060
Now here this is actually giving us an end just ampersand is for and.
59

60
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,780
So Python, sympy, is actually telling us that there are two conditions.
60

61
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,970
So X is greater than two.
61

62
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,600
And also X is less than what is this thing??
62

63
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,990
This is like oo-oo or just ooh!? Actually this is the way that Python represents infinity.
63

64
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:00,300
It is a double lowercase o so X must be greater than 2 and X must be less than infinity
64

65
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,250
for this expression to be true. So it might seem a little bit strange that we also get this result less
65

66
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,110
than infinity.
66

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,260
But that's just how sympy gives the output.
67

68
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,520
Okay.
68

69
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,760
So now I can make this look slightly nicer.
69

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,320
I think this already looks pretty decent but I'm going to in case this into latex code so sym dot
70

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,910
latex and then the output of solve and here we get basically the same thing except it looks a little
71

72
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,880
bit nicer. Now this symbol here is called a wedge symbol and, let me write that out.
72

73
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,640
So it's called wedge.
73

74
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,570
And in fact the latex code for that would be wedge like this.
74

75
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,710
And in this case the wedge operator is used to indicate a conjunction.
75

76
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,560
So X must be greater than 2 and X must be less than infinity.
76

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:59,110
So to access the infinity or to represent infinity using symp, you type sympy dot 0 0. So the output
77

78
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,540
is 0 0 and we can see you know is infinity greater then.
78

79
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:03,910
I don't know.
79

80
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,410
Some really large number.
80

81
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,780
The answer is true.
81

82
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,220
And you know we can make that number bigger.
82

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
The answer of course is true.
83

84
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,300
Because infinity is larger than any number.
84

85
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,680
Okay.
85

86
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:22,060
Now I'd like to show you the other expression that I showed in these slides, So that was X minus one
86

87
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,070
times x plus three.
87

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,530
And then this was greater than zero.
88

89
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,590
And here we can see, let me get rid of this....
89

90
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,380
And so here we get part of the same answer that I showed before.
90

91
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,010
So X is less than minus three or x is greater than one.
91

92
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:49,570
And then you also see that there are these conductive operators for x is greater than minus infinity
92

93
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,990
and x is less than infinity.
93

94
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,920
But mostly you know you can just kind of try to ignore these things and focus on the answers that involve
94

95
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,670
real numbers.
95

96
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:05,150
So X is less than minus three or x is greater than minus one.
96

97
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,440
All right.
97

98
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,910
There's some one more thing that I want to show you in this video which is what happens if you don't
98

99
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,050
provide enough information for the sympy solver to do its job.
99

100
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,760
So let's see.
100

101
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:26,350
I'm going to create new variables A B and C so symbols symbols A B C.
101

102
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:36,680
Now let's make our expression B A times X must be greater than B squared divided by C.
102

103
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,470
So first thing I like to do when I see a mathematical equation that looks like this or an inequality
103

104
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:50,400
that looks like this I like to see it written out in latex just so I can interpret it better.
104

105
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:58,500
So X is greater than B squared divided by C and now if we just try to solve it let's say sym dot solve.
105

106
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,850
Now maybe, you know that you want to solve this in terms of x because perhaps you are thinking that X
106

107
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:12,930
is like the unknown variable and ABC are just these sort of arbitrary scales that represent any numbers.
107

108
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:20,140
However, python is going to give a really long warning here and the warning message says well it's a
108

109
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,410
non implemented error and it says the inequality has more than one symbol of interest.
109

110
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay so you're probably thinking that the solution is really straightforward and that is simply to say
110

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,710
comma x.
111

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,660
Now in some sense that is true.
112

113
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:41,810
We can say comma X and that's telling Python that the variable in this expression that we want to solve
113

114
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,730
for is x.
114

115
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:50,600
However, in this case that didn't actually do anything but return the exact same equation that we started
115

116
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,270
with.
116

117
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,440
And the issue here is that sympy,
117

118
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,080
it just doesn't have enough information to be able to solve for any particular variable.
118

119
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:05,750
There are no constraints on, A for example, and that's because as you can see up here, the solution to
119

120
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,440
inequalities will depend on what these other numbers are.
120

121
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,790
So if I would just write this you know
121

122
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:19,730
so this answer here, x is less than one, that depends on knowing the sign of this number here minus one.
122

123
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,990
So if I would replace this with a and b then sympy simply doesn't know enough about the constraints
123

124
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,610
on these variables A and B in order to come up with a specific enough example. And in fact if I try to
124

125
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,810
run this, I'm pretty sure we're gonna get an error, we get an error and oh okay.
125

126
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,000
So that's actually the same error.
126

127
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:48,650
But now even if I tell sympy that I am interested in X, it's still not able to come up with a solution
127

128
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,170
and that's really because we haven't provided enough information; we haven't provided enough constraints
128

129
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:01,610
and that is generally the case with sympy: if ever you encounter a situation with sympy, where
129

130
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:09,050
the output of some function like solve or some other function is literally just re typing the input
130

131
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,490
expression, then that generally means that sympy doesn't have enough information.
131

132
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:22,180
It's not possible to come up with a solution. So here is the exercise for this video.
132

133
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:29,020
Essentially, you have this long inequality here with multiple terms on both sides of the equation and
133

134
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,640
X also on both sides of the equation.
134

135
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:39,070
And what you want to do is implement this expression in sympy, and then use the solve function to
135

136
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:47,530
find the bounds on X, or the inequality on X, that would satisfy this expression.
136

137
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,450
So here I am in Python.
137

138
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,390
I'm going to work through my solution.
138

139
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,070
If you haven't already paused the video, obviously
139

140
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,900
Now is your last moment to do it.
140

141
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,970
Now it turns out that actually this exercise is not so difficult.
141

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,220
It's mostly just keeping track of all the variables, making sure that you are typing it in correctly.
142

143
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:13,760
So this was four minus five times x divided by three is less than... now,
143

144
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,320
I haven't told you in this particular video How to Solve for an inequality that involves less than or
144

145
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,320
equal to or greater than or equal to.
145

146
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,680
But I think you've probably figured it out.
146

147
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,110
All you have to do is attach an equal sign to it.
147

148
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,280
So this side was two minus.
148

149
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:42,010
And then we had in the numerator that was five times two minus X and then divided by four and actually
149

150
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,940
I think these outer parentheses are not necessary.
150

151
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,570
Okay let's see.
151

152
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,680
So I run this code don't get any errors so I haven't made any typographical mistakes.
152

153
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:58,060
And so out of curiosity, before moving to the solution, I want to display what this equation looks like
153

154
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,690
in nice latex formatting.
154

155
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,260
OK so here we get three --
155

156
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,560
Huh... look at this: Already we see some differences between what I wrote down here and what sympy actually
156

157
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,970
printed out.
157

158
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,550
So that's pretty interesting.
158

159
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:21,580
What I encourage you to do is pause the video, or maybe do this after the video ends and get out a piece
159

160
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,960
of paper and a pencil and work through this side of the equation and make sure that you see how this
160

161
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,360
expression can be converted into this expression.
161

162
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,860
And likewise for this side of the equation and this expression.
162

163
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,140
All right.
163

164
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:44,030
That said now we can compute the solutions so sym dot solve X.
164

165
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:51,460
Now in theory you could also say comma X, however because X is the only symbolic variable in this expression
165

166
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,820
you don't actually need the second input
166

167
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,030
in this case.
167

168
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:02,770
So it turns out even though it's a pretty complicated looking inequality, the solution is fairly straightforward.
168

169
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:10,270
It's basically just that x is greater than or equal to twenty two divided by seven and out of curiosity.
169

170
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,370
I wonder what.
170

171
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,410
Twenty two divided by 17.
171

172
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,930
Sorry I said seven up here.
172

173
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,600
Seventeen.
173

174
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,950
what this number is.
174

175
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:28,770
So as long as X is greater than one point to nine for one then this inequality will remain true. So in
175

176
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,670
this video I showed you how to solve for inequalities.
176

177
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:38,700
And I showed you some potential problems or weird things that can arise when you're trying to use sympy.
177

178
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,370
I also showed you how to represent infinity using sympy.
