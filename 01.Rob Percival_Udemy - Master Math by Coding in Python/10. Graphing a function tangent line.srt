00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,790
In this video I'm going to talk to you about Tangent lines to a function.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,420
I'll introduce you to the idea and the formula for a tangent line.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:19,780
And of course you will get to see this in Python and in the exercise you will get to make a beautiful

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,400
plot.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,300
And don't worry there's going to be purple in the plot.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,820
So then you know that it's going to be good.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,460
So what is the tangent line.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,180
So here is a function.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,590
This happens to be the function x squared.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,870
And now this orange line here is a tangent line to this function.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,190
So what is a tangent line.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,580
Attention line is a straight line that just barely kisses the function at one single point.

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,840
So it touches the function at this one point over here.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,520
So that's a bit of a intuitive and visual definition of a tangent line.

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,190
There is a formal definition of mathematical definition and that looks something like this.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:08,130
So let's say the line T THE TANGENT LINE IS EQUAL TO F prime at A or F prime.

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,890
Of course is the derivative of the function and a sub a here which is the same A is here in here.

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,030
That is simply the point at which you want to compute the tangent line.

19
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,770
So in this particular example a would be looks like it's around 1.

20
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:31,000
So f prime at a so you have to compute the derivative of the function and then evaluate the function

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:40,780
at the point A times the quantity X minus X say an X is actually really just this axis here this x axis

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,840
here an x ray is is this point here.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,540
So that would be one for this example.

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,500
So X minus X A plus the function value at point A.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,330
So what is this function mean.

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,470
I think it helps to understand this function and also to remember this function by comparing it to the

27
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,810
formula for computing a line that I showed you in an earlier section of this course.

28
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,820
So that formula is often expressed Y equals M X plus B.

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,700
This is often called the slope intercept form of a line.

30
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,100
So let's compare these are t is a line Y is the line now f prime at a.

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:29,410
I'm claiming is basically the same thing as M now m we interpret as the slope of the line and that is

32
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,170
exactly the idea of a derivative.

33
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:39,670
The derivative is the slope of a function at an infinitesimal at a you know the tiniest tiniest difference

34
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,280
that you can compute.

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:48,070
So f Prime is the same thing as the slope and then we have the variable x and that's essentially what

36
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,080
we have here.

37
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,750
The only thing is that we are shifting X by X at a and the way to think about this shifting procedure

38
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:03,020
is that this function value this vector value is going to be zero at the point A.

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,320
So really all you're doing is taking this same X and you're just shifting it a little bit so that the

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,940
point that you are interested in will have a value of zero in this expression here.

41
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,410
Okay.

42
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,360
And then these slope times the Axis vector X that you know that can be any number of lines it can make

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,010
an infinite number of lines you need to know how far up the y axis to shift this line here and that

44
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:37,450
is given by f of a or the function value at point A which is gonna be this red dot here and just by

45
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,860
analogy that's the same exact thing as this which is called an intercept.

46
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,860
So here the interpretation of the intercept is what is the value of y when x equals zero.

47
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,030
And that's exactly the same thing here.

48
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,390
X this whole term is zero when x equals x sub a.

49
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,260
So that means that this whole term is zero.

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,990
So this is basically acting as the intercept.

51
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,310
Okay.

52
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:10,480
So I hope that's sensible that helps connect algebra and basic graphing with calculus and tangent lines.

53
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:18,010
What I'd like to do now is switch to Python and basically translate this formula into code and reproduce

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,210
this graph.

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,170
We are going to be using the simple by the.

56
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,390
No that's a mistake.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,250
The gnome pi and map plot lib in this video.

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,120
So let's see.

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:42,070
Let's start by creating a symbolic variable X X that symbols X and then I'm going to define the function

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,280
and it's to give tive.

61
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,020
So let's see the function f is going to be X squared and then the derivative I'll call it variable D

62
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,970
F that's going to be sin.

63
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,950
Def of X okay.

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:06,490
And then I'm going to get the function and derivative value at our requested point which is you know

65
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,970
I call it x sub a.

66
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,350
So in fact we haven't even defined x of a song call this X a equals 1.

67
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,030
So this is the points I think I'll even make a comment here.

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,610
This is the value at which to compute the tangent line.

69
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,550
Okay so then we need the function and derivative value.

70
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,670
So in other words what is the value of f at X A equals 1.

71
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,960
Now obviously we can just compute it just by looking at this.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,420
You know 1 squared equals 1 and the derivative of x squared is 2 x.

73
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,300
So the derivative is gonna be 2.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,290
However obviously we want this code to be able to work for any value that we want to compute the tangent

75
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,460
of.

76
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:59,440
So I'm going to create this new variable called F a set it equal to F2 subs and now I'm gonna sub for

77
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,170
X X A.

78
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,300
And let's just do some sanity checks make sure that that's one which indeed it is.

79
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,810
And then I will get D F at a and I'll set that equal to that's gonna be now.

80
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,170
Def that sub.

81
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:25,960
So again we are now substituting for X the value of X A in the simple I object D F and that corresponds

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,610
to the derivative of the main function x squared.

83
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:30,970
All right.

84
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,720
And let's see what that's equal to 2 as predicted.

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,030
Very nice.

86
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,390
Okay.

87
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:44,500
So to compute the tangent line I actually want to convert these simple objects into num pi functions.

88
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,200
So I've told you how to do that several times already.

89
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm gonna call this f fun fun is for function of course although I hope you are having a lot of fun

90
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,140
while going through this.

91
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:04,720
So that's going to be simple lambda phi X F and then usually the way that I've been showing you previously

92
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,010
how to do this is you would say you know F fun and then X X like this however it turns out that if you

93
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:19,090
don't need to run this function multiple times with different ranges of x you can actually add the input

94
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,360
that you want into the function immediately after writing the function with this syntax.

95
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:32,470
Okay now of course I haven't yet defined X X so let's see X X is going to be known pi Lynn space and

96
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,320
I think somewhere like minus two to plus two in two hundred steps is pretty good.

97
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:46,720
So just to show you what this looks like now instead of fun being a function which it will be if I comment

98
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,600
out this second input.

99
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:56,050
Now this is a lambda fied function but when I include the input into this function immediately after

100
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,380
generating it like this then f fun ends up being the vector and actually we can already see it gets

101
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,820
starts off as being large numbers and then it gets smaller it gets close to zero you can see you know

102
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,880
like this value for example here is nine but then it's times tend to the minus four.

103
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,970
So this is actually extremely close to zero and then the function gets large again.

104
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,360
Okay.

105
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:25,990
So that seems consistent with what I would expect based on the function x squared.

106
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,230
All right.

107
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,490
And then of course I need D F fun.

108
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,930
And that's going to be basically the same.

109
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,190
I'll do copy paste except this is now going to be def okay.

110
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,270
And now for the real fun.

111
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,070
Well I think the real fun comes from the plotting.

112
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,830
So but this is kind of fun.

113
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,230
We're building up to the fun compute the tangent line so let's see.

114
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,780
I will call this tan line not to be confused with the tan line you get when you're laying on the beach

115
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,650
in the summer.

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:05,890
The tangent line now remember from the formula that was the derivative of a so I call that f prime at

117
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,220
a.

118
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,990
In the slides.

119
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:16,690
Times X X minus X a plus the value of the function at point A.

120
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,910
So that's this thing all right.

121
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:25,070
So run all this code just to make sure I haven't made any silly coding errors and I haven't yet.

122
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,310
Who knows what's going to happen in the future.

123
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,770
Let's see.

124
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,750
Now I want to plot something to plot F..

125
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,250
Let's start by plotting the function itself.

126
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:43,360
So f fun and I will give this a label of F of X and let's already see what this looks like.

127
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,400
Just for a bit of sanity checking.

128
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,990
Okay this looks pretty good.

129
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,290
It looks like the function f of or C F equals X squared.

130
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:59,710
Now I'm going to plot the tangent line so that's P L ts and now that's x x is still the x axis vector

131
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:07,430
and then we have tan line and the label here is going to be tangent.

132
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,280
Let's see how this looks all right.

133
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,320
Looking pretty good.

134
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,830
Now I want to plot that red dot on top of the point here where the tangent line intersects and just

135
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,140
kisses the function.

136
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,640
So that is plot that P L T.

137
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,900
So that was point X a an FAA and you have to be mindful here.

138
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,380
This is not DFA so we're not plotting the point at the derivative.

139
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,120
That's actually not the right point.

140
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,500
We want the point at exactly the original function.

141
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,730
All right.

142
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,880
So this looks pretty good.

143
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,880
What I'd like to do now is just spend a moment to make this figure look a little bit better.

144
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:52,060
So the first thing I'm gonna do is set the axis to be square and then set the limits.

145
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,600
And as I've mentioned before it's nice to set the limits because you know this graph here is dominated

146
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,940
by all this parts of the function here which are not terribly interesting.

147
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,750
The interesting part is happening right around here.

148
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,080
So let's say that this should be certainly don't want it to go all the way down to minus five.

149
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,350
Let's try to how about that.

150
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,930
So minus two to plus two on the x axis minus two two plus two on the y axis loops.

151
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,850
And this is called Axis not limits.

152
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,980
I told you I was gonna make a silly typo.

153
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,440
Okay so this is looking good but still I don't think we need all this room down here.

154
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:39,700
Why don't we try setting the lower limit for the y axis to be maybe minus point five.

155
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,920
How about that OK.

156
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,670
This is looking better and I would like to add some dotted lines that go across.

157
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,270
Y equals zero and x equals zero.

158
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:58,590
So we could hard code them but I'm going to read them right off of the axes and partly the main reason

159
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:05,580
why I'm doing that is just to give you a reminder of this aspect or this approach to graphing lines.

160
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,170
So I'm going to get information about the current axis.

161
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,190
That's what GCA stands for.

162
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,280
Get current axis and then I'm going to say plot from this variable x.

163
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,360
I'm going to get the x limit and that's gonna give me the two coordinates for the X limit.

164
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,850
Now of course it's going to be minus two and plus two but it's useful to see how to soft code this year.

165
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,640
And then on the y axis the line is just going to go from zero to zero.

166
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,920
And that's this line here actually as it turns out this line happens to be the tangent line of this

167
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
function at exactly point zero.

168
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,600
So even though this is not by intention this dotted black line is also a tangent line.

169
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,030
Okay.

170
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,410
And then we want a vertical line.

171
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,930
So that's going to be on the x axis.

172
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,750
It goes from zero to zero.

173
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:08,340
And on the y axis it goes from the lower limit of the y axis to the upper limit of the y axis.

174
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,120
All right.

175
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,500
So that gives us this and let's see what else do we need to add here.

176
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,540
Well we certainly need to activate the legend otherwise all this work that I went through to write out

177
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,840
these labels is for nothing.

178
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm going to say that this is looking pretty good.

179
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:32,400
Of course by now you know enough about map plot lib and Pi Thun plotting to be able to add some extra

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,660
things if you like like a Y axis label and x axis label and so on.

181
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,730
But I'm going to call this good for now so that was a pretty fun video.

182
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,980
I told you about the concept the intuition and the formula for computing a tangent line to a function

183
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:57,290
and how to interpret that formula and connect it to the Y equals M X plus b slope intercept form of

184
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:57,920
a line.

185
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:04,600
And what was this about yet another beautiful plot with Python that actually comes from the exercise

186
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,460
in this video.

187
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,220
And that is the next video.

188
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,600
So stay tuned.
