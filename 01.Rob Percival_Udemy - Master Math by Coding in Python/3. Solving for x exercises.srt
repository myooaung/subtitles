00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,220
This video is a continuation of the previous video.
1

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,480
I have three exercises for you to solve here but they are a little bit more involved than some of the
2

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
exercises that you've had in previous videos
3

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,900
in this course. Therefore, to prevent the past video from getting really really long,
4

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,420
I decided to break it up into two. So that means that if you didn't yet go through the previous
5

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,630
video, then it might be a good idea for you to watch the previous video before trying to solve these
6

7
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,490
exercises here.
7

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,310
So here are your three exercises.
8

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:47,940
Implement this equation in Python and simplify. In particular, simplify as much as you can.
9

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,750
That is to say, allow sympify to simplify for you and then solve for q.
10

11
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,870
So that is exercise 1.
11

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,300
Here is exercise 2: You want to now implement this equation in sympy.
12

13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,600
Check out the functions symplify, which I've already introduced you to, and cancel -- the function in the
13

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,280
sympy module called cancel.
14

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,580
I haven't yet introduced you to this but you can read the help text and look at the output to see if
15

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:23,000
that helps you understand the difference in the output of the symplify function and the cancel function.
16

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,780
Finally, we get to the third exercise, which looks like this.
17

18
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,880
There are square roots all over the place.
18

19
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:37,580
Implement this equation in sympy. Simplify this equation, and then you can test by substituting various
19

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,370
numbers for Q. So you can substitute q equals, you know, 10 or minus 15.
20

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,480
Or anything you like. Substitute a couple of different variables or numbers for Q and see what happens.
21

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,910
And if you are a little bit surprised at the result, then what you should do is get out a piece of paper
22

23
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,780
and a pencil, and confirm the algebra on your own.
23

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,630
So basically, try to simplify this expression on your own using paper and pencil.
24

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,200
All right.
25

26
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:14,980
So now is your opportunity to pause the video and work through all three of these exercises. So I'm definitely
26

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,690
going to be using the sympy toolbox, and the display and math functions.
27

28
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,870
I'm already importing those right from the start.
28

29
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,360
Okay so here was the first assignment, so you needed to implement this equation.
29

30
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:40,330
So we need q. I'm going to say sym dot symbols, and then q and let's call this equation eq for equation.
30

31
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:53,890
And that was three times Q plus four divided by Q plus three equals five times q minus one divided by
31

32
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,090
Q minus one.
32

33
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,640
Now if you try to run this code you're going to get an error and the error is related to this equals
33

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,060
sign here.
34

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,870
Now you might remember from the previous video that I mentioned that in Python and in sympy,
35

36
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,470
very often you have to convert an equation into the homogenous form, which basically means setting the
36

37
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,800
entire equation to be equal to zero.
37

38
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,570
And the way to do that is by moving
38

39
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,110
so basically subtracting all the terms in the right hand side and putting them on the left hand side.
39

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,420
And when you do that, you have to be really careful that you are subtracting all of them.
40

41
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,000
So you're setting minus signs on all of them.
41

42
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,370
And I realize now that what this should have been is actually these were all plus signs in the equation
42

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,210
in the slides.
43

44
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,980
I'm sure you noticed that before I did.
44

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,550
And then when you move these three terms to the right hand side of the equation, they all need to get
45

46
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,690
a minus sign.
46

47
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,980
Now you could do it like this.
47

48
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:02,330
You could in case these in parentheses and then leave the plus signs in here, or you can set each individual
48

49
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:08,990
term to be minus. But you have to be mindful because this equation is now incorrect.
49

50
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,570
This is not the equation that I specified in these slides because of this term here.
50

51
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,010
This needs to be minus.
51

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,480
All right.
52

53
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,970
So now we get this equation.
53

54
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:27,730
And now I haven't explicitly set it to zero but that's implicitly assumed by sympy.
54

55
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,610
So let's write out this equation display math sym dot latex eq.
55

56
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:41,490
Now I told you in the slides, in the instructions, that you have to simplify this equation as much as
56

57
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,030
possible.
57

58
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:49,690
It turns out that sympy already does the simplification for you, or at least it does some of these simplifications.
58

59
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,680
Now in this particular case it's not even possible to simplify it further, so you can see the plus three
59

60
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,740
and the minus one got combined into two and so on.
60

61
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,860
Same with the q's. So the three times Q and the minus five Q turned into minus two q.
61

62
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:13,170
So if you want to simplify this further, I showed you using the function sym dot simplify in a previous
62

63
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:21,440
video. But you can also call simplify as a method on the equation object, on this sympy object. So I can
63

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:31,500
write eq dot simplify. And then with parentheses because this is a function, and then run this.
64

65
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:39,340
Now it turns out that in this case it's the same because Python has already done the easy simplifications.
65

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,680
All right.
66

67
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,010
So this is already in its simplified form.
67

68
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,910
And now to solve for q, let's see... I'm also going to write this out here.
68

69
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:57,490
So I'm going to say Q equals and then a plus sign for string concatenation sym latex.
69

70
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,480
Now we don't want to simplify the equation.
70

71
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,690
We want to solve the equation.
71

72
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,100
And actually this needs to be sym dot solve.
72

73
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:14,580
And then the equation and we are solving for Q. So here we get q equals
73

74
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,630
Now this is a list.
74

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,060
You saw this before, with the square brackets here and the comma in between.
75

76
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,400
This is a list in Python, and this is telling us that there are two solutions to this equation.
76

77
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,900
One solution is Q equals one half plus the square root of seven over two.
77

78
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,750
And the other solution is one half minus the square root of seven over two.
78

79
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,650
All right.
79

80
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,920
So that is enough for the first problem.
80

81
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,280
Let's go to the second problem.
81

82
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:57,890
So here the equation was two Q Plus three times Q squared minus five over q minus four divided by Q
82

83
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,530
And then that one was cubed.
83

84
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:06,830
And again you will remember from the video about order of operations, this shorthand for remembering
84

85
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,070
order of operations, it was PEMDAS. so exponents have priority over division.
85

86
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,970
So that means we don't actually need the parentheses here.
86

87
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,800
You can leave them in for visibility if you like, but python will know that it's the Q that gets cubed
87

88
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,620
and not the four over Q that gets cubed.
88

89
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:25,860
All right.
89

90
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,490
So here is the equation.
90

91
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,650
So I just ran this cell by pressing control enter on the keyboard and we didn't get any errors.
91

92
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,740
So that's a good sign.
92

93
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:43,730
Let's start by just displaying this on a display math sim dot latex eq, and now we get this nice
93

94
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,080
looking expression here.
94

95
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,760
So now the instruction for this assignment was to test the function sympify and the function cancel
95

96
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,040
and see what those two look like.
96

97
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,600
So to start off with, I'm going to say latex and then sym dot simplify
97

98
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,350
oops.
98

99
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,320
We get an error.
99

100
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,850
Let's see.
100

101
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,120
Oh.
101

102
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Simplify.
102

103
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,470
T simplify.
103

104
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:13,890
Okay.
104

105
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,990
Now the fact that sym dot simplify gives us the same as the original equation tells us that Python
105

106
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,540
thinks this form is already as simplified as it can get.
106

107
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,000
So there's no like terms that can be combined like what you saw appear with the you know the Plus Three
107

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,570
and the minus one got combined into two.
108

109
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,910
Python has looked at this equation and said well it's basically already simplified.
109

110
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,150
All right.
110

111
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,580
So let's see what would happen if we replace simplify with cancel.
111

112
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,710
Now we get an expression that is actually identical to this expression but it has a slightly different
112

113
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,670
form.
113

114
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:03,010
In fact, what Python has done here is put the entire expression into the numerator and then Q cubed in
114

115
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:10,780
the denominator. You can confirm by dividing each of these terms by Q to the power of three that these
115

116
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,340
two expressions really are the same.
116

117
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,310
For example three times Q to the fifth power divided by three times.
117

118
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,710
Ah sorry.
118

119
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:25,320
Q to the third power is three times Q squared, which is this term that you see over here, and so on.
119

120
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,070
So these two terms actually are the same.
120

121
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:35,640
And now we can put the cursor inside the cancel function and then press shift tab on the keyboard and
121

122
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,040
that's going to open up this little help file.
122

123
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,530
And if you press the plus sign here you'll get sometimes a little bit more detail or sometimes some
123

124
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,840
examples like what you see here.
124

125
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:52,990
Now sometimes these doc strings, as they're called, these explanations of the functions are more helpful,
125

126
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,570
sometimes they're a bit less helpful. If you're still unsure about what a particular function means, you
126

127
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,850
can try looking it up on the Internet.
127

128
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,580
One good thing about Python is that because it has a really large user base all over the world there
128

129
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,970
are people all over the world who are writing on the Internet and stack exchange and on blog posts about
129

130
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,800
explaining functions in python.
130

131
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,050
But essentially, what the cancel function is trying to do is put as many terms as possible together into
131

132
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,340
one single term.
132

133
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:32,140
So this expression here is one two three four separate terms and we were able to combine them into one
133

134
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,920
single term.
134

135
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,110
So this is one term.
135

136
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,240
It's a rational expression.
136

137
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,600
All right.
137

138
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:43,710
So now let's move on to the final exercise. That was number three.
138

139
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,470
So here what we wanted to do was implement this expression in sympy, and then test for a couple of
139

140
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,200
different values of q. So that expression was... let's see, it was a little bit complicated.
140

141
00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:02,730
So it had a big numerator and a big denominator. The numerator was the square root of three.
141

142
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:14,740
So sympy dot square root of three plus sym dot square root of 15 times Q. And then in the denominator
142

143
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:28,410
we had sym dot square root of two plus the square root of 10 times q.
143

144
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,940
All right so a lot of square roots going on in here.
144

145
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,670
So the first thing I want to do is display this expression to make sure that I've implemented it correctly.
145

146
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:47,570
So display math and then sym latex expr.
146

147
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,890
All right.
147

148
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,940
So this looks good.
148

149
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:55,450
You might remember from the equation in the slides that this is what it looked like.
149

150
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,810
The terms were the other way round so I had the like I wrote up here.
150

151
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,570
So the square root of three and the square root of two on the left.
151

152
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,540
But it doesn't matter.
152

153
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,280
That's the same thing.
153

154
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,500
Okay.
154

155
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:13,650
So I'd like to see what happens if we start plugging in different values of q so let's say expr dot
155

156
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,580
subs and I'm going to substitute Q. Let's start with about the number 10.
156

157
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:26,180
So you might be a little bit surprised to see that this answer is still in its symbolic form.
157

158
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,090
So we still have square roots here instead of returning a single number.
158

159
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:38,440
And what's going on here is that sympy is seeing that the square root of three is its own number, that
159

160
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,630
is just the square root of three.
160

161
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:49,100
What we want to do is force simplify to evaluate this expression within some tolerance of accuracy.
161

162
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,420
And so to do that we can add another method or we can call another method after subs which is called
162

163
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:06,330
evalf, and that is going to return a number and this number is basically this expression substituting
163

164
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:14,340
Q for 10 to 15 degrees of precision or however many decimal points this is.
164

165
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,660
Okay.
165

166
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,090
So here we found that when we set Q to be 10 this is the answer.
166

167
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,610
It's about one point two.
167

168
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,050
Let's see what happens if we set Q to be....
168

169
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,180
I don't know how about three.
169

170
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,580
Huh.
170

171
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,740
And it seems like it's the same number.
171

172
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,140
How about if we set Q to be minus eighty three.
172

173
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,180
Hmm.
173

174
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,880
Still the same number.
174

175
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,030
That's really strange! It seems like whatever I set
175

176
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,960
Q to be, I'm still getting this same number.
176

177
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,660
How about if it's like a large number like this.
177

178
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,610
Wow it's still the same number.
178

179
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,500
What is going on here? To understand what is going on here
179

180
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,470
Let's try to simplify this expression.
180

181
00:13:52,470 --> 00:14:03,960
So now I'm going to write out this latex, but first I'm going to simplify, so sym dot simplify.
181

182
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:10,200
Simplify this expression and then print it out and then we get to the funny result that when I simplify this
182

183
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:17,580
expression, the Q's actually completely drop out, and we just get the square root of six divided by two.
183

184
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,160
Now if you disagree and you don't think that that should be the right answer, now is the opportunity
184

185
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:30,060
to get out a piece of paper and a pen or pencil and work through this equation do a little bit of arithmetic
185

186
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,690
and see if you can simplify this down to root 6 over 2.
186

187
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,350
I'm now going to switch back to the slides and show you the answer.
187

188
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:39,660
All right.
188

189
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,630
So if you haven't already paused the video to work through this, then now is your last opportunity to
189

190
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,840
do so.
190

191
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,110
Okay.
191

192
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:54,000
So to work through this problem what you need to see is that the square root of 15 can be simplified
192

193
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,000
to the square root of three times the square root of 5, and square root of ten can be simplified as
193

194
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,750
the square root of two times the square root of 10.
194

195
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,260
So when you rewrite it out like this you see a couple of interesting things popping up.
195

196
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,470
There is the root 3 and root 3 and root 2 and root 2.
196

197
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,540
So there's like terms here and there's also root 5 Q and root 5.
197

198
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,970
Q And these are like terms over here.
198

199
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,100
So now what we can do is group these two sets of terms together.
199

200
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,590
So in the numerator we grouped together, or we pulled out, the square root of three from both of these terms.
200

201
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,290
That gives us square root of three times one plus the square root of five times q.
201

202
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,980
And in the denominator you get the same thing.
202

203
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,220
So that means that these two terms will cancel and we are left with the square root of three divided
203

204
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,140
by the square root of two.
204

205
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:53,040
Now your math teachers and the people who write your math textbooks and the people who wrote sympy
205

206
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:01,880
believe that it is somehow ugly or wrong or just plain weird to have radical signs in the denominator.
206

207
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,350
Now why that is the case
207

208
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,850
I honestly have no idea.
208

209
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,910
I don't see anything wrong with having square roots in the denominator.
209

210
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,600
Nonetheless, many people don't like it, so it's common practice in mathematics to try to get rid of the
210

211
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,730
square root in the denominator.
211

212
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,720
And in this case you can do that by multiplying both sides,
212

213
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,510
so the top and the bottom of this fraction, by the square root of two.
213

214
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,260
And that gives you square root of two times the square root of 2 in the denominator, which of course
214

215
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,140
is just 2, and the top is the square root of three times the square root of 2, which is the square root
215

216
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,960
of 6.
216

217
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,400
And this was the answer that you saw in Python so that's pretty funny.
217

218
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,230
You saw that even though there is a variable Q In this expression the answer turns out to be the square
218

219
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,820
root of six over two regardless of what Q is equal to.
219

220
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:04,030
So in this video and the last video you learned about using simplify and Python to solve for a variable
220

221
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,790
in an expression.
221

222
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,130
In the next video we are going to continue our adventures in learning how to use Python to understand
222

223
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,550
algebra, and that's going to be done by expanding terms.
223

224
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,910
I'm also going to show you some new concepts in sympy.
224

225
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,560
So keep on watching.
