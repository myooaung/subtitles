1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,930
Let's start by talking about limits and the limit of a function.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,130
So what does that mean to have a limit of a function.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,320
Well let me start with the notation.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,560
So the notation looks like this.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:27,040
So you would say you would pronounce this as the limit of F of X as X goes towards a.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:35,400
And essentially what this means is what is the value of the function when X goes towards the value of

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,570
a.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,070
Now sometimes the limit of a function is really easy even trivial to compute and you can see that in

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,430
this example.

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,140
So the limit of the function x squared over 2 as X goes towards for that.

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,800
In this case computing the limit is really simple.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,610
All you have to do is plug in for for X and then you just see what the function ends up being.

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,170
So for squared is 16 divided by two is eight.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,000
And we can draw this on a graph and then you see that as X goes towards four.

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,640
The function goes towards eight.

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,310
So that's a pretty easy example.

17
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,520
Limits can be trickier in some cases.

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,910
For example consider this graph.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,330
This is a graph of the function f of x equals X squared divided by X minus two.

20
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,470
So what is the limit of the function as X goes towards two.

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,160
Well you can try to just plug in two into this equation A you get four that's no problem but here you

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,320
get two minus two which is zero.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,700
So you end up with four divided by zero.

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,760
And we're not allowed to divide by zero and furthermore when you look at this graph you can see that

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,520
the limit isn't even the same when you approach the function from the from the right versus when you

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,610
approach the function from the left.

27
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,880
So in this particular case for this example we actually need to have two separate one sided limits.

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,350
So you would right the limit as x approaches two from the positive direction or from the right and there

29
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,170
the limit is plus infinity.

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:26,880
You can see this function goes up to infinity here and here you say the limit of F of X as X goes to

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,710
two coming in from the left or from the negative side.

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,950
So that would mean coming in from here and you can see the function goes down to minus infinity.

33
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:45,740
So let's switch to Python and see how to implement the limit of a function in this video.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:54,150
We are going to use several modules including simplify and map plot lib dot pi plot for plotting num

35
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,740
Pi.

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,640
And from the Python display the display and math functions.

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,370
And that's because I'm going to show you how to write out the limit in later coding.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,670
All right.

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,540
So let's start with a fairly simple function.

40
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm going to say Actually first I will import a symbolic variable X and then let's say F of X equals

41
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,850
X cubed so x to the power of three and let's say we want to compute the limit points.

42
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,180
So the variable that I called a in the slides but here in code I'm going to call it Lim point because

43
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,400
I think this is a little bit more informative than just saying that variable a.

44
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:39,690
Okay.

45
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,140
So now we say that the limit is Sim dot limits.

46
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,600
So it's a pretty easy function name to remember.

47
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,900
So some limit and then let's see how to use this function.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,240
So I just pressed shift tab on my keyboard to get this doc string here.

49
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,190
So we see that the help file says e said and said not okay.

50
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,900
So what does this mean.

51
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,730
This means that we compute the limit of e of Z.

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,650
So that means that this is a function that's in the slides.

53
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,190
What I was referring to as F of X at the point z 0.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,010
So this is what I was calling a in the slides in here I call Lim point.

55
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,410
Okay.

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,600
So the way we set this up is to write F of X or effects and then X which is the key variable that we're

57
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,450
looking for.

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,290
And then the Lim Lim point.

59
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,810
All right.

60
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,830
So let's just see what that is.

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,230
Okay so we get a value three point three seven five and a bunch of zeros.

62
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,360
And really what.

63
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:54,030
You know what is going on here is that this limit point just gets plugged into this equation so we can

64
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:01,930
also see that one point five to the power of three is essentially that same number.

65
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,260
Okay.

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,750
Now I'm just gonna print this out in later coding so it looks a little nicer.

67
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,730
So display math.

68
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,180
And now the limit function in latex is probably not so surprising.

69
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,190
It's just Lim.

70
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:25,330
And then you use an underscore like this now normally in later coding an underscore gives us a subscript.

71
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:34,040
But now with this limit function in before it then latex will know to put whatever character comes after

72
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:41,520
the underscore directly beneath the limit and not just in a little subscript to the right but of course

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,430
we don't just want one character.

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,330
We want actually an entire expression.

75
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,860
So therefore we put it in curly brackets and now everything in the curly brackets is going to go underneath

76
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,610
the limit.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,880
So just to show you what this looks like.

78
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,940
So we have Lim for limits and then.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,510
OK so a SDF is not really a sensible thing here but I just wanted to print something out okay.

80
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,630
So X and then to get the little arrow use slash slash to.

81
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:19,080
And then this is going to be % G because I'm gonna replace this with the limit point and then I want

82
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,510
to write the function value and then the actual limit itself.

83
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:24,720
Okay.

84
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,630
So now we need to do some replacements.

85
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,360
So this first replacement here was X goes to.

86
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,460
And then that variable is Lim point.

87
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,090
And then I want to write the function here so that s f of x and then I want to write the actual limit

88
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,670
which is Lim.

89
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,310
Okay let's see if this is gonna work or if we need to fix anything in this line to make it look a little

90
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,960
bit nicer.

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,650
Okay well this doesn't really look nicer so we certainly need to fix this.

92
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,870
That was actually not intentional.

93
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,390
In fact I was referring to fixing this to make this look nicer.

94
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,940
So of course you already know how to fix this.

95
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:15,400
We want to convert this expression from Python code into latex formatting so that is going to be Sim

96
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,010
dot later like F X all right.

97
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,510
Now this looks pretty nice.

98
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,230
This is some beautiful latex formatting here.

99
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:34,020
So now we know what this value is but in mathematics in general and particularly in calculus visualization

100
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,310
is really important.

101
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,540
In fact I think visualization and calculus is so much more important for building intuition and understanding

102
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,260
than is often taught in high school or university level calculus courses.

103
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,770
So therefore what I'd like to do now is basically plot the function and also plot the limit on top of

104
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,140
that and to generate this plot.

105
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:05,460
What I'm going to do is generate a function that will allow me to evaluate this function.

106
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,240
So X cubed based on whatever values I want.

107
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,680
So that's not possible here because X is a symbolic variable.

108
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:22,380
So I'm going to use a function called Sim that lamb defy and then I'm going to provide two inputs which

109
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,210
are x variable X and the function or the expression.

110
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,410
Now lambda Phi is a simple function that will return another function that we can provide inputs to

111
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,270
and get outputs from.

112
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,240
I mentioned this function and showed you briefly how to use it a while back in the course that was in

113
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,740
the section on simplify and latex introduction but it's a pretty important function for calculus.

114
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,970
I'm gonna be using this function fairly often so let's see what this output is.

115
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,660
So notice that this output is actually a function.

116
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,310
It's not a variable on itself.

117
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:08,720
And what this allows us to do is use this as a function providing an input for what to replace with

118
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,900
F to a sorry X to evaluate f of x.

119
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:21,830
So for example if I input zero course the result is gonna be zero because zero cubed is zero.

120
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:28,100
And you know I can input 3 for example and 3 to the power of three is twenty seven.

121
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:36,030
So now I'm going to come up with some x axis range that's going to be Lynn space.

122
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,960
How about this go from minus five to plus five in two hundred steps.

123
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:51,910
Okay so now what we can do with this lambda fired expression is say that you BPL t that plot x x by

124
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
f of x.

125
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,650
Now this is not going to work on its own.

126
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,830
And that's because this isn't actually a list of numbers.

127
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,820
This is a function and it's not really possible to plot a function.

128
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:09,710
So we provide input to the function and that is x x.

129
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:20,140
So this gives us an evaluation of this function f of x whereas that up here for values it corresponding

130
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,120
to this variable I call X X here.

131
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,580
Okay.

132
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,640
And now once we have that we can add to this.

133
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:35,140
I'm going to say P L T dot plot and now I'm going to plot the Lim point by the limit and let's make

134
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,210
this a red dot.

135
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,400
So now I plotted the function and I've plotted the limit on top of it.

136
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,950
Now if you like you could take a few moments to make this plot look a little bit nicer.

137
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,260
You could change some of the axis limits you could give access labels and a legend and so on.

138
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:02,020
But you know how to do that by this point in the course what I'd like to do now is show you another

139
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,000
plot of the function that I showed in the slides.

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,970
And that's also going to allow me to show you a little bit more about using this limit function.

141
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,720
So let's start by defining that function.

142
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:23,320
So that was F of X equals X squared divided by X minus two.

143
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,500
And in fact don't even need these parentheses but that's okay.

144
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,780
Okay.

145
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:36,400
And now I'm going to immediately skimmed that land defy variable X and F of X. The expression and then

146
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:44,950
for this function I'm going to evaluate it between 1 and 3 and let's go for one hundred and about one

147
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,760
hundred and two steps between 1 and 3.

148
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:48,590
Okay.

149
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:56,170
So now this was an interesting function because we cannot simply plug in for the value of two because

150
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,990
that gives us zero in the denominator.

151
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,890
So let's see.

152
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:06,760
So let's say the limit point is 2 and then Lim equals in the limit.

153
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,270
So I'm gonna try doing essentially what I did before what I did earlier limit point and then let's see

154
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,820
what what Lim ends up being.

155
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,030
Okay.

156
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,380
So we get what looks like 0 0.

157
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,880
Or you might be tempted to think that this is Python saying you maybe python is trying to give us a

158
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,400
hard time about computing the limit of this function but you saw in the graph in the slides and we'll

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,410
make another graph in a moment that the limit is actually different depending on whether you're coming

160
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,660
in from the right side or whether you're coming in from the left side.

161
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,470
So how is that incorporated in this expression here in this line of code.

162
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,230
Actually it's not incorporated.

163
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,580
So we want to change this a little bit.

164
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm gonna add a fourth input and that's dir 4 direction equals plus.

165
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,630
So this means we're coming in from the plus side we're coming in from the right over here.

166
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,210
So you can still see that says you.

167
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:12,470
And now when I change this to minus it says minus 2 or minus infinity.

168
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,680
Okay.

169
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:22,820
So now let me make the plot quickly so appeal to you that plot x x by f of x x and then we input x x.

170
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:31,800
So here you see that plot again and then I'm going to whereas it here I want to copy and paste this

171
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:40,120
code time here and I just want to show you how to make this small in addition to this formula so that

172
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,010
we get the one sided limit because this statement as it stands is actually not technically true.

173
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,780
This is not really a valid statement because without a plus or minus sign here this implies that the

174
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,440
limit is double sided and that is the case here.

175
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,710
So when you approach this point here for this particular function from the left and from the right or

176
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:08,940
from negative and from positive you get exactly the same limit here you get a different values.

177
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:18,190
So we need to specify that this is coming in from the left which means we need a little superscript

178
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,680
after the two over here.

179
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:30,770
So now this is actually the correct way to format this expression to show this expression in this video.

180
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:37,640
I introduced you to the idea of the limit of a function and how to compute limits of functions in Python

181
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:46,790
and also a bit of a review about using simplify to create functions that can be evaluated and you learned

182
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,140
a little bit more about later coding and making beautiful math notation.

183
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,130
Now don't go away.

184
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:59,150
Don't run away too quickly because the next video is going to contain the exercise for this video.
