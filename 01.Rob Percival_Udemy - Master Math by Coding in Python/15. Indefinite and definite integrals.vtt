00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.900
In this video I'm going to discuss indefinite and Definite integrals.

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.460
Now of course integration is a huge topic in calculus in many college programs.

3
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.450
You would spend an entire semester just talking about integration and I'm basically going to summarize

4
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.740
it all in about three minutes.

5
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.520
So let's see how I do.

6
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.650
I'm going to introduce you to the concept of an integral which is actually pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.370
You're just adding together a lot of really tiny little things.

8
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.610
And then I'll show you definite and indefinite integration.

9
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.320
Obviously how to implement and compute integrals in Python and then in the exercise you will also see

10
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.110
how the indefinite integral is related to the derivative and you'll see that it's basically like the

11
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.790
inverse of the derivative.

12
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.820
So here I have a function.

13
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.290
It's just some function that goes up and then down and up again and now a question is what is the area

14
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.150
between these two lines.

15
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.210
So if you would take the area that fills in all of these boundaries here.

16
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.540
So at the bottom of the axis and then these two sides and then the curve here this function here defines

17
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.880
the top of the boundary.

18
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.120
How would you go about identifying this area of this space here.

19
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.110
Well one way you could do it is by putting a bunch of bars that would fill in roughly fill in this area

20
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.350
and then you count the area of all of the bars and you say well that's a pretty decent approximation

21
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.260
of the area of this surface.

22
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.800
So how do you compute the area of all of these bars.

23
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.770
Well we start with this one bar a rectangle the area of a rectangle is the height.

24
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.570
Times the width so the height here looks like one two three four five.

25
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.150
Let's just call that five and what is the width here well three of these bars fits into one unit here.

26
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.450
So this is one third across here.

27
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.830
And it's five units up here so five times one third is of course five thirds.

28
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.750
So this area here is five third.

29
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.960
And then you would have to compute this area in this area and so on.

30
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.680
And then some.

31
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.930
All these up together.

32
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.820
Now of course that's not going to give you an exact correct answer.

33
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.460
And that's because you can see these bars.

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.190
So this one you know it overshoots a little bit and we're missing there's a gap over here.

35
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.110
So what can we do about that.

36
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.100
We could follow this same approach but make these bars a little bit thinner.

37
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.910
So we still cut up this area into a bunch of vertical bars and count their areas or some other areas

38
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.990
but we make the bars thinner.

39
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.790
Now you can imagine that the thinner these bars get the more accurate this estimate of the area is going

40
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.560
to get.

41
00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.680
And then we basically get down to an infinitesimal which means the smallest possible width that a bar

42
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.260
can possibly take.

43
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.050
Now on my computer screen that width would be one pixel but out there in the continuous analog real

44
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.690
world the width of that is going to be you know I guess it's like planck length the sort of smallest

45
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.430
disparities nation of the physical universe.

46
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.700
OK.

47
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.130
So but that is the principle we basically sum up a lot of really thin bars that cover the function from

48
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.000
this boundary point to this boundary point and that leads to the notation for computing the integral.

49
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.360
You have this really long thing it kind of looks like the little piece that's cut out of a violin but

50
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.110
it's called an integral symbol and you can think of it like an S.

51
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.510
It's like you're taking an S for summation but then you're squeezing the s a little bit and stretching

52
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.630
it.

53
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.340
So it's really tall.

54
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.990
So this symbol means to integrate between A and B and that's drawn here so a is this boundary and B

55
00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.240
would be this boundary here and then the way to interpret this here is this is the function.

56
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:12.590
So this is actually the height of the bar at each point in X and D X is like the smallest thinnest width

57
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.790
of the descriptive creation of x.

58
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.890
So you can see this is really just the height of the bar times the width of the bar and then this gets

59
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.640
smaller and smaller until it goes towards zero or infinitesimal.

60
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.850
And this ends up being just the function itself.

61
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.840
Now this is called a definite integral and that's because we are definitely computing an area between

62
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.640
the definite points A and B if you just want the general formula of what the integration of some function

63
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.250
would look like then you don't actually need these boundaries here A and B instead you want to compute

64
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.940
what's called the indefinite integral.

65
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.730
Now this is where your calculus course starts getting really hairy because computing INDEFINITE integrals

66
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.770
is not so straightforward.

67
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.080
You have to learn a lot of trick you have to look up integration tables and so on.

68
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.260
But it actually turns out that some functions are pretty straightforward to integrate including polynomials

69
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.300
so I'm just going to focus in this video on integrating polynomials.

70
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.820
So here is the general formula for the indefinite integral of a polynomial.

71
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:31.260
So the integral of B or B is a constant times X which is the variable and a is some power also a constant

72
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:41.670
D X equals B X to the power of a plus one and that whole thing divided by a plus one plus C where C

73
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.150
is just some arbitrary constant might be the number three or minus 10 for example.

74
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.710
So how do we make sense of this result and how do we derive this answer from this equation.

75
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.520
Well the way to do that is to think backwards and to say what is the derivative of this formula or this

76
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.030
expression.

77
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.360
So the derivative of this expression would be to take this power here bring it down here to multiply

78
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.480
the B and then we subtract one from this power.

79
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.690
So this would end up being a plus one minus one which is of course a.

80
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.900
And then we have the A PLUS ONE TERM out front and that cancels out the A plus one.

81
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.160
So then we end up with b times X to the power of a.

82
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.380
So that's the derivative of this.

83
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.160
And now this constant here also comes from taking the derivative of this expression because the derivative

84
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.380
of a constant is always zero.

85
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.620
Right.

86
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.980
A constant is not moving it's just a straight line.

87
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.040
So if it's not changing over time then it's derivative is zero.

88
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.230
So you could also implicitly write plus zero in here and that wouldn't do anything.

89
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.120
Now that leaves open the question of why it's the right thing to do to define this integral as being

90
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.940
the opposite of the derivative.

91
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.940
And that is one of the most important principles of calculus which is that integration and derivation

92
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.960
are the opposites of each other and you are going to be able to demonstrate that in the exercise.

93
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.190
OK.

94
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.340
So this is a formula.

95
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.900
Let's go through one simple example.

96
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.560
So let's say we want to compute the indefinite integral of four times X squared.

97
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.420
Well we just follow this principle here.

98
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.880
So that's 2 plus 1.

99
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.510
So X cubed and then we put the exponent plus 1 also in the denominator here.

100
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.350
And of course add C.

101
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:42.270
And now we can quickly confirm that computing the derivative of this side will give us this term here.

102
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:48.740
So the derivative of this is going to be we take down the three and this becomes 12 times X squared.

103
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.460
But then it's divided by three.

104
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.360
So that brings this 12 back down to four and that gives us exactly this term in here.

105
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:56.760
All right.

106
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:03.510
So with that as a introduction I'm not going to switch to Python and show you how to compute the integral

107
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:12.210
the indefinite and definite integral of a function using simple fortunately it's pretty straightforward.

108
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:21.930
So let's start by creating a symbolic variable so x equals some symbols X and let's say that our function

109
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.150
is just x.

110
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:34.290
So it's a really simple function and then we type Sim dot into great integrate F and the output is the

111
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.480
indefinite integral of this function.

112
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.950
So X squared divided by two and we can quickly confirm that the derivative of this is going to be two

113
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.290
x divided by two which of course is just x.

114
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:53.640
Now you have to be careful when computing the indefinite integral in simple.

115
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.770
That the constant is left out here.

116
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:03.170
So notice in the slides I said you know you put on this plus C over here but here the output of sim

117
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.060
that integrate actually doesn't include a constant.

118
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.470
So something to keep in mind.

119
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.070
So this is the indefinite integral.

120
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.510
And now how do we compute the definite integral.

121
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.220
Well it's actually pretty much the same thing.

122
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:24.510
So I'm still gonna write simple dot integrate it's still f except now we provide a second input which

123
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:31.950
is going to be a tuple and in this tuple we give three inputs the variable that we are going to integrate

124
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.460
over.

125
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.750
Now in this case it's only X that's our only option.

126
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.850
But of course if you have a function of multiple variables you know if this were a function of x and

127
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:50.060
y then you could integrate over X or integrate over y and then we want the two areas are the two boundaries

128
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.770
I should say to compute the integral over.

129
00:09:53.220 --> 00:10:01.950
So we are going to compute the integral of x in the range of 0 to 1 and the answer is 1 1/2.

130
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.330
So how can we make sense of this answer.

131
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.430
Let's start by plotting this function I think I'll do that up here.

132
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:19.950
So all right p equals Sim dot plotting dot plot f now because I am computing the definite integral between

133
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:30.810
0 and 1 I actually want to zoom in to this plot a little bit so p dot X Lim equals Let's go 0 to 1 and

134
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:38.040
then I'll set p that y Lim how about maybe also 0 to 1.

135
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.160
Okay and now let me to make sure that these X and Y limits are going to be updated I'm going to write

136
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:51.990
show equals false and then after I change some of the features of this plot then I write p dot show.

137
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.890
Okay so here is our function and it's it's actually a pretty boring looking function isn't it.

138
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.050
It just goes up like this.

139
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.890
So F equals X Y equals X.

140
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:09.760
And now when you look at this graphically it's pretty obvious that the area under this curve or the

141
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.740
straight line from 0 to 1 is going to be 1 1/2.

142
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.360
And that's because we have a box here that's Unit 1.

143
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:23.160
So it's a box with area equal to 1 and then we're just cutting it exactly on the diagonal.

144
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.120
So that's the kind of visual geometric way to understand that this is the right answer.

145
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:33.900
And numerically the way to think about this being the right answer is that you compute the integral

146
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.090
at X equals 1 minus the integral of x equals zero.

147
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.090
So X equals 1.

148
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.510
The integral was let me print this out here

149
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:55.970
x squared divided by two so then we input one or we replace X for one and we get one squared which is

150
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.430
just one divided by two.

151
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.090
Which is one half and then minus x equals zero.

152
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.800
And of course this function is zero.

153
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:11.480
So then we get one half what I'd like to do next is show you a little bit more about plotting a integral

154
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.760
and a function.

155
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.020
So let's come up with another function.

156
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.120
Maybe this one's gonna be a little bit more interesting.

157
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.580
How about X cubed divided by X minus two.

158
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.710
Now this is gonna be interesting as a function because it's gonna have something bizarre happening at

159
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.600
X equals 2.

160
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:38.030
So first I'm going to compute the indefinite integral let's call this int f equals sim that integrate

161
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.530
of f and then I want to plot both of these on the same plot.

162
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.630
So right.

163
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:54.230
P equals Sim dot plotting dot plot f show equals false and this is lowercase F and now I want to include

164
00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:02.900
the integral in the same plot so I have to write P that extend and I'm going to extend this plot object

165
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.750
by adding another plot object to it.

166
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:13.910
So that's gonna be another same dot plotting dot plot and now it's int f and let's say the bounds for

167
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:22.220
that should be X and let's go from a little bit higher than this maybe like two point one up to ten.

168
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.490
Okay.

169
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:30.200
And then also show equals false and make sure this has a different line color of red.

170
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.930
And now let's just plot this and see what it looks like.

171
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.450
Oh right.

172
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.860
So the function blows up to plus infinity and over here it goes down to minus infinity.

173
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:49.890
So I want to force the y axis to be a little bit more centered so let's say p dot y Lim equals maybe

174
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.750
minus two hundred two plus two hundred and let's see how this looks.

175
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.220
Oh right.

176
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.410
This is looking a bit better okay.

177
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.770
And then the last thing that I want to add here is some labels for a legend.

178
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:12.080
So let's say the first label is going to be I want this to to show me what the function is.

179
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:22.670
So this is going to be f of x equals and then percent s and here replace that percent s with Sim the

180
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.620
late.

181
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:31.110
And then the function itself which was F and then let's see I'll do a little bit of copying and pasting.

182
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:36.960
So this is gonna be the label associated with the second line so of index 1.

183
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.760
And that's going to be the integral.

184
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:46.620
So that should say since this is the latex code for into getting the integral sign slash and so and

185
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:55.150
then we need a d x in here and that's going to be it f right.

186
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.100
And then I need to activate the legend.

187
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.430
So p dot legend equals true.

188
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.090
There you go.

189
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.270
OK.

190
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.040
So here we just see all the raw latex code which didn't get interpreted.

191
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.330
And why didn't it get interpreted.

192
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.630
This was my mistake.

193
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:17.370
I should have put another dollar sign at the end here.

194
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.940
Let's see.

195
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.540
There you go.

196
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:28.630
Now that's looking quite a bit nicer in this video I introduce you to the concept of an integral.

197
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:34.670
I showed you how to compute the definite and indefinite integrals in python using simple.

198
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:41.210
And in the next video which contains the exercise associated with this video you will get to see that

199
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:46.250
the indefinite integral is like the inverse or the opposite of the derivative.

200
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.130
That's a pretty important principle in calculus.
