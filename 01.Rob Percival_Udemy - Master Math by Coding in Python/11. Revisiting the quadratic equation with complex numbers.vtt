00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.350
Now that you know about complex numbers and how to work with complex numbers I'd like to go back to

2
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.230
the quadratic equation and revisit that video on the quadratic equation.

3
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.400
So if you haven't already gone through that video then I recommend pausing this video and going back

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.790
to watch that video on the quadratic equation and then coming back here so you will remember that in

5
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.480
that video what we did was create a function that computes the quadratic equation and gives two output

6
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.140
corresponding to the two solutions or the two routes of that second degree polynomial.

7
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.480
And then what we did was put that into a matrix where we looped over different ranges of these two coefficients

8
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.520
B and C and then made an image of that.

9
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.660
Now you will remember there was this warning that said casting complex values to real discards the imaginary

10
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.550
part.

11
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.160
And so what I want to do now is go back and actually separate these plots for the real part and the

12
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.000
imaginary part.

13
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.640
So in fact you're going to generate three plots one corresponding to the real part of the solutions

14
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.630
one corresponding to the imaginary part of the complex solutions and another one corresponding to what's

15
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.300
called the magnitude of a complex number.

16
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.800
So the magnitude of a complex number is the distance between the origin of the complex plane and they

17
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.490
coordinate that's represented by that complex number.

18
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.820
Okay.

19
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.980
So let's see what we can do here.

20
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.380
So here's our matrix M and what I'd like to do is just start by viewing the real part of M.

21
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.860
Now based on this warning message I already expect that the real part of M is going to produce a graph

22
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.430
that looks exactly like this.

23
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.730
Okay.

24
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.850
So it does look exactly like this but we still get this warning here.

25
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.650
So maybe let's just ignore this for the moment and see what the imaginary part of M is.

26
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.530
Mm hmm.

27
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.800
And this is just one solid green block and you can see that this is all at zero and we still get this

28
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.710
warning.

29
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.710
Now what's actually happening here is that this warning is not coming from this line of code.

30
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.620
This warning is coming from this line of code.

31
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.810
So the output of the quadratic equation function can be complex as valued.

32
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.660
However this matrix is not set up to handle complex value numbers.

33
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.040
And so to change this we actually need to explicitly tell none pi in this zeros function that we want

34
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.050
to be able for this matrix to represent or to contain complex numbers.

35
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.790
So you have to right d type for a data type equals complex.

36
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.070
OK.

37
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.660
So now I'm going to run this code again and we will see what happens here huh.

38
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.110
So.

39
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.430
OK.

40
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.720
So first of all that warning message went away.

41
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.460
So that was already pretty nice.

42
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.170
And now we get this really interesting looking plot where it looks like there's a lot of values that

43
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.490
are zeros here.

44
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.060
Now I'm going to come back in a moment and talk about how to interpret this plot.

45
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.210
But first what I want to do is generate some additional plots and have them all be next to each other.

46
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.410
So we can see the three plots all side by side.

47
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.470
So to do that I'm going to use subplots.

48
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.330
So let's see.

49
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.560
I will write BLT the subplot.

50
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.370
And so the subplot function takes three inputs the first two inputs correspond to the geometry in terms

51
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.130
of the number of rows and the number of columns.

52
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.740
So I want this figure to have one row three columns.

53
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.190
And then the third input corresponds to the axis that you want to be currently working on.

54
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.070
So that's going to be one for the first axis.

55
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.920
Now if you're thinking it should be zero because Python starts counting at zero then yes I agree it's

56
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.730
a little bit confusing.

57
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.100
OK.

58
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.150
So let's run this code now and see how this looks so.

59
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.720
Notice that this plot got a bit smaller.

60
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.170
Now the color bar doesn't really look good anymore.

61
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.010
So we don't really even need the color bar except it is useful to remember that in this plot zero caused

62
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.050
so a value of zero corresponds to this yellow color over here.

63
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.860
OK.

64
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.600
So this shows the imaginary part although in fact I would like to show the real part on the left.

65
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.590
Now I'm going to copy and paste this code.

66
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.680
And now we're going to work on the second image so that's going to come here.

67
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.160
Remember this is a one by three geometry.

68
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.110
So it's one row and three columns.

69
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.930
Now this one is actually going to contain the imaginary part and maybe we should make a more informative

70
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.650
labels.

71
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.610
I'll say real part.

72
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.990
Get rid of this and get rid of all this.

73
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:04.230
And this is going to be the imaginary part loops and parentheses okay.

74
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.530
So here I actually copied and pasted too much.

75
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.330
So this P L T dot show command is really only supposed to be run when you are finished plotting.

76
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.310
Okay.

77
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.730
So now we see these two plots side by side like this.

78
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.440
However the y axis label from this plot is being drawn on top of the real part.

79
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.280
And in fact we don't even need these here.

80
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.340
So I'm even going to simplify things a bit by getting rid of this.

81
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.800
And so I'm going to get rid of the labels and I'm going to turn off the axis so axis off.

82
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.100
So notice that completely turns off this axis.

83
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.720
And then I will say the same thing here.

84
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.150
Okay.

85
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.790
Now this looks a little bit more interpretable.

86
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.420
And then the last thing that I want to plot is the magnitude of the complex number.

87
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.850
Again that was the distance between the origin and the coordinate indicated by the complex number.

88
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.000
And that is called the absolute value.

89
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.250
So magnitude Whoops.

90
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:20.080
Okay here the problem is I'm putting over the second plot here okay.

91
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.710
So now that the plotting is done I want to take a few moments to interpret what you're looking at here.

92
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.330
In particular focusing on the real part and the imaginary part so you can see that there is this structure

93
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.990
here this kind of looks a bit like a tongue sticking out where there's zero imaginary part here so zero

94
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.050
imaginary part means that there are real valued solutions and when there is an imaginary part then these

95
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.830
are complex valued solutions.

96
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.750
And so to help us interpret this actually I will leave the access on for this first plot here.

97
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.620
So remember that these are the values for b the second coefficient and these are the values for C.

98
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:06.020
So what this plot is telling you is that as B gets larger either negative or positive.

99
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:14.720
So the further away B gets from zero the more you have real valued and not complex valued solutions.

100
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.510
Now that doesn't only work on its own it's actually interacting with the C parameter and in particular

101
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:29.340
as the C parameter gets smaller so closer to zero then you're also seeing more and more real value solutions.

102
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.950
Now let's keep that interpretation in mind and look back at the formula.

103
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:41.020
So essentially we get complex valued solutions when there's a negative number inside this square root.

104
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.960
And how do you get a negative number inside the square root.

105
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.610
Well you get a negative number.

106
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.210
Basically when this term is larger than this term.

107
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:57.680
So to get real value solutions you want either b to be large or a time C to be small.

108
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.170
And now here we're fixing a to b 1.

109
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:07.690
So let's just ignore a and we can just think about C so when C is small and B is large we get real valid

110
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:13.290
solutions which means no complex numbers which means no imaginary part.

111
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.850
And that's what this graph is showing you here.

112
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.860
As B gets large and it doesn't matter if it's large negative or large positive because B ends up being

113
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.600
squared.

114
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:30.170
So this highlights one of the really powerful ways of using Python or other computer numerical softwares

115
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.920
for visualizing mathematics because we can get some really beautiful insights into the nature of these

116
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.610
equations.

117
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:44.960
In this case the quadratic formula by making plots of the results of the formulas and kind of looking

118
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.240
at the plots and thinking about the formulas.
