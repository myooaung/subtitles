1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:10,400
So let's continue our exploration of using trigonometry to make beautiful simple art.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,630
In particular we are going to make roads curves.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,280
This is rose like the flower Rose.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,210
So you're going to learn the formula for making roads curves.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,850
And there's an interesting relationship between the key parameter for this formula and the number of

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:31,170
pedals or the number of leaves in the flower in the Rose okay.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,290
And then the exercise will get to make some more interesting looking graphics.

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:35,620
All right.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,930
So this is an example of a rose curve.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,900
You can see so this one has four pedals and it almost looks like you know to infinity signs is like

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,640
a horizontal infinity sign and a vertical infinity sign.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,070
So how do we create this rose curve.

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,540
Well we plot X comma Y where X and Y are defined according to these expressions.

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:07,520
So X EQUALS COSINE of k Times T where T is some vector you can think of it as time K is a parameter

15
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,480
it's a single number.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,350
I'm going to talk about how to define this number in the next line.

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,290
So X equals cosine of k Times T times cosine of T.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,820
So it almost looks like cosine squared but it's not if you are as long as K is not equal to 1 then this

19
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,700
is not cosine squared and y is equal to cosine of Katie again this same term.

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,090
And then the sign of T.

21
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,550
So it's a little bit tricky.

22
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,940
This is not the sign of the sign times a sign.

23
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,490
It's always the coastline of k Times T.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,590
And then for x you multiply by cosine and for y you multiply by sine.

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,290
All right.

26
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,170
Pretty straightforward to implement.

27
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,870
Let me talk about this parameter k.

28
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:59,600
So it turns out that if k is drawn from these set of natural numbers so the integers now K doesn't have

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,380
to be an integer you'll see that in the exercises.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:10,280
But if you set k to be an integer then here's the rule for the relationship between K and the number

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,410
of pedals.

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:19,040
So if k is an even number then the Rose curve will have two times K pedals and if k is an odd number

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,010
then the Rose curve will have K pedals.

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,260
So pretty bizarre looking rule.

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:32,420
So my question for you put your thinking cap on what is the parameter of K in this particular Rose curve.

36
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,340
Well the only possible answer is to.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,690
So it has two times K so two times two which is four pedals.

38
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,690
Now you could just look at this rule and say well you know couldn't K also before but that.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,730
So this rule is only valid if k is odd and for of course it is not an odd number.

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,010
All right.

41
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,230
So now let's switch to Python and we are going to implement the formula and create some rose curves

42
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,360
so we're still using known pi and map plot lib dot pi plot.

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,890
And let's see.

44
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:16,540
So I will set k equal to and then I'm going to set t to be known pi to linearly spaced numbers from

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,380
now of course.

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,360
This is also a bit arbitrary.

47
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:27,580
It is good to have a minimum number of cycles which would mean going through two pi and I will let you

48
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,560
play around with this.

49
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,290
This this range on your own.

50
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,250
I'm going to set it from zero to 4 pi in.

51
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,210
Let's go for 1000 steps.

52
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,570
All right.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,300
So now we need to create X and Y.

54
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:48,680
So remember X was the cosine of k Times T times the cosine of T.

55
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:57,940
So that was X and then we have Y is almost exactly the same except for of course we have changed the

56
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,190
variable to y except for the cosine here it turns into a sine this first term remains a cosine.

57
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:05,530
All right.

58
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:13,250
So then let's plot some peel to eat up plot x comma Y I'm going to make this a nice thick magenta line.

59
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,460
Why does it have to be magenta.

60
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,510
You guessed it because magenta is basically purple which is a great color.

61
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,980
So BLT that axis square.

62
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,510
And I'm also going to turn the Axis off because we don't actually care about the values on the Axis.

63
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,510
We don't need to see the grid of the axis and boom there you go.

64
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:42,490
So we set k to be two and we get this for pedaled Rove's curve as I said in the video.

65
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,900
So let's see or in the slides so we can set k to be three.

66
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,690
And now we get a rose curve with three pedals.

67
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,010
Pretty neat if it's four.

68
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,790
Then we get not four pedals right.

69
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,430
Because remember if k is even then we get to Times K pedals.

70
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,040
So here we have one two three four five six seven eight which happens to be two times four.

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,820
Now I mentioned briefly before switching to Python that K does not need to be an integer.

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,510
So there you go.

73
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,930
Now I set k to be four point two and it makes this kind of interesting looking pattern with overlapping

74
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,310
pedals it even looks more like a rose now than it did before.

75
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,110
It's also interesting to see the line just stops here.

76
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,850
So I think it looks like that we should really set this parameter here for Pi to go higher.

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,530
So it seems like for the value of four point two maybe we want to set this to strike eight pi.

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,830
Okay.

79
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,970
So that looks pretty good now.

80
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,440
This looks like a full rose flower.

81
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,210
Very nice.

82
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,910
So here is your exercise for this video.

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:02,030
What you want to do is create nine rows curves by parameter R setting K to be different values so zero

84
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,400
point five one one point five.

85
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,540
So this is one point five.

86
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,460
This is two.

87
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,100
And so on up to four so you can see it's quite similar.

88
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,500
You know there's some similarities to the previous video.

89
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,000
You can set k to go from 0 to 4 in steps of point 5.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,070
And you also want to put this into a three by three geometry just like what you did in the previous

91
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,810
video.

92
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,780
So good luck.

93
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,740
Have fun enjoy working through this exercise and producing this series of Rose curves.

94
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:45,210
So now I am going to switch to Python and walk you through how I came up with a solution to this all

95
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,470
right.

96
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,380
So let's do that here.

97
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,070
Now some of this code is actually gonna be pretty much exactly the same as in the previous video.

98
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:04,360
So BLT the subplots three comma three and I'm going to set this fig size also to be ten by six.

99
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,400
And then I'm going to specify or create these new variables Ro and call these are going to be the matrices

100
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,770
that I will index in order to convert from linear indices into subscript.

101
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,560
And that's for calling up the specific subplots.

102
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,600
So and P indices.

103
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,380
And that's going to be a three by three.

104
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,350
Geometry.

105
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,190
Now of course you are welcome to and I encourage this to try changing this geometry you can make it

106
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,510
three by four if you want to get more parameters and there were five by five.

107
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:43,040
That would give you twenty five different rows curves but I'm just gonna stick to three by three here.

108
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,430
Okay.

109
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,850
So now we need a loop.

110
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,070
I'm going to say so there's a couple of ways you could setup this loop.

111
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:56,010
You know we could set up a parameter k to go from 0 and then point 5 and then 1 and one point five.

112
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:02,410
Obviously this is not valid code but just to illustrate the concept that you could already create a

113
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:10,620
a vector a list k of numbers that go from 0 to 4 in steps of point 5.

114
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,480
But I'm going to accomplish this in a slightly different way which may also be the way that you did.

115
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,080
So I'm still going to specify a range that goes from zero to nine.

116
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,610
And now what I'm going to do is specify that K is I divided by two.

117
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,370
So that is going to give me in fact that I think I'll even print this out just to make sure that it's

118
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,930
super duper clear.

119
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,450
So here we have.

120
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,250
Well here we have our our axes.

121
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,200
You don't have to worry about those for now.

122
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,550
So here we say that we go.

123
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,970
We count from zero to eight.

124
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,710
And then I specify k to be I this looping index over are divided by two.

125
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,650
All right.

126
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:02,910
So then let's see I'm going to do a bit of copying and pasting and now I'm not redefining T because

127
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,770
I've already defined t up here so I'm not redefining it down here either.

128
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,700
So let's see just tab indent all of these lines.

129
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,880
So let's see what do we need to change here.

130
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,350
Well we already have t and we are redefining k up here.

131
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,070
So that looks good.

132
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,050
This looks good.

133
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:30,430
So this is fine except now of course we need to specify that this is going to be axis are comma c.

134
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:37,650
So then I say R equals road that Ravel and then I'm going to index the ISF element.

135
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,440
Now if you have no idea what I'm doing here if this looks really mysterious this is something I explained

136
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,650
in the exercise of the previous video.

137
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,380
So you might want to go back and consult.

138
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,540
That's OK.

139
00:09:50,790 --> 00:10:01,080
So let's see that is for the plot and then for changing the axes and then I will say P L T dot show.

140
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,680
Let's see.

141
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,550
All right.

142
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,780
This is pretty good but it's not quite perfect.

143
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,070
So one thing is that this line you know a line with the three looked pretty good here when we just had

144
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,610
one.

145
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,740
But it's getting a little bit thick here in particular for this.

146
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,150
You know this just looks like a mess in here.

147
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,310
So I'm going to specify that the line with should be equal to 1 which is the default and also change

148
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,910
this to black lines.

149
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,160
OK.

150
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,130
So I think this looks a bit better.

151
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:34,830
However this is still not exactly what I said you should do in the slides because we are missing the

152
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,860
titles of all these graphs that indicate the parameter the value of k.

153
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:52,260
So let's write X R comma C dot set title and I'm going to set the title to B K equals and then use a

154
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,070
substitution here and then percent K like this.

155
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,890
All right.

156
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,180
This looks really good.

157
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:07,910
It's also interesting to see that when K equals zero and when K equals one we just get a pure circle.

158
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,660
In both cases and I encourage you to take a moment meditate on this fact this observation and think

159
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,450
about what that means here when K equals zero.

160
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:26,040
And when K equals 1 as I mentioned of course as always for every video in this course I encourage you

161
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:33,240
after this video to spend some time exploring different parameters of K you can explore different bounds

162
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,160
for tea.

163
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,140
You can do all sorts of things and play around if you happen to discover something really amazing and

164
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,060
beautiful and outstanding please please please post it to the Q and A.

165
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:52,250
I love looking at what artwork and creativity you have come up with okay but so in this video we covered

166
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:58,430
Rose curves which are these interesting curves they have a neat looking formula and a pretty interesting

167
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:06,110
rule for the parameter that that K parameter and the number of parameters are the number of petals in

168
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,590
the Rose curve in the next video I'm going to ask you to do a little bit of web searching to find your

169
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,180
own formula.

170
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,080
It's gonna be a slightly different approach from what I normally do in this course.

171
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,570
So keep watching and I will see you soon.
