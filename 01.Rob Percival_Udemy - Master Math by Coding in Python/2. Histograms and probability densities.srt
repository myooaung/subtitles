1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's begin our discussion on probability by talking about history.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:15,150
Probability densities and the difference between a probability and a proportion.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,500
So let's start by talking about this dataset here.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,190
This is a set of letters and what we want to do is create a histogram from this set.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,700
So creating a histogram from a finite set like this is pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,770
All you do is look at all the unique elements in this set and then count the number of occurrences of

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,310
each element.

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:46,020
So we have on the x axis the letters a b and c and on the y axis the occurrences or the counts.

9
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:53,570
So the histogram of this set looks something like this a appears twice B appears twice and c appears

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,650
four times.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,990
So pretty straightforward I think.

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,620
Now here you see a probability plot.

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,340
Now you'll notice that it looks overall the same.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,130
The main difference is that the y axis is changed here compared to here.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,000
So this is in just the raw counts and this is a probability.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,450
So A is associated with a probability of point two five or 25 percent and b also and then C is 50 percent

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,920
or point five.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,000
Now importantly a probability density has to sum up to 1.

19
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,300
So all of the values in this entire histogram have to sum up to exactly 1.

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,490
And of course that's the case here point to five plus point two five plus point five equals 1.

21
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,780
So we have a histogram.

22
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:49,520
We have a probability plot and then here I call this a proportion.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,460
Now this looks remarkably similar to this probability graph.

24
00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:00,170
In fact in this case there are exactly the same except that the interpretation is quite different.

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:08,470
So this y axis here proportion means that a appears 25 percent of the time b appears 25 percent of the

26
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,670
time and c appears 50 percent of the time.

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,220
Now that is slightly different from the interpretation of this probability graph here.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:25,340
What this means is that if you were to pick a letter totally at random from anywhere in this set there

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,230
is a 25 percent chance that you're going to pick the letter A.

30
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,980
So you'll notice that that is a different interpretation from proportion.

31
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,150
Now to make this distinction between probability and proportion a little bit clear.

32
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,460
Let me show you another example.

33
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,230
So here is an example of coin flips.

34
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,020
These are U.S. pennies.

35
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,600
So imagine you flip a coin ten times and six of those times that lands heads.

36
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,860
So we can say in this dataset this finite dataset with 10 coin flips the proportion of heads was 60

37
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,370
percent.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:09,380
So six out of ten times we got heads but the probability of getting ahead with any given coin flip is

39
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,720
point five or 50 percent.

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,990
So here you can see the difference between proportion and probability.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,370
Now let's switch to Python and see how to produce a histogram and a probability density in code.

42
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:32,920
So we're gonna need the NUM pi and Matt plot lib modules and I'm going to start by creating a dataset

43
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,320
that's going to contain a bunch of numbers let's say 1.

44
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,520
And how about a couple of twos three and four five maybe we need some sixes in here.

45
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,080
Seven eight nine maybe we need another eight and a six and how about three.

46
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,450
OK.

47
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:58,520
So this is our dataset and now I'm going to write P L T dot hist data and we need an x axis label that's

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:09,380
going to say value and a Y axis label and that's going to be number of appearances or the count and

49
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,700
that I think should be enough.

50
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,990
Okay.

51
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,090
So here you see the histogram.

52
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,430
So that count by the value.

53
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:23,110
So let's see there was 1 1 and looks like 5 2 so 1 2 3 4 5.

54
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,620
That's correct but we get here.

55
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,740
This is starting to look a little bit weird because kind of seems like there's zero fours there's clearly

56
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,140
a four There's also five.

57
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,620
So what's going on with this missing gap here.

58
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:43,580
Well to understand this a little bit better to understand why this looks a little initially weird compared

59
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,730
to what you see in this dataset what I'm going to do is instead of just drawing the histogram directly

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,350
I'm going to use the NUM pi histogram function to extract these values.

61
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,120
So get out these x axis values and get out the y axis values.

62
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:10,580
So I'm going to write test data that's gonna be output of the histogram function and let's say data.

63
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:10,820
Okay.

64
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,840
And let's start just by looking at hist data.

65
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:21,910
So hist data provides two outputs or in this case a tuple that both goes into the Hist data variable.

66
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,550
So here you see the y axis coordinates.

67
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,930
So 1 5 2 1 0 and so on.

68
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,450
And then this second output corresponds to numbers that go from 1 through 9.

69
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,860
And this is the actual range of the numbers that I wrote in the dataset but they don't have integers.

70
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,700
So it's like 1 to one point eight and then two point six three point four.

71
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,960
And so on.

72
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,350
Now it's also interesting to count the number of numbers in here.

73
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,890
So this has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 elements.

74
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:03,360
And here we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven elements.

75
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:03,610
OK.

76
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,780
So there's already a couple of bizarre seemingly bizarre things.

77
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,190
So first of all I only have the there's only nine unique elements in here integers 1 through 9.

78
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,990
And here we have 10 integers.

79
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,630
And here we have eleven numbers.

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,950
So I'm going to talk more about this in the next video.

81
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,680
But essentially what's happening is that the function hissed as well as histogram is by default trying

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,180
to group the data into 10 equally sized bins.

83
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:40,800
And so what this zero here means is that there is no numbers in our data set that fall between four

84
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,780
point two and five.

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,460
And that's an exclusive thing.

86
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,070
So 5 the number five appears once in the data set.

87
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,890
And that's going to be counted as between five and five point eight not between four point two and five.

88
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,250
And of course the number four in the dataset is between three point four and four point two.

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,710
OK.

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,110
So how can we make this a little bit more sensible.

91
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,890
So what I'm going to do is specify the exact bins that I want to use and I'm going to make this be a

92
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,430
range.

93
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,140
So num pi range function from 1 to 10.

94
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,130
Now let's see what this looks like.

95
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,020
Now we see that these values are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

96
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,970
And then the values here are a little bit more sensible.

97
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,370
But still there's only eight numbers here.

98
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,270
So one two three four five six seven eight.

99
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,630
And that's because it's actually excluding the number nine here.

100
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,770
So you can see the number nine appears once in this dataset.

101
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,170
And although the bins the bin boundaries go up to nine.

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,690
This is exclusive on the top level.

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,730
So we actually don't see the number nine in here explicitly.

104
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,380
So therefore what we actually want to do is go from 1 through 10.

105
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,600
And now you can see there's one two three four five six seven eight nine elements in this array and

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,180
that's kind of correspond now to the individual integers that I specified above.

107
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,090
So the first bin is going to go from one to two and then a second bin is two to three and so on.

108
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,280
Up until nine to 10.

109
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,050
So now what I'm gonna do is make a plot of these outputs.

110
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:31,800
So let's say P L T dot bar hist data one by hist data zero.

111
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:39,990
Let's see and then I will just copy and paste some of this stuff here and we get an error.

112
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,260
Why do we get an error.

113
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,130
This says something about the shape.

114
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:53,070
So the problem is that the bins on the x axis have one number larger than the number of bins for the

115
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,560
y axis plotting.

116
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:00,630
And again that's because these numbers here do not correspond to the centers of the bins they correspond

117
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,710
to the bin boundaries.

118
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:08,040
So the first bin here goes from one to two and then the second bin goes from two to three and three

119
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,620
to four and so on.

120
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:17,190
So therefore the way to plot this is to write that we are going to use just the first elements up to

121
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,890
minus one.

122
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,240
Okay.

123
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,490
And now finally after all this time we get a histogram that looks like what you would expect.

124
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,670
So you see the values here go from 1 through 9 and the accounts here correspond to the accounts that

125
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,850
I specified here.

126
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,110
I hope that all makes sense.

127
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,130
If it's still a little confusing enough it's not totally clear then don't worry I'm going to be talking

128
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:47,130
quite a bit more about creating histogram over the next several videos so you'll get quite a bit more

129
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,670
practice.

130
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:55,920
Well I'd like to do now is convert this histogram into a probability density and to do that I think

131
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,860
I will actually just comment that this code because I don't we don't need it right now okay.

132
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,110
And then rather than just getting hissed data I'm going to write to outputs.

133
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm going to request two outputs from the histogram function.

134
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,590
Now notice that this is why comma X and not X come a Y.

135
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,550
And that's because the first output from the histogram is the counts which is the y axis values here.

136
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:31,640
So let's see then this will need to change to X and this will need to change to Y.

137
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,490
And I'm just gonna run this again just to make sure I haven't made any silly typos.

138
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,860
Okay so to convert this to probability what we want to do is make sure that all of the values on the

139
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:51,170
y axis for all of these bins will sum up to 1 and the way to do that is to say that Y equals Actually

140
00:10:51,170 --> 00:11:01,730
maybe I'll make this a new variable Y P for probability equals y divided by num piled up some of Y.

141
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:11,540
So now I'm going to change Y to Y P and you'll notice that the X X or the y axis values have now changed.

142
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,240
But the legend is now incorrect.

143
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:20,960
So this is going to say I'll write this as proportion and let's see I think it would also be nice to

144
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,790
show that all of the numbers here.

145
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:32,980
So I'm gonna change the x stick labels so P L T that X ticks equals our is set to numb pi to a range.

146
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,740
I want to go from 1 to 9.

147
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,060
Okay.

148
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,560
So I think this looks pretty good.

149
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:45,590
So now we have our plot of proportion which is also probability but again I just say this again as a

150
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:51,890
quick reminder the difference between proportion and probability is that this value here means that

151
00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:01,010
literally 25 percent of all the numbers in here are have a value of 2 and probability means that if

152
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:08,120
I gave you this dataset and you were to pick one of these numbers at random from this entire set you

153
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,720
would have a 25 percent probability a 25 percent chance of randomly getting the number two.

154
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,080
All right.

155
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,380
So there is one more thing that I want to show you one more way of plotting and that is to convert this

156
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,350
to a maximum value of one that's sometimes called normalizing.

157
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,350
So now instead of dividing by the sum we are going to divide by the maximum.

158
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,680
And now we also have to change this because this should say proportion and I think I'll just specify

159
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,250
that this is Norm for normalized.

160
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,810
So this is not a probability distribution and you know that because I told you that a probability distribution

161
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,260
has to sum to exactly 1.

162
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,020
Now the sum of all these numbers is obviously greater than 1 the largest value is 1.

163
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:06,170
So this is a normalized proportion plot and this is often a useful normalization for example if you

164
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,260
are comparing across different datasets and you might norm all the data sets to a maximum value of 1

165
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,880
which facilitates averaging across them.

166
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,440
I hope you found this video insightful.

167
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,070
I talked about histogram as probabilities and proportions and I showed you how to create all these things

168
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,650
in Python which as you saw is actually a little bit trickier than you might initially expect.

169
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,840
Now don't go away.

170
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,940
Don't go too far in the next video.

171
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,400
There's going to be the exercise associated with this video.

172
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,550
It's going to be really really interesting.

173
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,730
I'm already excited to make the video.
