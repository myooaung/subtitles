00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.130
It's that time again.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.000
Time for another bug hunt.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.430
So if you haven't already you should go through this code.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.230
Each cell at a time look for coding errors so Python mistakes.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.530
And you also have to be mindful of math errors or formula errors so something that might be mistyped

6
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.790
and incorrect but still not technically a programming mistake per say.

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.130
All right.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.990
So I'm gonna start going through this.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.090
It looks like we already have the known pi and map plot lib modules imported which is pretty handy.

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.770
And now let's see what's going on here.

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.250
Make a galleon.

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.520
All right.

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.810
So I'm just gonna run this cell okay.

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.090
So there's no coding errors or warning messages.

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.530
So that's pretty nice.

16
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.700
But you can see that this thing is definitely not a galaxy and this doesn't look like a gaussian.

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.220
In fact this looks like an extremely happy smile.

18
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.160
So maybe you want to modify this codes that you put two eyes up here or maybe you're in a particularly

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.030
bad mood today.

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.400
So you want to figure out how to turn this thing upside down so it's making a frowning face anyway.

21
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.620
So I think there's something wrong with the formula.

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.310
So let's see the formula for a gaussian was e to the minus X squared plus Y.

23
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.910
Aha.

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.640
Here's the problem right here.

25
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.650
You can see with these parentheses we are first adding y to X squared and then squaring all of that

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.090
stuff.

27
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.170
So these parentheses or this in parentheses needs to move out here so that the Y gets squared.

28
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.800
All right.

29
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.020
That looks pretty good.

30
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.130
Draw a circle using mesh grid.

31
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.940
Let's see.

32
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.170
So I'm actually already going to look at this formulas.

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.500
The formula looks right.

34
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.640
X squared plus Y squared minus r squared.

35
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.820
So that seems legit.

36
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.980
Oh and we get an error.

37
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.890
Not enough values to unpack expected two inputs.

38
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.640
Got one input in the mesh grid function.

39
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.930
Okay.

40
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.050
So the mesh grid function always requires at least two inputs.

41
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.880
You can't provide one input.

42
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.610
Now it seems like it should be just one input because we're gonna have x and y be symmetric.

43
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.210
But you still need to have X comma x.

44
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.610
Okay.

45
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.460
So now let's try.

46
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.780
Okay.

47
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.630
So here there's nothing particularly wrong here but we have to look at these instructions here this

48
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.110
comment and say that we're trying to draw a circle here you can see the formula for a circle.

49
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.200
I have a feeling that although this isn't technically incorrect is probably not what the intended outcome

50
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.030
is.

51
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:52.980
I think the intended outcome is a contour like this where we get actually a circle because previously

52
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.770
that looked a bit more like a galaxy and then a circle.

53
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.910
And then I will also make that I mean this doesn't look like a circle either it looks like an ellipse

54
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.520
so let's set the current axis the aspect ratio to be equal.

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.570
And now this looks like a circle.

56
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.480
All right let's move on to the next problem.

57
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.860
Let's see.

58
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.080
We don't really get a whole lot of commas here but looking through this code a bit it looks like we

59
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.900
are trying to create an eclipse.

60
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.120
So you see X squared over a squared plus Y squared over B square that's basically the formula for an

61
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.930
ellipse.

62
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.030
And now I also see the title it says ellipse centered at.

63
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.890
Okay.

64
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.580
So I'm just gonna run this and see what happens.

65
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.650
So uh we get it looks like the ellipse is all the way out here you can see in the corners just barely.

66
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.490
So the center of the ellipse should be at to come a minus three.

67
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.170
I think there is something wrong here.

68
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.720
There's clearly no coding errors no explicit Python programming errors because we don't get any error

69
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.590
messages here.

70
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.750
Let's have another look at this formula.

71
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.170
So that was it X squared over a squared plus Y squared over B's core.

72
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.630
You know what.

73
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.540
We're missing the pesky minus one super important.

74
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.910
All right.

75
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.010
So now this is looking a bit better.

76
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.380
We see an ellipse centered at x y equals two minus three.

77
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.380
So huh.

78
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.920
Mm hmm.

79
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.650
Okay.

80
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.450
So the ellipse actually should be centered here.

81
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.740
Shouldn't it be.

82
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.000
OK.

83
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.330
So looking at this formula again you can see that we are not shifting the x and y matrices.

84
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:43.030
So it should be X minus H and then this has to be Y Y minus K Okay so that looks pretty good.

85
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.650
The last thing that I'm going to do.

86
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.680
Which isn't necessary it doesn't say anywhere in the instructions but I think it's nice to plot a dot

87
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.970
at the center here.

88
00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:02.890
I'm gonna write P L T dot plot and then h comma K and let's make this a green dot all right.

89
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.540
Looking good.

90
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.550
Now the next cell is actually the last one.

91
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.130
So this isn't a particularly long bug hunt.

92
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.590
Let's see so clearly we are trying to create a hyperbole.

93
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.000
Not an x.

94
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.000
I don't know what's wrong with X it seems like a pretty good letter to me.

95
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.500
Okay so but this looks more like an X than a hyper blob and you know based on what I figured out was

96
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.180
the problem here I'm already going to guess that this is an issue.

97
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.250
So this is supposed to be minus one over here and now that looks better.

98
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.790
So overall this was a successful and enjoyable and also educational bug hunt.

99
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.350
I hope you enjoyed it as well.
