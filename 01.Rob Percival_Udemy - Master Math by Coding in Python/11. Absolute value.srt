00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:08,230
The goal of this video is to discuss the absolute value of a number.
1

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,760
I'm going to give you a definition and show you how to interpret the absolute value of a number.
2

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,760
And of course we will switch to Python and you'll see how to compute the absolute value of a number
3

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,820
in Python. And then also in this video I'm going to review a little bit of the syntax a little bit of
4

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,320
the material for printing out latex
5

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,480
code to make nice looking formulas. And in the exercise at the end of this video you will get a chance
6

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:43,130
to improve your programming skills in particular with regards to for loops and if statements.
7

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,460
All right.
8

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,410
So let's begin.
9

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,710
So I'm going to start by giving you what I consider to be a bad explanation of what the absolute value
10

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,880
of a number means.
11

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,940
And then I'll give you a good explanation.
12

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,550
So I would say a bad explanation is that the absolute value of a number means to strip off the negative
13

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,720
sign of that number.
14

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,110
So if the number is a negative number then you just remove the negative sign and that gives you the
15

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,290
absolute value.
16

17
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,710
Now that kind of is true a little bit it's not a great definition.
17

18
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:21,860
It is an algorithm for computing the absolute value but I think a better way to understand the absolute
18

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:28,820
value is to think of the absolute value as the distance from a number to the origin of the number line.
19

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,440
So let me show you what I mean by that.
20

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,540
So here is the number line, you can see there's zero in the middle,
21

22
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,450
negative numbers off to left, and positive numbers
22

23
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,200
off to the right. Now,
23

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,630
this number here is two units away from the origin,
24

25
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,070
away from zero.
25

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,260
And so therefore the distance is two.
26

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,270
So the absolute value of this number is two and this number here it's off to the left.
27

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,560
However it is five units away from zero.
28

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,830
So this distance is five units.
29

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,710
So therefore the absolute value of minus five is five.
30

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,950
Now if you are thinking that this explanation is entirely consistent with what I said is the bad explanation
31

32
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,810
of absolute value then you're correct.
32

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,550
In this case however when you get to learning about complex numbers in mathematics then you will learn
33

34
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,420
that there is also an absolute value of a complex number, and for a complex number that's like a two
34

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,170
dimensional number.
35

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,170
This is these real numbers, or one dimensional numbers.
36

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,830
When you start learning about complex numbers on a plane then the definition of absolute value as distance
37

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,360
to zero makes sense.
38

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,240
Whereas what I consider the bad definition of just stripping off the negative sign actually doesn't
39

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,940
make any sense.
40

41
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:56,350
OK so that aside, I want to show you now a little bit of notation for indicating the absolute value. It's
41

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,590
either abs for absolute value, and then in parentheses will be the number that you're taking the absolute
42

43
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:10,960
value of. Or you will also see it written out with these vertical lines around the number or around the
43

44
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,920
variable.
44

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,310
So this indicates the absolute value of variable x.
45

46
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:23,290
This notation is also pretty convenient because that is exactly how the function in Python looks.
46

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:32,490
So let's switch to Python and I'll show you this so let's start by just saying abs of four.
47

48
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,030
How about that.
48

49
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,670
So the absolute value of four is four and the absolute value of minus four is also four.
49

50
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,250
Not surprising.
50

51
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,010
Now this also works with variables.
51

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,450
I can say A equals minus four.
52

53
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,650
And now I can say abs of four.
53

54
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,110
And that's also going to be four.
54

55
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:00,070
You can also print or save this as a variable so B equals the absolute value of four.
55

56
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,140
And now I can print out a or I can print out b and this might be new syntax.
56

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,660
I don't believe I've shown this before; but you can print out two variables at the same time like this
57

58
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:20,370
with the notation a comma B and that's going to give us this output minus four and that corresponds
58

59
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,550
to the variable a and plus four which corresponds to the variable B.
59

60
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:25,980
All right.
60

61
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,760
So I want to do a little bit of a review of printing out with latex. So let's set some variable let's
61

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,190
call it X equals minus about four point three.
62

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:45,930
So now what I'd like to do is print out that the absolute value of variable x is four point three or
63

64
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:54,360
whatever you know whatever we happen to set X equal to. So I'm going to write display and then math.
64

65
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,710
Now here is where I put inside these single quotes.
65

66
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:05,330
This is where I put the latex code. So the latex code for those single vertical lines that I showed in
66

67
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,330
the slides is called the pipe symbol in Unix.
67

68
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,890
It's a vertical line. On my keyboard,
68

69
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,090
I have to press down shift and then there's the key on top of the enter key.
69

70
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,770
So on your keyboard it might be located somewhere else but you should be able to find something that
70

71
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,210
looks like this.
71

72
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,670
So this is gonna be X here.
72

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,820
So this is the absolute value of X equals X.
73

74
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,810
Now as I mentioned in previous videos when I'm writing out latex code I like to first write out what
74

75
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:42,170
I want the code to look like or put in this kind of place holders before I finish writing all of the
75

76
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,000
code.
76

77
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,660
So that's generally what it's going to look like except of course X is going to be replaced with whatever
77

78
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,140
we specify X to be here.
78

79
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,220
So this has to be percent G equals percent G.
79

80
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,340
And now here I type percent.
80

81
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:04,010
And then in parentheses the two items -- the two variables that are going to replace this percent G and
81

82
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,820
then this percent G.
82

83
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:13,490
So the first place holder is X and then the next one is the absolute value of X.
83

84
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:13,820
Okay.
84

85
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,550
So now I'm going to press control enter and run this.
85

86
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,760
But we get an error and it says name math is not defined.
86

87
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,090
Now I hope that you caught this before I actually ran this code and got an error. You might remember
87

88
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:35,990
that the display and the math functions are not actually built into the default Python workspace.
88

89
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:44,210
So instead we need to import these two functions and that comes from...
89

90
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,320
So we say from IPython
90

91
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,360
and now I'm also going to teach you something that might be new to you.
91

92
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,420
So there is something called tab completion.
92

93
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,010
So let's say you don't remember exactly what this was called here you knew it was Ipython.
93

94
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:06,570
dot something. You can actually type the tab key and that's going to show you all the possibilities
94

95
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,140
for what you can possibly complete here.
95

96
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,060
So this was called Ipython display.
96

97
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:22,050
So from Ipython dot display we want to import display and math and I believe that that is the correct
97

98
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,890
syntax.
98

99
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,630
So let's try it again.
99

100
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:24,940
Yep.
100

101
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,380
And now we get this really nice printed out message, it says the absolute value of minus four point three
101

102
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,430
is four point three.
102

103
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,730
So now it's good to play around and test a few things. We can say the absolute value of seven
103

104
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,630
is seven.
104

105
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,830
And so this seems to work well. Now it's time for the exercise.
105

106
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,840
This is your chance to show off and improve your python coding skills.
106

107
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,050
So what you want to do here is write a little bit of Python code that will print the absolute value
107

108
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:06,860
of each number from a set of numbers, but only print anything only print the absolute value if the number
108

109
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,600
is either less than minus five or if it's greater than two.
109

110
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:20,640
So here is the set of numbers: minus four six minus one 43 minus 18 two and zero.
110

111
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,950
So you have to program in this list of numbers into Python, loop through each one of these numbers individually
111

112
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,370
or loop through the set and for each number you have to print out one of two messages.
112

113
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:41,870
Either you print out that that number was not tested, or you print out that the absolute value of that
113

114
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,920
number is whatever the absolute value is.
114

115
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,080
So the number is not tested if it's between minus five and two.
115

116
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,380
All right.
116

117
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,220
So good luck.
117

118
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,060
Have fun.
118

119
00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:00,080
Now is your opportunity to pause the video and then I'm going to now switch to Python and show you how
119

120
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,720
I've completed this code.
120

121
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,350
So I'm going to get started by creating this list of numbers.
121

122
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:19,960
Let's just call this numbers and I'll say minus 4 6 and then minus 1 43 minus 18 2 and 0.
122

123
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:20,970
OK.
123

124
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,620
So now we need a for loop.
124

125
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:30,870
We are going to... I'm going to even make some comments here. for loop over the numbers.
125

126
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:38,530
So let's say for... now we can call this looping variable whatever you want. I'll call it numi. num for
126

127
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,730
numbers and I for the i-th index, or just for indexing in general.
127

128
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:52,090
So for I in numbers because this is the set that we want to loop over, so now each iteration inside this
128

129
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,350
for loop numi -- this variable numi -- will take the value of minus four.
129

130
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,990
And then the second iteration 6 the next iteration minus 1 and so on.
130

131
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,060
OK.
131

132
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:11,050
So now we need to print a message but we print that message only if the number is less than minus 5
132

133
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,750
or if it's greater than 2.
133

134
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:22,390
Let's say if I is less than minus five or if the number is I greater than 2 and just keep in mind you
134

135
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,310
don't actually write if here again.
135

136
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,350
So it's not like this.
136

137
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,600
You don't have to do this.
137

138
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,850
You only need one if here in the beginning.
138

139
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:41,800
So if this is the case then we print out that the absolute value of, then it's going to be the
139

140
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,740
number, is the number.
140

141
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,100
Okay.
141

142
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,290
And I'm going to replace this with percent g this one with percent G.
142

143
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,020
And now I have to indicate what these percentages get replaced by... this was I.
143

144
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,870
I'm sorry.
144

145
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,510
No, I mean numi and then absolute value of numi.
145

146
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:01,810
All right.
146

147
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:09,340
So this code is not yet finished however it's generally good practice when programming to test your
147

148
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,570
code before writing too much code.
148

149
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,550
And that's because you want to catch errors as early as possible.
149

150
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,470
So here you go.
150

151
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,640
I've already run into an error and says name I is undefined.
151

152
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:21,910
OK.
152

153
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,800
So that was actually a pretty stupid mistake.
153

154
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
This should be numi.
154

155
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,980
and this should also be numi.
155

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,240
I wonder if you caught this error before I did ;)
156

157
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,270
Let's try it again.
157

158
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,560
All right.
158

159
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:41,020
So we get printed out the absolute value of six is six forty three and 18... so far so good.
159

160
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:50,440
Now we need another case to handle what happens when the number is between minus five and plus two.
160

161
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,880
So then we want a printout on the screen I think I showed that the number was not tested.
161

162
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,800
So it was not tested.
162

163
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,370
Now you could write it out like this and maybe you also wrote this out in later code like this.
163

164
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:13,090
It's totally fine. The way that I'm going to do this here is by converting this number, so I'm going to say
164

165
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,670
str numi.
165

166
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,340
And then plus.
166

167
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,450
So I'm going to take this number here at each iteration in the loop, convert it from a number into a
167

168
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:29,620
string, and then I'm using the plus sign, not for addition, but for concatenation for string concatenation
168

169
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,500
okay.
169

170
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,300
Let's run this and make sure that works.
170

171
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,340
All right.
171

172
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,540
Minus four is not tested minus one 2 and zero.
172

173
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,690
Not tested.
173

174
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,710
All right.
174

175
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,150
So that is pretty good.
175

176
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:48,050
Now I realize that in this code and this code this line of code and this line of code, I have showed
176

177
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:55,370
you three different ways of printing out information into the python display.
177

178
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:03,800
Now normally I would recommend keeping the display options consistent, that helps you keep better track
178

179
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,630
of your code; it makes for cleaner code.
179

180
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:14,490
But in this case I want to remind you of all the different options for printing out information. In this
180

181
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:14,970
video
181

182
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:21,360
I taught you (or perhaps reminded you) of the definition of absolute value and how to compute the absolute
182

183
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,090
value.
183

184
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:29,430
And you saw computing the absolute value in python and I hope you also got a nice refresher on creating
184

185
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,160
for loops and writing if else statements.
185

186
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,880
See you in the next video.
