1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:11,410
Well we certainly can't have an entire section on trigonometry without talking about the Pythagorean

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:11,890
theorem.

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,670
So that is the purpose of this video.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,960
It's going to be a quick review of the Pythagorean theorem.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,660
You'll get to see the Pythagorean theorem implemented in Python and we will draw triangles from you

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,270
know kind of from.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:33,220
From the ground up from first principles in Python and the exercise you will also get to see an application

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:40,000
of the Pythagorean theorem to these crazy complex numbers that keep popping up further into mathematics

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,380
you get.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,670
OK.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,290
So what is the Pythagorean theorem.

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:52,420
So if we start from a right triangle and a right triangle means that one of the angles is exactly 90

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,200
degrees.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,160
So that's typically indicated with this little box here.

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:03,130
So if you have a triangle with one angle being equal to 90 degrees then there is a relationship between

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,830
the length of this line the length of this line and the length of this line.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
And that relationship is that C squared.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,300
So the length of C Square this is also called the hypotenuse of the triangle.

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,630
So C squared equals a squared plus B squared.

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,060
And of course that means if you want to solve for C if you want to know what is the length of this line

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,620
here this hypotenuse then you have to take the square root of a squared plus B squared.

22
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,560
Okay.

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:39,190
And so what I'd like to do now in Python is basically draw this triangle and these letters here so we're

24
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,620
going to use and text in Python and then determine the length of C..

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,090
All right.

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,570
So let's get started.

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,440
So I'm going to define a and b.

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,210
So how about a equals eight and b equals four.

29
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,310
Actually no I think I'll start off with three and four because there's a couple of these famous Pythagorean

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,680
triplets and three and four is one of them.

31
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,640
So a equals three and b equals four.

32
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,150
Then I know that C is going to be equal to five.

33
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,330
I don't have to write that down in fact I'm going to compute it.

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:20,920
So let's see C equals the square root of a squared plus b squared and we can already have a look and

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,320
see what C is so C is five.

36
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,660
That's one of these Pythagorean triplets.

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,040
There are several of them.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,280
All right.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,900
So what I'd like to do now is start drawing the triangles or draw the triangle.

40
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,300
Let's see.

41
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,540
So we have a couple of things that we need to draw.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,300
And I think I'm going to start by drawing the base here.

43
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,680
So drawing this line that's flat along the x axis.

44
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:52,090
Now drawing this triangle is going to be easier if we consider that the right angle point of the triangle

45
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,790
is at the origin of the graph.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,820
So zero zero.

47
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,120
So let's say P L teed up plots.

48
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:06,010
So we want a line that's going to go from the origin meaning X or sorry 0 on the x axis and 0 on the

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,490
y axis.

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,410
Now where does it end.

51
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:16,690
Well on the x axis it ends at a that's the distance along the x axis and then on the y axis that line

52
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,840
just ends at zero.

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,230
So let's see and I'll make this a little bit of a thicker line.

54
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,550
So in line with how about two.

55
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:25,800
Okay.

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:35,260
So here we get a straight line starts at the origin and it goes to three which is the point A.

57
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,500
Oh right.

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,090
So then I think next I'll draw this vertical line here.

59
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:49,680
So that is going to be a line that goes also from zero on the x and y axes.

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,350
And then on the x axis it basically stays at zero.

61
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,780
We don't travel on the x axis at all.

62
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,740
And on the y axis we go up to be okay.

63
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,790
So this is starting to get somewhere.

64
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,790
And now the last leg of this triangle is the hypotenuse.

65
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,180
So let's see that's going to be P L teed up plot.

66
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,560
So where does it start from.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,780
So let's say that it starts from here Well you could start it from here and end here or you could start

68
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,070
from here and end here.

69
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,230
But I'm going to start it from this point here.

70
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,550
So that is the point x equals zero and Y equals B.

71
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:35,280
So we need zero comma B and then it ends at X equals three or a more generally and Y equals zero.

72
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,970
So and this should also be a black line website.

73
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,160
I mess this up.

74
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,450
I hope that you caught this mistake before I did so in fact that the line on the x axis goes from zero

75
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,010
to a.

76
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,630
And on the y axis it goes from B to zero.

77
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,330
That looks much better.

78
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,610
Okay.

79
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,570
So here is our triangle.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,250
Now what I'd like to do is draw this little box here to indicate that this is a right angle.

81
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,430
So let's draw that line.

82
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,880
So I'm going to start by drawing this line that comes up here.

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,320
So it has to be a straight line.

84
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,260
So it means on the x axis is going to stay the same.

85
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,050
And on the y axis it's going to move from zero to some point here.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,470
So this is a little bit arbitrary but I'm just basing this on visual inspection.

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,440
So how about let's try on the x axis.

88
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,050
We're going to stay at point three and then on the y axis.

89
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:39,230
We're gonna go from zero to point three and then I'll also make this a slightly thinner line.

90
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,150
Let's see how that looks.

91
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,760
All right.

92
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,180
So that looks pretty good.

93
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,000
Now we need that other line that goes across this way this horizontal line so that is going to have

94
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,870
x axis coordinates that go from zero to point three and then on the y axis.

95
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,430
It doesn't change it stays at point three.

96
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,590
And let's make sure this is also a black line.

97
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,230
All right.

98
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,970
So this is starting to look good.

99
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,820
I want to make this triangle look a little bit nicer before adding the text to these three sides and

100
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,010
in particular you can see that this box here is supposed to be a square.

101
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,290
This should be a perfect square and you can see that because all these numbers here to create these

102
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,450
sides these are all zeros in point three.

103
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:29,790
So that means that this distance here is the same as this distance here in terms of coordinates.

104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,860
But these two axes are are not the same.

105
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,560
So we need to make these axes be the same.

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,100
So let's start by saying peeled to the axis square.

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,600
All right.

108
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,560
This is looking a little bit better now.

109
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,090
You can see the axis limits are the same.

110
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,640
So it goes from zero to four and zero to four.

111
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,840
But how do we know what is the right axis limits here.

112
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,540
Well they should be based on a and b.

113
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,870
So I'm going to change the axis limits to make sure that they're always going to work well even when

114
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,170
we change the sizes of or the lengths of the two legs a and b and so to do that.

115
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:15,230
I'm going to create a new variable called X limb and let's set this to be the maximum of a and b.

116
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:22,750
So whatever is the larger of a and b and then maybe we add a little bit as a buffer so then I write

117
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,760
P L T dot axis.

118
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,790
So now I want the x axis to start not exactly at zero but I like colors a little bit of space here.

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,780
So I'm gonna say that the x axis should always start at minus point five and it should end at X limb.

120
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,180
And then this is actually M plus point five.

121
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,410
All right.

122
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,420
I mean that the larger of a or b plus point five.

123
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:52,150
So that also gives us a little bit of space up on the top or over here on the right.

124
00:07:52,150 --> 00:08:00,090
So this for the x axis and then the y axis limits are exactly the same.

125
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,940
Okay so that looks pretty good.

126
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,260
And now we don't even need this axis here this bounding box I'm just going to turn the Axis off.

127
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,530
All right.

128
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,170
This is starting to look good.

129
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,800
However I think our triangle looks a little bit lonely a little bit sad.

130
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,990
So he needs a couple of friends actually.

131
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,350
He needs three friends and those are going to be the sizes the lengths of these three sides.

132
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,390
OK.

133
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,800
So now let's add that.

134
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,930
I'll do that below here.

135
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,450
So I want to use text.

136
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,770
So you remember I introduced you to drawing text in figures.

137
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,010
I don't remember which video it was but it was a bit earlier in the course.

138
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:49,300
So as a quick review to use P.L. you got text you basically provide three inputs the x coordinate the

139
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,810
y coordinate and a string.

140
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,790
So what are these three coordinates.

141
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,110
Let's start with the text here.

142
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:02,140
So I want this to say A equals and then the size of a cell for this triangle it's gonna be a equals

143
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,930
three.

144
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,700
So where should we draw that text.

145
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:13,390
Well I'm going to say we start at the x axis coordinate a divided by three and the y axis coordinate.

146
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:23,680
Of point two five and then the text is going to say A equals and then I'm going to say plus string a

147
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:25,890
okay.

148
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:33,140
Now this looks a little bit small so I'm going to make this slightly larger so I'm gonna say font size

149
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,720
equals let's try 15.

150
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,630
Okay so that looks pretty good.

151
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,440
And you know I kind of just came up with these numbers by poking around a little bit a little bit of

152
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,190
trial and error.

153
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,140
So I kind of like the a to be on the inside of the triangle.

154
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,770
You could also specify it to be on the outside of the triangle if you like.

155
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,810
Maybe something like that looks good.

156
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,090
Actually maybe I prefer that.

157
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,410
Maybe that's better than having it in the Triangle.

158
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,120
All right let's keep it like that.

159
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,010
And now for B.

160
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,030
So that's gonna be on this side and I will put that on the inside of the triangle.

161
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:13,780
So let's say plot text and I'm gonna have it start at x axis coordinate of point 1.

162
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,480
So it's gonna be around here it's gonna start around here and then the B corner of the y coordinate

163
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:27,150
should say it's gonna be b divided by three and then this tax is going to be b equals string.

164
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,380
Now remember here I'm using a plus sign for string concatenation which is different from how the plus

165
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,910
sign is being used here.

166
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,290
Okay.

167
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,880
And then let's also make sure this one is a nice healthy fonts that we get.

168
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,630
B equals 4.

169
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,180
And then of course you know where this is going.

170
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,900
We need to add a C so how can we figure out where to put the text for C.

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,140
Well I'd like to have c b around here.

172
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,360
So here corresponds to half of the way across the hypotenuse.

173
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,420
So what is this halfway point on the hypotenuse.

174
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,720
Well it's actually just a divided by 3.

175
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,510
Sorry divided by two and b divided by two.

176
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,200
So that's exactly the middle.

177
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,960
So let's try that.

178
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:23,090
Let's say a divided by 2 be divided by 2 and then the text is C equals string C and then font size equals

179
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,980
15.

180
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,650
Okay.

181
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,170
So this is looking pretty good except the C is really just almost touching the hypotenuse.

182
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm actually going to add a little bit of an offset point one like this.

183
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,910
All right.

184
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,330
I think this looks really nice and let's test this.

185
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,750
I'm going to ads and change these numbers a bit.

186
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,760
What if a is eight and B is three and then what is the length of C there.

187
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,220
Mm hmm.

188
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,600
Okay.

189
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,780
It's pretty interesting.

190
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,120
So we get this kind of longish triangle and c ends up being eight point five.

191
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,580
That s also seems pretty plausible that the length of this line is just a little bit longer than the

192
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,340
length of this line for the exercise.

193
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:13,540
I would like to revisit the complex numbers that you learned about in the algebra 2 section complex

194
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,900
numbers also show up in trigonometry or I should say there are many applications of trigonometry to

195
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:26,740
complex numbers in physics in linear algebra in signal processing and so on.

196
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,260
So you've learned that there are two interesting features that we can extract out of a complex number

197
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:39,730
and that is the length of this line which is the distance to the origin and this angle here of this

198
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,660
line with respect to the positive real axis.

199
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,650
So how do we extract those.

200
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,590
Well we can use trigonometry to get these values.

201
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,260
In particular we can use the Pythagorean theorem to get the length of this line.

202
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,760
So how does that work.

203
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,180
Well that works by thinking about drawing some you know thinking about drawing an imaginary line down

204
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,160
here and then look what we have.

205
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,640
We have exactly a right triangle.

206
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,740
This is a right angle here.

207
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,170
And so this is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.

208
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:18,880
So that means that to compute the length of Z which is also called the absolute value of the complex

209
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,110
number we say that the length of that number squared equals the real part squared plus the imaginary

210
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,440
part squared.

211
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,460
And here you have to be careful that you're not squaring eye because you're not squaring the imaginary

212
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,580
number as well you're only squaring the distance along the imaginary axis.

213
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,550
And that is three not three eyes.

214
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:48,530
So two squared plus three squared or more generally the magnitude or the length of the complex number

215
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,080
of squared is the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared.

216
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,850
And then we have this angle here.

217
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:04,150
Let's call that K and we can compute K by considering that the tangent of that angle K is equal to the

218
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,130
imaginary part.

219
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,780
So the opposite divided by the adjacent.

220
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,370
So that is the imaginary part divided by the real part.

221
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,950
So in this particular case for this number the tangent of K equals 3 divided by 2.

222
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:24,790
So then if you want the angle of K in radians then you have to invert tangent and then you take the

223
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
arc tangent or the inverse tangent of three divided by two.

224
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,410
Okay.

225
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:35,740
And so this is basically the goal of this exercise to implement these two ideas these two formulas in

226
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,790
python in order to obtain the length of Z which is also called the magnitude or the absolute value of

227
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:50,980
this complex number and to get the angle K which is the arc tangent or the inverse tangent of the imaginary

228
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,650
part divided by the real part.

229
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:53,880
Okay.

230
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,220
So now you can switch to Python and have a go at this.

231
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,220
It shouldn't take you too long hopefully.

232
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:07,580
Now I'm going to switch to Python and you can see what I do here so let's start by creating a complex

233
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,080
numbers.

234
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,870
All right Z equals num piled complex.

235
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,620
And how about you know let's go for three and four because then I know based on what we did up here

236
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:26,220
that the length of this line or the magnitude of the complex number is going to be five.

237
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:32,600
So let's say that mag and I'm going to call this variable mag 1 and you will see why I call it one in

238
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,740
a moment.

239
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:42,040
So to compute the length of Z or the magnitude said we take the square root of the real part squared.

240
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:49,910
So real part of said squared plus the imaginary part of said also squared.

241
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,670
And now I want to compute this a different way.

242
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,350
So I already told you in the section on algebra 2 that you can compute the magnitude of a complex number

243
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:06,230
or the length the distance of the complex number away from the origin using this function a B.S. for

244
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,580
absolute value.

245
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,900
So we should actually see that both these numbers end up being the same.

246
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:20,580
So I'm going to print out mag 1 and mag 2 and sure enough they are both equal to 5.

247
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,400
Okay.

248
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,990
And then we need to extract the angles.

249
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,330
I'm also gonna call that Ang 1.

250
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:36,160
So now the function in num PI for computing the arc tangent or the inverse tangent is arc ten two.

251
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:44,290
And then we have to input the imaginary part of said and then the real part of Z.

252
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,810
And again I'm going to compare this to a built in function to extract the angle of a complex number

253
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,570
and that's just an P that angle.

254
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,710
So now I'm gonna print out both these make sure they look the same.

255
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,770
And not surprisingly they do.

256
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,290
Now of course in general when you're working with complex numbers in practice it's more convenient to

257
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,920
use a B.S. and angle.

258
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,170
But that said it's also interesting to see that you get the same number when implementing the Pythagorean

259
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:24,410
theorem like this so in this video you got a reminder about the Pythagorean theorem you gain some experience

260
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,390
in drawing in python in particular drawing really from the ground up.

261
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,930
So just drawing all the individual lines that make up a triangle.

262
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,180
And of course you could extrapolate this to any other shape that you want to draw.

263
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,070
And finally you got to see an application of the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry more generally

264
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,290
to working with complex numbers and extracting information from complex numbers.
