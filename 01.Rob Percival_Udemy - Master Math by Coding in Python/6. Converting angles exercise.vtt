00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.690
This video is the exercise that goes along with the previous video on converting between radians and

2
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.620
degrees.

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.300
So it would behoove you to go through that video before working through this exercise.

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.640
All right.

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.160
So the point of this exercise is to create a function in Python.

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.160
I called my function angle convert plot and what this function will do is ask for two inputs from the

7
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.030
user.

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:39.320
The angle to convert and the unit that was input it here and then what it will do is generate a plot

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.160
that looks like this this plot should show two vectors.

10
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.710
One is the vector with the angle that it was input in here.

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.140
So in this case I input it pi over four and it showed me an angle at pi over four which is also 45 degrees.

12
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.730
And another factor here that goes along the x axis or this is like the cosine axis.

13
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.090
And this is an important vector because this shows the reference.

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.360
So this angle is 45 degrees relative to this line here.

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.600
All right.

16
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.190
And then obviously you're going to have to create this title which means that you will have to convert

17
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.890
between radians and degrees.

18
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.530
Now of course I could have also input in 45 degrees in here and then I would have written the word degree

19
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.460
here so you have to make your function flexible enough to be able to convert or I should say accept

20
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.730
input in degrees or in radians.

21
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.610
Now the other thing that you need to make sure that your function does is a little bit of error handling.

22
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.570
And that's because maybe the user the person using this function is not paying attention or maybe they're

23
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.460
trying to play some tricks on you.

24
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.270
So you have to test to make sure that the input is either Radian or degrees and if it isn't.

25
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.730
If the input is neither of these two options then you have to give an error message.

26
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.390
So for example here I wrote angled to to convert 45.

27
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.590
Which unit you input.

28
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.390
I just wrote a SDF here.

29
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.140
Now SDF is not a valid measurement for an angle at least as far as I am aware.

30
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.070
So I gave an error here it says value our unknown unit.

31
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:28.170
Now I haven't actually told you yet in this course how to go about doing error handling inside functions.

32
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.470
So if you are feeling a bit adventurous a bit ambitious and you would like to figure this out on your

33
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.800
own then.

34
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.410
Now is the chance to pause the video switch to Python before I show the hint and if you're getting stuck

35
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.920
or you want a little bit of a hint then there you go.

36
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.870
That is your hint for getting this error handling to work in this function.

37
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.190
All right.

38
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.750
So now is your chance to positive video.

39
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.690
Write some code in Python and when you're ready you can come back to the video and watch me solve the

40
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.570
rest of this problem here.

41
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.490
So let's get started by creating our function.

42
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.600
So Def angle convert plots.

43
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.510
Now we don't need any inputs into this function because that's what we are going to specify.

44
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.780
So I'm going to create the first section of this code which will be to get the inputs from the user.

45
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.160
Okay so let's see the angle we are going to input as the message would be what angle to convert and

46
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.480
then call this variable unit and let's say input.

47
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:48.770
Which unit Did you input and then we will make a suggestion to provide the answer in radians or degree

48
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.170
okay.

49
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.910
So before going too much further you know that I'm a huge fan of testing code piece wise.

50
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.620
So the first thing that I'm going to do is to print out the angle and the unit and now I just want to

51
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.010
test that this code works so far as is okay.

52
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.600
So let's write angle convert plot and which angle to convert.

53
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.040
So let's convert about 13 degrees and which unit did you specify.

54
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.850
I wrote.

55
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.140
Degrees.

56
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.430
Okay.

57
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.750
So so far not super interesting.

58
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.170
This just confirms that I haven't made any errors here.

59
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.330
Now this is gonna come back as a string you'll remember when I introduced you to this function input

60
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.420
that the output of input.

61
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.040
So what it returns is always going to be a string but we actually want a number we want the angle to

62
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.930
be a numeric representation.

63
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.050
So let's see what happens if I do this in float.

64
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.450
So now we get let's say 46 degrees and I input a degree.

65
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.760
Okay so now we get a number that's pretty good.

66
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.210
But you saw in the slides that we should also be able to input radians using pi.

67
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.130
So let's see what happens if I try to convert from PIs NDP let's just convert pi and this 0 0 warning

68
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.400
could not convert string to float.

69
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.860
Mm hmm.

70
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:22.830
Okay so here we already have a problem with this command here and the problem is that this is actually

71
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.560
a string this is five characters.

72
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.230
It's not a floating point number.

73
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.040
So there are a few different ways to solve this problem the way that I came up with to solve this is

74
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.450
by using the function eval.

75
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:45.180
And what if all we'll do is evaluate the code as if you are writing it down.

76
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.030
So for example if you would write let me insert a new cell down here so insert cell below.

77
00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:00.840
So if we would write eval whoops he fell and let's say I want to evaluate one plus two.

78
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.560
Now notice I wrote one plus two as a string.

79
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.080
But when I run this command eval when I run this code the answer that I get is three.

80
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:17.490
So evil is going to take this string and interpret it as if it was a python code.

81
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.660
Okay so let me get rid of that.

82
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.960
So now I'm going to evaluate whatever the input is so let's see if that works.

83
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.690
So end Peter pi and then radians okay and then we get pi as a number.

84
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.860
That's pretty cool.

85
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.650
And now we need to go back and make sure that this is still going to work for regular numbers.

86
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.860
So if I try to convert a number and I get back a number.

87
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.370
Huh.

88
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.190
All right.

89
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.420
That was pretty good.

90
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.060
All right.

91
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.690
So the next thing I want to do is run the conversion so the conversion basically means that we should

92
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:58.110
compute radians from angles if the input but our sorry radians from degrees if the input was degrees

93
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.790
or degrees from radians.

94
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.410
If the input was in radians.

95
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:09.750
Now the interesting thing to notice here is that these two words radiant and degree are actually purely

96
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.220
discriminated just by the first letter.

97
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.810
That means it doesn't actually matter what all these other letters are.

98
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.780
All we need to do is test whether the first letter is an R or a D.

99
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.310
So I'm going to write if unit index 0.

100
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.390
So just the first element in unit.

101
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.350
If that equals R then we are working with radians.

102
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.290
So now I'm going to create two new variables one is gonna be called RAD for radians not rad for radical.

103
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:46.290
And now we don't need to do any conversion because this is already the angle so the Radian already is

104
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:53.300
the angle but the degree has to be none pi red to degree.

105
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.670
So if the input is in radians then we convert from radians two degrees

106
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.970
likewise.

107
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:11.700
So l if so if the first character of unit is D then is basically exactly the opposite of this so we

108
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:18.750
can say that the degree is the angle that was inputted and the gradient is going to be num piled up

109
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:24.890
degree to radians of the input angle OK.

110
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:30.160
Now I haven't yet dealt with the error handling but again I've written some code and I want to test

111
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.830
that it makes sense.

112
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.380
I want to test that it works.

113
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.360
So now what I'm going to output is degree and read.

114
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.050
OK.

115
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.830
So run this self code again and then run this self code again and let's convert one hundred and eighty

116
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.670
degrees.

117
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.240
And that seems right.

118
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.620
So 180 degrees is pi radians.

119
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:58.440
And notice here I actually wrote degrees not degree which was the suggested input option.

120
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.320
OK let's try this again.

121
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:06.090
Let's go for pi divided by four.

122
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.860
And I'm just going to say radio and I'm like super excited about this.

123
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.320
Oh.

124
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.370
Mm hmm.

125
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.650
Now I get an error.

126
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.360
What is the problem here.

127
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:21.880
The problem here is that this is a capital R but here I'm only looking for a lower case are now there

128
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.130
are two ways that you can deal with this issue.

129
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:31.230
One is you can write if unit zero equals R or unit zero equals capital R.

130
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.600
And if you came up with this solution it's totally fine.

131
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.830
This is a great solution.

132
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:43.840
However there is an even slightly better solution which is to use a method on strings called lower and

133
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:51.530
lower is going to basically convert this string so the first letter into a lowercase letter.

134
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:57.730
So if this is capital R then this will be lower case r and if this is already lower case r then well

135
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.480
this doesn't do anything.

136
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.850
OK.

137
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.780
So I'm also going to write that here.

138
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.660
So dot lower now.

139
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:14.210
Let's run this code again so which angled to convert 43 degrees and I will say which input this is degree.

140
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:14.700
OK.

141
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.630
And then it still works.

142
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.560
Very nice.

143
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.490
Now we need the air.

144
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:24.170
So what happens if I write neither R nor D.

145
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.700
Now what we need to do here is basically raise an exception.

146
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.230
That's what the raises for us so we raise an error or an exception.

147
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.100
Now there are multiple kinds of errors and you can create your own error messages.

148
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:43.520
But I'm going to use the built in value area and we'll call this on known unit.

149
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:43.760
All right.

150
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.730
So so far this is looking pretty good.

151
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.670
What we have done is get the input of the angle and the unit.

152
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.020
We have done the conversion and now it's time for the plotting.

153
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.240
OK.

154
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.610
So let me get rid of this.

155
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.770
So let's make the graph.

156
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.500
I'll put it in.

157
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.430
Make the graph.

158
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.100
OK.

159
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.500
So I'm going to start by plotting the line that goes along the horizontal axis.

160
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:19.420
So the X range is going to be 0 to 1 and then the Y range is 0 to zero because it's flat across y and

161
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:26.940
I'll specify that the line with should be how about 2 and then I'm going to make the angle or align

162
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.840
with the angle that was specified here.

163
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:36.070
So that's going to be so the x component is going to be the cosine part of this angle and that needs

164
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.120
to be specified in radians if we're using cosine.

165
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:46.450
So num pied cosine of red and then the y component is zero.

166
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:53.620
That num pi that's sign of red and then also this can be a red line.

167
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.100
And let's also make this line even a little bit thicker.

168
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.400
How about three.

169
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:00.990
All right.

170
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.900
So there's still more to do with the plotting of course.

171
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.300
We need the title which is very important but I want to run this already just to make sure that it's

172
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.420
working so far.

173
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:11.720
Okay.

174
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.500
So which angle to convert.

175
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.940
How about 80 degrees.

176
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.220
That's almost a right angle.

177
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.140
And we specified degrees and then we see here's the reference line.

178
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.650
And here is our main vector here which is almost a right angle.

179
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:27.960
All right.

180
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.400
So we are getting there.

181
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.730
There's a couple of things that we still need to do.

182
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.280
One of them is to make this plot look a little bit nicer.

183
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.380
In particular it should be centered at zero not with zero all the way at the lower left corner here.

184
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:49.210
So I'm going to force the plot axis to go on the X range minus one to plus one.

185
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.470
And on the Y range minus one to plus one missing a comma there.

186
00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:02.570
And I will also specify that the axis should be square and then I think I'll also turn on a grid s grid.

187
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.320
Okay.

188
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.120
Let's see how this is looking.

189
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.650
How about seventy eight and that was degrees right.

190
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.870
Remember the order counts here the order is important here.

191
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:20.290
So we have to say make the axis square first and then set the axis the axis limits.

192
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.560
Okay let's try this again 78 and degree.

193
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:23.930
All right.

194
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.750
This is looking better.

195
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.590
We still need a title so let's see.

196
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:41.420
This should be plot that title and then I'm going to write the angle is is % G in actually.

197
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.320
Let's see.

198
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:48.040
I want this to have a little degree mark so to get the degree mark you have to make a superscript and

199
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.820
then an 0.

200
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.690
So it looks like this in later coding.

201
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:57.730
However this is not straight later coding right here we have to specify the python that we want a little

202
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:03.850
bit of latex code and that is done by encasing the string in dollar signs.

203
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:10.300
So python will see these two dollar signs and interpret everything between them as latex code.

204
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:17.540
So angle is percent s degrees or percent s radians.

205
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:17.830
Okay.

206
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:26.230
So then we replace this first substitution with the degree and then with radians.

207
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.370
So we are coming close to the end.

208
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.460
I am pretty excited.

209
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.810
I wonder what ninety seven degrees looks like okay.

210
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:44.450
So there you go the angle is ninety seven degrees or one point six nine radians there is one more thing

211
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:52.730
that I would like to adjust in this code and that is if we input some really large number like this

212
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:58.850
Let's say this is degrees then we get an angle that is also really large and a radius that is really

213
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.770
really large.

214
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:05.430
Now technically this is true but as you learned in the previous video it's kind of hard to interpret.

215
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:14.000
It's useful to have the angles in degrees to go between zero and 360 and in radians to go between zero

216
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.830
and 2 pi.

217
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:24.350
So therefore I'm going to add a little bit more code here to convert to below three hundred and sixty

218
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:33.490
degrees so I'm just gonna say that the degree equals the degree mod 3 60s and the modulus after dividing

219
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:39.910
by 360 and the radius is going to be the radius mod and Pi dot PI.

220
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.250
This should be two pi it's pretty important.

221
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.740
All right.

222
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.870
And let me put these in parentheses here.

223
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:52.880
Okay so let's try this one more time inputting a fairly large number.

224
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.810
Let's say that's radians.

225
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.870
And now whatever number this is you know three and a half million radians that actually is the same

226
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:09.220
thing as about four radians or two hundred and thirty degrees all right.

227
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.880
Very nice.

228
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.580
So in this and the previous videos you learned about what I consider to be the most annoying part of

229
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.350
trigonometry.

230
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:22.120
Maybe you are annoyed by other parts of trigonometry but anyway you learned about converting between

231
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.940
metrics and you learn quite a bit about writing functions in Python.

232
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.820
That was a pretty informative video.

233
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:36.760
I would say in the next video we are going to continue our adventures through trigonometry in particular

234
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.870
focusing on graphing sine and cosine and tangent.

235
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.280
So I will see you soon.
