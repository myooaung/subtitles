1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,640
I've already mentioned complex numbers previously in the course.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,290
In particular in the last several videos and maybe you've also encountered complex numbers in your adventures

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,330
learning mathematics.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,750
So what I'm going to do in this and the next several videos is give you a deeper introduction to complex

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,530
numbers.

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:32,790
In this video I'm going to explain what the imaginary operator is how to represent it in Python and

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,960
I will also talk about complex numbers and adding and subtracting complex numbers.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,210
So let's begin and let's begin actually with an equation that looks like this So X squared plus one

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,850
equals zero.

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,000
Now you already know that this is just a polynomial.

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:57,690
In fact this is a degree to polynomial so the question is what are the roots of this equation.

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,350
In other words how do we solve for x.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,820
Well you know we go about this the normal way you isolate X on one side so have to subtract one from

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,790
both sides of the equation and then you just take the square root of both sides of the equation and

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,010
that gives you that X equals plus or minus the square root of huh minus 1.

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,350
That's kind of funny.

17
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,450
Now what does this mean.

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,330
To take the square root of a negative number it kind of doesn't really make any sense because no number

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,700
of times itself can be a negative number.

20
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,040
But we need to have some kind of a solution to an equation like this.

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,800
So therefore mathematicians a very very long time ago invented a special operator for this case and

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,300
they call that I.

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,230
So I is for the imaginary operator.

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,160
Now for much of the history of mathematics I was basically the only letter used for the imaginary operator

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:03,060
for the square root of minus one in recent times like in the past hundred years or so people have also

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,320
started using J.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,680
And that's because in engineering people use AI to indicate current.

28
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,010
So sometimes you see I sometimes you see J.

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,850
So it's good to be comfortable with using I or J as the imaginary operator Python for example uses J.

30
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,570
Okay so that's the imaginary operator.

31
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,310
Now one thing you can do with the imaginary operator is create what's called a complex number so a complex

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,220
number means that there are two parts to the number.

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,130
There's the real part and the imaginary part.

34
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,020
So here's a bit of terminology for you.

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,160
Z here is the complex number.

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,880
A is called the real part b is called the imaginary part.

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,750
Notice that B is not the imaginary number in fact B is just a regular number but it's attached to or

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,360
it's multiplying the imaginary operator which is the square root of minus 1.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,450
Now there's an interesting geometric interpretation of a complex number and I will talk about that in

40
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:10,680
a few videos from now but for now in this video you can just focus on this kind of arithmetic interpretation

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,420
that a complex number has a real part and an imaginary part.

42
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,880
Some aspects of working with complex numbers are a little bit tricky and you have to learn the rules

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,120
and other aspects of working with complex numbers are really natural and intuitive and basically exactly

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,800
what you would think about addition and subtraction are really easy.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,110
They work exactly how you think they should work.

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,590
So when you add Z plus W these are two complex numbers.

47
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,560
Then you just add the two real parts and you add the two imaginary parts.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,810
The only tricky thing that you have to keep in mind is that there's still just one imaginary operator

49
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,170
here.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,070
So you add these together but this doesn't give you to I.

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,450
This is still just I.

52
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,900
And that's because it's b times I and D times I.

53
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,060
So when you add this term to this term you still just get one imaginary operator here.

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,740
All right.

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,400
And subtraction also works exactly the same way.

56
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,460
So you just subtract the real parts and subtract the imaginary parts and you make sure that the imaginary

57
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,680
operator is associated with this difference or this addition here.

58
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,080
Okay.

59
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,340
Let me switch to Python and show you how to represent the imaginary operator and then how to do simple

60
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:34,140
arithmetic with complex numbers I'd like to start by showing you a couple of different ways to represent

61
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,420
the imaginary operator.

62
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,410
So let's start by just writing 1 j.

63
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,740
Okay.

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,260
So now python just prints out 1 J.

65
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,930
Notice that it's not giving an error.

66
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,620
So for example if I would type one How about 1 p now python is giving me an error.

67
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:58,890
This is invalid syntax so not any letter can validly go after the one for example.

68
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,690
Even I.

69
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,450
Doesn't work.

70
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:08,750
So the built in operator the built in name for the imaginary operator is I j.

71
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,400
Now we can try print.

72
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:11,830
Let's try.

73
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,580
Let's see how this works in num pi.

74
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,670
So I can type N.P. dot square root of minus one.

75
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,220
Now first of all this is just going to crash because I haven't yet imported the NUM pi module.

76
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:35,230
So let me go insert so above and I will import num num pi as and P OK.

77
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,350
So now we get that in num Pi the square root of minus 1 is n n.

78
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,740
So not a number.

79
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:49,170
This is a concept that I introduced you to in the previous video about the quadratic equation and taking

80
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,930
the square root of a negative number.

81
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:59,640
So it turns out that actually in num Pi you can get the square root of a negative number.

82
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,910
And that is by forcing the data type to be complex.

83
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,340
So now you actually do get one J here the imaginary operator.

84
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,850
Alternatively you could also use the CI pi module and that was the solution that I presented in the

85
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,920
previous video.

86
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,820
So in fact if you want it you could even go back to the code from the previous video on the quadratic

87
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,690
equation and replace Sy pi square root with NUM pi square root specifying that the data type can be

88
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,210
complex anyway.

89
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,140
Another method which is actually the least preferred method.

90
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:43,290
It's a method I don't recommend is to say minus one to the power of one half.

91
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,490
Now let's see what happens when I do this this kind of should be the same thing as this.

92
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,490
It's still the square root of minus one.

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,990
However here it looks like it's six times 10 to the minus 17 so there's is a really tiny number but

94
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,050
it's not exactly zero plus 1 J.

95
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,440
Now this part is the piece that we're looking for and this is computer rounding error.

96
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,500
So this is not a preferred method for representing the imaginary operator.

97
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:12,920
Okay.

98
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,090
One more way that I want to show you and that is getting the imaginary operator in simple.

99
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,500
So let's first import these Sim pi modules so import simple as Sim.

100
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,950
And now I can write prints

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,030
Sim thought I capital I.

102
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,300
And that's just represented as this capital I hear.

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,280
But this is generally used in the simple module to represent the imaginary operator so you can see there's

104
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,390
multiple ways to do this.

105
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,290
This is a good way.

106
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,680
This is a good way if you are using symbolic math.

107
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,930
This is also fine.

108
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,850
You can also do it in a side by Tool Box.

109
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,080
You can see there's multiple ways to represent the imaginary operator.

110
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,280
Basically you just want to avoid using this method.

111
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:11,090
Okay so now I'm going to show you how to create a complex number in num pi and also just in the main

112
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,020
Python set of built in functions.

113
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,820
So let's define a couple of variables I'll say the real part equals how about four and the imaginary

114
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,450
part equals Let's go for minus five.

115
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,200
How about that.

116
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,130
OK.

117
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,540
So we have complex number 1.

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,960
So complex number 1 is going to be any peace and umpire duck complex.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,970
And now here you give two inputs the first input is the real part and the second input is the imaginary

120
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,470
part.

121
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,760
So and then let's see what this looks like.

122
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,060
All right.

123
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,510
So here we have our complex number four minus 5.

124
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,190
J.

125
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,750
Okay.

126
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:57,650
And now what I'm going to do is create another complex number which I meant this to be two without using

127
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,180
num PIs.

128
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,450
That's gonna be real part plus 1 J.

129
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,920
Times the imaginary part.

130
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,870
And then let's see what C and in fact I think I'll print these both out and say print c and 1 and then

131
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,700
print c and 2.

132
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:20,840
So here you go two different ways of creating complex numbers using num pi and without using num pi

133
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:29,030
and let's also check out the type or the class of these variables so say type and also type here we'll

134
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,930
see what the type of this variable is.

135
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:39,470
So you can see that these are both complex numbers there have class complex or type complex.

136
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:44,340
Now I'm going to show you how to add and subtract complex numbers.

137
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,770
It's even easier than you might be thinking it is.

138
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:58,280
So let's say complex numbers said 1 equals and P that complex about 4 and 5 and then we'll say said

139
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:07,000
2 equals and b that complex 3 and is not not 0.

140
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,840
Let's go for 2 How about that.

141
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,150
Okay.

142
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,490
So now really all you have to do is say said one plus said two and then you get the answer and we can

143
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,080
confirm quickly that this ends up being the real part of 7 and the imaginary part of also 7.

144
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,230
So there you go.

145
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,850
And now I can say I even do this right here.

146
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,170
So minus then we get 1 3 J and we can confirm that here.

147
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,090
So this is one minus two.

148
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,920
So four minus three is one five minus two is three.

149
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:46,460
And then the last thing that I want to show you before switching to the exercise is how to extract the

150
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,090
real and imaginary parts from a complex number.

151
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:55,140
So here I created a complex number using the real part and the imaginary part.

152
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:04,520
And now I can type NDP real said 1 and that tells me that the real part is 4 and then you can probably

153
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:10,890
guess what is the function name for extracting the imaginary part it's image.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,270
And now I get the answer of five the exercise for this video is actually not terribly difficult nor

155
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,810
is it particularly mathematically insightful but it's good practice.

156
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,650
It will give you more experience working with complex numbers in Python.

157
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,490
So what you want to do is create two complex numbers W and Z.

158
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,780
So here is W it's two for I and Z is 5 6.

159
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,070
And then you want to add those complex numbers together just like I showed you a moment ago and you

160
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:53,290
want to show that this is equal to creating another complex number out of the real part of W and the

161
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,550
real part of Z and add those together and the imaginary part of W and the imaginary part of Z and then

162
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,150
adding those together.

163
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,080
So basically this is just illustrating that adding these two complex numbers together is the same as

164
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,930
separating the real parts and adding them together and then separating the imaginary parts and adding

165
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,750
those together and then combining them back into a complex number.

166
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,290
All right puzzle video.

167
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,470
Spend a few moments to work through this assignment and now I'm going to switch to Python and you can

168
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,370
watch me solve it.

169
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,190
All right.

170
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,430
So let's start by creating these two complex numbers.

171
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:46,920
So w was an P that complex to 4 and z equals NPD complex that 1 was 5 and 6.

172
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,500
All right.

173
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,070
And so what I'm going to do is sum the real parts separately.

174
00:12:52,230 --> 00:13:00,350
So I'll call this real sum that equals num paid out real w plus none Pi the real Z.

175
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,660
And then of course we have to separate the imaginary parts.

176
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:14,370
So n peaked in Maj w plus and p dot image Z and I mentioned this when I talked about the terminology

177
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:20,460
or complex numbers in the beginning of this video but just to remind you the imaginary part of Z is

178
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,250
6.

179
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,800
It's not 6 I or 6 J.

180
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,870
It's only the number 6.

181
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,700
That is the imaginary part.

182
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,150
All right.

183
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:35,220
So let's call this w plus Z and then maybe I'll say 1.

184
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,700
So this equals end p dot complex actually.

185
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:46,350
You know even before I do this I just want to show you that even though W and Z are both complex numbers

186
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm extracting the real parts and extracting the imaginary parts and these two variables are real value

187
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,310
numbers so I'm gonna write print real some and imagined some.

188
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,060
So this is just to show you that these are two real numbers.

189
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:10,540
These are not complex numbers OK so now I'm going to put these together using the complex functions

190
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,180
of real some and imagined some.

191
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,880
OK.

192
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,460
This was the first part.

193
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:23,330
And now what I want to do is add them together directly plus Z.

194
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,320
Maybe I call this separate and I'll call this direct.

195
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,990
And this is just w plus Z.

196
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,270
Okay.

197
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:39,820
And now we went to print w plus said separate and print.

198
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,490
Let's see print paste.

199
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,020
And then this becomes direct.

200
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,050
Okay.

201
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,700
And no big surprise.

202
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,890
You see that these are the same number.

203
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:58,360
So obviously this is a much more convenient way to add complex numbers compared to these three lines

204
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,140
of code.

205
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,240
Nonetheless it's nice to see that when you do it both ways you get the same answer.

206
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,780
In this video I showed you what imaginary operators are and where they come from and several ways to

207
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,660
represent them in Python.

208
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:19,090
I also talked about complex numbers and how to add and subtract complex numbers in python in the next

209
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,590
video.

210
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,760
You will learn how to multiply complex numbers.

211
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,130
It's actually a little bit trickier then addition and subtraction.

212
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,580
So I look forward to telling you all about it.
