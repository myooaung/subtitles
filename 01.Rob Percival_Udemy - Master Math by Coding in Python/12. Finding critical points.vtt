00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.360
Do you know what the critical points of a function means.

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.500
If you don't then this is going to be a super exciting video for you.

3
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.370
And if you do know what the critical points are then.

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.890
Well I hope it's still pretty exciting.

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.920
You will get to see methods for computing for finding the critical points in Python.

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.390
And perhaps that's new to you.

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.250
So then it will be exciting.

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.570
All right.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.010
So let's say we have some function here.

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.110
So what are the critical points of this function.

11
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.840
Well the critical points are these three points right here.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.130
Now why are these points special.

13
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.500
Why are these called critical points.

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.780
Well you can see in the function that that's the points where they kind of level off and change direction.

15
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.350
So it's kind of comes to a stop and then turns around and goes the other way.

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.980
That's a bit of the idea of a critical point.

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.730
In fact the more formal definition of a critical point is to identify the points where the derivative

18
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
of the function cross is 0.

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.090
So here you see the derivative of this function.

20
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.670
So here's the function in blue and it's derivative is in this greenish color.

21
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:27.320
And now if you look across at the zero line so y equals zero when the derivative crosses zero then that

22
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.410
point on the function is called a critical point.

23
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.110
So here the derivative crosses zero here and here the derivative crosses zero.

24
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.500
And that's why we have our three critical points here.

25
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.450
Now in truth that's only half of the definition of critical points.

26
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.100
All the critical points are where the derivative is equal to zero or where the derivative is undefined

27
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.470
for some reason let's say if the derivative is you know some weird point at minus infinity or something

28
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.640
over zero.

29
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.580
But for this video we were only going to be considering critical points where the derivative is equal

30
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.810
to zero.

31
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.070
OK.

32
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.140
So this is some pictures I hope this gives you a bit of a intuition a visual graphical intuition for

33
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.620
what critical points are and how to identify them.

34
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.210
I want to now show you an example.

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:24.950
So actually this function is minus X to the power of four plus three times X squared.

36
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.690
So that's the function.

37
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.420
Then we can take the derivative and this is a pretty straightforward function to take the derivative

38
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.580
of because it's just some polynomial so the derivative which you see in this cyan line here is minus

39
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.270
four times x cubed plus six x.

40
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.660
Okay.

41
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.030
Now I said that we want to find the points in the derivative that are equal to zero.

42
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.800
So what we do is take this function and set it equal to zero.

43
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.970
And you've actually seen this before in this course in the algebra 2 section in particular.

44
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.470
This is a polynomial expression.

45
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.110
We set it equal to zero and then we just want to find the roots of this expression which means the x

46
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.500
values that satisfy this equation.

47
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.740
Okay.

48
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.500
So it turns out this isn't too difficult.

49
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.210
You can do this by hand with a piece of paper and a pen or you can probably even solve this in your

50
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.390
head if you like.

51
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.650
It turns out that these solutions the algebraic solutions to this equation are x equals zero which you

52
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.170
see here and X equals plus or minus the square root of three over two.

53
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.520
And that's these points over here.

54
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.150
Now I'm going to switch to Python.

55
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.050
I'm going to show you two different methods for computing the critical points of a function.

56
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.820
One method I call the empirical method because we are just going to be evaluating this function and

57
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.930
the second method will be using simplify and of course that's like this symbolic or the analytic solution

58
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.350
in this video we are going to use these simple AI module the NUM pi module map plot lived up pi plot

59
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.830
and this function fine peaks which is from the CI pi dot signal toolbox I introduce you to this function

60
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.530
find peaks way way way back in the course in the section on algebra 2 and I forget offhand what the

61
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.090
title of the video was but it was something about finding the extreme points of a function.

62
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.460
Okay so let's begin by creating a function actually just to be clear I'm going to start with the empirical

63
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:44.200
method and you will see over the next seven to ten minutes why I call this the empirical method.

64
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:53.560
So I'm going to start by defining some variable X so known pi Lynn space let's go from minus five to

65
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.070
plus five in one thousand steps.

66
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.140
That seems like a pretty good resolution.

67
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:09.580
Now we're going to define F of X and I'm going to set that equal to x squared times e to the minus X

68
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.990
squared.

69
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.860
So it's a pretty interesting function you'll see what this looks like in a moment.

70
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.010
Actually no.

71
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.180
Let's already plot it.

72
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.550
I'm going to plot x by f of x.

73
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.290
And here you can see what this function looks like now to me.

74
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.510
This function looks like an M but maybe I'm just partial to seeing Ms everywhere.

75
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.050
Now it happens that for this particular function we can compute the critical points by identifying the

76
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.310
Maxima and the minima of this function.

77
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.670
And that works because for this function the the two local maxima are the points where the function

78
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.160
stops and changes direction.

79
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.860
So it kind of slows down and it changes direction.

80
00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.900
So this is going to be where the function is instantaneously flats which means the derivative is zero.

81
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.250
And then here that's also going to work.

82
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.300
And that's because this point ends up touching exactly zero right here and you can see that because

83
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.130
at x equals zero.

84
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.480
This term is zero.

85
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.220
So the entire function is zero.

86
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.300
And then because this is E to the minus X squared these tales always are positive.

87
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.650
They're strictly non negative.

88
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.350
They never even touch zero.

89
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.990
Exactly.

90
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.000
Okay.

91
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.700
So let's find the local extreme points of this function.

92
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:44.210
So let's say local max equals find peaks of F X and then just as a bit of a reminder let's see what

93
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.420
local Max looks like.

94
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.090
Okay.

95
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.940
So you can see it's an array.

96
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.770
It gives us two values.

97
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.850
And then there's actually a second output here in the second element of this tuple.

98
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.450
And what we really care about is this array here and not this additional information.

99
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.330
You can read more about that here.

100
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.610
That was basically just other information about the peaks which we haven't actually requested.

101
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:17.910
So if I only want the first output I can use square brackets here and just say zero.

102
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.580
And now that just returns this array.

103
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.090
So these are in fact the local maxima and then the local minima.

104
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.980
I can get by finding the peaks of the negative of the function.

105
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:37.460
So we just turn the function upside down and if this seems weird then you can take a moment and refer

106
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.690
back to the video on finding extreme points in the section.

107
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.560
Algebra 2.

108
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.400
OK.

109
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.540
So let's print this out.

110
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.230
Let's see what these end up being.

111
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:54.370
So I'm going to print the critical points are and then I'll say plus string.

112
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.130
So what do we want.

113
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:02.870
We actually don't really care about the local max persay because these are actually just indices.

114
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.060
What we want is those indices into the variable x.

115
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:16.180
So that is when you look here you know there actually is no value of 400 or 600 in this array instead.

116
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:26.540
This is telling us that the index 400 so the 400 point in X is where F of X has a local maximum.

117
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:34.250
So in fact what we want here is to say X of local max and then

118
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.170
the local minimum so acts of local men.

119
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.730
Okay let's print this out.

120
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.420
So this is telling us that the critical points.

121
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.740
It's good to have a proper spelling in here.

122
00:08:51.100 --> 00:09:00.010
The critical points are minus not quite one and not quite one and minus something is not quite zero.

123
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:08.110
So this might seem a little bit strange because in fact if you were to put this value into this function

124
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.360
that's going to be something that's greater than zero right.

125
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.700
It's gonna be some small number but it's going to be greater than zero.

126
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.820
But you can see obviously that zero is the minimum.

127
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.590
So what is going on here.

128
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:26.950
Well what's going on here is actually about the democratization and there actually is no exact zero

129
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.950
in this vector X and that has to do with this descriptive station here.

130
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:40.180
Now if I were to change this from an even number to an odd number like 1001 then we in fact are going

131
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.150
to have exactly zero.

132
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:48.280
And that's because if you go from negative some number to positive some number in an odd number of steps

133
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.280
then you're always going to have exactly one point in the middle which in this case is zero.

134
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.180
So now watch I've just changed this function from this.

135
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:06.670
The resolution of X from 1000 to 1000 and one and now the critical points are minus one plus one and

136
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.420
zero.

137
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.080
And that actually is the correct answer.

138
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:17.800
And so that is an important lesson here that when you are implementing math in computers you always

139
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.000
have to be careful when you are describing.

140
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:26.800
Now I'm going to show you in a moment the symbolic or analytic solution which doesn't suffer from this

141
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.850
problem.

142
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.550
Nonetheless I think it's pretty important to know about.

143
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:31.880
OK.

144
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.260
Let's see.

145
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.980
So I want to plot these critical points.

146
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:44.320
So P L T dot plot and again it's not the local max per say that I want to plot it's those indices into

147
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.590
the vector x that I want to plot.

148
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:53.900
And same goes for the function it is the local max indices in those functions.

149
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.710
And let's make this a red circle.

150
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.200
Okay.

151
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.770
So that's looking good.

152
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:11.080
And then I want the local minima so plot x local men and effects of local men and let's make them how

153
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.130
about a green square.

154
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.140
All right that looks pretty good.

155
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.900
Another thing that I would like to do is plot the derivative on top of this function.

156
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:30.250
Now notice I can't use SIM dot def as I have in previous videos and that's because this is not a symbolic

157
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:30.910
expression.

158
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.160
This is not assume a simple object.

159
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:40.590
So instead what I need to do is literally just compute the diff the differential of this function and

160
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:48.150
that I'm going to do by writing D if X equals num pi dot diff of F of X.

161
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.870
Okay.

162
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.630
So this is going to give us the differential or the difference.

163
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.010
So it's the discrete derivative of this function.

164
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.820
It's really just the difference at each time point in the function.

165
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.750
So now let's make a plot of this so we'll plot this on top.

166
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.050
So let's see X by D F X.

167
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.670
Mm hmm.

168
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.920
And now we get an error.

169
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.470
This is not the arrow I was hoping for.

170
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.780
Okay fix that typo error.

171
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.970
Now we get the error that I was hoping for.

172
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:26.230
This says X and Y must have the same first mentioned but they have shapes 1000 and 1 and 1000.

173
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.330
So what is going on here.

174
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:34.150
Well what's going on here is that X is a thousand and one time points of course because that's what

175
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.400
I specified here.

176
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.520
But the derivative is actually one point fewer.

177
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:46.480
And that's because what this function diff is doing is saying that each element in D F X is equal to

178
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.350
each element and F X minus its neighbor minus the one that comes after it.

179
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:59.470
So that means that this is going to have one point less than this vector here or so then this vector

180
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.220
here.

181
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:08.530
So to plot this what we need to do is actually just run X from the beginning up until the end minus

182
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.750
one point so that's supposed to be 1.

183
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.130
Mm hmm.

184
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.130
But the derivative looks a little bit small.

185
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.430
Maybe I've done something wrong here.

186
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:23.530
Actually when you think about the notation for the derivative it's always something like this.

187
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:32.920
It's def by D X and so this expression here is actually just computing D F so in fact we need to divide

188
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.080
this by the differential of X so what is D X here.

189
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:43.000
Well D X is actually just the smallest increment of X that we have.

190
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.730
So we can set that to be x 1 minus x 0 Uh huh.

191
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.230
And now we get a derivative that looks right.

192
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.240
It's on the same scale as the original function.

193
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:57.540
OK.

194
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:06.520
So you can see why I call this the empirical method of finding the critical points of this function.

195
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.790
Now I'd like to repeat this method but showing you the analytic or symbolic method so to do this we're

196
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:20.710
gonna start using these simple AI modules so I'm going to define a symbolic variable X and then I will

197
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:26.500
create a function and it's gonna be the same function of course but I have to redefine it in terms of

198
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.000
this symbolic variable x.

199
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:36.770
And of course this is no longer num PI that e XP it's actually Sim for simple e XP.

200
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.960
So then minus X squared.

201
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.350
Okay.

202
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:46.210
And now we're gonna go about solving the critical points here slightly differently from how I did up

203
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.090
above.

204
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:55.780
So here I'm going to define the derivative and that's going to be the symbolic version of the derivative.

205
00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:04.410
And then what we want to do is solve for zero so I'm going to say that the critical points are Sim dots

206
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.850
solve of D F X.

207
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:14.430
So you might remember when I introduced you to this sim dot solve function earlier in the course.

208
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:21.730
And essentially what it's going to do is solve for this expression equals zero and actually let me show

209
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.230
you what that expression looks like.

210
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.700
Okay so here we get well it's some slightly longer expression and this basically comes from the chain

211
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:30.990
rule.

212
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:37.480
Because we have multiple functions that are multiplying each other and also functions that are embedded

213
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.660
in the exponential.

214
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.780
So this is the derivative of this function here.

215
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:53.340
And now we get crit points so the critical points and you can see that that is minus 1 0 and 1 which

216
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.840
we can confirm are these same values here and the same values that we got in the plot.

217
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:07.390
However of course that was different for from when we were using an even number of points OK so this

218
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.800
is going to give more accurate results.

219
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:16.150
Still I think it's nice to know both methods and if you like you can also reproduce this graph or a

220
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:23.890
graph that looks very similar to this and simply by using simplifies plotting routines basically to

221
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:31.910
plot this function and its derivative and also identify the critical points in this video.

222
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.270
I reviewed the idea of critical points.

223
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.370
The formal definition as setting the derivative equal to zero.

224
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:47.380
And I showed you two methods in Python for identifying critical points of a function.

225
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:54.470
Now don't go too far away because there's going to be an exercise in the next video all about critical

226
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.860
points.

227
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.690
It's going to be a pretty fun exercise.

228
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.600
And I look forward to walking through my solution.
