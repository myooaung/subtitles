00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.090
Welcome to this section of the course, which is all about algebra.
1

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm going to start this section with probably the most fundamental and most important part of algebra,
2

3
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.400
which is solving for x.
3

4
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.040
So I will show you how to use sympy to solve for a variable, a symbolic variable, and you'll also get
4

5
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.890
to learn a little bit about Python lists.
5

6
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.150
Okay.
6

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.020
So what does it mean to solve for x?
7

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:39.010
So if you see this expression: four X equals two, then we might wonder what is x equals to?
8

9
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.400
So to solve for x you have to isolate X on one side of the equation by doing all sorts of arithmetic
9

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.180
operations.
10

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.510
So in this case you can divide both sides by four and then you get X equals one half.
11

12
00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.780
Now if you have multiple variables in the equation, you might have something like this: minus four x squared
12

13
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.110
equals Y to the one third power.
13

14
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:11.460
Then you can still solve for x and that solution is going to be in context of y, or Y is going to be
14

15
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.800
in the solution of x.
15

16
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.480
So we are defining X in part by the value of y.
16

17
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.210
So for this expression, the value of x turns out to be plus or minus two times the square root of minus
17

18
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.070
one which is a bizarre looking operation.
18

19
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.520
This is actually something called a imaginary operator. It's how we form complex numbers.
19

20
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.280
And I will talk about complex numbers later on in the course.
20

21
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980
Times Y to the 1 6th.
21

22
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.670
Now you could also turn this equation around and set it equal to y.
22

23
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.740
And in this case that's actually not so difficult because Y is already on its own on one side of the
23

24
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.530
equation.
24

25
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.780
We would just have to raise both sides of this equation to the power of three to isolate y on this side.
25

26
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.200
The last thing that I want to mention before switching to Python is a little bit of terminology in algebra.
26

27
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.750
So you can have an expression like this where you have something on the left hand side of the equation
27

28
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.820
and something on the right hand side of the equation if you would move everything onto one side of the
28

29
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.450
equation then you're setting the equation equal to zero.
29

30
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.470
This is often called a homogenous form.
30

31
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.560
So this equation is in it's homogenous form.
31

32
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.900
Notice I've just moved the nine to the left.
32

33
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.350
Put a minus sign on it of course and then set the whole equation to zero.
33

34
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.790
Now the reason why I'm mentioning this is because in many sympy functions, the way to operate the function,
34

35
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.420
the way to use the function, is not by inputting an equation but by setting the equation to zero.
35

36
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.720
And then you input just the non-zero side of the equation.
36

37
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.540
So the homogenous form of the equation, you've already seen that a little bit in the previous section
37

38
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.630
with providing one input into the eq or equals function.
38

39
00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.940
All right.
39

40
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:08.760
So with this as a background, let's now switch to Python and figure out how to solve for X. Before even
40

41
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.660
getting started,
41

42
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.410
I know that I'm going to be using the sympy module, so I'm going to import sympy
42

43
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:26.970
and I also want to do some nice printing, so I say From IPython dot display import display comma math.
43

44
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.450
All right.
44

45
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.670
So let's begin by creating a symbolic variable for X symbols x.
45

46
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.920
And now the expression is going to be expr....
46

47
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:47.330
I'm going to set this equal to a variable expr, and let's say two times x plus four minus nine.
47

48
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.800
So this is the expression.
48

49
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.840
Now as I mentioned in the slides, you can actually think of this expression like this.
49

50
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.960
Two x plus four equals nine.
50

51
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.150
However in sympy, we want to consider this to be a homogenous equation.
51

52
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.620
So we are going to specify two x plus four minus nine and implicitly we are setting this equation equal
52

53
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.290
to zero.
53

54
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.820
Like this.
54

55
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.310
However you don't write this equals zero.
55

56
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.450
You just keep it like this.
56

57
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.260
So now I can write sym dot solve.
57

58
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.170
So this is a new function or at least a function that I haven't yet introduced in the course. And the
58

59
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.940
input is going to be the expression.
59

60
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.080
And then this tells us that X equals five over two.
60

61
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.620
Now how does Python know that I want to solve for x?
61

62
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.690
It guesses -- sympy guesses that I want to solve for x because x is the only thing to solve for;
62

63
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.600
there is nothing else that's interesting to solve for in this equation.
63

64
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.660
Okay.
64

65
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.210
So the solution is five over two and we can actually quickly confirm that.
65

66
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.260
It's always a good idea to do in math whenever possible.
66

67
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.630
So we have two X equals nine minus four.
67

68
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.760
So what I'm doing is basically just moving this back to the right hand side of the equation and then
68

69
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.590
subtracting four from both sides.
69

70
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.170
So then this becomes five.
70

71
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.920
And now we divide both sides of the equation by two and we get indeed that x equals five divided
71

72
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.320
by two. All right, so you might be wondering why we need this super fancy programming language just to
72

73
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.580
solve this.
73

74
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.620
Obviously, when you have something this simple, you don't need Python; you can just do it by hand.
74

75
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.790
When you get more complicated expressions, that's when Python becomes an important tool for learning
75

76
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.400
mathematics.
76

77
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.640
All right.
77

78
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.140
So what I want to do now is print out this result in a nicer looking format.
78

79
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.750
So I encourage you to pause the video and do this, essentially what you want is something like the solution
79

80
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.080
to two x plus four minus nine is five divided by two.
80

81
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.870
So you want something that... or maybe better if it says X equals five over two.
81

82
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.870
So you want to print out something that looks like this.
82

83
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.230
All right.
83

84
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.590
So there's two ways that we can get this to work.
84

85
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.770
We can use the print function but that's not going to make really nice looking output.
85

86
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.880
It's going to look a little bit more like this. Or we can use the display math in combination with latex
86

87
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.210
code.
87

88
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.030
So first I want to print out some text.
88

89
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.170
So the text is going to be: text and then in curly brackets the solution to....
89

90
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:40.600
and now here I want to write out the equation, and then we need more text is X equals.
90

91
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.880
And then here I want to print out the solution.
91

92
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.220
So now we're going to need to replace this and we're going to need to replace this.
92

93
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:54.130
So this is going to be replaced with the expression and let's already
93

94
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.890
try that before getting too much further.
94

95
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.890
Now I need percent and then this is going to be the expression.
95

96
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.270
So the solution to two star x minus five.
96

97
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.580
So this doesn't really look like very nice formatting.
97

98
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:17.480
So I want to encase this in latex code, so sym dot latex and now let's try this again.
98

99
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.310
Okay.
99

100
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.520
The solution to two X minus five.
100

101
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:27.780
Now notice that Python actually combined the four and the minus nine here into minus five is X equals
101

102
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.130
so.
102

103
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.010
So far this is looking good.
103

104
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.590
We also need to replace this with the solution.
104

105
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:41.310
This is going to end up being a number like this, so I will use % G here and then we need to replace
105

106
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.470
this percent G essentially with this here.
106

107
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:50.910
So I'm going to copy and paste and let's see how this looks... ah! we get an error.
107

108
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.220
The input must be a real number not a list.
108

109
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.170
Ha that's funny.
109

110
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:00.710
What is a list in python? A list is a particular variable type.
110

111
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.400
I'm going to introduce you to a list more in a few moments.
111

112
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.040
I'll have more to say about lists in Python.
112

113
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:13.870
For now, suffice it to say that this output -- the output of sym dot solve -- is a list.
113

114
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.080
It's not actually a number.
114

115
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.210
There is a number inside the list but the whole object is a list.
115

116
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:28.090
And so what we want to do is actually just access the number that's contained inside this list, and to
116

117
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:34.730
do that, we can use square brackets with a zero indicating the first element.
117

118
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.180
I put this in the wrong place.
118

119
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.910
That should go after the output of solve not expression.
119

120
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.150
OK.
120

121
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.100
So now we see something that looks nicer.
121

122
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:50.030
So the solution to two X minus five is X equals 2.5.
122

123
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.320
Okay.
123

124
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.840
So if this notation looks a little bit confusing, then don't worry I'm going to talk more about that
124

125
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.180
in a moment.
125

126
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:03.090
So I said that this is called a list, and we have one element inside the list.
126

127
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:09.360
Now why it does sym dot solve output a list instead of just a single number?
127

128
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.610
Here there is only one solution.
128

129
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:17.190
However, we can have bigger equations that have more solutions to them.
129

130
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:26.350
So for example, let's imagine we are trying to solve the equation x squared minus four.
130

131
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.750
So now we get two solutions.
131

132
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.500
I said minus four.
132

133
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.640
We get two solutions: we get two and minus two.
133

134
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.280
And this should make sense if you think of this as an equation.
134

135
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.240
So X squared equals four.
135

136
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:47.410
Then you take the square root and then the square root of four is plus or minus two.
136

137
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.460
Okay.
137

138
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.620
So the solution to this expression -- x squared minus four -- is minus two and two.
138

139
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.570
So there are two solutions.
139

140
00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.530
So then Python needs a way to organize these two solutions.
140

141
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.250
And the way that it does that is with a list.
141

142
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.790
So now let me talk a little bit about lists.
142

143
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:12.790
First of all, I'm just going to put the output of this into this other variable called sol. And now I'm
143

144
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.320
going to say this a python function called type.
144

145
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:23.920
It's going to tell me the class of this object, so the type of this object, sol for solution, is a list.
145

146
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:30.030
Now I'm going to type L E N so this is a function to tell me the length of this list.
146

147
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.070
So how many elements are in this list.
147

148
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.960
There are two elements in this list.
148

149
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:43.450
And we can print them out and then we see that it is indeed two elements: minus two and plus two.
149

150
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:50.050
And now if you wanted to access only one element of these solutions, let's say only the first element,
150

151
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:58.300
then you would use like I showed here, you use square brackets. And indexing the first element is actually
151

152
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:04.870
indexed by zero it's a little bit confusing initially but zero corresponds to the first element in python
152

153
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.950
and a python list.
153

154
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.470
And then if we want the second element in the solution, we would type one here and that gives us the
154

155
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.640
second element.
155

156
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.650
OK.
156

157
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.270
So now I'm going to show you how we can use this.
157

158
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:28.250
So let me get rid of this. I'm going to say the expression is equal to x squared minus four.
158

159
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.780
And then here we want to solve for the expression.
159

160
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.160
All right.
160

161
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.680
So nothing particularly new yet.
161

162
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.220
And now what I want to do is create a for loop to print out all of the solutions.
162

163
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:48.630
So I'm going to say for I in range 0 to length of these solutions.
163

164
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.860
So we're having a for loop I'm setting up a for loop here.
164

165
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:59.160
The indexing variable is called I, it's going to loop from 0 to however long the solution is.
165

166
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.300
Which means however many solutions there are to this equation, to this expression.
166

167
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:13.810
And now inside this for loop I'm going to print out solution number i.
167

168
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:24.200
So the i-th solution is, and then another plus sign for string concatenation and then we want the solution
168

169
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.700
the i-th solution.
169

170
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.220
All right so let's see what happens when I try to run this code.
170

171
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:29.600
Okay.
171

172
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:37.360
We get an error and the error is can only concatenate strings, not integers, to other strings.
172

173
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.760
So I hope you see what the problem is.
173

174
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.240
The problem is that this is a string.
174

175
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:48.480
This is a number but I converted into a string and this is still a number I haven't yet converted
175

176
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.400
it into a string.
176

177
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.330
So now let's try this.
177

178
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.650
Now we see Solution Number 0 is minus 2, solution number one is 2.
178

179
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.870
I think this looks a little bit awkward.
179

180
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.340
I'm going to write I plus 1 here.
180

181
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:09.960
So the first solution is minus 2 and the second solution is plus 2.
181

182
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.050
Now of course you could make this look a little bit fancier like this.
182

183
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:19.800
Mostly the point here is to show you how to interact with lists and how to get individual items from
183

184
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.140
a list.
184

185
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.180
Very good.
185

186
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:29.400
The next thing that I went to show you is how to solve for one variable when there are multiple variables
186

187
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.770
in the same equation.
187

188
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.630
So let's say we have an expression that contains both X and Y.
188

189
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:44.220
So how about X divided by 4 minus X times Y plus 5.
189

190
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:50.370
So now there are two variables and I'm sure that you are already screaming at your computer screen that
190

191
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.230
Y isn't yet defined and you are right!
191

192
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:58.390
We need to define y. y equals sym dot symbols
192

193
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.390
y.
193

194
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.010
Okay so I just ran this cell and we didn't get any errors so that's a good sign.
194

195
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.390
We haven't done anything wrong yet.
195

196
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.780
So now the question is how do we solve for x and how do we solve for y?
196

197
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.900
So let's try writing sym dot solve expression.
197

198
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.910
Let's see what happens.
198

199
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.700
Okay so here we actually get a dictionary inside of a list.
199

200
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:32.570
So it says that the solution for x is 20 divided by 4 y minus 1.
200

201
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.390
But it doesn't tell us what the solution for Y is.
201

202
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:42.750
So to make this a little bit clear what you can do is input the variable that you want to solve for.
202

203
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:50.330
As the second input. So I'm writing sym dot solve expr -- so the expression -- comma Y. And now I'm telling
203

204
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.200
Python explicitly to solve for -- sorry,
204

205
00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:02.810
I said y, I meant X -- to solve for x. And now I can write Y and we get the solution for y in terms of
205

206
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.590
x. So this was a pretty productive video.
206

207
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.490
You learned how to use sympy to solve not only for one variable, but for multiple variables.
207

208
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.280
And I also told you a little bit about working with lists in python.
208

209
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.590
Now there's a couple of exercises that go along with this video, but they are a little bit more involved
209

210
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.280
and so I decided to have them be in a separate video.
210

211
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:33.640
So please keep watching! The next video is your opportunity to put into practice the material and concepts
211

212
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.500
that you learned in this video.
