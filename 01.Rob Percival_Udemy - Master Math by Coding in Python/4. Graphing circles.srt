1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:11,460
I'm pretty sure that you know what a circle is and you might even know the formula for a circle.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,760
But if you don't then don't worry I'm going to give you a reminder on the next slide.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,050
But the main point of this video is going to be to show you how to use the mesh grids that you learned

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,030
about in a previous video to making circles.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,020
It's a pretty interesting application of those matrix grids.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,680
All right so here we have a circle a circle has a particular radius typically indicated by R and it

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,000
has a center point which is often indicated as the coordinates H comma K where h corresponds to the

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,460
location on the x axis.

9
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,540
And k is the corresponding location on the y axis.

10
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,940
Here is the general formula.

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,860
So it's Y minus K and then the quantity squared plus X minus H.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,220
And that quantity squared equals R squared.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,560
Now when the circle is centered at the origin then k equals zero and H equals zero.

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,340
And that leads to the possibly more familiar looking version of this equation which is X squared plus

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,800
Y squared equals R squared.

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,160
All right so let's switch to Python and see how we can make a circle that looks like this.

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:30,570
In fact there are several ways that you can use python to create a circle and you've already seen some

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,380
of these ways in the past.

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,330
For example when creating the unit circle in the section on algebra 2.

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,400
So I'm going to show you a different method here and that is using mesh grid.

21
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,800
So let's start with the parameters.

22
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:53,830
So we have H equals about 2 and then K will set to minus 3 and then we need the radius.

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,270
And how about plus 3.

24
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,550
Okay.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:06,240
So what we need now is a mesh grid so going to say capital X Capital Y equals num PI that mesh grid.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,610
And then what should we put in here.

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,970
So this is certainly going to be something like vector X comma vector Y although in this case I'm going

28
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,710
to make a square mesh so this can be simplified to X by x.

29
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,980
So what should we set X to be.

30
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,730
Well we can write this out say in PI that Lynn space let's say like you know minus three two plus three

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,180
in one hundred steps.

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,190
But how do you know that minus three plus three is a good range.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,090
In fact for these parameters this is probably not a good range because we're not going to see the entire

34
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,440
circle given that the center is at minus three and the radius is at or the radius is three.

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,290
So what I'd like to do is make this a little bit more dynamic so I'm gonna make this be a variable maybe

36
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,060
we'll call it X LIM So X minus X lambda plus X Lim.

37
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,890
So then we need to figure out what is an appropriate axis limit for this plot.

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,290
So one way we can do that is by considering what is going to be the most extreme point on the circle.

39
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:22,780
It's the most extreme point on the circle is going to be the larger of K or H plus R.

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,470
And if that reasoning doesn't totally make sense yet then don't worry I'm actually going to show you

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,690
a picture of this and then it will be a little clearer.

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,040
All right.

43
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:41,570
So let's define now this variable X Lim equals R Plus and P that Max H comma K.

44
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,020
But the thing is that K here is a larger offset.

45
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,210
So this is further away from the origin than this one.

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,830
However H is going to be the maximum.

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,600
What we really care about is the distance away from the origin.

48
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:04,290
So I'm going to do I'm going to write A B S H and then a B.S. K and I'm going to run this code but I

49
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,750
believe that this is going to crash here.

50
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:07,970
Yeah.

51
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:15,540
So this is gonna crash here and that's because the max function is actually expecting one input for

52
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,380
the numbers so that then the second input would be the axis or the dimension over which you are computing

53
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,750
the maximum.

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:31,080
So this extra set of parentheses will force both of these numbers to be in the first input into the

55
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,480
max function.

56
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:32,760
Okay.

57
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,720
So let's have a quick look at X and Y.

58
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:45,150
So I'm gonna write P.L. t that I am show X and I am show why it's always interesting to look at these

59
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,290
things and in general to plot your code as you're going through it.

60
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:49,870
Okay.

61
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:57,300
So what we're gonna do now is create the function so f of clients F of X Y because the way I think about

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,250
this is that you know if you would write this out in math notation it might look something like this

63
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,520
because a circle is a function of x and y.

64
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,050
So the function according to the slides is X minus a.

65
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:25,220
That should be h x minus a squared plus Y Capital Y minus K squared equals R squared.

66
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,010
However when we're defining functions in python you don't actually.

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,110
In fact you can't even set an equals sign like this because there's already another equals sign here

68
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,250
and this is definitely going to produce an error.

69
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:44,970
So the solution you will remember from earlier in the course is basically to set this entire equation

70
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,750
to be zero which means you have to move this term to the left.

71
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:56,430
So I'm going to say minus r squared and now implicitly the rest of this equation says equals zero.

72
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,460
But in Python we don't need to write this all right.

73
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,050
So that is our function.

74
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,900
Now how should we visualize this function.

75
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:12,260
Let's try making an image using I am show just like what we did to look at the mesh grids.

76
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,570
So.

77
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,170
Mm hmm.

78
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,110
Doesn't quite look like a circle.

79
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,530
I guess you can kind of see that there's a circle in here but it looks more like a colorful patch so

80
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,390
I'm going to actually take a totally different approach rather than showing this as an image.

81
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,540
I'm going to show this as a contour map.

82
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:41,010
So let's see what happens if I write BLT dot contour so a contour map is a map that shows lines around

83
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,690
regions that have the same height or the same magnitude.

84
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,460
This is kind of like if you go hiking with one of these topography Maps that shows you elevation.

85
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,360
So this would be the highest elevation.

86
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,470
And then you go down and these are constant elevations along these contour lines.

87
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,260
Now this still doesn't really quite look exactly like what you'd expect for a circle.

88
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,500
But what we can do is provide some extra inputs into the contour function.

89
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,910
In particular I'm going to write zero.

90
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,860
And that is only actually going to plot only the first contour.

91
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,540
And now I'm going to actually also provide a couple of additional inputs and that's going to be the

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:31,470
X and Y matrices and then python is going to use that to define the x axis labels and the Y or the Y

93
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,040
tick labels and the X stick labels.

94
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,340
All right.

95
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,210
So this is starting to look.

96
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,760
There's a couple more things I would like to do.

97
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:45,190
First of all I would like to plot some guidelines at the zero marks.

98
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,230
So at C P L T dot plot and now how far along do we go on the x axis.

99
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,340
Well on the x axis we actually go from minus X limb to plus X limb.

100
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,780
So this was in fact how we defined the x axis.

101
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:10,440
So the X axis for the line is going to go from minus X limb to plus X limb and on the y axis we go zero

102
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,130
to zero and then this is going to be a black dashed line like this.

103
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:25,350
And then I want another one to go on the basically to go to cut across this vertical up here at x equals

104
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,170
zero.

105
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,760
So therefore I'm going to just swap the orders of the zero line and the X limit.

106
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,150
All right.

107
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,470
And now no circle would be complete without a dot in its center.

108
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:46,200
So I'm going to plot a dot at the center SPL T dot plot H comma K and how about let's go for a green

109
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:52,080
green circle because this also spells go which is a little bit fun.

110
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,010
Okay.

111
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,360
Now this doesn't look like a circle it looks like an oval.

112
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,690
It actually is a circle.

113
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,470
The problem is that the axes are not square.

114
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,160
The x axis is wider than the y axis is tall.

115
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,600
And so to fix this I'm going to use P ulti that GCA forget get current axis which refers to this current

116
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,270
axis dot set aspect and then equal all right.

117
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,720
Now this is starting to look pretty good.

118
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,020
I would say and I'm sure you agree.

119
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,460
And now just to get back to this discussion here.

120
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:36,580
So the idea of defining these axis limits is we take the larger magnitude of the X or Y center of the

121
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,440
circle and then add a radius three and then whatever is that largest number.

122
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,290
That's basically going to be the outermost boundary of the entire circle and that happens to be this

123
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:53,590
point right here I think this is a pretty cool looking picture right here.

124
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,990
I hope you agree because the exercise for this video is to produce exactly this picture.

125
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:07,430
So let's see what I did what I did hear was create a bunch of circles with different radii and also

126
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,740
two circles at different locations so you can see here's a circle and then there's a circle and another

127
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,860
one and so on.

128
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,920
And then when you draw these two they get these kind of interesting interference patterns with each

129
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,020
other in the middle it's almost a bit like a venn diagram here and then at the end I just thought it

130
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,950
would look nice to draw a thick black line that goes from the center of one set of circles to the center

131
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,230
of the other set of circles.

132
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,550
All right.

133
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,520
So here's a few parameters I specified the circle centers to be minus one point five and plus one point

134
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:48,950
five on the x axis and the radii for the different circles go from point five up to three and you can

135
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:56,750
see that I also change the color so as the radius increases the color also gets lighter and later all

136
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,080
right.

137
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:05,830
So pause the video switch to Python see if you can figure out how to produce this exact image.

138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,360
And now I'm going to switch to Python and you can watch me solve it.

139
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,090
All right so let's start with our parameters.

140
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:21,050
So we have the center is going to be minus one point five and one point five.

141
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,060
And then we need the grid spacing for mesh grid.

142
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,360
So let me start by writing this code here.

143
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:36,380
And B that mesh grid and let's call this a little X and a little X is going to be inspired.

144
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,150
Lynn space and what axis limit should we use here.

145
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,580
Well the top radius of the largest radius is three.

146
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,700
And here we have a center of one point five.

147
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,940
So we definitely need 4.5.

148
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,550
We couldn't go lower than 4.5.

149
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,520
Otherwise we're going to start cutting off the circles.

150
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,560
And so just to make sure we have enough room.

151
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,810
I'm gonna go from minus five to plus five and let's say a hundred steps.

152
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,150
Okay.

153
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,740
So just gonna run this code real quick.

154
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,900
I think it's good to run code every couple of lines that you add just to make sure that things are still

155
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,340
working right.

156
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,640
Good.

157
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:20,480
So what I'm going to do now is loop over the different radii and loop over these two centers.

158
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,490
So let's start with the radius loop.

159
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,560
So 4 are in and then here I was right.

160
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,660
And Peter Lin space from point five up to three.

161
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,420
And now I didn't tell you exactly how many circles you need.

162
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,180
Let's start with five.

163
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,880
And then here we want another loop.

164
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,820
Let's call this HDI for high in age.

165
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,730
So we have a loop that goes over radii and we have a loop that goes over the well the ages.

166
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,710
But this is really that the Centers for the two different circles.

167
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,740
Okay so now what I'm going to do is define the function for the circle.

168
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,240
So X minus and now it's high squared plus.

169
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,870
And you know you could write it Y minus zero squared but that's you know this is like formally correct

170
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,040
but it's a little bit redundant.

171
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:18,230
So I think it's easier to read like this minus r squared.

172
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:25,730
So this R is changing at each iteration of this loop and this center location is changing at each iteration

173
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,810
of this loop.

174
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:27,790
Okay.

175
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:38,360
So now we have our function and then we just plot a contour so plot dot contour X comma Y comma F of

176
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:46,760
X Y and then we want zero indicating that it's just gonna show the first contour.

177
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,180
All right.

178
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,700
So let's see then I do peel t the show and let's already see how this is looking.

179
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,000
All right.

180
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,250
So it's already looking pretty cool.

181
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,650
There's of course some more things we need to add to get this to look really good.

182
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:13,800
So I'm going to start by saying axis off and P L T that get current axis that set aspects to be equal.

183
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,390
All right.

184
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:20,270
Slowly looking better now one thing is there aren't enough circles here so let's try.

185
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,110
Let's go for 15 circles over here.

186
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,700
So 15 different routes 15 different radii.

187
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,140
Now it's 15.

188
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,960
There you go.

189
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,510
So this is the right number of circles.

190
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,640
There's only two things that are still missing.

191
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,480
One is the black line that goes from one center to the other center and the other is the color to make

192
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,410
the circles kind of fade off into the ether of non-existence as they get further away from the center.

193
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,540
It's going to start with this black line first.

194
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,000
So let's see this is gonna be P L T dot plot.

195
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,320
Now where do we want the plot to go.

196
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,910
It actually has to go from minus one point five to plus one point five.

197
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,020
So in fact this variable is already set for us.

198
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:12,580
So we just say h on the x axis and the y axis goes zero to zero.

199
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,020
And it should be a black line.

200
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,250
So this is kind of good except I want it to be a little bit thicker.

201
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,220
So how about line with equals 10.

202
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,520
Okay.

203
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,750
It's a little bit thick.

204
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,620
Maybe three.

205
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,520
Okay that looks a little bit better.

206
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,200
Right.

207
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,050
So now we need to change the color.

208
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
So colors equals.

209
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,280
And then this is gonna be the colors for the contour plot.

210
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:45,100
Now in this case we only need to specify one color because we just have one contour.

211
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:53,510
So for example if you set this to be like point four come a point four come a point four let's run this

212
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,820
code and see if that works.

213
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,200
Okay.

214
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:56,930
So that works.

215
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,110
But now every circle has the same grayscale.

216
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:08,750
So we need to figure out a way to make the color here be a function of r be a function of this to go

217
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,040
from point five to three.

218
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:20,600
Now these colors the way that Python once these colors specified it's in fractions of total RG B values.

219
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:28,310
So if you try to specify color values RG B values that are greater than 1 then you're going to get an

220
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,650
error it's actually really really longer.

221
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:37,130
So you can see it worked for a couple of circles but then after I guess the third circle this becomes

222
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,810
this value becomes larger than one.

223
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,550
So then what you can do is basically just divide this by something.

224
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:52,160
So it has to be divided by at least three because that's going to give us a result of 1 1 1 and then

225
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,010
if you like you can try some more value.

226
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,870
So you know you can say set the middle one which is the green let's make this a little bit smaller.

227
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,850
And here we have red.

228
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,360
Maybe I'll divide that by four.

229
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,480
And then you're gonna get some interesting different color patterns emerging.

230
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:17,150
But this is the set of colors that I used for the plot that I showed in the slides I hope you agree

231
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,520
that that was a really cool looking graphic using concentric circles.

232
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,810
And if you don't think that was a cool looking graphic if you think that was really boring and totally

233
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:34,250
lame then I challenge you to make a much nicer one and post it on the Q and A forum so you can make

234
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,510
a fool out of me.

235
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,250
I look forward to seeing your results.
