1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:11,170
The topic of this video is the singular value decomposition which is often abbreviated as S V D so singular

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,390
value decomposition.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:20,740
I'm going to show you the big picture of the SVOD and then we'll spend most of the time working in Python.

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,980
I will show you how to perform an SVOD and a little bit about how to interpret the results of an SVOD

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,430
and you will also learn about how to import pictures into the python workspace.

6
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,240
So let's begin.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,940
Here is a rather daunting looking picture.

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,370
This is the big overview of the s the D.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,960
So we start with some matrix A maybe that's a picture that's what I'll show in a moment.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,720
When we switched to Python maybe it's a data matrix.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,090
Now this matrix does not need to be square like with Icon decomposition.

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:02,850
So the idea of SVOD is to decompose this matrix A into the product of three other matrices.

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:12,820
Those matrices are called U Sigma and V transpose so you and V transpose are a little bit like the Ion

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:20,260
vectors in the sense that they point in directions that are invariant to multiplication by matrix A

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:28,540
and they identify important features or components in this matrix and these Sigma matrix is a diagonal

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:35,200
matrix so it's all zeros except for the diagonal elements which are going to contain non-zero values.

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Those are called these singular values of matrix A and these singular values are a little bit like the

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,240
eigenvalues that you learned about in a previous video.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,810
Now there is a ton to be said about the theory and applications and all the nitty gritty details of

20
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:59,980
SVOD how you create these matrices how to interpret them exactly how to use them in practical analysis

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:08,320
and so on but in the context of this video and this course the main idea is that The Matrix you and

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,880
the matrix v transpose are identifying features or patterns in Matrix a for a picture.

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,910
Those are like spatial patterns in the matrix and the singular values correspond to the importance of

24
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,590
those patterns.

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,860
So some patterns are more important and some patterns are less important.

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,310
Okay.

27
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,780
So with that said as a brief introduction let's switch to Python and have a look at what the LCD looks

28
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:43,640
like so we are going to need num pi and matte plot lib and I'm also going to import another function

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,010
from P I l import image with a capital I.

30
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,250
This is a function that we are going to use to import a picture from the disk.

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:05,170
So along with the code that you got for this section of the course you also got a JPEG file and that's

32
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,690
called so image dot open.

33
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:13,110
It's called Einstein dot j peg like this.

34
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,440
Okay.

35
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,790
So now I'm going to run this notice.

36
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,740
Didn't get any errors and give me Python warnings or messages and let's see what I and looks like.

37
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,440
I'm going to just look at these shapes so print.

38
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,450
Pi dot shape and then I'm.

39
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,020
So we see that this is a four hundred and five by three hundred and fourteen by three matrix.

40
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,310
So this corresponds to the rows and columns of the picture and the three.

41
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,320
Here this third dimension corresponds to the RG B or red green blue channels.

42
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:54,030
So we can view this image using P L T that I am show and P L T dot show.

43
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,840
Okay.

44
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,630
So here is this picture of Einstein you've probably seen this picture before.

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,340
It's a pretty famous one.

46
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:07,480
Now as I mentioned in the slides a moment ago these singular value decomposition is built for a two

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,580
dimensional matrix or matrix that has rows and columns not a cube of data.

48
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:19,330
If you want to decompose cubes or tensor is of data then you need to use different kinds of methods.

49
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:26,380
So what we need to do is basically get rid of this third dimension here and the way that I'm going to

50
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,540
do that is simply by averaging over the color dimension.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,910
And that's going to transform this picture from having our G.B. intensities at each pixel even though

52
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,270
it's a grayscale map it still has RG B values and instead it's just going to be an intensity image.

53
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,740
So we're going to get the intensity of the image.

54
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,630
So the total brightness of the image at each pixel.

55
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,280
So the way that I'm going to do that is by simply replacing the matrix ion.

56
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,810
So this variable with itself except it's going to be the means.

57
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:10,180
So no I don't mean of iron and then I'm adding a comma to here because I want to average over dimension

58
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,750
number two.

59
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,400
So this would be the zero with dimension the first dimension and the second dimension here.

60
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,390
So the colored dimension so and then actually I'm gonna put this line before the print sign.

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,480
OK.

62
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,540
So now we see a couple of changes.

63
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,910
First of all we lose the three here.

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,360
So this is now just a two dimensional matrix and now we have also lost the color scaling or the gray

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,200
scaling so we just see this image in intensity.

66
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,530
Now I'm going to compute the singular value decomposition.

67
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,040
So the function is known pi.

68
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,540
Lin ouch dot SVOD and then we input the matrix and now there's going to be three outputs they are in

69
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,380
order.

70
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,970
S sorry you comma s comma V.

71
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,970
So this is the U matrix.

72
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,230
This is the singular values.

73
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,090
And then this is the V matrix.

74
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:12,460
Now it's interesting to have a look at these things so I'm going to print out the shape num Pi the shape

75
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,640
of you and then repeat this for S and V.

76
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,680
So here is V and here is s.

77
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:29,530
So you see that you and v are both square matrices but they're not the same size as the original matrix

78
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:39,340
in fact you is a square matrix and that is the number of columns and V is a square matrix that corresponds

79
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,020
to the number of rows and s here is actually not a matrix it's just a vector.

80
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:53,140
So in the slides I illustrated that s was a diagonal matrix but here num pi just exported these second

81
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,840
variable as a vector.

82
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,770
So what I'd like to do now is show some images of these three matrices and I'm also gonna need to convert

83
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,380
this into a matrix.

84
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,460
So let's see I'm going to show this in subplots that are all next to each other.

85
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:18,120
So p t that subplots this is going to be a one by three geometry three because we have three matrices.

86
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:28,370
So let's see in the first axis we make an image of you and I will set the title to be set.

87
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,460
Title you.

88
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,140
Okay.

89
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,180
And then the next one we have was let's see.

90
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,700
So then the first index is going to be s and we're gonna have to figure out a way to fix this.

91
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,450
I'm also going to make the title be later coding for Sigma.

92
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,200
So this is going to give us the uppercase Greek letter sigma and then here we have v and that's also

93
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,590
called V over here.

94
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,110
Okay.

95
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,030
P L T the show and then I notice almost made a mistake here.

96
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,100
Oh maybe I did actually make a mistake.

97
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,490
So you plotted correctly and then it crashed at plotting.

98
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,940
S It says invalid dimensions for image data.

99
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,200
That's the key part of this error message here.

100
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,470
We're trying to make an image but this is actually just a vector.

101
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,080
So what we want to do is convert this into a diagonal matrix.

102
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:39,640
So I'm going to write MP dot the bag of S and now we see the you matrix the V matrix and the Sigma matrix.

103
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,580
Now it doesn't really look like there's anything here it looks like.

104
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,780
You don't really see any thing on the diagonal or off the diagonal.

105
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,620
And that's really because of the scaling of these segments.

106
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,470
And I'm going to show you the scaling in a moment but for now what I want to do is just take the log

107
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,820
of these values so end PDA log and really all this is doing is compressing down the really really large

108
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,010
values so that the large values and the small values are all more or less in the same scale.

109
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,000
So here you see a square matrix that corresponds to Sigma.

110
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,010
Now what I showed in the slides is actually not a matrix of this size I showed in the slides that Sigma

111
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,250
is actually a matrix.

112
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,530
That's the same size as the image.

113
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,850
It's still a diagonal matrix but it's the same size as the image.

114
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,710
So this is actually probably not really the right way to represent Sigma and that is something that

115
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,820
you should keep in mind in the exercises.

116
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:45,420
But before getting to the exercises I want to explore this Sigma a little bit more.

117
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,930
So these singular values and in particular what I'm going to do is plot them.

118
00:09:49,930 --> 00:10:01,230
So let's say plot s and I'm going to make this black squares and with a marker face equal to whites.

119
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,180
So let's see what this thing looks like.

120
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,210
Whoops.

121
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,590
What did I do wrong.

122
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,160
Right.

123
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,470
This should be marker face color.

124
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,030
Apologies for that.

125
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,900
Okay.

126
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,890
So here you see all of these segments.

127
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,200
And you can see that most of them are really really really really tiny.

128
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,040
And a couple of them are large and there's one that's huge.

129
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,940
So in fact I would like to zoom in here a little bit.

130
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,520
So let's say peel T dot X limb.

131
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,470
Let's go from about zero to 50.

132
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,060
Let's see how that looks.

133
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,060
So zero actually cuts off this one a little bit.

134
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,220
How about minus one to 50.

135
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,540
Okay.

136
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,740
And then I'll put in a title because I want you to see what this is called.

137
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:52,930
So this thing when you make a plot of these singular values it is often called an icon spectrum.

138
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,680
And I'll even call this an icon spectrum of Einstein.

139
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,600
So I again spectrum that's what this sort of thing is typically called.

140
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,590
Now what does this mean.

141
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,270
What do these numbers mean.

142
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:10,900
Well as I mentioned in the slides the idea is that there are patterns that are encoded into the columns

143
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:18,580
of you and the rows of V transpose and those patterns are telling us about the important features of

144
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,630
this picture.

145
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:27,260
This matrix here now the patterns that are stored in U and V transpose don't have any importance.

146
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,920
They just have a direction.

147
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,260
So they just point to a pattern in the matrix.

148
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,960
It's these singular values that identify the importance of each feature.

149
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,730
So what this is telling us is that there is one big spatial feature that's really prominent in this

150
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,320
image.

151
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:49,240
And then there's a couple more maybe like half a dozen maybe there's six or seven features that are

152
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,720
also pretty important in this picture in this matrix.

153
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,330
And then there's a lot of other features in the data that just aren't really important.

154
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,510
They don't take up a lot of variance in the picture.

155
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:07,630
Now this ability of the singular value decomposition to identify important features that are distributed

156
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:15,460
across a matrix or across the data set is exactly why the SVOD and the icon value decomposition are

157
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:23,480
so important in machine learning and A.I. in this video I introduced you to the big picture idea of

158
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,670
the SVOD.

159
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,410
Of course there are many details and subtleties and applications of the SVOD that I just don't have

160
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,710
time to get into.

161
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,070
But I hope you at least get a bit of a sense of what the SVOD can do.

162
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,740
And if you want to learn more about working with the SVOD then keep watching because the next video

163
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:50,300
will contain an exercise that will allow you to explore the effects of using the SVOD to reconstruct

164
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,140
the Einstein picture.

165
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,110
So I will see you in a moment.
