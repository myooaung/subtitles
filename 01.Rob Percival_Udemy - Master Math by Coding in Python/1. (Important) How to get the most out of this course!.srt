00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,140
I made this course for you.
1

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,610
I want you to do well.
2

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,080
I want you to succeed.
3

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,480
And I want you to get the most out of this course that you possibly can.
4

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,350
And so in this video I'm going to give you a few tips for how you can proceed through this course to
5

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,470
maximize your learning experience.
6

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,650
So here are five main points.
7

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,000
And now I'm going to spend about a minute talking about each of these points.
8

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,560
First of all it's important to make sure you understand what this course is all about.
9

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,870
This course is about implementing math expressions and equations and concepts in Python.
10

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,690
It's not a course about a lot of theoretical or abstract math.
11

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,440
Now, I do explain all the concepts in the slides before switching to code but I spend more time working
12

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,950
on implementing math concepts in code than I do working through lots of examples and intricate details.
13

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,710
So the idea of this course is for you to learn how to use python as a tool to help you learn the math.
14

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,480
That means you are going to get the most out of this course
15

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,360
if you treat this course as a supplement alongside another math course in high school or university
16

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,950
or an online course, something that goes into the theory and the abstract features of math.
17

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,190
The reason why python is such a powerful tool for learning mathematics is that python can deal with
18

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,120
all of the implementation details and that allows you to focus on the important concepts.
19

20
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:45,450
It allows you to build intuition based on going through lots of examples, and importantly a lot of visualizations.
20

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,520
In the videos
21

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,090
I spend a lot of time going through code and explaining code and encouraging you to write code based
22

23
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,150
on exercises that I give.
23

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,400
But math and programming are not spectator sports.
24

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,930
So if you just watch the videos without working in Python yourself, then that's still pretty good.
25

26
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,000
You're definitely going to learn something.
26

27
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,390
But if you really want to deeply get involved in the learning, if you really want to master math, then
27

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:22,830
it's a good idea to have the video open and have Python open at the same time, so you can code as you're
28

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,630
watching the video.
29

30
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,710
One of the amazing things about video based and online learning is that unlike in real life, you can
30

31
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,560
pause the video whenever you want. So don't hesitate to pause the video when I'm in the middle of explaining
31

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,290
something.
32

33
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,490
You can see if you can code faster than me, you can see how I setup the code and then you can change
33

34
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,900
the code as you like.
34

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,960
And relatedly -- and perhaps most importantly -- you should think of my code more as starting code to
35

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,130
help you get started. After you see the code that I've written,
36

37
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:02,470
you can change the variables in the equations or the parameters or the colors of the plots and so on.
37

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,110
As I already mentioned, the best way to learn is by doing.
38

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:14,790
And that's why I have an exercise associated with every single video and also larger projects at the
39

40
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,360
end of every section of the course.
40

41
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,580
I go through all of these solutions to the exercises but you should also definitely try your best
41

42
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,940
to solve the exercises before you watch me solve them.
42

43
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,880
It's important to keep in mind that there are many correct ways to code.
43

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,270
So if your solution looks a bit different from my solution then as long as the end result is accurate
44

45
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,400
it's OK if you set up your code differently from how I set up my code.
45

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,610
As I mentioned in the previous slide, you should consider the code that I presented to be kind of beginner
46

47
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,750
code that helps inspire you helps you continue on your own.
47

48
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,310
Changing the code, improving the code and therefore getting the most out of this course.
48

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,300
Math and programming are not easy.
49

50
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,260
Anyone who tells you that coding is easy and math is easy is probably just trying to trick you.
50

51
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,360
But the hard work leads to big rewards.
51

52
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,630
I really believe that you have to embrace the course and embrace the learning experience, which includes
52

53
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,540
a little bit of frustration
53

54
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:27,600
every now and then. And I really believe that if this course weren't challenging then it would get boring
54

55
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,140
and it wouldn't be worth your time or your investment.
55

56
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:37,190
And speaking of investments, your brain is the most valuable and precious resource that you have.
56

57
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,710
So invest in yourself, invest in your brain, invest in your future. And you should already be happy and
57

58
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,070
proud of yourself that you are doing the right thing by learning math and learning coding.
58

59
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:56,610
The final point is that you should take advantage of your lifetime access to this course. As long as
59

60
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,170
human civilization continues to support electricity and the Internet,
60

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,780
you will be able to access this course. So you don't need to rush through the course as quickly as you
61

62
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,550
can.
62

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,470
You should feel free to come back and re-watch videos that you've already gone through and you can
63

64
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,150
always come back to this course in the future.
64

65
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,320
And in fact, that's a good idea because I periodically add new videos and maybe even entire new sections
65

66
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,380
to this course.
66

67
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,490
So you should come back and check out what's new.
67

68
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,100
I designed this course to flow in a specific order that the course is presented in.
68

69
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,020
So I do recommend going through the course videos in order.
69

70
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,800
However, that is really just my recommendation.
70

71
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:45,090
You should definitely feel free to skip around in the course and watch some later videos even if you
71

72
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,150
haven't completed the earlier sections.
72

73
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,660
That's all I have to say to get the most out of this course.
73

74
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,230
Good luck.
74

75
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,490
Have fun and I look forward to seeing you in the rest of the course.
