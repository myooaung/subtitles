00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.990
So far I've showed you how to add and subtract polynomials.
1

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.790
I've showed you how to multiply polynomials and now in this video, I'm going to show you how to divide
2

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.490
polynomials in python.
3

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.430
Now this is a really great use case.
4

5
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.010
This is a really great example of why using computers to do math is great.
5

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.450
And that's because dividing polynomials by hand is a total nightmare.
6

7
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.420
It's really hard.
7

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.560
It's really tedious.
8

9
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.420
It takes a really long time.
9

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.170
So if you have to divide this polynomial by this polynomial you end up needing to write out some really
10

11
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.660
long long division.
11

12
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.700
So a long long division problem, but fortunately we are going to solve this in Python so we are going
12

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.540
to use python as a fancy calculator to solve a problem like this all for us.
13

14
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.840
Okay.
14

15
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:04.210
And so the way that works is by defining the polynomial. So let's start with... How about four times x to
15

16
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.970
the fifth power minus X and then polynomial two and we'll make this be the denominator.
16

17
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.560
So P1 is gonna be the numerator and P2 will be the denominator.
17

18
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.770
Let's make this two times X cubed minus X as well.
18

19
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.960
So now let's see.
19

20
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.630
I'm going to display the fractions.
20

21
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.100
So display math.
21

22
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.160
So let's see how shall we display this as a fraction.
22

23
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.950
So you already know how to use the slash slash frac latex code.
23

24
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.040
So there we need a pair of curly brackets for the numerator and a pair of curly brackets for the denominator.
24

25
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.630
So put percent s in here.
25

26
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.960
Percent s in here and equals and then let's have another percent s here.
26

27
00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.050
And essentially what I'm going to do is first use latex to explicitly write out the P1 is in the numerator
27

28
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.450
P2 is in the denominator and then here I'm gonna say P1 divided by P2.
28

29
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.340
So let's see.
29

30
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.720
So the first replacement is going to be sym dot latex P1.
30

31
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.950
The second replacement will be sym dot latex P2 and then a third replacement will the sym dot latex
31

32
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.320
P1 divided by P2.
32

33
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.430
So let's see how this looks.
33

34
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.840
Huh.
34

35
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.100
So that's pretty interesting.
35

36
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.320
So when I wrote explicitly in a fraction versus when I just divided these two polynomials as symbolic
36

37
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.450
expressions, and then made a latex version out of that, we got exactly the same result.
37

38
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.070
So now it's interesting to try a few different ways, so let's copy and paste this code.
38

39
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.680
And now what I'm going to do is expand this division here.
39

40
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.100
So let's write some dot expand and let's see how that looks... huh, that's interesting.
40

41
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.210
So this looks in fact a little bit different.
41

42
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.170
And what you can see is that sympy broke up the numerator to have individual terms.
42

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:13.930
So this is four times x to the fifth power over this denominator minus X divided by this denominator.
43

44
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.840
Now these two denominators are the same.
44

45
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.450
So of course you can combine these two terms into one.
45

46
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.640
However, we asked sympy to expand the terms and here is what simply did.
46

47
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.030
Okay.
47

48
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.540
And now I want to run another test, except instead of expanding I want to simplify.
48

49
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.530
So I'm going to replace expand with simplify
49

50
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.010
OK so this is pretty interesting.
50

51
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.480
Now in this case Python actually did the division of this polynomial into this polynomial and their
51

52
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.330
results happened to be two x squared plus one.
52

53
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:03.090
So that means that two X cubed minus X goes into four X to the fifth power minus X.
53

54
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.480
Exactly two x squared times one plus one times.
54

55
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.770
Okay.
55

56
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.430
So that's basically all there is to know about division of polynomials in sympy.
56

57
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.440
Now I'd like to tell you about the exercise for this video.
57

58
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.780
So what you want to do is implement this polynomial division.
58

59
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.200
So this polynomial divided by this polynomial. Now notice that this polynomial actually has two variables.
59

60
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.930
There's X and there's a bunch of X terms in the numerator and in the denominator.
60

61
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.330
And then there's this term minus Y, which is present only in the numerator.
61

62
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.460
So the question is what is a value of y that will give you a result that has no fraction.
62

63
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.510
So that is to say, if you set y to be equal to 5 for example and then you implement this division the
63

64
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.880
result is going to be another fraction.
64

65
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.600
Now it turns out that there is at least one number between 5 and 15 might be one number might be two
65

66
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.920
or maybe three numbers.
66

67
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.480
But there is at least one value of y -- one integer value of y -- between 5 and 15 such that when you set
67

68
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:21.570
y to be that number or those numbers then this result, this division, gives you another polynomial. But
68

69
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.710
it's a polynomial that is not a fraction.
69

70
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.700
And your job is to find that.
70

71
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.610
So what you want to do is implement this in a for loop that loops over different values of Y from five
71

72
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:41.700
to 15 in integers and determine whether the result of this fraction of this division is a fraction or
72

73
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.440
not.
73

74
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.440
And the hint is that you want to use, or you can I recommend using, a function in the sympy module called
74

75
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.090
dot fraction.
75

76
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.440
Now I haven't yet told you how to use this function and that was on purpose.
76

77
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:03.000
I would like you to figure out on your own; how to use this sympy fraction function and how to use the
77

78
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.800
information from the,
78

79
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.140
so the output of this fraction function, in order to help you solve this problem.
79

80
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.440
All right.
80

81
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.430
So good luck.
81

82
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.940
Pause the video now and work through this on your own in Python.
82

83
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.710
And then when you're ready or if you get stuck then come back to the video.
83

84
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:27.610
Now I will switch to Python so I'm going to start here by giving you a little bit of a primer on using
84

85
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.110
the fraction function.
85

86
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.290
So let's start by creating some fraction.
86

87
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.560
I'll call this variable F and that's going to be let's say three divided by four.
87

88
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:44.500
Now I've already showed you in a previous video that Python is actually going to implement this division
88

89
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.490
and represent this not as three divided by four but instead as point seventy five.
89

90
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.130
So what we can do is say sympy dot sympify.
90

91
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:04.100
Now we are representing the numerator not as the number three but as the symbolic number three.
91

92
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:12.040
And now F is the symbolic object or the this mathematical expression three divided by four.
92

93
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.270
OK.
93

94
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:19.780
So let's see what happens when I get f info, I'll call this variable finfo equals sym dot fraction 
94

95
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.000
F.
95

96
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:28.840
So let's start by just printing out f info and here we get in parentheses three comma four.
96

97
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.320
Let's see what is the type of this variable.
97

98
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.120
So this is called a tuple.
98

99
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:41.280
It's a python variable class called a tuple and essentially it's just holding this information.
99

100
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.730
So tuple sounds like a funny word but it's just a way of storing this information.
100

101
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.360
So three and then 4.
101

102
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.540
Now you probably already guessed that this is the numerator and this is the denominator.
102

103
00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:00.760
So to access just the numerator we can access the first element of this tuple and we do that with a
103

104
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.000
square bracket after the variable and then 0.
104

105
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.600
And that gives 3.
105

106
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.340
And of course the second element we access with the number one of the index 1 and that is 4.
106

107
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.600
OK.
107

108
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.560
So with that in mind.
108

109
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:21.070
Now I'm going to show you what happens when we just have the symbolic number three.
109

110
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:26.080
Now f infos so the output of simple out fraction is three comma one.
110

111
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.600
And that's because three is the same thing as three divided by one.
111

112
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.510
And that is the key insight into solving the problem.
112

113
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.520
So if you are working through the exercise and you couldn't quite figure it out you couldn't quite get
113

114
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.260
to a solution, then
114

115
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:45.090
I hope that now you have enough information to work through a solution.
115

116
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.890
So feel free to pause the video again and continue working.
116

117
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.110
OK.
117

118
00:08:51.150 --> 00:09:00.100
So I'm going to start by creating some new variables, let's say Pnum so numerator for the polynomial
118

119
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.920
in the numerator.
119

120
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:11.750
That was X to the sixth power plus two times X to the fourth power plus six times x minus y.
120

121
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.150
And I just now realized that I haven't yet created a symbolic variable Y.
121

122
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.630
I'll get to that in a minute.
122

123
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:24.060
So the polynomial in the denominator was X cubed plus three.
123

124
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.550
So let's see.
124

125
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.770
I will also recreate X just to be on the safe side.
125

126
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.820
So X comma Y equals sym
126

127
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.190
dot symbols X comma Y.
127

128
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.990
Okay, so ran this l don't get any errors already.
128

129
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.340
Good sign.
129

130
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:47.740
Now what I want to do is essentially loop through different values of Y in the range of 5 to 15.
130

131
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:54.190
So for I maybe I call this Y in range 5.
131

132
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.240
And now we want the numbers to go up to 15.
132

133
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.060
So therefore the top index here has to be 16.
133

134
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:08.500
So my strategy for solving this problem is I'm going to divide the numerator by the denominator while
134

135
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.190
substituting in for different values of Y.
135

136
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.930
And then I'm going to use this fraction function and basically test whether the fraction or the denominator
136

137
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.780
of the fraction is equal to 1.
137

138
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.570
So now I'm going to create a new variable for the numerator.
138

139
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.570
Let's call this tempnum.
139

140
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.790
So temporary num
140

141
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:35.710
And often when people write the word temp in their variable names it's because they're only using a
141

142
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.650
variable for one or maybe two lines.
142

143
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.220
And otherwise they don't really care about it.
143

144
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:56.650
So let's say that is p num dot subs, and here I want to substitute y for Y so wherever y appears in
144

145
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.700
this polynomial we're going to replace that with Y i.
145

146
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.400
Which of course is the different numbers in this range here.
146

147
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:03.730
Okay.
147

148
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.410
And then actually before moving too much further I want to print this out just to make sure that this
148

149
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.160
is looking good.
149

150
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:17.890
So let's say display math and then I want to write out the fraction and then say what it is equal to
150

151
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.730
if it reduces.
151

152
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:28.900
So percent S equals percent s and then I'm going to substitute the first one with sym dot latex.
152

153
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:36.040
Now this is not P num with a capital N like this here; instead I'm gonna substitute temp num here.
153

154
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.980
So tempnum for numerator divided by P denominator.
154

155
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.440
Now this polynomial of course never changes it's always stays the same.
155

156
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.460
So that was the first substitution and then the second substitution is essentially the same except that
156

157
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:59.710
we want to simplify like what we did here. So I will say assume that latex and then sympy simplify and
157

158
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.240
then the same things that tempnum divided by P denominator.
158

159
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.520
All right.
159

160
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.290
So let's run this code and see if we get some results.
160

161
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:08.640
All right.
161

162
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.840
So this is looking pretty good.
162

163
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:19.030
And it's also pretty interesting to see that all of these cases have a, so in a simplified case we have
163

164
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:25.120
still a denominator of X cubed plus three, except for this one here.
164

165
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.340
So that's where y equals nine.
165

166
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:34.300
So we found our result but I would like to add a little bit more code to this for loop so that this
166

167
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.800
is identified automatically and print it out in text in words at the very bottom.
167

168
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.240
Okay.
168

169
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:47.890
So therefore what I'm going to do is identify the fraction of this division, so I'm going to write it
169

170
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.940
like this
170

171
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:59.130
so this fraction the numerator divided by the denominator dot fraction and then what we care about is
171

172
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.320
not the first element in this tuple but the second.
172

173
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:09.540
So that's going to be number one and we want to know if this is equal to 1 like this.
173

174
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.210
So here remember we didn't have a...
174

175
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.020
So this wasn't actually a real fraction.
175

176
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.190
So the denominator is just one.
176

177
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.410
And so that's the case here implicitly.
177

178
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.950
You could divide this expression by 1.
178

179
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.730
And it's exactly the same expression.
179

180
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:35.100
So let's say if we treat this as a fraction and in fact this needs to be sym dot simplify just like
180

181
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.990
we had over here.
181

182
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:43.080
So simplify this fraction and then extract the two parts of the fraction out of it -- the numerator and
182

183
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:52.680
denominator. If the denominator is equal to 1 then that means we have gotten the right answer equals
183

184
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.350
Y.
184

185
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:54.960
Okay.
185

186
00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:03.480
And then when this whole for loop is finished, I want to print out that the correct answer --
186

187
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:16.530
well I should say the answer that satisfies our goal, is Y equals percent G and then percent right answer.
187

188
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:16.830
Okay.
188

189
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:22.120
So I hope I haven't made any coding errors up and it looks like I have all right.
189

190
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.790
So dot fraction is not a method here we need it as its own function.
190

191
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.110
It's a sympy function, so this has to say sym dot fraction.
191

192
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.330
My apologies for that mistake.
192

193
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.880
So let's see.
193

194
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:42.660
So now we take the numerator with the Y replaced, divided by the denominator and then we simplify that
194

195
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:53.340
and then we take that as an input into fraction and then we want the second item in that the output
195

196
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.290
of that function.
196

197
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:55.520
Okay.
197

198
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.070
So here we get the same result that we saw earlier.
198

199
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:06.720
And this says the answer that satisfies our goal is Y equals nine, which we can confirm here visually.
199

200
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:12.240
So if there's anything that you learned in this video then I hope it's that that exercise would have
200

201
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.870
been a total nightmare to do by hand.
201

202
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:21.450
So be thankful be grateful that we have computers and numerical software programs like Python to do
202

203
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:28.700
all of the hard algebra for us and we can focus more on the concepts, and the meaning of the math and
203

204
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:34.380
that is kind of generally the point of this course: if you use python if you learn how to use python
204

205
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:40.290
as a tool for helping you with mathematics, then that kind of frees up your your mind; it frees up your
205

206
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:47.760
mental workspace to focus on important concepts and ideas in mathematics and principles as opposed to
206

207
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.770
getting bogged down in the little arithmetic details. Anyway,
207

208
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:58.860
there is still more information about working with polynomials in Python so I hope you will continue
208

209
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.090
watching to the next video.
