00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,640
In this video I'm going to show you how to compute powers, that is exponents, using Python.
1

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,640
I'll also introduce you to the law of exponents in case you're not familiar with the law of exponents.
2

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,090
If you are familiar with the law of exponents, then this will be a useful reminder.
3

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,960
And you're also going to learn a little bit more about printing out really nice looking mathematical
4

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,560
expressions in python using LaTeX.
5

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,950
So raising one number to a power of another number in this case three to the power of two, which is also
6

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,110
called three squared, simply means multiplying the base number by itself
7

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:50,010
this number of times. So three squared equals three times three and therefore three to the Power of Four
8

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,610
means three times three times three times three.
9

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,450
So we have four threes that all get multiplied here.
10

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,720
Then we get to something called the law of exponents which sounds really fancy and formal but it basically
11

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,190
just means that if you have the same base then you can add the exponents.
12

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,580
So in this case we have three to the power of two times three to the power of four.
13

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,310
And this is equivalent to -- this is the same thing as -- we can rewrite this expression as three to the power
14

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,470
of two plus four.
15

16
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,890
And you have to be mindful that the plus four is also in the exponent here.
16

17
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,940
So this is not three squared plus four this is three to the power of two plus four which is three to
17

18
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,390
the power of six.
18

19
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,490
And basically that means multiplying three out six times.
19

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:46,200
Now the law of exponents also states that this is only possible when the base is the same.
20

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,480
So in this case we have three to the power of two times four to the power of three.
21

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,830
And you can't really simplify this much further, so you can write out three times three which is this
22

23
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:05,160
term times four times four times four which is this term and then you can multiply them altogether.
23

24
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,080
But it's not possible to simplify the exponents because the base term is different.
24

25
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,360
OK.
25

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,950
So now let's switch to Python and see how to compute powers in python
26

27
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:27,650
so to put a number into an exponent in python you actually use an asterisk, but a double asterisk.
27

28
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,160
So this might seem a little bit confusing at first because a single asterisk like this one star means
28

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,970
to multiply.
29

30
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,700
So here the answer would be three times two which is six.
30

31
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,930
But in this case we say three star star.
31

32
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,650
So two asterisks and then two.
32

33
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,920
And that means to raise three to the second power.
33

34
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:54,920
So there the answer is going to be nine of course because three times three is nine. One easy to make
34

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,810
mistake is say three caret.
35

36
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,690
-- This is called the caret symbol -- two.
36

37
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:08,040
Now when you're writing out exponents in text on computers people often use this caret symbol like this.
37

38
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,520
So sometimes people would write an expression like this and they mean three squared.
38

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,150
However in Python the caret symbol is something else.
39

40
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,540
This refers to the X or logical problem. I'm not going to cover that
40

41
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,300
in this video, but it's pretty easy to see that this gives you the wrong answer.
41

42
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,610
So three caret two is not the same thing as three squared.
42

43
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,220
So you just have to be a bit mindful of that.
43

44
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,790
Powers are always indicated with two asterisks.
44

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,580
Of course you can also use variables like you've learned in previous videos.
45

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,210
I can say x equals two and then three to the power of x is going to be nine.
46

47
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:55,190
And now it's really easy for me to change this to let's say six and then three to the power of six turns
47

48
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,160
out to be seven hundred and twenty nine.
48

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,570
Okay.
49

50
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,540
Let's make a little demonstration of the law of exponents.
50

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,320
So I'm going to say three to the power of three, which is twenty seven because three times three is nine
51

52
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,860
and then times three again is twenty seven.
52

53
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,450
So therefore three times three times three must also be twenty seven.
53

54
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,570
And you know by now by this point in the course you know that this is not going to print out twenty
54

55
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,820
seven twice because the output of this expression doesn't get printed.
55

56
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,560
Only the output of the final expression in each cell gets printed out.
56

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,380
So instead I'm going to use the print function, so print here and then another print here.
57

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,470
And now this is going to print out twenty seven twice this first twenty seven corresponds to this expression
58

59
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,430
and this corresponds to this expression.
59

60
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,950
Now what I'd like to do is use python to illustrate the concept that I showed in the slides that if
60

61
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:05,480
you have two numbers taken to the same power, multiplied by each other, you can add the exponent and keep
61

62
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,900
the base the same.
62

63
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,770
So I think I'll even use the example that I showed in the slide.
63

64
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:17,380
So that was three to the power of two times three to the power of four.
64

65
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,360
Now there's a lot of asterisks going on here in this line.
65

66
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,110
So it may look a little confusing at first but notice that I'm using spaces to separate this term from
66

67
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,280
this term.
67

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,770
As I mentioned in a previous video, you can write it out like this with no spaces and you get exactly
68

69
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,190
the same result.
69

70
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:42,470
However, adding spaces like this makes the expression a little bit easier to interpret.
70

71
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:50,120
Now if you're wondering why Python knows that this should be three squared times three to the four and
71

72
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,540
not for example grouping these terms together so three to the power of six and then that to the power
72

73
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,350
of four.
73

74
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,840
That's because of something called the order of operations.
74

75
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,450
I mentioned this term before.
75

76
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,130
Order of operations.
76

77
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,880
I'm going to have a whole video about order of operations.
77

78
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,210
OK.
78

79
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,540
And now what I want to do is write on a separate line three to the power of.
79

80
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,470
And now I want to say two plus four.
80

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,830
So if I would write two plus four out like this.
81

82
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,210
This is actually not going to be the right answer here.
82

83
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,160
Python is prioritizing exponential rating over additions.
83

84
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:34,460
So I'm going to use parentheses to show Python that I want to associate the two and the four together
84

85
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,100
with the plus operation.
85

86
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,770
And then this result which is six of course that goes into the exponent of three.
86

87
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,220
And now we run this and we get seven hundred and twenty nine in both cases. And this is a great lead
87

88
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:55,760
in to the next concept that I want to illustrate to you which is taking a number to a fractional power
88

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,980
such as the square root.
89

90
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:05,770
So for example we know that the square root of 4 is 2 because two times two equals four.
90

91
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,250
Now later on in the course you're going to learn other ways of computing a square root.
91

92
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,260
But for now I'm going to show you computing the square root using fractional powers.
92

93
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,560
So we can say four to the power of one half.
93

94
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,020
So you indicate the square root
94

95
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,020
using a power of one half.
95

96
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,300
But again we need to use parentheses here to make sure that Python knows that we mean to put one half
96

97
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,890
in the exponent and not one in the exponent and then divide the result by two.
97

98
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,590
So now you see that four to the power of one half is two.
98

99
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,020
And again that makes sense because two times two equals four.
99

100
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,260
Now I'm going to show you what would happen if you accidentally left the parentheses off the answer.
100

101
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,700
Well again the answer is two because now four to the power of one is four.
101

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,650
And then that divided by two.
102

103
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,490
Let's try this with nine. So nine to the power of one divided by two is 4.5.
103

104
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,600
However if I add parentheses here I get nine to the power of one half which is the square root of nine.
104

105
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,280
And that gives me three.
105

106
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,660
Okay.
106

107
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,130
So now you know how to implement exponents in Python.
107

108
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:20,140
What I want to do now is show you how to make beautiful looking equations in the Jupiter notebook.
108

109
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,030
Using LaTeX coating.
109

110
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,620
So this is a follow up of what I've discussed in previous videos.
110

111
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,160
So you remember from previous videos that we had display, Math and then we can write for example one
111

112
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,810
plus two equals three.
112

113
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,670
Now when I tried to run this cell I get an error it says name
113

114
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,010
Math is not defined.
114

115
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,250
And the reason is that we haven't called this function math or the display function into the current
115

116
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,500
work session of Python.
116

117
00:08:50,500 --> 00:09:00,140
And so to do that you might remember this from a previous video we have to type from Ipython dot display
117

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
import display.
118

119
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,790
And we also want to import math.
119

120
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,460
So importing these functions from this module is something that you're going to have to do every time
120

121
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,510
you open up a new Python session.
121

122
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,580
As long as you're working in the same Python session,
122

123
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,910
so within this notebook, you only need to run a line like this once. But every time you open up a new
123

124
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,090
session you will need to run this line of code again in order to import these special functions.
124

125
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,320
OK.
125

126
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,990
So now I can run this code and I get one plus two equals three in nice formatting.
126

127
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,860
So what I'm going to do now is write out these two expressions here.
127

128
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,610
So I'm going to say three and now we want to the power of two.
128

129
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,520
Now here's where things are getting a little bit confusing with indicating the exponents because in
129

130
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Python code you use two asterisks like this.
130

131
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,330
However I'm not writing Python code here.
131

132
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,790
I'm actually writing latex code inside this math function.
132

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:06,260
So the correct way to do it is not three star star 3 that's actually just going to give me three star
133

134
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,370
star or two.
134

135
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,150
I should said two instead of three. Instead in latex,
135

136
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:18,440
you actually do use this caret symbol here, so you have a caret symbol here and the number or letter
136

137
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,110
immediately after the caret is going to go into the exponent. You can see why this gets a little bit
137

138
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:30,380
confusing, because in Python itself you use a double asterisk to indicate powers.
138

139
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,510
But here in latex you have to use this caret symbol.
139

140
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,830
Okay.
140

141
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,260
Now obviously three squared does not equal three.
141

142
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,820
So we should change this.
142

143
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,750
I went to write three squared times.
143

144
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,400
This is a double slash here.
144

145
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,370
Times three to the power of four.
145

146
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,210
And I'm going to run this cell again just to make sure that this looks good.
146

147
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,680
Okay.
147

148
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,940
So this looks good.
148

149
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,350
Three squared times three to the power four obviously does not equal three.
149

150
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:03,210
I need to change this part equals so I want this to say three to the power of two plus four.
150

151
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,060
However if I just write it like this I get three squared plus four.
151

152
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:15,070
So what we need to do here is tell latex to associate all of these characters to these three characters
152

153
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:22,160
the to the plus sign and the four with this superscript indicator. And the way that you do that in latex
153

154
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,170
is by encasing these in curly brackets.
154

155
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,710
So notice these are curly brackets here.
155

156
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:31,880
These are not parentheses like these are this simple round parentheses.
156

157
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,850
These are curly brackets.
157

158
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,740
So there we go.
158

159
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,360
This formatting looks really nice.
159

160
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,660
Three to the power of two times three to the power of four equals three to the power of two plus four
160

161
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,580
now it's time for the exercises for this video.
161

162
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:57,570
There are three exercises here and what you want to do is define two variables: x equals five, Y equals
162

163
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,860
five point one. And then implement these three equations and make sure you get the correct answer.
163

164
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,840
So X to the power of three divided by four.
164

165
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,030
Be mindful that this is a fractional exponent.
165

166
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,830
So it's three divided by four all in the exponent.
166

167
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,030
And what you should do is not only implement these equations to make sure you get the correct result,
167

168
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:25,860
but also display these using the display math functions and latex coding as I've shown in a previous
168

169
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,370
video.
169

170
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,050
And in this video of course you learned how to do this exponential nation.
170

171
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,630
So good luck working through this exercise.
171

172
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,590
Now is your chance to pause the video switch to Python on your own.
172

173
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,040
Implement these three equations, and then when you're finished come back to the video and you can watch
173

174
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,570
me solve this problem
174

175
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:48,800
all right.
175

176
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,610
So now I'm going to work through the exercises.
176

177
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,300
So let's start by setting X equals five and Y equals 5.1.
177

178
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,820
So for the first problem we had something to say the answer equals x to the power of three divided by
178

179
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,330
four.
179

180
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,320
And remember that you have to put the three fourths in parentheses here.
180

181
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,850
Times four to the power of y.
181

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,760
And then I will display that, so I'll say display math.
182

183
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,190
And now I'm going to follow the latex coding that I illustrated up here.
183

184
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,860
So these this concept up here.
184

185
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,080
So this is X to the power of....
185

186
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,360
and then in curly brackets, three divided by four.
186

187
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,110
And then we have times four to the power of y equals
187

188
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,590
And then we need a %g and then out here percent ans.
188

189
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:52,670
I remember I don't need to import the display and math functions again because I've already imported
189

190
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,030
them in this cell up here.
190

191
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,600
Okay.
191

192
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,810
So this looks nice and this gives us the correct answer.
192

193
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:07,770
Now if you like you could also substitute X and Y the letters X and Y here for the numbers 5 and 5.1.
193

194
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm not going to do that now but you already know how to adjust the code to print out five to the power
194

195
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,190
of three fourths.
195

196
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,160
So I'm going to move on to the next problem.
196

197
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,280
So again I'll start with writing out the answer.
197

198
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:32,030
So the answer was that C was three squared divided by X to the power of y and just to make this a little
198

199
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,920
bit more readable.
199

200
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,560
I'm going to put it in parentheses so that it's really clear to me and to Python that three to the power
200

201
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,280
of three goes in the numerator and X to the power of y goes into the denominator.
201

202
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,310
Now display math.
202

203
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,990
And here we need to use a fraction.
203

204
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,840
I hope you remember from a previous video how to write out a fraction using LaTeX coding. In case you've
204

205
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,540
forgotten, it's slash slash and then frac and then we need two sets of curly brackets.
205

206
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,540
So one set of curly brackets for the numerator.
206

207
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,680
Another set of curly brackets for the denominator.
207

208
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,490
So the numerator was three to the power of three.
208

209
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,300
And then the denominator was X to the power of y.
209

210
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:24,290
And then we set that equal to %g and then percent ans so there we go.
210

211
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,310
And this also matches the answer that I showed in the slides.
211

212
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,150
Very good.
212

213
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,300
Now we have the third one and I think I'll call that variable solution just to mix things up a little
213

214
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,070
bit.
214

215
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,320
So let's say a solution.
215

216
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:43,600
And this was 10 to the power of x minus four.
216

217
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,010
So then we say display math and then we have 10 to the power of...
217

218
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,240
and then in curly brackets because we want all of this expression to go into the exponent into these
218

219
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:06,640
superscript after 10 and that equals %g and then percent solution.
219

220
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,430
All right.
220

221
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,120
And then we get 10 to the power of x minus four equals 10.
221

222
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:17,840
And this might seem like a strange result at first except when you keep in mind that X is the number
222

223
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,800
five.
223

224
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,430
So in fact this is really just saying ten to the one and any number to the power of one equals itself
224

225
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,160
so this was a productive video.
225

226
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,440
I hope you enjoyed it.
226

227
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,030
I covered exponents or taking powers in Python.
227

228
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:41,450
I gave a review of parts of the law of exponents and you learned a little bit more about using LaTeX
228

229
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,390
coding or integrating latex coding with Python coding in order to compute mathematical expressions and
229

230
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,690
display them using nice formatting.
230

231
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,760
And I am really excited for the next video because that's the video where I'm going to introduce you
231

232
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,690
to something called for loops. For loops are one of the most important command structures in all
232

233
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,590
of programming.
