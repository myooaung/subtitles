00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:10.660
This section of the Course is all about graphing Connex and conic sections and we are going to start

2
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.400
with parabolas.

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.260
So I'm going to show you the general formula for a parabola.

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.890
I'll show you in Python how to plot vertical and horizontal parabolas.

5
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.960
It's actually easier than you might think.

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.460
And then in the exercise you will learn the little formulas for the vertex the focus and the direct

7
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.690
tricks of a parabola and how to plot those in Python.

8
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.030
So let's begin what is a parabola.

9
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.730
Well a problem is basically just a function and that kind of opens up like this.

10
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.350
Now sometimes it opens upwards sometimes it opens out downwards like this.

11
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.530
And there are also these horizontal parabolas that go off to the side.

12
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.210
But in general all problems have this kind of shape where they branch out from some point over here.

13
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.480
Problem is are used all the time in particularly in physics for ballistics.

14
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.840
So for example if you're standing here and you throw a ball as high as you can and tilted or angled

15
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.530
a little bit in the air the trajectory of the ball is going to look like this.

16
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.290
Eventually gravity overpowers the force that you put into the ball and then it will fall back down to

17
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.610
the earth or the moon or Jupiter or whatever planet you're on.

18
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.710
So this is what parabolas look like.

19
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.100
There is a general formula for a problem.

20
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.890
And that looks like this.

21
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.240
Now this is kind of a weird looking and colorful formula.

22
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.140
It's not a formula that's in the sort of standard configuration that you're probably used to seeing

23
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.230
where the y is on one side and everything else is on the other side of the equals sign.

24
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.060
But that's OK.

25
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.040
When you're looking at formulas it's an important skill in math and particularly when translating math

26
00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.940
into code to be able to have a bit of a bird's eye view and see what's going on in this formula.

27
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.390
So we can see there's still the basic thing so it's Y equals something with X but then Y is just shifted

28
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.250
by K an X is shifted by H.

29
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.320
And so I hope that when you see that or imagine that K equals zero and H equals zero then this is really

30
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.020
similar to the function Y equals X squared.

31
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.720
And of course Y equals X squared looks something like this.

32
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.510
And then we have this four P chunk here and that's really just a parameter.

33
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.190
Now I'll explain a little bit later on where these parameters come from and how to implement them in

34
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.980
Python.

35
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.360
You could rewrite this equation to be a function of y and it would just look like this.

36
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.760
And if it's not immediately clear how to get from this equation to this equation then I encourage you

37
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.390
to pause the video get out a piece of paper and a pen and basically do a little bit of arithmetic on

38
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.970
this equation to solve for y.

39
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.560
So you can see that there are three parameters.

40
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.100
There's the H parameter that's a shift on the x axis.

41
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.250
The K parameter which comes from here.

42
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.400
So that's a shift on the y axis.

43
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.770
And then there's one over for P.

44
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.090
And people often just replace this or substitute this with another letter let's say.

45
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.800
So this would be one parameter here.

46
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.090
All right.

47
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.770
So now I'm going to switch to Python and show you how to implement this formula for a variety of parameters.

48
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.500
We are going to need the NUM pi import num pi as MP and the Met.

49
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.500
Plot lib.

50
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.040
So import met plot plot lib dot pi plot as P L T.

51
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.820
Okay so let's start by listing some parameters.

52
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.990
I'm going to say that A equals 1.

53
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:57.060
So we'll start off pretty simple and remember now a is actually equal to one over for Y.

54
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.790
So in the formula in the slides I had this expression one over for y and here I'm calling that parameter

55
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.980
a.

56
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.580
And then we had H and K let's set H also to be equal to 1 and k about minus 2.

57
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:20.460
And now what we need to do is specify the x axis points to evaluate the function.

58
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.470
So I'll say x equals num pi Lynn space.

59
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.340
So we are gonna come up with linear least based numbers.

60
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.270
And what should they go between we need to specify the two bounds.

61
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.690
Let's start with minus 1 and plus 1 and we will see if that is a reasonable range and then I'm also

62
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.180
going to parameter rise the number of points.

63
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.380
So let's say there's gonna be one hundred points that we evaluate this function on.

64
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.960
All right.

65
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.020
So now we're ready to create the function using the second formula that I showed in the slides we set

66
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:07.820
y equal to a Times X minus H squared plus k.

67
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.830
All right.

68
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.620
So let me see I'm actually going to run this code first just to make sure I haven't made any errors

69
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.690
and I don't see anything down here.

70
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.720
This gets a number in here which means that Python actually ran this code and no error messages were

71
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.250
produced.

72
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:34.800
So that is a good science so now I'm going to plot x by y and peel to show I if I had a a euro for every

73
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.020
time I make this mistake here and I write plot that show instead of p l didn't show I'm sure I'd be

74
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.760
a millionaire by now.

75
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.480
Okay so this doesn't really look like a parabola.

76
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.310
It looks like a very gentle negative slope and we have no idea what's happening out here.

77
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.120
Maybe it just goes down and it stays low for all infinity.

78
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.420
So what is going wrong.

79
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.290
There could be something wrong with the formula.

80
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.260
Or maybe there's something wrong with the x axis.

81
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.390
While there isn't really anything wrong with the x axis but maybe we just haven't gone far enough out

82
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.890
so let's try.

83
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.020
How about minus 50 to plus 50.

84
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.330
Okay.

85
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.360
So that's looking a little bit better.

86
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.000
Now we see that there is definitely a parabola.

87
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.750
However it's not really clear where this thing is next to zero.

88
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.020
So how can we specify the X range a little in a more principled way.

89
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.460
Well one thing we can do is to consider that in the function the parameter H is the x axis offset.

90
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.470
So what if we would do something like h minus 10 to H plus 10.

91
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.620
So now notice that whenever I change the parameter H which is the D shift on the x axis that's also

92
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.980
going to change the range for the function or the domain for the function I should say.

93
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.850
So where it is on the x axis.

94
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.180
Okay.

95
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.250
So this is looking good.

96
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.170
I want to even make this a little bit tighter so let's make it minus five to plus five.

97
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.140
This I like because now you can you can basically see where the the peak of this parabola is where the

98
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.770
trough is down here.

99
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.160
So now this is pretty handy to have this soft coated like this because watch what happens if I change

100
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.190
h to be let's say minus 10.

101
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.650
Now we still get the problem to be centered in the graph and now it's centered at minus 10.

102
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.870
All right.

103
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.500
So I am reasonably happy with how this looks.

104
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:38.150
I think I just want to say I'm going to turn the grid on and I'm going to make the axis square.

105
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.140
I think this will make it look a little bit nicer.

106
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.570
All right.

107
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.140
So and then if you want this to be centered the way it was before then you could also change the x axis

108
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.590
limits here which I won't do in this case.

109
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.840
All right.

110
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.440
So this is for a a vertical parabola.

111
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.070
It's a problem that opens upwards.

112
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.870
How could we change the code here to get the parabola to open up sideways.

113
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.260
Let's say we one of the parabola to look like this.

114
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.330
So the answer in math terms is that you just swap X and Y.

115
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.570
So in that original formula.

116
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.870
So in this formula basically you just set this to be X and this to be Y.

117
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:24.130
And in fact doing that in Python is really easy because all you have to do is swap Y and X here.

118
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:31.610
So now I'm plotting Y as a function of x and Python still interprets this as the X axis coordinate and

119
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:38.510
the y axis coordinate the exercise for this video is essentially to produce this graph.

120
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.150
So what are we looking at here.

121
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.060
Here you see the function this is the parabola and then I've labeled two other points here.

122
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.790
That's called the vertex and the focus.

123
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:55.280
So the vertex is the minimum point here is the point where the parabola is curving around and then this

124
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.300
line is called the directorates.

125
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:05.030
And the idea of the directorates and the focus is that one way to define a parabola is to say that the

126
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:12.800
parabola is the set of all points that is equidistant between the focus and the directorates.

127
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.060
So this point here.

128
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.760
So the vertex here is equidistant between the focus and the director X..

129
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:26.930
And as you get further away know this point over here that's as far away from the focus as it is from

130
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.430
the directorates.

131
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.080
Okay.

132
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:35.500
So here are the expressions to get the vertex the focus and the directorates.

133
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:43.040
So now you should pause the video switch to Python and basically produce this graph based on this information

134
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.320
here and now it's my turn to switch to Python let's see it.

135
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.070
I think I'll just keep working with this graph here.

136
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:59.010
So x by y and just for convenience I'm going to turn off this access square and let me set this back

137
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.510
to 1.

138
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.220
How about.

139
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:02.470
Okay.

140
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.840
So here we have the parabola and I mean a comment here.

141
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.170
So this is plot the parabola and then the next day I want to plot is the vertex because that was pretty

142
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.160
straightforward plot the vertex.

143
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:24.810
So that's P.L. to eat up plot so that one was h comma a K and let's make it a red circle and we we should

144
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.830
label all these things or label this the vertex.

145
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:34.710
This will be labeled of course the parabola and let's see how this looks all right.

146
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.490
So that looks pretty good.

147
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.460
Activate the legend here

148
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.270
next I'm going to plot the focus of the plot the focus.

149
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.890
Now some of this code can be just copied and pasted.

150
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.240
So let's see this is the focus.

151
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.030
And that was a green circle.

152
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.130
And what are the coordinates for the focus.

153
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.840
Well it was still H but then here it was actually K plus P.

154
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.040
So where do we have this parameter p.

155
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.500
Mm hmm.

156
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.430
We actually don't have this parameter p here.

157
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.110
In fact it comes from here this was a typo earlier that should have been won over for P not one over

158
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.430
for Y.

159
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:22.410
So if a equals one over for P then how can we solve for P.

160
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:29.330
Well we need to do a little bit of algebra so let's say 1 over for P equals a.

161
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:36.710
And so therefore we can multiply both sides of this equation by 4 times P and that's gonna give us one

162
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.190
equals a times four times P.

163
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:49.250
And now to solve for P we divide both sides of this equation by a times 4.

164
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.040
So then it becomes 1 over for a.

165
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.240
Okay.

166
00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:00.050
So therefore P is going to be equal to 1 divided by 4 times a.

167
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.410
Okay so let's try that.

168
00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.710
Let's try writing this code now with a focus in there.

169
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.370
And well it looks pretty small.

170
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.360
Maybe we should focus in a little bit.

171
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.100
Or maybe I will tighten the x axis.

172
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.650
Let's set this to be minus 2 and plus 2 All right.

173
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.620
So that's looking pretty reasonable.

174
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:27.980
And now let's plot the directorates and plot the directorates so the directorates is a line.

175
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:34.240
It has to go from all the way on the left side of the x axis to all the way on the right side of the

176
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.860
x axis.

177
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.030
So how should we do that.

178
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:43.310
Well I think what we can do is take advantage of our x variable that we've already created.

179
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:52.090
So I'm gonna say that I want X to go from the first element of X to the last element of X.

180
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.190
And then what is it on the y axis.

181
00:12:54.190 --> 00:13:00.050
Well the y axis is actually constant that director X never changes on the y axis.

182
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.150
So that's going to be the same number I'll call that parameter d.

183
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.510
And I haven't yet created D.

184
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:12.130
So let's say d equals and then from the formula in the slides that was K minus p let's see.

185
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.420
So then this needs to get a label of direct tricks.

186
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:16.690
All right.

187
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:23.340
So I'm going to run this and let's see if we get any errors coming from this line.

188
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:23.760
Aha.

189
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.860
And we actually do get an error the error is too many indices for array.

190
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.160
So the error is actually coming from this part right here.

191
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.460
So it turns out that what we need to do is index the variable or sometimes in Python it's called the

192
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.200
ignorable using a list not using two separate numbers like this.

193
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:50.890
So the solution here the correct way to set this up is to have a double square bracket like this.

194
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:56.320
It looks a little funny but that's the right thing to do because this is a list that we are inputting

195
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.290
into the variable x.

196
00:13:59.290 --> 00:13:59.790
All right.

197
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.500
And now this is looking pretty good in this video.

198
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.050
You learned about the general formula of a parabola.

199
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.550
You saw how to plot vertical and horizontal parabolas.

200
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.940
How to plot the vertex focus and directorates of a parabola in python.

201
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:22.660
But I think the most important lesson that you got from this video is translating formulas from math

202
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.310
notation into code in Python and manipulating those formulas.

203
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:33.070
So applying a bit of algebra to those formulas to change how to work with them in Python.
