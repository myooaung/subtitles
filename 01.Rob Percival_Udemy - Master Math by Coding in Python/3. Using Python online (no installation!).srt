00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:10,890
In the previous video I showed you how to install the anaconda program so that you can run Jupiter notebook
1

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,260
locally on your computer.
2

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,500
And in this video I'm going to show you how to use Python online.
3

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,810
That means you don't have to worry about installing anything on your computer.
4

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,350
So let me say in advance that the advantage of using Python online is, as I just mentioned, you don't
5

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,020
need to do any local installations.
6

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,690
This can be useful if let's say I don't know you have an old laptop and there isn't a lot of space on
7

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,140
it or you're concerned that it isn't fast enough.
8

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,630
Or maybe if you're using a computer at work or at your university and you don't have administrator privileges
9

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,640
you're not allowed to install anything new on the computer.
10

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,460
That said there are a few disadvantages of using Python exclusively online.
11

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,500
It depends on Internet availability.
12

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,700
So if you want to do some Python coding at a cafe somewhere in the cafe is crappy Wi-Fi then you're
13

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,890
kind of out of luck with Python online.
14

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,020
Also you have to deal with some hassle of uploading files and then downloading files again.
15

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,900
It's pretty easy to lose work.
16

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,000
I've done that before.
17

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,740
You know you put a good hour or so into a script and then you close the browser and you forget to download
18

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,800
the code and all of your precious work is gone.
19

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,500
So for these reasons I generally recommend a local installation of Python.
20

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,580
And as I mentioned in the previous video most people go with the anaconda package.
21

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,590
That said there is nothing particularly wrong with Python online.
22

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,330
And so now in the rest of this video I'm going to spend a good couple of minutes showing you a few different
23

24
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,280
options for how to use Python online and all of these things are free by the way.
24

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,630
You never have to pay any money or you should never pay money to use Python certainly not online so
25

26
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:12,550
here we are at jupyter.org/try. When you scroll down this page you'll see there are many buttons.
26

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,710
These are all different languages that you can test.
27

28
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,100
So here's Julia.
28

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:24,190
And, R and C++ and Ruby and so on. For this course for Python notebooks you're going to want either the classic
29

30
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,200
notebook or the Jupiter lab they're both more or less the same.
30

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,110
The Jupiter lab has a slightly nicer looking interface so I'm gonna show you that.
31

32
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,040
But the classic notebook is also fine it's a little bit simpler it's a little bit more kind of a I don't
32

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,300
know.
33

34
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,740
Shall we say 2017?
34

35
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,550
Anyway let's go to try.
35

36
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,280
Jupiter Lab. So I click here.
36

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,050
And eventually that's going to lead to a page that looks something like this.
37

38
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,100
Now you might get some intermediate pages getting here but just wait a moment and eventually the screen
38

39
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,680
will start to look like this.
39

40
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,700
So here you see all of these files.
40

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,760
These are the notebooks the data files and so on.
41

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,690
Here you see the main notebook that you are working with.
42

43
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,690
And here is just some reference documentation.
43

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,510
So I'm actually going to close this documentation just so it's less annoying.
44

45
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:21,610
And now here the idea is that we want to upload our own files onto the server here so you can click
45

46
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:31,210
on this up arrow here upload files so then you want to navigate to the folder on your file where you
46

47
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:37,120
have downloaded the python files from this course and then essentially you're looking for this one that
47

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:47,020
says I P Y and B so this is an I Python notebook and then you select that file click on open and now
48

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,830
you'll see it appears here and then you can double click on that file.
49

50
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,200
And now that file is going to appear here in this window as soon as it loads.
50

51
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,480
Okay.
51

52
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,730
There we go.
52

53
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:03,340
So now you can use this python notebook just the way that I'm doing it on my computer.
53

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,890
In the video that you're watching.
54

55
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,970
So if you click inside of a cell you can press control enter to run all the code in that cell.
55

56
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,860
And here we see here some output here and so on.
56

57
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,380
Now you can change this file as much as you want.
57

58
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,680
You can type you know obviously it is not real python code but you can change this file and then if
58

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,550
you want to save all of these changes you can right click on this file and select download then you
59

60
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,370
can download this file back onto your local computer.
60

61
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,600
And this is actually one of the disadvantages that I mentioned in the slide because if you just close
61

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,030
this tab then hopefully you'll at least get a warning that says changes you've made may not be saved
62

63
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,190
but if you're not really thinking about it and you press leave then you're going to lose all the changes
63

64
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,670
that you've made.
64

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:54,970
OK.
65

66
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,450
So this is for the Jupiter Web site.
66

67
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:04,850
Now there's also colaboratory, that comes from Google research. And this is a really similar concept
67

68
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,270
so there's code here.
68

69
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:12,420
Now the thing about the cloud is if you try to run the code it will say Google sign in required.
69

70
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:20,490
So basically you can use colab.research.Google.com only if you sign in with your Google
70

71
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:20,990
account.
71

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,700
So you know if you're not really comfortable with signing in and using your Google account then you
72

73
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,920
might not want to do this option.
73

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,150
OK.
74

75
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,130
So I'm now going to sign in with my Google account
75

76
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,750
and now I'm able to run the code that's in these notebooks now.
76

77
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,180
One thing I want to warn you about if you want to use collab then you have to be aware that some of
77

78
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:52,180
these special formatting that I use in this course is actually not going to work directly in code.
78

79
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,820
So let me just show you what I mean.
79

80
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,470
So display math.
80

81
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,710
Now if you don't really understand what I'm writing then don't worry I'm going to explain this throughout
81

82
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,370
the course.
82

83
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,550
So it's a B F of X and d x.
83

84
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,410
So essentially what I'm writing down here should be nicely formatted math code.
84

85
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,530
And let me run exactly this same code over here in Jupiter lab so you can see what this is going to
85

86
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,420
look like.
86

87
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,770
Maybe I'll zoom in a little bit.
87

88
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:34,250
So this code that I just entered creates this really nice beautiful looking latex formatted mathematical
88

89
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,120
expression with this integral sign and all sorts of nice looking things.
89

90
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:44,180
And when I run exactly the same code in collab it just comes out looking like this which is raw latex
90

91
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,850
code.
91

92
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:52,250
Now it is possible to interpret latex code in colab; it just requires a slightly different approach.
92

93
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,710
I'm not going to discuss that in the course.
93

94
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,020
You can look it up online.
94

95
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,870
It's slightly more involved but it's still possible.
95

96
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,540
So mainly for this reason I actually do not recommend using collab while you are following along with
96

97
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,420
this course.
97

98
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:13,160
Now that said one advantage of using collab is that if you do have a Google account and you use Google
98

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,880
Drive to store your files you can actually just mount your google drive directly onto your collab session.
99

100
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,930
Once you've logged in.
100

101
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,070
So that's actually pretty convenient.
101

102
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,560
OK.
102

103
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:30,600
The last thing that I'm going to introduce you to is Kaggle. This is another Web site Kaggle.com.
103

104
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,040
And here we can just scroll down a little bit and click on try now.
104

105
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,320
OK.
105

106
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,930
And that takes a moment to load in depending on your internet speed and how busy the Kaggle server is
106

107
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,930
and so on but you still end up with a notebook like interface that looks something like this.
107

108
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,510
And here I can actually run this code that I showed you before which worked well in Jupiter Lab. It
108

109
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:57,850
didn't work in Google collab and now it looks really nice in Kaggle as well.
109

110
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,490
And here also of course you can upload your own files so you can say upload notebook.
110

111
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,970
And now here you see the script that I downloaded from the course.
111

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,000
And you can follow along with the course in this session.
112

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,840
So to conclude there are several ways you can use python online.
113

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,620
In general I recommend using Jupyter.org/try not because it's necessarily the best but because
114

115
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,600
it's going to be the easiest for you to follow along with in the course.
115

116
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:34,810
That said I also generally recommend using a local installation of Python whenever possible.
116

117
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,530
Personally I find that to be easier and more convenient.
