00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.030
I am really excited about this section of the course.

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.340
I mean okay I was excited about all the sections of the course but this one is particularly important

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.430
to me because Linear Algebra is my favorite topic in all of mathematics.

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.630
It's really interesting.

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.760
It's really beautiful and the practical applications are huge.

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:33.090
Modern civilization is built on linear algebra everything from statistics to computer graphics to machine

7
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.630
learning to A.I. to deep learning Linear Algebra is at the heart of pretty much everything when it comes

8
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.380
to technology.

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:50.160
All right so let us begin a brief adventure through the land of linear algebra with talking about vectors

10
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.250
and in particular row vectors and Column vectors so a vector is really just an ordered list of numbers.

11
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.150
So here you see Val for examples of vectors.

12
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.070
Now these are five individual numbers.

13
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.470
This is not the number thirteen thousand two hundred fifty four.

14
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.590
This is a vector that contains 5 elements 1 3 2 5 4 vectors are typically indicated by square brackets

15
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.000
or sometimes like rounded brackets.

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.800
Here you see a two element vectors of this vector has two elements two numbers.

17
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.480
And again this is not a equation.

18
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.440
This is not minus 1 minus 14 equals minus 15.

19
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.250
These are two numbers in a two element vector.

20
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.880
You would also call this a two dimensional vector the dimensionality of a vector is the number of numbers

21
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.290
in that vector.

22
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.320
So this would be a five dimensional vector.

23
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050
Now these are called row vectors.

24
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.070
They're called row vectors because the numbers are lined up in a row like this.

25
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.070
You can also have Column vectors like this.

26
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.880
So this is a two dimensional column vector.

27
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.740
This is a five dimensional column vector.

28
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.930
I notice that vectors don't have to contain integers or even rational numbers.

29
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.150
You can have irrational numbers.

30
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.190
You can have even complex value or imaginary numbers in here.

31
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.820
So this is called the algebraic definition of a vector.

32
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.910
There's also a geometric way of thinking about vectors and that's to think about a coordinate space

33
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.630
that has the same number of axes as there are elements in the vector.

34
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:39.960
So this is a two dimensional row vector so this can be represented geometrically in a two dimensional

35
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.150
space.

36
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.790
And essentially what this vector tells you is that you can represent this geometrically by going one

37
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.920
unit over.

38
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.900
So plus one unit on the first dimension and plus two units on the second dimension.

39
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.610
Now it looks like from the picture that I'm drawing here as if a coordinate on this plot is the same

40
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.540
thing as a vector but that is not the case.

41
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.180
The vector is a more general concept that that's not specifically tied to this particular coordinate.

42
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.550
One common two.

43
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:22.140
So for example all of these arrows here show the same vector one 2 even though this coordinate is obviously

44
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.430
not X equals one Y equals two.

45
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.180
But the geometric interpretation of a vector is simply that you see you go from the tail of the vector

46
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.180
and then over one unit and up two units because that's these numbers here and then you end at the head

47
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.080
of the vector.

48
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.960
So these are two terms that are useful for describing geometric vectors.

49
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.360
Now I just said that the coordinate is not necessarily the same thing as a vector.

50
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.550
That is true in general.

51
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.790
As you can see here.

52
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.890
But when they do coincide.

53
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.740
So when the head of the vector is at the coordinate then the tail is at the origin of the space.

54
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.680
And then we refer to this as the vector being in its standard position.

55
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.930
So this is what a two dimensional vector would look like.

56
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.720
What would a three dimensional vector look like.

57
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.990
Well you guessed it it would be a vector in a three dimensional space.

58
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.770
So we need three axes here to describe a three dimensional vector.

59
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.260
And what does a 17 dimensional vector look like.

60
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.730
Who.

61
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.900
Well I don't really know.

62
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.950
Somehow it's a line in a 17 dimensional space.

63
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.340
But I got a little bit confused when I started trying to draw a 17 dimensional space.

64
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.290
My head was spinning and I got a headache and so I just stopped here with three dimensions.

65
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.290
So let's see how vectors are implemented and represented in Python

66
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.540
nearly everything done with linear algebra on in Python is done with the NUM pi modules.

67
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.870
So we are definitely going to need num PI for this section of the course.

68
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.380
And in this video we're also going to use simplify and display and math functions because I'm going

69
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.300
to print out some of these vectors in later coding.

70
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.800
All right so let's begin.

71
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.890
So I'm going to start by creating a row vector.

72
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.310
Now in num Pi the way you create a row vector is by just specifying the numbers.

73
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.730
Let's say we want to create a two dimensional row vector how about let's use 4 and 2.

74
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.270
So each element is separated by a comma and there is one set of square brackets here to indicate that

75
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.560
there is one row.

76
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.220
So it's one row for one set of square brackets.

77
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.550
Now the reason why I mentioned that explicitly is because when we need to make a column vector things

78
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.740
are going to look a little bit more confusing.

79
00:05:51.770 --> 00:06:00.740
So we have one set of square brackets here for the entire matrix and then each row requires its own

80
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.980
set of square brackets.

81
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.200
So for example to make the column vector let's say I don't know minus two and three we actually need

82
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.360
to use a bunch of pairs of square brackets.

83
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.910
So it looks a little confusing at first but you will quickly get used to it.

84
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.240
So essentially we are saying that this is a row and then this is the next row.

85
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.130
Okay.

86
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.230
So let me print these out and let's see how they look like when printed out so print row vac and print

87
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.740
call vec.

88
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.940
So here you see actually on the I'll do this one at a time just so it's less confusing.

89
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.350
So here you see 4 2.

90
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.820
This is a row vector.

91
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:46.910
Now I will comment this line on Comment this line and now the column vector gets printed out as minus

92
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.970
two and then in the next row three.

93
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.750
So you can see this looks like a column.

94
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.120
Okay.

95
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.150
And now I would just like to show you these two things printed out in nicer looking latex coding.

96
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.850
So let's see.

97
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.770
I think I'll leave those there so you can see for comparison.

98
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:10.000
So display math and then some dot latex and then let's see row vec.

99
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.680
Okay.

100
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.950
So now this just looks like the number 42 which is pretty confusing.

101
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.900
The problem here is that this is a num pi object but we are interpreting it as if it's a simple object.

102
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.280
So we need to convert this from num pi into simple.

103
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.490
And that's done with Sim if Phi.

104
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.780
Yeah.

105
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.190
Like this.

106
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.540
Okay.

107
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.160
And now this looks like more of what you'd expect for a row vector presentation.

108
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.450
All right.

109
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.060
So I'm going to copy and paste and then here you see the column vector.

110
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.600
And now this also looks a little bit more like what you might expect to see in a math textbook.

111
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.480
Of course it's all the same information as what you see printed here.

112
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.940
It just looks a little bit nicer.

113
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.630
Now I'd like to go over quickly plotting these vectors.

114
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.860
This is actually relatively straightforward because there's nothing really new.

115
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.590
It's just a slightly different language that we are using.

116
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.140
So let's see BLT dot plots.

117
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:18.680
Now the idea is we want to generate a vector and for convenience we will produce this vector a real

118
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.410
plot this vector in its standard position.

119
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.350
So that means we start from 0 0 and we draw the line to these coordinates here.

120
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:36.590
So therefore the x coordinates will go from zero to row back and then the first element and then the

121
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:43.060
y coordinates are gonna start from zero and then they go from to row back one.

122
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.750
OK.

123
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.070
And I'm going to make this red line for Row and let's see label.

124
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:55.460
And this is going to be a row vector and then P L that show.

125
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.290
So here you see.

126
00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.000
So it's just a line.

127
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.330
Now what I'm going to do is copy and paste and repeat this for the column vectors call and then call.

128
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.430
Let's make this what colour do you think we should use.

129
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.050
I agree.

130
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.190
Let's make it blue.

131
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.910
And then here I will say column vector.

132
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.110
All right.

133
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:24.190
And then I'm just gonna spend a moment here making this a little bit nicer looking P L T dot axis.

134
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.560
Let's go for minus five to five on both the x and y axes.

135
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:38.700
Turn on a grid and let's see activate the legend BLT legend okay.

136
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.640
There you go.

137
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.980
The main point that I wanted to show you here is well I guess two things one is a brief reminder of

138
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:54.320
drawing lines in map plot lib and Python graphics and secondly show you that geometrically vectors are

139
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.570
the same or drawn the same whether they are row vectors or Column vectors.

140
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:05.060
So for algebraic purposes a row vector is not the same thing as a column vector they have a different

141
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:12.050
orientation that has important implications for doing mathematical operations like multiplication and

142
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.100
transformations.

143
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.830
And so on.

144
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.290
But when it comes to plotting row vectors and Column vectors are basically the same thing the exercise

145
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:26.210
for this video is basically to reproduce this plot that you see here.

146
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.310
This is a three dimensional plot showing these two vectors.

147
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.420
So three zero minus four minus one.

148
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.070
1 3.

149
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:42.070
Now I haven't yet taught you in this course how to create a three dimensional plot that looks like this.

150
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.590
So if you would like to figure this out on your own then.

151
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.070
Now is your chance to pause the video and switch to Python.

152
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:56.510
Because in a moment in like five seconds I'm going to show a hint to get you started.

153
00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:02.660
Okay so here is the hint the hint is to basically start working from this code.

154
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.840
Now I'm not going to tell you exactly everything to do.

155
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.050
You still have some stuff to figure out on your own but this is enough to get you started.

156
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.290
I believe.

157
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.550
All right.

158
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.890
So now I'm going to switch to Python and essentially start by you know implementing some of this code

159
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:27.740
that I'm drawing here and then reproduce this graph so 3D plotting is by default not available in P

160
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.340
L T dot plot.

161
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:36.060
So that's why we need to import a separate function from a different module so that module is called

162
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:43.960
NPL tool kits dot M plot 3D.

163
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.640
Okay.

164
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:53.460
And then we don't actually need to import the entire module we just need the function axes 3 3 D.

165
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.720
There you go.

166
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:54.950
Okay.

167
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.150
So now I run this cell again to run this line and get this function to import.

168
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.370
And now let's see.

169
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.400
So I'm going to specify these two vectors.

170
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.290
I'll call this first one V and let's see that is now here.

171
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.760
You could create this to be a row vector or a column vector for the plotting.

172
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.940
It doesn't matter but for just initially setting it up in Python it's certainly easier to write out

173
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.250
a row vector than a column vector.

174
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.320
So I will set these all up to be row vectors so that's V.

175
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:36.130
I call this second vector w so and that one was minus one comma one comma three.

176
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:36.630
Okay.

177
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:44.160
So now we need to set up a figure and that's going to be appeal to that figure fig size.

178
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:53.460
So that stands for figure size peel t that fig aspect 1 and then within this figure I need to set up

179
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.380
an axis.

180
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.070
And that's going to be figured that ad sub plot.

181
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:05.890
And now I actually don't want any real subplots per say it's just going to be one main plot in the entire

182
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.340
axis.

183
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.520
So therefore I just say 1 1 1.

184
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.840
That means that there's going to be one row one column and I'm going to be working with the.

185
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:19.180
Well the first axis but of course in this case is the only axis.

186
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.730
And then here's the most important thing you say projection equals 3D.

187
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.730
And that is how you get a 3D projection.

188
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.110
Okay.

189
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.790
And then once you've set this code up like this then the rest is actually pretty straightforward.

190
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:40.900
So X dot plot and then so we're going to have these two vectors start from the origin.

191
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.230
So these will be vectors drawn in standard position.

192
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:51.910
So it's going to be zero comma v zero and then zero v 1.

193
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:59.200
And the last one is you guessed it zero comma whoops v 2.

194
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.650
There you go.

195
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.100
So let's make this a blue vector and I'm gonna make sure that we have a nice thick lines is gonna be

196
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.250
lined with equals three all right.

197
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:17.450
And then I'm going to draw a W in the same way just replacing all the V's with WS here.

198
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.600
So v v v turns to W W W and let's just already show this.

199
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:30.410
Make sure we haven't got any errors and make sure we haven't done anything foolish like draw both vectors

200
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.730
in the same color.

201
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.340
Whoops.

202
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.110
Now the reason why this plot doesn't really look like the plot that I showed in the slides is that I

203
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:45.050
showed a plot with the origin in the center and that's generally the best way to show these kinds of

204
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.310
plots with the origin in the center.

205
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.420
You can only see here the origin is somewhere.

206
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.710
Well it's uh this point here at somewhere around.

207
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:59.300
Well it's this point here but you can see that you know zero is not at the middle of any of these three

208
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:07.070
axes so to set that we write X that sets underscore X Lim 3D.

209
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:13.340
So this is slightly different code from how you have to setup the axes in a two dimensional plot which

210
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.080
I showed you here set the x limits.

211
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:22.650
Let's go for how about minus five to plus five all around.

212
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:29.100
So this is going to be X Y and Z all right.

213
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.980
So this is looking better and now just to like visually anchor these points a little bit more.

214
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:41.730
I want to draw some guidelines in here and those guidelines are basically just gonna be the lines that

215
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.290
go across these zero coordinates on all three axes.

216
00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:52.130
So let's see X dot plot and then I want the first line to go across the x axis.

217
00:15:52.140 --> 00:16:00.420
So the X axis is going to go minus five to plus five the y axis doesn't change and I should say the

218
00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.550
line on the x axis are the y axis and the Z axis also doesn't change okay.

219
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.030
And this is going to be a dash line.

220
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.530
And I want the color to be something like gray like this.

221
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.830
All right.

222
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:22.340
So you see that draws the one line here and then the other two guidelines are essentially the same.

223
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:28.540
So I will do a bit of copy paste except now we just move these things around.

224
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:37.160
So this is going to be not moving on the x axis not changing on the z axis only changing on the y axis.

225
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:45.500
And then of course we have the same thing for the third line going across the z axis.

226
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.190
All right.

227
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.450
Very very nice.

228
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:55.170
Now we see these two three dimensional vectors in a three dimensional space in this video.

229
00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:02.500
You learned about vectors and the algebraic and geometric definitions of vectors and you learned how

230
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.300
to make 3D plots in python in the next video.

231
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:11.890
You're going to learn how to work with vectors including adding and subtracting and scalar multiplying

232
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:12.670
vectors.

233
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.430
So see you in the next video.
