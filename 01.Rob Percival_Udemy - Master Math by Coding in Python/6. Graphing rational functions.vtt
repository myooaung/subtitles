00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.700
In this video you are going to learn about graphing rational functions.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.930
Fortunately it's not so difficult.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.020
It's essentially just combining the knowledge that you learned about polynomials in the last section

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.870
of the course with what you learned about graphing.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.900
So far in this section of the course and let me start by just talking a little bit about a rational

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.890
function now you might think that a rational function is a function that is purely logical it always

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.120
makes the best decisions it doesn't act on impulse or emotional mood swings or anything like that but

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.930
actually a rational function is not the same thing as a rational person a rational function actually

9
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.060
comes from the word ratio.

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.200
So a function is a rational if it's essentially a ratio of polynomials.

11
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.260
So this is an example of a rational function.

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660
This is also an example of a rational function.

13
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.780
One plus the square root of X because that can actually be expressed as a ratio of one over the square

14
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.280
root of X to 1.

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.070
So just putting one in the denominator.

16
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.740
So here is a rational function.

17
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.740
This is a simple polynomial like the polynomials that I introduced in the previous section.

18
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.850
So this would be a degree to polynomial and you might recognize already the form so it's minus X squared.

19
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.260
So X squared generally looks like a bowl and then minus X squared which means it's a bowl opening down

20
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.080
and in fact the plot looks something like this.

21
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.680
And then the 2 here is basically just shifting this whole function up on the y axis here.

22
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.870
So the way to plot a rational function in python using map plot lib is essentially by generating a couple

23
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.990
of points in the function and then evaluating those points and drawing a line between them.

24
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.710
So it would look like this and in fact I'm going to start by generating exactly that same plot that

25
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.530
I showed in the slides.

26
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.890
So let's see we are definitely going to need num pi and Matt plot lib in this video.

27
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.400
So I'm going to specify the x axis is going to go from minus three to plus three which means I have

28
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.120
to specify this as four and then I'm going to run this first example generating this function point

29
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.290
by point.

30
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.810
So what I need to do first is initialize the vector of y points I'll say num pi dot zeros and that's

31
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.180
going to be length of X or before actually moving forward.

32
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.050
Let me show you what X and Y are.

33
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:51.320
So here is X that's a range from minus three to plus three and then we add one here and then Y is a

34
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:59.720
bunch of zeros and it's the same size or it has the same number of zeros as the length of X..

35
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.130
Okay.

36
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.520
And so what I'm going to do now is loop through all of the values of x in this range and then replace

37
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.460
each of these zeros with the actual value of the function at that point of X..

38
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:28.100
So for I in range 0 to the length of x we say that the ISF element in Y is equal to basically the function

39
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.670
definition.

40
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.100
So 2 minus X and then it's the ISF element of X squared.

41
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.450
Okay.

42
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.430
And then we are going to plot this.

43
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:47.660
So peel T dot plot x by y and I will make this squares with lines connecting the squares.

44
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.050
All right.

45
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.090
So there you go.

46
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.470
That looks like a nice plot.

47
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.830
Now you could embellish this a little bit more you know you could spend some time making this plot look

48
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.670
a bit nicer you could draw some grid lines and x and y axis labels and so on.

49
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.200
By this point in the course you know enough to be able to beautify this plot a bit on your own.

50
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.210
Instead I would like to move on and show you a little bit more about plotting functions and in particular

51
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.300
the next thing I would like to discuss is the resolution here or the number of points that are on this

52
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.420
graph so let's plot another function.

53
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:31.080
How about Y equals two plus the square root of x.

54
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.730
Actually the square root of the absolute value of X..

55
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.270
So it's a bit similar to a function that we plotted in one of the previous videos.

56
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.580
Okay.

57
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.540
Now notice that I'm actually specifying the entire function on one line here.

58
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.110
So this is different from evaluating the function one point at a time.

59
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.790
Now there isn't really a general reason to prefer one method over the other method in certain circumstances

60
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.270
you will find that it's useful to generate functions one point at a time and other cases it's useful

61
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.450
to specify the function all at once.

62
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:16.100
So I'm going to say that X equals and now I would like to basically change the resolution of these dots.

63
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.840
X is gonna go from minus three to plus three.

64
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.380
But I want to be able to specify how many points there are between minus three and plus three and to

65
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.880
do this.

66
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:35.030
I'm going to use a function in the NUM pi module called Lin space and the way that the Lin space function

67
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.730
works is that you provide three inputs the first input is the lower bound.

68
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.960
The second input is the upper bound and the third input is the number of steps between minus three and

69
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.590
plus three.

70
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.860
So let me print this out so you can see what this will look like.

71
00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.470
So you can see that we have numbers from minus three going up to plus three and now there are ten of

72
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.730
them.

73
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.590
So I can make this be 20 numbers between minus three and plus three and so on.

74
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:15.320
So now that I have this specified I'm going to make a plot of this function so plot x by y and let's

75
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.010
also make this squares with lines.

76
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:26.060
But I think I'm gonna say m for magenta all right so this looks pretty interesting.

77
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.750
This is our plot of the square root of the absolute value of X so it kind of comes down and then it's

78
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.450
flat at the bottom and then it goes back up.

79
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.600
Now what would happen if we changed the Axis limits a bit.

80
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:45.570
So for example if we would make this block generate from minus three to plus four.

81
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.870
Huh.

82
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:52.880
So now we actually don't get that flat plateau at the bottom now it just comes down to a point.

83
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.160
Now maybe there's something about the resolutions.

84
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.830
So what if we were to say how about 14.

85
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.630
So now you know the plot generally has this same form.

86
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.260
But when I change these parameters and particularly when I change the resolution of X it kind of seems

87
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.720
like in the middle it's changing a little bit the function seems to be changing a little bit and actually

88
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.200
what's happening here is that this plot is not really showing the function itself.

89
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.440
Instead it's showing just a collection of data points evaluated somewhere on that function.

90
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.110
So therefore these straight lines in between them are a little bit misleading because it suggests that

91
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.300
the function actually is straight from one point to the next point.

92
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.820
Now as long as the points are sufficiently close together that's not really a problem.

93
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:49.400
And in fact you will learn later on in this course that linear functions which is essentially what we're

94
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.780
doing here are actually really good approximations of nonlinear functions which is what this is.

95
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:02.180
As long as the linear spacing is close enough so we can make this even higher resolution.

96
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:09.020
And now this line this estimate of the function the square root of the absolute value of X starts to

97
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.390
look more and more like the real function.

98
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:17.330
And also by the way the more points we add the more kind of annoying it looks with these squares.

99
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:24.290
So maybe it's better if we remove this s and just leave this as a magenta line.

100
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.360
Now I would like to take a moment here before the exercise to illustrate to you one of the things that

101
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.290
I love about exploring mathematics with tools like Python or other numerical processing software is

102
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:43.370
if you would see this function here and you wanted to know a little bit more about this function and

103
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.120
all you had at your disposal was a piece of paper and a pencil.

104
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:53.030
It would basically take you a really long time to try and get more familiar with this function but in

105
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.620
Python it's really easy.

106
00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:00.380
For example if you want to know what does this function look like if you subtract the square root.

107
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:06.350
Super easy All you have to do is change this line of code or even just this one character and then you

108
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.690
get to see that this starts to look like the roof of a house or something.

109
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.570
Maybe you're curious what happens if you say two times x minus the square root of the absolute value

110
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:25.790
of x and ha then it looks even more interesting or what if we would say two plus how about instead of

111
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.700
the square root of X we would make this b the cube root of x.

112
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.480
So to the power of one third.

113
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.150
Okay.

114
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.250
Well that one actually doesn't look so different.

115
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.130
Oh but maybe we can do something like this.

116
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:47.900
Maybe I can say why one and then why two and then will equal the square root of the absolute value of

117
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.360
x.

118
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:56.760
And now I can say why 1 and Y 2 will make Y to be a black line.

119
00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.570
Aha.

120
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:04.460
So this is pretty interesting now you can see parts of the function look really similar and there's

121
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.800
only one piece of the function that I'm changing.

122
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:14.540
And you get to see how changing the fractional power of this function will change the resulting graph.

123
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:24.530
And that right there is the most powerful way to use Python to help you get an intuitive feel for mathematics.

124
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:30.440
And with that concept in mind your goal for this exercise is to produce a plot that looks like this.

125
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.480
I think this looks really neat.

126
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:38.600
This almost looks like it could be an icon for some hip software company or something.

127
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.610
So essentially this is a similar set of functions.

128
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:50.980
It's all Y equals X to the power of something and that something goes from minus 1 0 1 2 and 3.

129
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.330
So pause the video switch to Python and see if you can produce a plot that looks like this.

130
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:03.670
Of course I recommend running through this in a for loop to make this efficient All right.

131
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:13.360
So let's see the x axis was numbers that went from minus four to plus four.

132
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.650
And I don't really know what was the resolution that I showed in the slides so I'm going to start it

133
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:24.070
off with let's say just 10 points for starters and maybe I will need to increase that later.

134
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.390
Okay.

135
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:29.950
So then we're gonna have the exponents and I'll just call that E for exponents and that's going to be

136
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.260
in a range from minus 1.

137
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.350
And in the plot I went up to 4.

138
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.060
That's right up to the third power.

139
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.800
So here I write for.

140
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.070
Okay.

141
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:44.190
So now we're gonna have a for loop and this will save for I.

142
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.440
In ease is pretty compact coating here.

143
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:54.770
So let's specify that the function is X to the power to the power of I.

144
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.050
And then we plot this function.

145
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:07.470
So X comma Y and then we need a label and that label was Y equals X to the power of.

146
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.900
And then I'll do a percent s in here and then a percent.

147
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.050
I out here.

148
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.730
All right.

149
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.110
And then we need to activate the legend.

150
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:23.620
So plot that legend and actually know before going much further I think it's a good idea just to look

151
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.320
at this plot and see how it looks.

152
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:25.620
Okay.

153
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.660
So it's kind of it's it's getting there.

154
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.130
Let's see there's a few things that we need to fix here.

155
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.870
One is that the lines need to be a little bit thicker.

156
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.700
I mean is that why line with to be equal to four.

157
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:49.420
Now I want to adjust the x and y limits so let's set the X limit to be set according to this X limit

158
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.780
here.

159
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:56.910
And so that's going to be the first element of X or the first value of x.

160
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.100
And then the last value of X..

161
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.420
All right.

162
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:07.030
So this is getting somewhere it still doesn't quite look like the figure that I showed in the slides

163
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.960
but we're getting closer.

164
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:14.230
I'm also gonna set the Y limit and let's say you know this is getting a little bit out of hand here.

165
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:20.850
I'll say minus twenty two plus twenty so minus twenty two plus twenty.

166
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:21.180
All right.

167
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.330
So this doesn't quite this looks a little too rugged here.

168
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:30.850
So I think what we need to do is increase the spacing between minus four and plus four.

169
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.870
So how about instead of ten we try a hundred.

170
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.700
Huh.

171
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:41.540
This looks much better and now I'm curious to see if it gets any better or different.

172
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.100
If I set this to be a thousand.

173
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:45.850
Mm hmm.

174
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.640
It doesn't really look much different.

175
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.100
I wonder if I can just set it to maybe 200.

176
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.850
Yeah.

177
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.210
So you can see at some point you get up to the resolution that is sufficient.

178
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.570
And then adding more data points is basically just going to make the computation take longer without

179
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.380
really adding any new information.

180
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:07.620
Okay.

181
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.580
So this generally looks pretty good.

182
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.500
The last thing I want to do is convert this into latex.

183
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:21.340
So it looks a little bit nicer in particular I want these exponents to be in these superscript.

184
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:28.420
So here when you are using LaTeX in a label for a legend or in a title you can actually just in case

185
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.430
everything in dollar signs like this.

186
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:41.060
And that means that we use the latex code for super scripts in which is the carat symbol.

187
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.280
All right.

188
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.420
So now this looks quite good.

189
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.010
So what a fun video this was wasn't it.

190
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.630
I hope you enjoyed it as much or maybe even more than I did.

191
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:57.700
So I told you about rational functions and a little bit more about plotting but I hope that the most

192
00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:04.030
important take home message for you from this video was how to interact with Python and how to change

193
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:10.510
functions so that by visualizing functions and changing the arithmetic of functions you get a better

194
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.900
feel for the underlying mathematics.
