00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,690
Hello and welcome back to the course and blog check.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,820
And today we'll find out how meme pools work.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,840
Now we really touched on temples a little bit before when we were talking about how miners pick their

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,760
transactions.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,380
Well today we'll see how meme pools function in this distributed peer to peer system.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,430
All right so let's get started here.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,470
We've got a network of participants of the network so-called nodes.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,640
Their computers will be called nodes because they're not actually minors.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,090
They're just people who want to transact on the network send each other bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,270
that this network is based around.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,970
And what we're going to now do is we're going to replace a couple of minors just to add some variety

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:53,780
on network to see that this actually works regardless of the configuration of our network.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,030
And as we've seen before there is a meme pool attached to each one of these participants and the crucial

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,390
thing here is that the men pool there is a meme pool for each participant whether it's a node or a minor.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,040
And that means that there isn't just like one meme pools shared between everybody because as I recall

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,360
this is a peer distributed peer to peer network.

17
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,230
That's the whole concept of blocking so there is nothing Central about it including the temple.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,060
The Temple has to be individual to every single participant.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,190
And the other thing here is that the meme pool as we recall is not the blockade itself.

20
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,340
It's a staging area for transactions.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,280
So blogs for instance on the Bitcoin block chain blocks are added at a certain regularity in the bitcoin

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,670
chain there added once every 10 minutes.

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,090
And yet we can transact with each other more frequently.

24
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,130
We don't have to wait and transact once every 10 minutes we like I could send money to somebody today

25
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,850
and they could send money to me like a few seconds later.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,370
And so on at any point in time.

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:06,080
So the pool is like a staging area where these transactions go before they're added to a block.

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,270
So now let's have an example let's look at example let's say Susan over here wants to send some money

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,150
to somebody.

30
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,380
It doesn't matter who we're going to talk about more about transactions and wallets and so on later

31
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,560
on.

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,290
But for now let's just say she wants to do a transaction.

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,910
And what happens then.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Well she got the oxygen's action and that transaction gets added to her name to her meme pool.

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,950
Then that gets broadcasted or relayed across the network.

36
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,080
And that means it gets relayed to the closest nodes including minors which is going to use the word

37
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,110
downloads for here from here.

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,880
And so then that transaction gets added to their members.

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,990
Now again there's lots and lots of checks that are conducted by every single node to make sure that

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,440
it's a valid transaction that everything adds up.

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,370
It's not it's not something vague that the signatures are valid and so on.

42
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,930
And we'll talk more about that further down the course.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,240
And then they relayed further down the network and that transaction gets added to every single meme

44
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,020
pool in the network.

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,990
Then what happens.

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:17,440
Well then let's say Mary over here also wants to do a transaction and Mary does her transaction that

47
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,850
transaction gets relayed through the network as well to every single note like that OK.

48
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,890
And then let's say one of the miners wants to do a transaction.

49
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,500
Usually they just mine but they can also do transactions.

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,490
Why not.

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,500
So the minor of the transaction.

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,590
And then again gets relayed gets relayed it's relayed that are in network and so on.

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,620
And in an old fashion the meme pool gets more and more and more transactions added to it.

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,810
We only have six here.

55
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:57,090
But typically a meme pool can fill up like six throughout the day to 8000 more and more than 9000 10000

56
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,610
transactions can be sitting there at any given point in time.

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,180
And then when a bloke comes along as we discussed before a blog can contain about 2000 transactions

58
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,030
more or less a block is limited by one and one megabyte but a block can contain a thousand transactions

59
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,420
approximately depending on the size of the transactions.

60
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,500
Well and let's have a look at how that works what happens when a block comes along.

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,410
How does the block.

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,310
Well we know that the miners are not just sitting there idly.

63
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,740
The miners are actually mining these blocks so there is a block chain right now as of up until that

64
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,590
point in time.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,210
And the miners are churning away the mining their blogs and then all of a sudden one of them finds the

66
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,340
next bloke Well they sold the cryptogram cryptographic hash puzzle and the next bloke they're allowed

67
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,410
to add the next block.

68
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,980
So how is this how does this work well from the tutorial about how minors secretary's actions.

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:56,500
We know that while they were mining the block in the process they had already selected the transactions

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,800
that are in that block so they have a block configuration that they're mining and so even before they

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,880
have success in mind the block they know what transactions are going to be in that block based on their

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,520
selection criteria.

73
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,840
And so now since that block has indeed been mined it's time to take these transactions out of the pool

74
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,850
so these transactions get removed from that pool and they are because they're already in the block and

75
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:28,600
then that block gets relayed across the network gets added to these guys and then those same transactions

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,350
get removed from their meme pools.

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,640
As long as the block pass passes the checks then that's the way it happens.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,490
So then it gets out of the way here.

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,740
Transactions get removed and gets added to all the networks and these directions get removed from their

80
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,480
pools for every single load.

81
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:53,140
And so there we go and then that block you know is now part of the network and then the network just

82
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,510
continues on from there.

83
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,150
And they you the same thing same process happens again and again.

84
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,130
So there you go that's how the memos work.

85
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,840
So now what we're going to do is we're going to show you some additional reading and then we'll jump

86
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,490
to look at some stats on black chain info.

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,200
All right so the additional reading for today is an interesting article.

88
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,040
I liked it.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,950
It's an in-depth guide into how the ampoules work.

90
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,770
It's an medium.

91
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:29,710
As usual the link will be in the notes for the course and this guide is how many pools work from the

92
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:37,210
perspective of not a minor but of a node of a normal just normal participant who's not a minor.

93
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,880
And that's why I like this approach because what we've been seeing so far is mostly like from perspective

94
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,760
of minors and not much you see from presidium knows whereas here they explain it from a perspective

95
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,590
of just a normal participant and how the member can feel Lobb what the size limits are with.

96
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,430
There are certain fee thresholds that kick in after a certain point in time and so on.

97
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,050
So quite an interesting read.

98
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,000
And now let's have a look at some stats.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,320
All right.

100
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,590
So here we've got a lot of info by the way.

101
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,540
This is this is the additional reading here.

102
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,200
It's not that long just a short article.

103
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah so that's right.

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,510
What I want to show you today.

105
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,340
OK.

106
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,200
Here we go.

107
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:31,170
If you need to get these just go to blog share the info and then go to the charts.

108
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:44,300
This one and what I wanted to have a look at is we'll look at Temple size transaction counts and growth.

109
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,250
Yeah we're good this year.

110
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,310
All right.

111
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,530
So full size.

112
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,430
There you go.

113
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,020
This is in what is in bytes.

114
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,340
And you can see how the size varies and this is.

115
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,140
So this is throughout the day so there's one day 23 24 25 26.

116
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,660
I guess it depends on the day and so on.

117
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,560
Like it it goes down like once the transactions are out of there then.

118
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,260
So it's building up as much as I should go on.

119
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,640
Go in there.

120
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,180
I guess like because Bloxham mine every 10 minutes.

121
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,570
So it's not a question of supply of blocks it's a question of demand of transaction that depends on

122
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,240
my thinking is like when people wake up you can see kind of like his period of periodic when people

123
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,970
wake up probably in the U.S. and when they're transacting and when mauritians actions up here and they're

124
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,570
available to be distributed into blocks and they start piling up.

125
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,920
Let's have a look at.

126
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,650
So that was from bite's number of bytes This is from number of transactions similar pattern a kind of

127
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,980
you can see again see a bit of up and down.

128
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,960
You can we can do a higher.

129
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,430
That's a couple of days like 30 days.

130
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Now is he more global or like the long term trends.

131
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,470
This this is going to be a year an hour loading interesting things.

132
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,140
Remember that when the price of bitcoin was very high there were lots of transactions.

133
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,820
People were like running around buying Bitcoins very very fast.

134
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,780
There's a lot of demand so that's why it was not getting down to zero.

135
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,950
There's a transaction called and this is my full side of growth size growth.

136
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,330
So this is the speed at which it's growing not not very not very varied.

137
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:35,140
This chart here is kind of like more or less consistent.

138
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,480
Another interesting one which I really like which I wanted to show you is if you go to data and you

139
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,050
go to stats and sort of charts and then you go to unconfirmed transactions.

140
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,170
So those are the transactions that are in the meme pool that they're called unconfirmed transactions.

141
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,620
And this is just amazing.

142
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,040
I love watching this.

143
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,280
You can see how they're being added like these are people transacting with each other and as soon as

144
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,140
they transact these get added.

145
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,270
So here you can see the total number of unconfirmed transactions and also illustrated over there for

146
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,850
us.

147
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,400
And that should really show about the map.

148
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,050
It's very dynamic.

149
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,950
But nevertheless we've got some information here.

150
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,380
Transactions per second hand.

151
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,730
Yes so that's how they're being.

152
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,930
So there's a thousand.

153
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:32,090
As soon as a block is mind this will go down to like gets reduced significantly by about 2000 transactions

154
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,630
or so because those protections will go into a bar.

155
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,570
And so you know how they say there's only this like three things you can watch for a fire water and

156
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,560
then they add something.

157
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,980
Well I'm going to add the growth of under-current from transactions or the growth of the temple for

158
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,840
bitcoin.

159
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,870
It's very mesmerizing.

160
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,830
I highly recommend checking it out so if you go here just watch it.

161
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,330
OK so there we go.

162
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,230
That's us for today.

163
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,610
Hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and now we have a clearer picture on how polls work and how that gets

164
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,110
relayed throughout the network.

165
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,490
And I look forward to seeing you back here next time.

166
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,510
Until then enjoy.
