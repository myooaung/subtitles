Hello and welcome back to the course on block chain.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.750
And today we're going to talk about the difference between a public key and a bitcoin address.

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.560
And the reason for this tutorial is because a lot of the time people use these terms interchangeably

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.250
and in are used as well.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.060
But when I dug a little bit deeper I found that these are actually slightly different things and I think

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.670
a good thing to know what how they're different and why they're there is a reason what the reason is

7
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.560
for them to be different.

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.700
All right so let's have a look.

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.380
So here's our diagrams up to now.

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.390
We've got a private key which is the public key the private key is used to create the message and and

11
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.220
then give the message recreate the signature and then the public key message and signature all go into

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.860
the verification function to get a yes no answer.

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.830
And so what is a bitcoin address.

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.260
Well let's restructure this diagram or move this diagram a lil bit to the left.

15
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.140
So that same diagram just moves to the left so that we have some space on the right.

16
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.030
And what a bitcoin address is.

17
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.510
It's a it is derived from the public key and is derived by just apply simply applying the charge on

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.600
or if it just is.

19
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.230
Hash function as we know the hash function is deterministic.

20
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.940
There's a very low chance of any kind of collisions.

21
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.490
So it's pretty much like if you have the public key you will always get.

22
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.840
You will definitely always get the same address from a public key but because the collisions are so

23
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.950
rare and so unlikely it's very unlikely that you will get a you know two different public keys will

24
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.650
generate the same address very very very unlikely.

25
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.600
And so therefore again as old as as many times in this course we are leveraging the shutter on a five

26
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.330
to six function here.

27
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.670
And so what is the address for the address is where you can ask people to send you money as just with

28
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.800
the public key.

29
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.740
It's something that you don't have to keep private.

30
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.460
So the private key you definitely don't want to ever share anyway.

31
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.850
That's something that is completely yours as soon as somebody knows your priority they can take away

32
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.560
everything all the money that you have all the because a job as of that has to be kept safe whereas

33
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.820
public key is not the same thing.

34
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.170
It doesn't have to be kept safe and the address doesn't have to be kept safe.

35
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.560
All that in fact that's what you need to tell people for them to send your money.

36
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.740
The interesting thing is that people can also send you bitcoin straight to your public key as well.

37
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.280
So you can give them either in the public key or the dress.

38
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.700
The Wards will handle it either way they can send you money one way or the other.

39
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.080
But why.

40
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.980
So what was the point of the address.

41
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.490
The reason is we want to actually try and keep the public key also safe or not.

42
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.680
Exactly private and protected all the time.

43
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.030
We want to keep the public key.

44
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.170
We don't we don't want to expose it too often.

45
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.160
We definitely will have to expose the public key when we send money to someone when we send Bitcoin

46
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.260
to someone else because the public key they cannot run the verification function they cannot not confirm

47
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.890
that the transaction is valid.

48
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.080
So you will have to expose the public key when you send money.

49
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.090
But if we can avoid exposing it when we receive money we should do that.

50
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.260
And that's always the address.

51
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.280
And so the question is Why should we avoid exposing the public key when we can.

52
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.980
Well the reason for that is what we hear is in this link between the private and the public.

53
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.840
So as we know as we've discussed there's no way to generate to identify what the private key is or find

54
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.060
out the private key knowing the public key.

55
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.410
And that's like a huge foundational layer of or underpinning concepts of all this.

56
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.230
And why is that.

57
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.370
Well because the way it's generated is through an elliptic function.

58
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.340
Now we're all going to go into elliptic functions here.

59
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.110
It's a very technical topic.

60
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.580
It's kind of like digging into the nitty gritty the how the shot 256 works.

61
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.890
It's not a hash functions and elliptic function but that's how they connect some from a private key

62
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.230
elliptical function gives you the public.

63
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.830
And the reason for this additional protection that we're trying to create here.

64
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.610
We're using the Shudra 56 function is because if at some point this is somehow reverse engineered if

65
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.050
there is like a flaw in the elliptic function that is uncovered or something else and that eventually

66
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.810
one day somehow somebody finds a way to go from public to private key Well if you are giving everybody

67
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.560
a public key for all your transactions then it was very quickly somebody can get your private key.

68
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.770
But if you're protecting an additional layer of protection which is the short term and 56 of the hashing

69
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.470
algorithm then even if this happens if somebody somehow reverse engineer this then you will have that

70
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.360
additional layer of protection because people want to have your address.

71
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.740
They won't have they won't be able to get to the public that quickly unless you know unless you've sent

72
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.570
them money.

73
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.970
But if they've been sending you money they won't be able to get to it because there's this layer of

74
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.220
protection and therefore it will say you'll take some time for the Bitcoin community to fix this problem

75
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.290
fix this bug and replace the elliptic function or fix how it's calculated so fix this problem that there's

76
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.490
clearly there is a vulnerability here.

77
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.320
So it'll take some some time to fix that vulnerability and you want to be protected as much as you can

78
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.420
Jurich the duration of that vulnerability.

79
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.890
So there we go.

80
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.730
That's the reason why we use addresses rather than public keys.

81
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.890
That's why we plan additional hash or additional shut 256 or public key to get the address.

82
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.800
This is how it all works.

83
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.870
And to finish off let's have a look at what we need to do of the address where somebody said money so

84
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.550
how does this how does this actually happen.

85
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.450
This part here.

86
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.160
Well let's duplicate.

87
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:56.620
This is our diagram I've put in like sample dummy keys in there and here's another diagram another person

88
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:04.470
so let's say that's me Carol that's Adlon and if one wants to send me money I have to give him my address

89
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.660
and he will put it in to the transaction.

90
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.580
So this message here is actually that's how when we are actually transacting each other rather than

91
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.480
just encrypting messages.

92
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.100
That's where the transaction actually goes.

93
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:24.090
And then this transaction once told encrypted like that it will go to the you'll go to the block chain.

94
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.110
So you go into a block along with this public key that he has.

95
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.210
So together they all go into a block and then anybody can.

96
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.190
And the signature of the transaction the signature and the and the public key will go into a block and

97
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.830
then anybody can go ahead and verify or the notes can verify that it is about election.

98
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.820
So that's how it happens.

99
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.560
Basically I need to give them that address and he will include it in the transaction.

100
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.440
So there we go.

101
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.660
That's how what the difference is between an address and a public key.

102
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:04.450
And if you'd like to learn a bit more where I learned about this stuff is a subset it is like a it's

103
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.870
like a saw like like I don't use read it that much.

104
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:16.700
It's like the response on Reddit to a question what's the difference between the public and public address.

105
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.320
Very very detailed response by H.K. support link has always will be in the notes for the course.

106
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.430
If you would like to have a look and find out a bit more detail on that.

107
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.900
And on that topic injury to Tauriel Accorsi and XM.

108
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.620
And until then enjoy good chance.
