00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.980
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.350
All right.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.200
Back in our ad can I see your contract in the preexistence or we introduce the public variables that

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.870
anyone will have access including the persons outside of the contract.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
And now we're going to make a mapping from the investor address so it will be like it's public key it's

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.480
public address to both it's equity and at coins and USD.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.720
So for example if the investor has $1000 invested in whatever platform that holds the coins and runs

8
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.500
the CEO well on this platform the investor will have an equity of one thousand dollars and one million

9
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.110
at coin's because one U.S. dollar equals 1000 coins.

10
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.490
So let's make this mapping.

11
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.140
And actually we're going to make two mappings because in order to get both these two equities and coins

12
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.040
and USD Well we'll have to make two mappings.

13
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.430
But before we make them let's make sure we understand what exactly a mapping is.

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.330
A mapping is like a function but in which the data of the mapping is stored in an array.

15
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.230
So you know it's not exactly like a function that takes a variable and returns an operation of this

16
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.100
very well.

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.200
It's more like an array in which will have the input variable which will be the investor address and

18
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.470
which will return for each of these addresses the equity.

19
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.420
So one of these mapping will return the equity in coins and the other mapping will return the equity

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.610
in USD.

21
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.360
And so now to make a mapping in-city we simply start with knapping then some parenthesis and then in

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.810
these parenthesis we must put first the type of the input which is an address because the input will

23
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
be the address of the investor and the address is a type and solidity.

24
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.540
As we can see here.

25
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.530
So we first need to hear the input type which is address.

26
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.740
Then we add an error like this and then eventually the type of the output which will be a huge integer

27
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.610
because we want to return the equity and the equity is of course an integer you know will not be able

28
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.080
to invest $1 cents.

29
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.230
So just it's just going to be an integer and therefore that's what we have to specify here the type

30
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.120
which is again.

31
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.420
Okay.

32
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.180
And then that's not over here that's where you have to give the name of the variable that will contain

33
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.280
the value returned by this mapping.

34
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.590
Taking the address's argument as its input.

35
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.570
And so the name of this horrible will be we can say the equity in at coin's just like that.

36
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.290
So we define the mapping taking as input the address of the investor which will return an integer as

37
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.480
a type of the variable returns and the name of this variable returns will be equity at coin's getting

38
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.800
the equity in coin's of the investor.

39
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.240
All right.

40
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.130
And then let's not forget that semicolon especially when you're used to Python.

41
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.900
OK and now we're going to define the second mapping.

42
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.140
So I just selected this and compute it and just below I'm pasting it.

43
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.250
All right.

44
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.070
And so this second mapping is of course a mapping from the address of the investor.

45
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.650
Still returning a variable of type integer.

46
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.860
But this time this variable returns will not be the equity in at coin's but in U.S. dollars equity USD.

47
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.840
All right.

48
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.170
Congratulations you defined your first mapping incivility.

49
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.620
So that was a no brainer quite easy.

50
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.670
We just made like some arrays that basically make a mapping from the investor's addresses to their equity

51
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.300
in both coins and us.

52
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.050
All right so we're making some good progress then in the next to toile we'll make a modifier.

53
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.780
Why is modifier emulsifiers something that will check if an investor can buy or sell some at point he

54
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.370
or she will always be able to sell some coins.

55
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.810
No problem about that.

56
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.420
But this person will not be able to buy some coins if they're not at coins left.

57
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.150
So we'll have to make this more if I were to check that there is still some Adkins left.

58
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.450
And if that's the case the money I will give it's OK for the investor to buy some at coins.

59
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.340
So we'll make this in the next Statoil.

60
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.260
And until then.

61
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.120
And Joe hence.
