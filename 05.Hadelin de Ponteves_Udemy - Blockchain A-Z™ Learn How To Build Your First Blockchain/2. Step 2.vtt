00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.530
Hello here we are at the beginning of our implementation of the smart contract for the HCO initial at

2
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.780
COONTS offering.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.430
So as you can see I started by getting the version of the compiler which is version of point four point

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.540
eleven.

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.760
That's the version I use at the time I implemented this smart contract.

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.050
But of course you might have another version which should also work and that's how you have to start

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.320
with solidity by just getting this version of the compiler.

8
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.670
And then we are ready to create the contract and to create a contract in city.

9
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.270
Well we start like this contract then we need to give a name to this contract and we're going to call

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.450
it that coin ICAO so that the name of our contract and then to define this contract we need to add here

11
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.830
some brackets and anything that happens inside the contract will be the definition of the contract.

12
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.600
So there we go.

13
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700
Congratulations.

14
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.480
For those of you who just started their first their very first contract and solidity.

15
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.820
OK so in this contract we are going to start by defining the public variables.

16
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.790
That is the variables that can be accessed by anyone even outside the contract.

17
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.890
You know that's important to understand the difference between public variables and private variables

18
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.050
which we can differentiate here in solidity or even C++ a public variable is a variable that can be

19
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.290
accessed by anyone even outside the contract and the private variable is a variable that can be accessed

20
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.990
by only the people that are inside the contract.

21
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.800
OK.

22
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.190
So you'll see will defined some investors addresses and these will be the people for example inside

23
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.210
the contract.

24
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.440
But for now we're going to start by defining a public variable which will be the total number of coins

25
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.140
available for sale.

26
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.630
That is the total number of coins we are issuing and we're issuing 1 MILLION COINS.

27
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.130
Therefore one million at coins will be available for sale.

28
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.900
And so I'm going to introduce the new code section here with these double slashes for comment.

29
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.790
So you come in here and you could section which will be introducing the maximum let's say the maximum

30
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:37.270
or the total number of coins available for sale.

31
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.060
All right.

32
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.080
And according to you is this maximum number of coins available for sale going to be a public or private

33
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.980
variable.

34
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.350
Well a nice CEO which is deriving from an IPO initial public offering you know an IPO is for stocks

35
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.860
and NYCO is for crypto currencies or tokens.

36
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.030
But NYCO is public as an IPO so that you know anybody can invest in the tokens of the blood chain technology

37
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.780
that a company is building.

38
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.170
The ICU is public and therefore of course the maximum number of coins available for sale will be a public

39
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.830
variable and to make this a public variable we must first declare the type which is going to be a U

40
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.690
integer which means that it's an unsigned version of an integer meaning that the integer cannot be negative.

41
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.130
And more precisely it goes from 0 to the 32 bit limit which is 430 million that's the maximum number

42
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.260
that you entered you're going to have.

43
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.480
So here we have many of them but we're just going to take you and that's enough.

44
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.560
However if you want to issue 1 billion coins Well you will need to take the unit 128 you know to increase

45
00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.350
the maximum limit and then to make this variable a public variable we simply add here public.

46
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.980
All right.

47
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.710
And then of course the name of the variable which we're going to call let's make everything crystal

48
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:16.640
clear Max at quoits the maximum number of coins available for sale which we can already initialized

49
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.670
its value.

50
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.360
We want to sell 1 million coins to the world and therefore this Max at variable will be initialized

51
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.730
to 1 million Do we have one million here.

52
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.710
Yes we do.

53
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.610
Perfect.

54
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.180
So that's our first variable a public variable.

55
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.780
The maximum number of coins available for sale had Owens.

56
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.300
No I prefer that coins.

57
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.170
All right.

58
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.450
So coins are good.

59
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.350
Now let's define the next public variable.

60
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.890
So the next variable is going to be an interesting one.

61
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.970
We are going to define the conversion rate from U.S. dollars to coins.

62
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.550
That is how many coins one dollar is going to be.

63
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.160
So let's take the bitcoin for example.

64
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.510
Remember in 2009 Well you can buy a pizza with ten thousand bitcoins and you know there is the story

65
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.120
of some guy buying a pizza with 10000 coins.

66
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.890
And I think the pizza was worth $20.

67
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.220
And so he paid the pizza with ten thousand bitcoins and there is a funny anecdote.

68
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.850
If he had kept for him his ten thousand Bitcoins instead of getting some pizzas.

69
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.830
Well in November 2017 which at the time I'm speaking was the highest point of the Bitcoin reaching something

70
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.680
around eighteen thousand dollars.

71
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.710
Well this guy would have a hundred million dollars.

72
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.710
So that's a funny anecdote but not that funny for this guy.

73
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.470
And if by any chance when they buy pizza with them at Cone's we never know.

74
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.450
Well make sure to think twice.

75
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.050
And so anyway we're going to define that rate.

76
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.250
And so the question is how many coins would you give for some pizza.

77
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.620
Well you would give an infinity of at coins because that coin is worth absolutely nothing.

78
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.350
But we're just going to pretend it's worth something.

79
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.770
And just for fun we're going to say that one dollar is one at coin.

80
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.450
All right.

81
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:24.630
So we're issuing $1000 at coins and therefore nuclearization year introducing the USD the two coins

82
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.410
conversion rate perfect.

83
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.670
So the U.S. add coins conversion rate and is that going to be a public or private variable.

84
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.470
Well of course it's going to be public.

85
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.890
Otherwise the ICU would sound fishy.

86
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.360
You know you don't know what you can buy with one dollar.

87
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.030
Don't give your money.

88
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.520
And so we're going to do the same I'm going to keep this to be efficient because it's going to be almost

89
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.150
the same we'll just need to replace the name of the variable.

90
00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:03.470
So it's not going to be max at coins but let's say USD to add coins again let's make things crystal

91
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.030
clear.

92
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.960
And as we said one dollar equals one thousand at once.

93
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.620
Ok then let's not forget the semicolon right here and right here.

94
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.100
All right.

95
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.700
So everything looks good in the code so far.

96
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.590
And now we're going to have to define a third variable which will be a variable that will change its

97
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.430
value during the ICU because it's going to be the total number of coins that have been bought by the

98
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.210
investors.

99
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.880
And of course it's useful to have this variable to keep track of the CEO until all the coins are issued

100
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.570
you know until we have no coins left to sell.

101
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:56.570
And so third code section we're introducing the total number of coins that have been bought by the investors.

102
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.200
All right.

103
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.520
Introducing the total number of coins that have been bought by investors.

104
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.430
All good.

105
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.480
And again I'm asking the question is it going to be a public or private variable.

106
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:15.530
Well in an IPO or a nice year there must be a 100 percent transparency and also be able to see the number

107
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:22.830
of Atkins left inside to invest and therefore of course this variable is going to be again public.

108
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:30.250
So I'm going to copy this and paste it here.

109
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:36.730
And so this is going to be an integer public variable and then the name of this variable will be total

110
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.760
at coins.

111
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:48.370
But all right that's clear enough total at Cone's but and we will initialize it to 0 0 of course because

112
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:55.690
at the beginning of the ICAO no one no investor will have bought any coin and therefore it must start

113
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.590
at zero.

114
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.780
OK.

115
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:04.180
So that's it that's going to be it for this Statoil that was just the getting started tutorial for this

116
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:11.050
implementation to introduce all the required variables in the next one we're going to do something slightly

117
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.610
less easy but still quite easy.

118
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:21.970
We're going to do a mapping from the investors address to both its equity in coins and U.S. dollars.

119
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.110
So again check out the duck to get ready for this but it's a no brainer.

120
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.090
It's going to be quite easy.

121
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.780
Mapping is basically like a function you know a function that will take the address of the investor

122
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.180
and return its equity.

123
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.950
All right let's do this in the next tutorial.

124
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.540
And until then enjoy it.

125
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.170
Bludgeons.
