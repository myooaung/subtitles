00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.010
Hello and welcome to part three of the blog 10 course today we're starting our exciting journey into

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.250
the world of is the dream project that's been around for several years now and that is massively transforming

3
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.280
the world one step at a time.

4
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.660
So this is going to be a troll just introduced where it came from and what the general idea behind it

5
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.430
is and then we'll start diving more into things like smart contracts walk chain projects I suppose and

6
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.730
how the theory works and so on.

7
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.370
Further down the section.

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.150
So let's have a look.

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.530
Where did that theory come from.

10
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.030
If there is a project that was created by Vitale's with Teron who is currently in 2018 only twenty four

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.160
years old and when he created the project was in 2013.

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.500
So that's five years ago he was 19 years old when he came up the idea and we'll discuss this a bit more

13
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.580
in a bit more detail but in general Vitalii wanted like a scripting language a way to create programs

14
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.500
for Bitcoin.

15
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.710
And he didn't have that agreement from the community to do that or not.

16
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.470
Nobody really wanted to create a scripting language.

17
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.910
And we'll talk again we'll talk more about that down the track.

18
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.680
And so he went along and created his own project theorem which has grown into a giant behemoth that

19
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.500
it is now.

20
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.120
And like most CEOs and most new block projects are actually built on top of here.

21
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.370
So having said that Bitcoin and the theorem actually friends there is even an image like this and while

22
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.620
your friends will because they both exist in the protocol of going there and they have kind of different

23
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.340
purposes.

24
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.020
So the purpose of bitcoin is to just create a crypto currency that will disrupt your bags and allow

25
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.730
us to tray other transfer money borderless and permission lessly.

26
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.500
So because this is here and it doesn't really it's not the intention is not to create a platform for

27
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.510
others to create projects on top of it.

28
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.650
Whereas in theory that's the whole design that the theorem is actually not designed as a criticality

29
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.690
design as a platform for others to build on top of others to create programs in them.

30
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.150
So let's go into that a bit more detail what what what does this whole idea behind the protocol that

31
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.060
is a theory.

32
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.430
So the main underlying idea is that we are all interconnected.

33
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.560
There we are we we have the Internet which connects people together and so on.

34
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.080
So how about we build a blockade.

35
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.910
And we'll talk about what these smart contracts are and a bit more detail then try to build a block

36
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.450
chain that not only allows us to store transactional data but actually allows us to store programs that

37
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.530
allow facilitates the execution of programs.

38
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.350
And that way we can decentralize any application that we built and how in a decentralized way we're

39
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.510
going to run it.

40
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.740
Well we're going to run it on the computers of the people that are part of that block chain.

41
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.510
So what if we could instead of like launching an application for instance like Facebook on a server

42
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.320
and then everybody having to go to that server and communicate with it and store their data.

43
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.990
What if we could run Facebook on everybody's computer at the same time.

44
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.640
And like not Facebook but like an alternative to that way it's completely decentralized.

45
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.340
So the idea here and again we'll talk about this in more detail throughout the session but the core

46
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:50.110
idea here is to build a world super computer in a distributed manner and use blotching to facilitate

47
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.510
that.

48
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.180
So the world supercomputer won't be like a in one location or one very strong computer or one very paralyzing

49
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:06.300
you know it will be all of our laptops connected together working to execute apps and programs and you

50
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.510
know do things in this environment.

51
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.210
And all of that will be facilitate through watching where the programs will be described where all of

52
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:23.740
the transactions will be stored where any changes will be recorded and they will be in an immutable

53
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.340
manner and in a copy of that blotching will of course reside on every single computer as well so everybody

54
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.420
will have a copy of the wash.

55
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.680
And as we discussed before.

56
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.840
So that's the idea.

57
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.250
The idea of with theorem is actually degraded like the world's biggest supercomputer that will be able

58
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.110
to decentralize any application if you want to build the decentralized because you just go to a theorem

59
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.880
and you build it on top of that.

60
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.490
And so the infrastructure is already there.

61
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.690
That is how it theory is shaping and transforming the world.

62
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.720
So there is a quick taste for what is coming ahead.

63
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.780
So you can see it's a very different product.

64
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.390
They also use boxings is very different to Bitcoin and that and this is where all the development work

65
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.050
comes in.

66
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.170
This is where we are able to create programs and so on and finally we've gotten to this day it was necessary

67
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.230
for us to go through Paswan and to understand everything how everything works in box.

68
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.110
And finally we hear we're going to dive further into this in the coming tutorials.

69
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.480
Very excited about that.

70
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.440
And in the meantime if you'd like to get some additional information on lithium in an article I can

71
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.390
recommend is called What is the theory in the ultimate Beginner's Guide by Alex Moscow.

72
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.620
And locates located on coring Central.

73
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.630
So there we go.

74
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.440
That's what it is in a natural and you world supercomputer.

75
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.150
And come away to dive straight into it in the points totals until next engine.
