1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,200
Hello and welcome back to the course and blotching.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,400
So to understand what Web 3.0 is let's first understand what Web 2.0 is.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,370
Here we've got a couple of examples of Web sites back from the 90s as you might remember them or you

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,500
might not remember them but this is what they looked like.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,970
And back then simply a Web site was just text.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,940
Maybe some images and some links and like in the case of Apple this is Apple upset.

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,680
I was very upset and because of the Apple website like it's a bit like probably later in time or with

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,190
more advice because you can see like a for me here some buttons and so on.

9
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,630
Maybe like even some advance coloring and things like that.

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,300
So yeah good old days.

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,660
This is what the Web looks like and this wasn't Web 1.0.

12
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,520
As you can see it's a very different experience to what we have now.

13
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,030
So let's have a look at the Web sites of Apple and Amazon as they are today.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,650
There is Apple.

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,020
You get those vibrant colors.

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:22,540
We get all the menus at the top and how you can just go and watch a video right here of leaving the

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,640
page and there is the Amazon Web site.

18
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,730
Again you've got like a form here like a search form.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,820
You've got this carousel that's changing the ads in the background.

20
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:41,410
There you go all these different other ads they're all tracking your purchases like you're you're being

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,780
served.

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,330
The most relevant things to you.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,640
There's always these Pop-Pop says is very interactive things and I'm not even talking about social media

24
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,620
here.

25
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,490
That's a huge new thing in the web as well compared to version 1.0.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:08,770
And so all of this together is called Web two point oh the term was popularized in 2004 and it signifies

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,390
a paradigm shift in how we experience Web sites and the Internet.

28
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,700
So we went from just basic text and links and images to everything moving around things.

29
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,810
Loading.

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,000
You can watch videos you can watch videos for adlibbing a page you can you you have social There's so

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,110
many things going on and some of them are listed here.

32
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:40,660
A big role in Web 2.0 was played by Ajax and or I-X and javascript's because those technologies allowed

33
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,010
that whole transition to loading pages with refreshing loading elements on pages without having to refresh

34
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,050
the page every time we've had the page refreshing itself.

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,340
And that's that's immersion into your experience that you get from there.

36
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,370
So that's Web 2.0.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,510
It was like a prize in 2004 is like a specific date when that happened it just it just kept happening

38
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,590
and people realize that we're in a different world now.

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:16,900
And so this map that out on a typical Web site or typical experience user experience of the web we have

40
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,150
a front and the back in front end is what the user sees the back end is what happens in the background.

41
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,250
What they don't see.

42
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:30,900
So in terms of Front-End there is our back in Web 1.0 there is our app a Web site and now this is what

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:39,910
looks like in Web 2.0 front and has changed drastically the whole experience has changed a lot not just

44
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,590
what they see but like what they feel how how the machine learning technologies are serving and what

45
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:54,550
videos they interact with how the Web sites remembering things they've done before and adapting to them.

46
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,860
So that was that Web 1.0.

47
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,000
This isn't Web 2.0 but let's get them back in.

48
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,940
How does the back end change.

49
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,130
Well Bakken hasn't changed much.

50
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,940
We don't take into account all the complex algorithm that algorithms that sit in the back at the core

51
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:18,100
structure and the core architecture of how people interact with Web sites and things on the web is through

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,070
a centralized approach.

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:27,120
There's a central server for instance Apple in this case the central server and we're accessing it.

54
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,130
We're requesting things from a central server and then we're getting information back.

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,820
And so this is where lauching can play a huge part in Web 3.0 and probably will.

56
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,530
So there is Web 2.0.

57
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,270
We don't really know what's going to happen with the front end because it's also important to think

58
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:54,760
about that as well that that will change maybe it will become a computer vision or maybe will become

59
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,750
like an even more interactive or even more AI driven personalized that things like that.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,630
That's not the question that we're answering here right now.

61
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,530
The question is how will the back end change.

62
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:14,410
Well this is where blotching play a major role and we can move from a centralized web in Web 2.0 to

63
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,520
a decentralized web the Web 3.0.

64
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,930
And let's have a look in a bit more detail how that can take place.

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:31,260
So here we've got all the people in the world and as we know we're all interconnected.

66
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,460
We all know something that somebody knows somebody and then people know each other and there's like

67
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,830
this whole concept of Six Degrees of Separation and things like that or now it's the lower that you

68
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,960
pretty much know anybody in the world through like four or five or six connections.

69
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,000
But nevertheless even though we're all connected where we want to interact to each other what do we

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,430
do.

71
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:03,160
Well we go to for instance Facebook which has centralized servers which belong to Facebook and all the

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,490
data is stored there.

73
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,140
And so we are actually interacting with Facebook or Facebook's servers and services which then allow

74
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,000
us to connect with each other.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,010
So we have that middleman Facebook which so far has done a great job.

76
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:23,620
We've got we've got to give it to these companies that bring us closer together Facebook linked Twitter

77
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:33,080
and so like they've they definitely had a major role in the evolution of how society and just globally

78
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,900
the world is connected.

79
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:42,280
However the core the underlying foundational premise of all remains that we are still interacting through

80
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,620
a centralized way with each other through Facebook servers so they have control where data over our

81
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,880
privacy they can service the ads they want to serve as they can charge us if they want to charge if

82
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,960
they don't if they don't want to charge as adults.

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,680
And so there is a lot of control.

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:11,500
Are we giving away to them whereas in Web 3.0 with the block chain approach the hypothesized idea is

85
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,810
that we move back to using this interconnectivity that we have with each other and at the same time

86
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,630
they will be able of change or multiple block chains which would run the applications again a copy on

87
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:34,300
this block chain would be stored on every single computer and then they would be smart contracts which

88
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:41,650
govern how these applications work and what happens for instance in the case of a social media application

89
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,800
or social media network.

90
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,370
Smart contracts would say what happens when a person joins what happens when they add somebody as a

91
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:48,880
friend.

92
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,080
What happens when somebody posts something and so on.

93
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,280
So basically the code behind that social media network and that would all be stored in a block channel

94
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:07,750
shouldn't be running just as we discussed throughout this whole course how a watch chain works and a

95
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,180
great example of Blash in readiness for this is theory serious blotching where applications are already

96
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:19,950
created and we saw an example of steam in it which is a block chain version of Twitter.

97
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:29,800
And so basically the social media network live on this block chain we would all have either our own

98
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,530
data or fragments and bits and pieces of each other's data and then along the way.

99
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,570
But the point is that the control over the data would be stored using a private key on the block chain

100
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,020
so only you would have access to your data and you would through your interactions and through the smart

101
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,870
contracts you would be able to and through your actions you would be able to select who gets to see

102
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,470
your data doesn't who you want to be friends with who doesn't and befriend them.

103
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,700
So you get control back over your data completely entirely because it's not stored on a centralized

104
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:09,490
service store or near a computer again or there's other ways to implement this can be stored in fragmented

105
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,180
pieces all over the place but only you can put it back together.

106
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,770
And so therefore what we're doing is we're leveraging our own machines rather than a central server

107
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,440
to help make all of this happen.

108
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,260
All of the smart contracts are executing on all machines all the data is stored in our machines the

109
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,460
block chain is running on our machines.

110
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,680
The interconnectivity is happening between our machines we don't really need a central server.

111
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,840
We can have a social network which is completely which doesn't belong to anyone.

112
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,750
It just runs.

113
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:52,090
It just exists and it's crowdsourced and people add to it and like take away from it and we all vote

114
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,010
how it develops and things like that.

115
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,610
So a very democratized approach.

116
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,950
Where we all have control.

117
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,890
So this brings us back to that idea of the supercomputer that Israel was trying to build like the global

118
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,980
supercomputer using our little computers that we have rather than a centralized server.

119
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,490
So there we go that's how Beauchesne can contribute to Web 3.0 very easy an example of this steam at

120
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,490
a Web site.

121
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,810
And there's more and facts and interesting additional reading for you here.

122
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,690
Where

123
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:38,110
author tio talks about the theoretical concepts and implications around ball or block chain or Web 3.0.

124
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:46,030
Actually there is a screen shot there of the apps how they might change how the browser machine's storage

125
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,180
and video call social networking and so on.

126
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,380
So you actually see here steam it is over here.

127
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,380
So there we go that's web three point onwards.

128
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,810
And how blotching can play a role in that.

129
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:08,080
Check out this article is quite popular on medium and yeah it's a good idea I think to get up today

130
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,000
or upscaled with with what's coming ahead.

131
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,490
What to expect from what the Internet will look like and why.

132
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:23,110
Well because it will give you ideas on maybe how you can contribute to that or maybe how you can participate

133
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,350
in all of this and get started early and start you know transitioning your mindset again.

134
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,450
This is all just all might change in a few months in a few years.

135
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:39,670
It might look completely different to what we're speculating now but it does look promising it does

136
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,380
look like a very interesting way that world could go on that now.

137
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,050
I hope you enjoyed this story on that look your next.

138
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,320
Until then.

139
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,000
But Cheyne's.
