00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.050
Hello and welcome back to the course and blotchy and today I've got a very interesting topic Bitcoins

2
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:19.210
monetary policy just as central banks of governments have their own monetary policies being a financial

3
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.980
system of its own kind.

4
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.720
Bitcoin also has a monetary policy.

5
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.380
So let's have a look.

6
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.520
Bitcoins monetary policy consist of two main parts a principle called the having and block frequence.

7
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.290
And we'll have a look at both.

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.480
So the hobbit What is it all about.

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:48.970
Well what's this principle states is that the number of bitcoins released into the system is covered

10
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.720
every single four years.

11
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.830
So it's actually not just for years it's two hundred and ten thousand blocks.

12
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.110
So you can see here that every 10000 blocks the number of bitcoins per block is reduced by two.

13
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.400
So by like twice by two x.

14
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.440
So at the start it was 50 cents per block from 2012 from November 2012.

15
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.910
25 because per block.

16
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.940
But and you can see that happen that Glocken number children ten thousand four hundred twenty thousand.

17
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.180
It was reduced to 12 and a half because per block around 2020 it'll be six point twenty five because

18
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.550
we're broke and 2024 will be 3.5.

19
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.710
And we continue having every child written down and looks about or about every four years.

20
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.820
And the important thing to note here is that the monetary policy of course is entirely controlled controlled

21
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.600
by its software and tried entirely under the control of the algorithm that is in bitcoins not somebody

22
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.280
going out there and say OK we're going to change the number of bitcoins released this year to this amount.

23
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.320
No it's just all preprogrammed into the software.

24
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.730
It's done like that.

25
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:17.530
And as you'll see for the dollar and actually in the tutorial about mining and distending mining difficult

26
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.210
to we'll have a discussion about how this is actually very effective.

27
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.890
How effective the policy is how is able to keep things under control inflation control things like that

28
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.170
so let's look a little bit about it today and we'll talk more about that.

29
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.130
So this is the principle that's basically controls as we know because there are at least two of every

30
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.080
block every single time there's a block created because there really well this controls a quantity of

31
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.820
because Beulah's And if we charted out you will see that Bitcoin's This is the Javie principle in blue.

32
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.650
So on the right is the reward and you can see that it drops 50 even coins to 25 to twelve point five

33
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.310
it will keep reducing like that until like approximating to zero.

34
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.250
Then on the other hand you have the number of because the supply so you can see how many bitcoins are

35
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.940
going into the system.

36
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.440
So there's 210 foreign trainees every every square here is about 40 years.

37
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.840
If you if you think of it that way you can see that the number of bitcoins is increasing.

38
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.680
And because of the hobby principle.

39
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.590
So if you take it like if you take if you take 50 plus 25 plus 12 and a half plus and so on.

40
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.840
And of course you multiply it by the number of number of Laux inside this period of four years.

41
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.880
But in general you see because it's having It's approximate So it's basically an exponential chart as

42
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.390
well.

43
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.460
And it has an asymptotic value so it go it will not just keep increasing forever it will it will converge

44
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.560
to a certain amount and in fact simply because there is a limitation in the accuracy of how like you

45
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.370
know how much you can divide a single bitcoin by because of that limitation that the final the final

46
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.930
block or block the final bit coins that will be released as a block reward ever will happen in 2140

47
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.990
at 21.

48
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.650
So theoretically it could keep having until infinity but because there is a certain number of decimal

49
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:37.650
points after the comma that's off to the decimal that a bitcoin can handle the final blog will be really

50
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:46.220
the final block reward the final Bitcoins released for the sister in this matter will be installed 140

51
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.920
and the total number of bitcoins in circulation ever will be 21 million.

52
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.380
And yeah.

53
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.050
So we actually there's an interesting chart let me let me have a look.

54
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.780
What we want to talk about now.

55
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.510
Oh actually.

56
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.790
First I wanted to mention this is a different chart.

57
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:12.360
So here you can see the same yellow line is also how many of the red line is the block reward as you

58
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.700
can see it's is being hard every four years is going down.

59
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.770
But this yellow chart now doesn't represent the total number of bitcoins in circulation.

60
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.920
It is the transaction fees because from here you might ask the question you know well if we're getting

61
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.400
if we're getting if miners are getting less and less and less reward of time you know after some time

62
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.310
once it gets like below one Vicodin per minute Glock what's the point of mining the whole system collapse.

63
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:43.320
Well the hopes are that it would collapse because the fees should increase because as time passes more

64
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.300
and more people will adopt Bitcoin and more and more people will be using bitcoin and therefore more

65
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.160
transactions will be required to be processed and therefore minors will be getting more fees and B and

66
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.010
people will be paying more higher fees for their transactions to go through because of the because there

67
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.820
will be more demand for for transactions to go through basically.

68
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.680
There's a limit to how much money Tommyknockers actions can go through and they'll be like it will be

69
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.640
a competitive market.

70
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.590
So if you want a transaction to go through you'll pay more fees and therefore the fees will go up and

71
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.130
minors will be compensated not just the Iranian Oil Company.

72
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.480
They are already compensated not just by the block reward they're also getting the fees but because

73
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.970
the fees will go up that will compensate for the fact that the bloke who warned has gone down.

74
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.010
And so it is hoped that the total mining incentive will stay here.

75
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.240
But this yellow line is totally up to how the market plays out how this whole system plays out and the

76
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:46.170
adoption rate of the court and the other thing I wanted to show you is this chart over here where we've

77
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.470
got monetary inflation.

78
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:55.830
So once again this blue line this time it's once again the total number of bitcoins in circulation.

79
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.310
So it's not these bitcoins in circulation.

80
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:06.400
We're back to that and this line that drops over here is the inflation and inflation is basically there's

81
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.430
a formula for inflation here Coinbase.

82
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.010
That's how much money is being released.

83
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.250
So that's some of 50 $25 have tons of sportier.

84
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.820
Divide by existing points.

85
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:27.040
But in essence what's inflation as we know it is like how prices increase in in a certain currency you

86
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.020
know like if you have a bottle of milk was a dollar then becomes two dollars.

87
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.190
That's because of inflation.

88
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.570
Well in bitcoin.

89
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.780
Actually what you see is overtime.

90
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.850
There is deflation.

91
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.550
This factor is decreasing and that's because more supply is limited and it's less and less blocks have

92
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.370
been released and released into the system.

93
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.690
So Bitcoin is a deflationary type of currency.

94
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.220
Very interesting.

95
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:53.760
OK.

96
00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:00.430
So having principle and now there's talk about block frequency so low frequencies How often do those

97
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.020
blogs come in that Graig the reward which is right now.

98
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.070
And a half Bitcoin's per block.

99
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.210
How often do they come in.

100
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.850
Well depending on the cryptocurrency they are different.

101
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.430
For instance in Bitcoin it's 10 every 10 minutes.

102
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:18.100
And in theory it's every 15 seconds in Ripl it's every three and a half seconds and like coin every

103
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.270
two and a half minutes.

104
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.020
So it really depends on the design of the system.

105
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.990
And now let's have a look at an example.

106
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.950
Look at this live life example so this is a Web site that we're going to be going to very often is called

107
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:39.030
block chain dot com or blotching don't I think the same Web site you'll see will just jump over that

108
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.520
are now.

109
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.530
So if I go to data here at the top you see box into an inferno.

110
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.410
And we'll be dealing with data charts.

111
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.560
That's those are going to be our predominant tabs and we're going to go into.

112
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.130
And this is where you can find all of the information log chain.

113
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.630
You can see the latest blogs that the latest blog was mine five minutes ago.

114
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.060
The one before that 22 minutes ago.

115
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.760
Twenty five and so on.

116
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.900
You got you have some stats very very useful.

117
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.970
So lots of wonderful information here so I highly recommend checking it out and just browsing through

118
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:16.180
it in your own time and plus we'll definitely learn a lot of things from here during this at least this

119
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.770
module of the course.

120
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:24.430
And so over you're going to hear see more and you'll see the most recent blogs you can see the time

121
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.190
when they were mine.

122
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.540
You can see this one was mine at 2 to 3.

123
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.560
This one 1:46 So what's the difference in time here.

124
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.550
It's 17 minutes.

125
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.800
So here it's three minutes.

126
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.460
Here it's another three minutes here it's 11 minutes.

127
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.340
Here is what is this 11 minutes as well.

128
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:48.090
So if you take these times and you take the average because again it's a cryptographic puzzle.

129
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.250
That is the goal.

130
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.210
If so basically it can it can vary.

131
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.890
You can flush it up and down.

132
00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:02.380
But if you take the average it should work out to be 10 minutes and we'll see exactly how this is controlled

133
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:09.940
in the system further down in this module of course you're on the sands covered together why it's actually

134
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.700
10 minutes how that is maintained.

135
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.590
And so you can click on any block and you can explore if you like.

136
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.660
And that brings us to the end of this to today's tutorial.

137
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.560
I wanted to see just an interesting article if you'd like to do some additional reading.

138
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.190
I found this interesting article by Mark Jeff savage and cool.

139
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:39.870
It's about all this time is different part to what Bitcoin really is and it's actually about how long

140
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.390
is it 15 minutes or so.

141
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:49.030
It's a longer than average but it about the we talked about inflation deflation monetary policy and

142
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:55.930
you know like for example here we've got what is this monetary base in billions of dollars.

143
00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:01.270
How many how many billions of dollars they are there in circulation as far as I understand.

144
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.480
But you can see right here is huge.

145
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:09.820
He's advocating that the central banks can just do whatever they want they can release money whenever

146
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.790
they like but in Bitcoin it's all part of the system part of a very very smart system very well thought

147
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.550
through system.

148
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:28.270
So very interesting article lots of thought provoking ideas here that will contrast crypto currencies

149
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.070
to normal currencies and I highly recommend checking it out for an interesting read.

150
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.550
And on that note I hope you enjoyed today's Torro.

151
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.880
I look forward to seeing you next time.

152
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.880
And until then good chance.
