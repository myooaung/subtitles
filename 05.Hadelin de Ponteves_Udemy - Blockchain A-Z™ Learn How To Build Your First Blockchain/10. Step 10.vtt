00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.430
All right guys let's do this let's do this demo.

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.110
Create a cryptocurrency interacting with our black chain and post man on our three node with you with

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.460
me and curial.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.020
So speaking of these nodes we have them ready that's the note five thousand one that's the node five

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.910
thousand two and that's not five thousand three.

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.520
All right.

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.420
And we have our two Jason foud one fell for the notes and one fell for the transaction.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.290
So we have everything ready.

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.450
Let's do this.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.940
Now the question is how are we going to do that demo.

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.340
Well I could either test it on several computers or I could even make a call with curial and do a live

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.120
video chat you know with him being in Australia and receiving the coins in.

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.210
I thought of doing this but I was afraid that the streaming would not be that great and therefore I

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.900
came up with another solution which is to create two other consoles here which is exactly like having

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.070
two other computers connected to two different servers.

16
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.610
So that's what I'm going to do.

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.340
I'm going to run this No.

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.340
1 which is my node on console 1 then I'll make another console and I'll run node five thousand two on

19
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.210
console 2 then I'll make a third console and I'll run node five thousand three on this console three.

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.160
All right so you ready let's do this and then we'll move on to postman to exchange a lot of Atco into

21
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.880
it.

22
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.170
So let's start with node five thousand one in console one.

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.370
Let's run this.

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.040
Here we go node five thousand one.

25
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.920
All good.

26
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.000
Now let's make a new console so you click on this tool button here and then on open and I buy it.

27
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.210
So there you go.

28
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.240
That's your second console on which we're going to run node five thousand two so selecting all this

29
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.300
that Kyrillos node.

30
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.540
Let's do this.

31
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.100
Running the app on Node 5000 to perfect.

32
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.740
And now let's take care of your node.

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.730
So again a new console here you click on the two button and then open and I buy and console and we are

34
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.590
going to run node five thousand three that is your node on console 3 and there we go.

35
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.530
We have our three nodes running.

36
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.070
And so now I can tell you we have our decentralized chain up and running.

37
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.780
So we're going to test it out now.

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.950
We're going to jump to postmen and to do this we're going to go to our list of programs or applications

39
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.090
doubletake on postman to lunch postman and in a matter of seconds will interact with our blood chain.

40
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.030
So let's close this.

41
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.920
We don't need this.

42
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.910
And here we go.

43
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.780
Let's get started.

44
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.110
All right.

45
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.090
So first thing we're going to do is since you know I'm not going to jump from one computer to another

46
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.210
we're doing everything on the same computer.

47
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.090
Well I'm going to create two more tabs here.

48
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.320
Each of them will be for each of our node.

49
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.520
So this will be for the node five thousand one my node this will be for the node five thousand two girls

50
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.420
node and this will be for the node five thousand three your note.

51
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.770
So let's start with my node and the first thing we're going to do is get the chain to see if the Genesis

52
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.960
block was well created.

53
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.890
So remember what we have to do we have to enter the request you are.

54
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:21.150
So let's get the main root of our node which is HTP colon slash slash 127 point or point 0.1 and then

55
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.720
I'll take this.

56
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.260
But it's going to be of course five thousand one for my node.

57
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.940
So going back to postman let's base that here let's replace node five thousand by five thousand one

58
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.130
that's my node.

59
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.920
And now let's get the get chaine request I think we're all good.

60
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.620
Let's press enter and there we go.

61
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.080
Welcome to the Genesis block.

62
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.710
Great.

63
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.050
So now we're going to take care of the other node.

64
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.750
Let's do the same now for curial.

65
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.290
So I'm going to paste that again.

66
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.440
Replace 5000 by five thousand two because clearly is a node five thousand two.

67
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.060
And then here add get changed again and let's press enter.

68
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.840
Perfect.

69
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.600
That's the genesis block as well.

70
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.240
Don't worry about the timestamp which is not the same as my timestamp.

71
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.080
This issue is going to be fixed as soon as we apply the consensus.

72
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.890
Indeed all the notes in the de-centralized block chain must have the same blocks.

73
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.870
So here we have the same prepossession the same proof but will also have the same time stamp.

74
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.080
Once we apply the consensus.

75
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.360
All right.

76
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.230
Now let's take care of your node get request as well.

77
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.600
Let's copy this.

78
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.760
You are on the node five thousand three and let's not forget to add the get chain request and there

79
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.630
we go.

80
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.660
Congratulations you have your Genesis block.

81
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.590
OK so that was the first part of the test.

82
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.550
The first part of the demo that's done now it's going to get slightly more challenging because what

83
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.680
we're going to do is make our first post request.

84
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.890
We're going to make our first post request to connect the notes to each other and therefore what you

85
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:10.070
have to do now is select post on your notes so I'm going to do this for each of the three nodes posts

86
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.360
here and post here.

87
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.680
And let's start with my note.

88
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.780
So what we want to do now is Connect the notes and therefore I'm going to go back to Python to my notes

89
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.890
JS Jayson file.

90
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.620
I'm going to select all this copy it and then go back to postman to make this post request.

91
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.860
So to make a post request first you need to select both as we did then you need to select the right

92
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.350
request which to connect node we called connect node.

93
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.400
All right that's the name of the request and then make sure to follow here.

94
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.160
We need to go to Buddy and then we need to select raw and then.

95
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.190
Don't forget this select here.

96
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.370
Jason abrogates and Jason.

97
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.680
And then you can paste the Jason Fowler.

98
00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.270
But since we're connecting the nodes from node five thousand one of course here we will remove all this

99
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.980
because this is the address of node five thousand one.

100
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.820
And in order to connect the node five thousand one to the other node well will simply need to input

101
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.320
the other notes that is no node 5000 to and your node node 5 and 3.

102
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.450
So there we go.

103
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.690
This should be all good.

104
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.870
Now we're going to check if that works.

105
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.860
I'm a little bit worried.

106
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.680
We never know.

107
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.600
But let's press enter and there we go.

108
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.610
All the nodes are now connected.

109
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.220
Congratulations to Atco and black chain now contains the following notes five thousand two and five

110
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.050
thousand three.

111
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.000
Besides note five thousand one awesome that works.

112
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.190
Congratulations you've just sent your first your very first post request.

113
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.590
And so now we're going to do the same for the other node.

114
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:54.350
We are going to connect the nodes from node 5000 to so connect node here same we go to Buddy then we

115
00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:04.940
go to Raw and then we select Jason then to be efficient we can just copy this we paste down here and

116
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:12.170
we select five thousand one and five thousand three because we were connecting the node 5000 to to the

117
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.530
other node which are five thousand one in five thousand three.

118
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.300
All right so if you're ready.

119
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.810
Everything seems to be all good.

120
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.430
Let's press enter.

121
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.240
Perfect.

122
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.990
All the nodes are now connected.

123
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.810
Let's quickly listen for your node from node five thousand three post request.

124
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:38.470
The request is Connect node now we go to Buddy we go to RA and we select Jason and now we are going

125
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:48.280
to take this and it and replace of course five thousand three by five thousand two because we're connecting

126
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.510
your node five thousand three to my node five thousand one and Kiros node five thousand two.

127
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.520
All right.

128
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.420
So again L'Express answer perfect.

129
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.140
All the nodes are now connected.

130
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.590
Our block chain is fully connected now.

131
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.350
You know it's like a fully connected graph.

132
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:11.590
Those of you who like Graph Theory of course in a real life action system we would have an extra program

133
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.090
that automates all this.

134
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.180
You know all the connections of these nodes.

135
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.320
Each time we add a node on the block chain.

136
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.450
But this is how it goes behind this thing.

137
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.140
OK.

138
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.110
So congratulations we're done with our first post request.

139
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.990
No worries we're going into the other one.

140
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.320
The atoms action post request but not right now.

141
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.290
Now we're going to test the consensus we're going to test what happens if on one node we get a chain

142
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:40.450
that is larger than the chains on the other node and therefore what I'm going to do now is first I'm

143
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:47.310
going to go back to the get request in the three nodes because otherwise I'm sure I will forget to get.

144
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:56.830
And so now what we're going to do is nine a block on my node so mine block that's the request remember

145
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.150
I'm mining a block of my node on the Get request.

146
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.860
All good.

147
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.520
Let's press enter.

148
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.590
And here we go.

149
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.760
Congratulations.

150
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.030
You're just mind block.

151
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.060
You been me.

152
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.910
The proof is 533.

153
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:16.630
And of course since I'm D-minor Well my node which has this address sends one at coin to me.

154
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.160
ADLER OK.

155
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:24.090
So interesting we just made a new blog and therefore my new chain if we have look at it.

156
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.870
Thanks to the get chain request.

157
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.810
Well here is my new chain.

158
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.960
Here is the black chain on my note.

159
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.050
So I have to work.

160
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:39.970
But if we have a look at curiousest joined now by selecting to get Jane requests.

161
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.380
Well he only has one block which is not good because he should have to.

162
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:54.210
And you get the same deal if we send the get chaine request on your node.

163
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.650
Well you will also have one block the Genesis block.

164
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:04.830
All right so no worries we're going to fix that now by applying to replace chain requests.

165
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.870
So let's do that for curious.

166
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:16.190
First I'm on Kyrios know right now and I'm selecting here to replace chaine request.

167
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.620
It's a get request.

168
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.270
Make sure to have that selective replay same.

169
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.580
We are in Kiros No.

170
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.680
Five thousand two.

171
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.450
We are ready to replace the chain.

172
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.410
And here we go.

173
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.050
The nodes had different chains.

174
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.270
So real strain was replaced by the longest one.

175
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.020
Awesome.

176
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.150
And now we have the new chain with the Genesys block which by the way is now having his issues solved

177
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.440
because we should have the same time stamp as my Genesis.

178
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.890
Here we go 5 p.m. and 11 minutes.

179
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.590
Perfect.

180
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:53.830
And of course we have my transaction from my node to myself because I mind and you block and here for

181
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.510
you now.

182
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.400
Well if we get the chance again of course you will still have just one block.

183
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:06.730
So we are going to fix that for you now replace chain by thinning to replace Sharon request let's press

184
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.560
enter and there we go.

185
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.660
You now have the same chain as killing me.

186
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.900
So perfect.

187
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.190
Second part of the demo smashed.

188
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:15.810
OK.

189
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:22.270
So now we're going to test the next post request which is the transaction post request and this is going

190
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:28.990
to be fun because I'm going to send a lot of coins to kill an even more odd coins to you.

191
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:34.240
I'm going to send 10000 at Cone's to Curiel and one hundred thousand at coin's to you.

192
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:41.830
So the first thing we need to do is first select the post request because the transaction request is

193
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:46.080
a post request and then we need to get the right name here.

194
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.050
So the name of the request is ad trend section.

195
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.960
That's the name of the request.

196
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.510
We're doing this on my note because I have old ad coins but you are about to get some as well so at

197
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.170
transaction then we get somebody then here of course will have a different reason.

198
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:11.090
So we'll go back to Python to get arch action Jayson file.

199
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.340
Let's copy this.

200
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:21.540
Let's go back to postman and let's replace the previous days and fall for the notes by the Jayson file

201
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.380
for the transaction.

202
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.020
All right.

203
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:35.370
So this is going to be a transaction from myself at Le to curial because I'm selling them at coin suku.

204
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.070
All right.

205
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.900
So here I'm just entering our names ATLA and curial.

206
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.660
But of course in real life we should enter our public key.

207
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.830
You know that's how it's done.

208
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.290
We don't enter it this way we need unique identifiers which is a public key.

209
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.970
You also have the private key.

210
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.730
That's the key you keep on your wallet like co-pay or 3m whatever you want and you'll see by the way

211
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.830
module three will work on my ether wallet.

212
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.030
But anyway the transaction is from the sender to the receiver curial.

213
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:13.940
And as I said I'm going to send to curial ten thousand at coin's right 10000.

214
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.600
All good.

215
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.030
So that's a transaction that's the Jason fell for the transaction.

216
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:25.360
And now let's check we have everything all good post actions transaction on that five thousand one which

217
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.280
is my note and I'm sending to Curiel 10000 at cons.

218
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.420
OK.

219
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.850
So let's test this again.

220
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.030
Slightly worried.

221
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.250
We never know.

222
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.880
3 2 1 GO.

223
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.020
Awesome.

224
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:46.320
This transaction the transaction of 10000 at coins from myself to real will be added to block 3.

225
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.940
Remember that the black index plus one.

226
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.650
All right perfect so we have this transaction.

227
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.320
But wait.

228
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.940
This transaction is not yet added to a block.

229
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.610
We need to mine a block first to welcome this transaction and added to the bloodshed.

230
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.540
So that's exactly what we'll do right now.

231
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.850
And that's why I'm going back to the get request.

232
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:16.340
And so now you'll see if I mine a black Thanks to the mine block request from my new five thousand one.

233
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.010
Well what will we get.

234
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.920
We will get a new block containing two transactions.

235
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:29.320
The first one is from the note to myself because I'm the miner who just mined the block and I just got

236
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:37.860
one at coin and of course the second transaction from myself to Kyrle of ten thousand coins.

237
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:44.010
All right perfect so not 100 percent perfect because now the issue is that on the other note there isn't

238
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.680
rules no.

239
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.940
And on your note you'll see that they to have the most up to date chain.

240
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.660
We can check that now if we have a look at our chain now sending the get chaine request.

241
00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.610
Well now my chain has three blocks with of course the Genesis block.

242
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.990
The first block that I mind.

243
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:10.720
And the second block with my action from the note to myself and the transaction from myself to Curiel

244
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.320
of 10000 coins.

245
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.310
So basically I have three blocks.

246
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:21.360
But then if we have a look at curiousest chain by selecting get chaine here.

247
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.450
Well curious Jane only has two blocks and same for you.

248
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.050
You only have two blocks right.

249
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.610
Two lengths two three blocks here two blocks here and two last year.

250
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:43.880
No worries we're going to fix that right now applying the consensus using our replace chain request.

251
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.890
And there we go.

252
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.430
The nodes had different chains.

253
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.460
So curious chain was replaced by longus one and now curial gets this new transaction that we made for

254
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.110
myself to kill of 10000 Atkins.

255
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:56.570
Great.

256
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.420
And by the way if we send our request again you know replaced Jane.

257
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.150
Well let's see what happens.

258
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.050
Well we have the actual chain and the message says all good.

259
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.710
The chain is the largest one.

260
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.050
So that's all good for curial.

261
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.030
Now let's take your view.

262
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:20.020
Get Jane we're going to send the replace chain request.

263
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.030
And there you go.

264
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.710
You have your chain replaced by longus when everyone is up to date.

265
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.680
That's awesome.

266
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.510
And you get the last transaction in the third block.

267
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.180
All right.

268
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.670
Perfect third part of the test smashed as well.

269
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.710
Now we're going to move on to the last part of the test.

270
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.510
Well it's actually not even a new part because we're basically going to do the same but as I promised

271
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.210
you I'm going to send you one hundred thousand at coins.

272
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.810
So let me do this for you right now.

273
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.330
I'm going back to my notes.

274
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:54.970
I'm selecting the post request because we're going to post a new transaction from me to you of 100000

275
00:16:55.030 --> 00:17:01.010
at coins and therefore I'm getting back to my ADD transaction method.

276
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.210
And now we're going to go back to buddy.

277
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.060
We're going to.

278
00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.830
Well everything is ready here.

279
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:17.100
I'm still descender ADLER But now the receiver is you and I'm adding 1 0 for you to send you one hundred

280
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.030
thousand at coins.

281
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.790
So 100000 Afghans for you.

282
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.380
I sound like a shady seller here.

283
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.490
Sorry about that.

284
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.550
Just a quick reminder that the coin is worth absolutely nothing.

285
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.420
So post all good post request transaction.

286
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.510
Very raw.

287
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.600
Jason from Adlon to you.

288
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.300
One hundred thousand odd coins.

289
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:41.160
So if now you're ready to get all this let's press enter and there we go.

290
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.380
This transaction will be added of course to look for because the actual chain of our black chain now

291
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.860
contains three blocks.

292
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.350
So of course this transaction will be added to the next block that is block for.

293
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.490
And so now what do we have to do.

294
00:17:54.570 --> 00:18:00.270
Well we have to mine a new block to welcome this transaction into look for it.

295
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.270
And so that's exactly what I'm going to do because I'm still descender.

296
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.680
This transaction was sent from my node.

297
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:13.830
So we're going to go back to the get request we are going to go back to the mine block request and there

298
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.130
we go.

299
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:21.060
Now let's press enter to create this new block containing two transactions the one related to the fact

300
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.090
that I just mind this new plug and therefore giving me one at coin.

301
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:30.810
And of course the transaction from myself to you giving you one hundred thousand odd coins.

302
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.260
All right.

303
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:38.430
And now the final step to do is just to apply the consensus on these two notes here to make sure every

304
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.870
node in the block chain has the same chain.

305
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:51.000
So let's do this we can if you want first get our chain here that's our chain containing for blocks

306
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:57.660
with the two transactions of at coins from myself to curial of 10000 coins and from myself to you of

307
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.310
100000 coins.

308
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.950
So Ford looks perfect.

309
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:09.830
But now if we get your chain in well first and Carol's nose get chain Well Cuil only has three blocks.

310
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.770
So that's not good.

311
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.630
Let's fix that right away.

312
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.010
Replace Shane.

313
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.490
Let's press enter and there we go.

314
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.750
The notes had different chains of the chain was replaced by the longest one.

315
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.510
And now we free press enter again.

316
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.200
All good we have the actual chain in gules.

317
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.690
No.

318
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.180
All good.

319
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.490
The chain is the largest one.

320
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:34.800
And if you want we can just go to get Chen Quest again to check that curiousest Jane is the same as

321
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.470
mine.

322
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:36.270
Yes.

323
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.070
As you can see it's exactly the same.

324
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.560
I'm switching between my node and Caryl's.

325
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.070
No.

326
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.900
All good.

327
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.920
And now let's make sure you are also on the same page.

328
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.140
So here we go everything is ready here.

329
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:54.720
Let's check your actual chain in the black chain so get chain here.

330
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.440
There we go.

331
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.090
You have three blocks.

332
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.790
Not good.

333
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.100
So let's fix this right away.

334
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:08.600
Let's replace get in here by with place chain and now in two seconds we will all be aligned.

335
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.170
There we go.

336
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.820
The notes had different change so your chain was replaced by longus one you now have four blocks and

337
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.660
you have the two transactions of 10000 at coins and thousand at coins.

338
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.430
Perfect.

339
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:28.350
We can do a last check to get your chain and check that we all have the same chain of four blocks.

340
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.290
So pressing enter here.

341
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.810
There we go that's your chain.

342
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.410
Now let's switch very quickly to each of the node to check that we have the same chain.

343
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.090
Yes.

344
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.620
That seems to be the case.

345
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.370
You can even scroll down for each five thousand two and five thousand three.

346
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.050
Let's see my node Kiros node and your node.

347
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.620
Oh good.

348
00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.000
We all have the same chain.

349
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.820
Congratulations.
