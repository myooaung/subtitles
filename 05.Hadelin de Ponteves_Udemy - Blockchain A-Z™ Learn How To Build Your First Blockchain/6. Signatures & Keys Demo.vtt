00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.110
Hello and welcome back so of course on blotching And today we're going to have a demo of how private

2
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.450
keys public keys and signatures were.

3
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.010
The demo look is located on the British side.

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.330
So if you'd like to follow along.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.580
The euro is tools to criticize dot com slash block chain slash public hyphen private hyphen keys slash

6
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.230
keys.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.920
I know as long you're allowed to type.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.940
But if you go to the show the course notes you'll see that you're all there and you can just click on

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.510
it.

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.630
And before we get started a huge thank you to the person that created this is it was created by Anders

11
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.660
Braun worth.

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.830
As you can see the copyright notice is here and a huge thank you for allowing everybody to use it freely.

13
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.600
So if you'd like a copy of your own you can go to get a job and you can copy it to your website and

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
play around with it too.

15
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.890
All right.

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.300
And also a huge thank you to that team of developers and to criticize us for putting it up here.

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.170
OK so let's have a look in the first one is he and he has a couple of opinions here so we'll go through

18
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.090
a few of them.

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.750
It's the first one we've got an opportunity to see how they bring up the slides.

20
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.970
So we have an opportunity to see how this link works between the private and the public.

21
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.310
So there is our private key there's a public key.

22
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.920
So if we generate a random private key we will get public and as you can see it's always a fixed length.

23
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.350
It's always a hexadecimal level or as the product is just a normal number.

24
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.790
So you can actually type in your own private key.

25
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.670
So whatever lenth approach you type in you will get a fix X..

26
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.360
The interesting thing to note or probably the thing to keep in mind is that you don't want a short public

27
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.830
key like 12.

28
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.700
Because anybody can guess that that's why it's better to generate one randomly or when you are creating

29
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.980
a wall or just except the one that they give you all the.

30
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.420
I don't get much choice.

31
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.040
They just give you one and is generated randomly like that as you can see is a huge number.

32
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.520
So that's why it's considered unique to you.

33
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.770
So that's our private and public.

34
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.850
Now we're going to look at signatures.

35
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.180
So as you recall here what happens is we have the private key and the public would keep this to ourselves.

36
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.380
This is available to everybody.

37
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.930
Then we when we write a message or create a transaction we sign it with a private key but everybody

38
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.530
else can use the public key we have to verify that transaction.

39
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.170
So here we got a private key you can type in here and they get as you like.

40
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.500
And this is what we see in the science phase and this is what people see.

41
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.290
For now we're going to see the public now create a message.

42
00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:04.300
Let's say Adlon sends to zero zero zero point two BTC.

43
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:14.080
So then what happens is my mouse again it is what happens is now I need to click the sign button and

44
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080
this signature is generated from the message of the transaction that we've put in here.

45
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.910
And the private key.

46
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.880
And so whenever the message is going to go anywhere it's always going to have the signature attached

47
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.150
to it and the public key not the private.

48
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.370
So when we look here you can see that everybody else in the network of all the nos will get the message

49
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.290
or the transaction the public key and the signature as we discuss your message signature publicly the

50
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.020
ones that are highlighted in the yellow a little highlight there.

51
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.820
And so now they can use these three to verify if indeed this message what are the very fact they're.

52
00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:02.020
Very important they're verifying that this signature belongs to the holder of the private key behind

53
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.030
this publicly.

54
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.850
So that's what they say.

55
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.280
So if they could verify and goes green This could only happen in the case that indeed the signature

56
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:20.960
of this signature was created by the person who has the private key to this public key.

57
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.840
And obviously the signature is directly linked to this message so if anybody tries to change anything

58
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.280
and they verify it doesn't verify or if they try to say look this verifies it try to change or say they

59
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.670
have they don't know.

60
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.280
I know.

61
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.620
Like yeah.

62
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.690
So basically that's it.

63
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.120
Like if even if you change this I don't know why you would change this but like it doesn't verify as

64
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.110
well so or signature.

65
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.610
So if they don't have access to my private key and they try to forge a fake signature so they put it

66
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.130
in there for an all there's no use in a hexadecimal number.

67
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.250
So they put in a fake signature.

68
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.460
It's not going to verify.

69
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.000
So only if you have access to the private and you have the message when you have the private key you

70
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.170
sign it.

71
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.070
You can see there's a 3 0 4 4 0 2 2 3 0 4 4 0 2 2.

72
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.460
And that's our public key link to this private key.

73
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.930
Then you verify.

74
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.350
All right.

75
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.570
So that's that's that part.

76
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.860
What do we have next.

77
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.190
We've got a transaction.

78
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.710
OK.

79
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.030
So here we are just replacing the message with a transaction see it says Message share but it's actually

80
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.010
a transaction.

81
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.820
And so again you can put in any value and say I want to send somebody 200.

82
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.580
Well here is dollars.

83
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.860
So from this address to this address and it has a private key.

84
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.500
So now we have more kind of details in the message itself.

85
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.090
But the whole concept is.

86
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.700
So here's my priority.

87
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.100
Let's say we can put in our own pro like just test it out.

88
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.850
You verify there's that message signature.

89
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.990
Now let's see what the public key for this would be.

90
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.650
Just to like is in the verify we already have a signature here.

91
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.740
Well yeah we don't have a public scene.

92
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.800
But in reality what should be or should be also shown here is the public key because you cannot verify

93
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.120
something for the public.

94
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.650
So if you go to keys and we put in our key here you can see is already put in for us.

95
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.980
And so the public key is generated.

96
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.770
So the public would be this one as a people actually also see the public key because they need the private

97
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.220
key the public key and the message the contents of the transaction to unlock the private key.

98
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.410
What am I saying.

99
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:46.420
They need to sign this again so people need the message the signature and the public key as we discussed

100
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.780
here message signature public key in order to verify.

101
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:56.300
And so as you can see it verifies and again if you try to tamper with anything it won't verify.

102
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:03.280
I wanted to point out here for full disclosure right now I think this one works if I try to tamper with

103
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.950
this one it works.

104
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.230
But if I try to change this one it still verifies and that's that's our bad.

105
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.110
We'll fix that.

106
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.280
It's part of the code.

107
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.080
We'll fix that code.

108
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.590
So it actually shouldn't verify.

109
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.010
So hopefully when you're checking this out it will it will go red if you try to tamper with it.

110
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.970
And also the signature works if I try to change the signature.

111
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.550
So you try to change anything in here.

112
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.720
And in addition remember you should also see the public here try to change anything.

113
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.360
It will not verify.

114
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.460
OK so that's those there's also this block chain one if you'd like to have a look around in your own

115
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.390
time and see how it works.

116
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.300
BLOCK Jane.

117
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.110
You're welcome to do so.

118
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.990
OK.

119
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.760
So I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial.

120
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.300
That's how private public keys and signatures work.

121
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.470
And I'll see you back here on the next one.

122
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.750
Until then enjoy.

123
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.380
BLOCK chains.
