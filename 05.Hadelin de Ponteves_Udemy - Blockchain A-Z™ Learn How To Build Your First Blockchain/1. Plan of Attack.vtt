00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.820
Hello to welcome back to the course on blog chain.

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.310
And today we got the plan of attack for Winchell to who's going to be massive.

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:19.420
So the plan of attack will really help us understand how are we going to get through all of these tutorials

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.990
that statute into it.

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.790
All right.

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.610
In this module we will learn about one What is Bitcoin and this tutorial is important because we're

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.950
not just talking about Bitcoin.

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.440
We'll get a bird's eye view of this whole crypto space in general.

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.040
We'll see the three different layers of technology there.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.070
The protocol there the token lair.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.910
On the stand.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.920
What's different particles exist.

13
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.880
Why Bitcoin is the protocol.

14
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.080
And well the difference between coins and tokens and things like that.

15
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.730
So a lot of foundational things that will put the right.

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.930
Give us the right start for the rest of not just the section but for the rest of the whole course.

17
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.940
Next we'll talk about bitcoins monetary policy just like with central banks of governments which have

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.430
more trade policies because it has its own monetary policy which is different in the way that it is

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850
governed entirely by the software.

20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.130
There's going to be an interesting tutorial there will talk about mining difficulties and will solidify

21
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.300
the things that we learned in Module 1 and take them to the next level and really see how Bitcoin through

22
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.130
software.

23
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.740
So these two tutorials the links help with how the software actually is created in the way that it facilitates

24
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.150
that monetary policy.

25
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.770
So very interesting it's going to be difficult to tutorial.

26
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.040
I'll warn you in advance.

27
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.570
But it's an important tutorial to really put all those things we talked about.

28
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.470
Module 1 and we started talking about module 2 together to understand how it all links up.

29
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.250
Then we'll talk about a virtual tour of biquad minds we'll kind of take a break and just have a look

30
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.530
at what it what minds look like so big industrial level Bitcoin was what they look like from inside

31
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.680
the I think is going to be interesting to see how what it's all about.

32
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.570
So not just like sit in the computer but see it in real life for what it is.

33
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.320
What is it.

34
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.640
What is it physically.

35
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.100
There was money pools.

36
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.470
How miners get together to form mining pools and then we'll have an interesting tutorial on the knowns

37
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.460
range.

38
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.820
So we've already spoken about the lawns and in this tutorial some additional information will be uncovered

39
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.090
about the nodes and we'll see on one hand some interesting things on the other hand will be some challenges

40
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.030
that this will pose and how are we going to answer them how we're going to tackle those.

41
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.650
How does a software tackle those.

42
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.910
So we'll get into even more technical detail about how bitcoins and watchings work I think is also very

43
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.470
important to be aware of these things understand that because a lot of the time people overlook them

44
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:03.450
and then they run into problems or they just don't like they're not up to date with why certain things

45
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.060
are happening in the technology.

46
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.150
They will talk about how miners make transactions so transactions are a very important component of

47
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.350
the block chain are reasonable or change because that's what it's all about.

48
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.570
To be able to transact shows.

49
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.610
So we'll see what how transactions are added.

50
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.950
The portion of it will be a two parter on the second part will actually have a look at some examples

51
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.990
of stats and actual long lived love change transactions on line then we'll talk about hardware for Bitcoin

52
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.740
mining and not just because money Ganey cryptocurrency mining Seabees use and A-6 and some interesting

53
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.980
things.

54
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.380
So if you're for example if you haven't heard of ACX before this will be a very good tutorial to get

55
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.020
into that to understand what this space are all about and what's the difference between guz and sex

56
00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.690
and how it all plays out in different cryptograms or your real cover of Theoria Bitcoin and see a few

57
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.420
others along the way too.

58
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.120
Are also Goldmember tools and how they work as a staging area for transactions before transactions get

59
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.990
into the book chain.

60
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.020
Where do they reside and how does that how does information propagate around the network from ampoules.

61
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.180
Then we talked about orphan blocks what happens when there's two competing Shanes Remember we mentioned

62
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.290
orphan blocks and Munjal one will here will understand what happens to them in the sense of the transactions

63
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.860
in them and how we will see some examples of orphan blocks of line.

64
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.440
And then you'll talk about the 51 percent attack will completely demystify this concept.

65
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.010
Because a lot of people don't have the right idea what the future 1 percent attack is so we'll discuss

66
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.160
what it is not and what he is and you will be absolutely clear from now on whenever you hear people

67
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.720
talking about the dreaded and mysterious if you want business you'll know exactly what they're talking

68
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.250
about and why it's dangerous.

69
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.200
And finally at the end we'll have an exit Troil.

70
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.630
How to convert bids to target is more of a mathematical tutorial or a good to know you don't have to

71
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.520
go through that one.

72
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.290
That's just some stuff especially if you're a developer in the space of chain then you will probably

73
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.510
benefit from that tutorial.

74
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.240
Otherwise you can feel free to skip it or just use it for general knowledge.

75
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.590
And then we go that's our plan we've got 12 tutorials plus one extra one in this Munjal.

76
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.320
It's a massive module but it's going to be lots of fun and afterwards you will walk away so much more

77
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.060
well-versed in a block Shanes and because you will truly take your skills together.

78
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.910
We will take your block change skills and cryptocurrency skills to a whole new level.

79
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.420
Superoxide about this let's get started.
