1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,320
Highs and welcome to the demo of module 3 create a smart contract in this demo we're going to be an

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,010
investor who wants to buy some coins to do so.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,640
We're going to set up a Mithraeum wallet on my wallet the website that I showed you in the first story

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,010
of this module and also on this get her page where we got our my Isa wallet folder.

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,810
So we're going to set up this will that we also have opened to interact with the block chain because

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,630
you know each time we sign the transaction Well the transaction will be added to a block and we will

7
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,520
see that happening in real time in cash.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,180
So we'll do all this.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,130
And so now the first step that we're going to do is open again.

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:54,040
And therefore I prepared everything here and especially I prepared my list of programs to find cash.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,170
So open first is opening right now.

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,270
And here we go.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,450
Welcome to get us some green too and watch this so that we can all see very well.

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,470
And there we go.

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,490
So we're going to do in cash is pretty simple.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,260
We'll choose one of these addresses you know each row here corresponds to an address to which you can

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:23,040
connect and you have a virtual balance of 100 ether and you'll see that each time we sign a transaction

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,300
or a block we'll spend very little amount of ether.

19
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,010
This is all virtual Of course.

20
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,180
Right now we are on current like zero meaning that we have in mind any block.

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,960
But first important information that we must see is this one the address of the server where she is

22
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,610
found.

23
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,260
So you recognize the local host here.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,980
One hundred twenty seven point zero point zero upon one exactly like the one we used in Postman.

25
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,690
But then we have a different port.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,500
It's no longer five thousand five thousand one.

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,320
We're going to use the port seven thousand five hundred forty five.

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,890
OK so remember this because we will enter it in my wallet and then I can just walk you through the important

29
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,230
stuff like here we have all the plugs you'll see.

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,590
So far we have the Genesis block but then each time we sign a transaction the transaction will be added

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,080
to a new block and we'll see the new blocks appear here and then we have the transactions here we'll

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,940
be able to have all the details of the transactions we sign right here in this page.

33
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,840
And also you have the lugs but we won't be needing this waiting for requests.

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,900
Yes the requests are coming.

35
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,530
All right.

36
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,530
So let's go back to our clowns.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,790
Let's use an account.

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,540
We're going to choose.

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,270
Well anyone you want.

40
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,970
I'm going to choose the first one.

41
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,400
That is the account of index zero.

42
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,090
All right.

43
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,380
So that's your first step and ganache and now we're going to move on to my wallet and go to my wallet.

44
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:57,250
Well we can either you know go back to Google because in the first Soyo this module Well we opened my

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,310
wallet from our local computer using you know remember if you go to your chain it is that folder and

46
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,440
then Mudgal 3 create a smart contract.

47
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:17,520
Well remember we went inside this folder and we double clicked on this index HVM L and that redirected

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,150
us to my word.

49
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,350
So you can do that again.

50
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:29,040
If you closed this page and there we are in my wallet remember we had all the warnings that were useful

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,860
to check out.

52
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,520
And now we're ready to start.

53
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,900
And so the first step is right in the center of this page.

54
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,610
We're going to create a new wallet a new eatery and wallet and to do this well we're going to create

55
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,280
a brand new one and to create a brand new one you go to this dropdown this year and you're going to

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,510
add a custom network node at the bottom of this dropdown.

57
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,410
So just click on this add custom network node.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,610
Let's do this.

59
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
And here we go.

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,650
So set up your custom notes.

61
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,900
Basically we're just setting up a virtual custom node.

62
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,590
And as you can already guess here we are going to enter the U R L at the local host which is this 127

63
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:18,390
point 0.0 upon one and here of course we're going to enter the port of Ganesh which remember is seven

64
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,130
thousand five hundred forty five.

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,010
OK.

66
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,740
So let's do this first.

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,670
We're going to enter a node name.

68
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,290
So what can we call this.

69
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,550
Well whatever you want you can call this by your name you can call it by at coin ICAO wherever you want.

70
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,640
Well in fact that's a pretty good idea.

71
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,200
Let's call this ad Quoin.

72
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,330
I see you.

73
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,210
All right.

74
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,830
CONAN So then the u r l is.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,330
So we can if you won't go back to gannets then copy this without the port because the port is entered

76
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,200
separately.

77
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,850
So let's go back to my wallet and let's face that right here and there you are.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,350
All right.

79
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,950
That's right you are well and now the port.

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,290
We can go back to Ghana to make sure we have the right one.

81
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,020
Seven thousand five hundred and forty five.

82
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,600
Let's go back to my wallet and let's face the port here.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:12,980
All right.

84
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,090
And then you don't need to see like this an ether of course.

85
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,410
That's the theory that if you read classic we're going to use ECM.

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,690
That's one of the best blocking technologies.

87
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:30,660
Let's go for it and let's save and use our network note plug chain note.

88
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,970
All right you are successfully connected.

89
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,350
Great start so far.

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,440
OK so we are getting close to the ICU now.

91
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,790
We are going to go here to contract up contracts.

92
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,030
Let's click on this.

93
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,090
And there we go.

94
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,670
We have the choice between interacting with our contracts or deploy our contract.

95
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,790
So according to you what do we need to start with.

96
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:59,480
Well of course we need to deploy the contract first because so far we have just simply implemented the

97
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,850
contract insipidity.

98
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,080
But we haven't deployed anything yet.

99
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,960
So we're going to deploy it now and to do this well we need to enter the byte code here which we will

100
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,320
get in solidity and then you'll see this the gas limit the gas by the way is a unit of some money you

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,980
spend.

102
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,830
You'll see when we sign a transaction or complete some actions like buying some coins basically an action

103
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,540
that is in the small contract.

104
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,790
So this will automatically be populated and then we'll select a private key.

105
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:34,040
But first let's start with the byte code and to get the bite code well we need to go back to our program

106
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,100
remix solidity.

107
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:42,160
That's our program and to get the bytecode of this program we need to go here to details.

108
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,750
All right.

109
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,740
And here we have all the details of our solidity implementation.

110
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,610
And as you can see the bytecode is right here.

111
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,910
So that's about code basically But we can copy it.

112
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,260
The efficient way by clicking on this is the copy value to clipboard.

113
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,800
So just click on this copy.

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,670
Perfect.

115
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:08,090
And now let's go back to my wallet and let's paste the bytecode right here.

116
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:17,200
But in this bytecode we're only going to include the number inside the object you know from here excluding

117
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,060
the double quote down to the very end of this very large string which is the byte code.

118
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,030
So here and pressing shift and I'm clicking to select all this and that's exactly what we want so I

119
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,860
can just copy it then select everything and then delete everything and then pasting it again.

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,820
So that's exactly what you want.

121
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,700
That's the bytecode we need here and there you go you have to guess limit automatically populated.

122
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,200
Okay perfect.

123
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,320
Next up how would you like to access your wallet.

124
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,450
Well of course it's going to be with a private key.

125
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,450
By the way you can see you can use adjacent fell to access your wallet.

126
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,350
So if you're interested in doing that you will have no problem understanding how it works.

127
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,750
Since you now know what a file looks like but here we're going to use a private key and there we go.

128
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,980
That's where we enter the private key.

129
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,110
And now of course the question is Where are we going to get our private key.

130
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,180
Well according to you where is it going to be exactly is it going to be in my wallet.

131
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,440
Is it going to be in solidity or is it going to be.

132
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,760
Well I'm going to tell you now it's going to be in gas.

133
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,370
That's where we're going to get our key and that's where we have to choose one of these addresses.

134
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,190
So as I told you I'm choosing this address.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,650
But feel free to choose any other one and to get the key.

136
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,420
Well I think it's pretty obvious now.

137
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,880
The key is right here on the key so click on Shoki is here and there we go.

138
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,470
Welcome to our private key.

139
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,820
That's our private key.

140
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,570
So let's keep this let's get a copy done.

141
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,490
And now let's go back to my wallet to paste the private key.

142
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,320
All right.

143
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:06,260
Now next step is just to click on unlock because we now have everything we have to bytecode we have

144
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,580
the private key.

145
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:15,290
So we're ready to unlock the wallet that is now successfully decrypted and not only we were ready to

146
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,020
unlock this but now we are ready to sign the transaction.

147
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,190
Congratulations guys you're about to sign your very first transaction through my contract.

148
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,480
Let's do this let's click on some transaction and there we go.

149
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,660
Now we are ready to deploy the contract.

150
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,630
However depending on the version of Guinness you're using you might have a little issue here.

151
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,410
If we go to Ghana.

152
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:37,940
There we go.

153
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,450
That's the issue I'm talking about cash encountered in there.

154
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,260
Help us fixing it by raising good habitue.

155
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,370
So no worries about this.

156
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,290
The trick to solve this is just to relaunch Nashe.

157
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:57,410
So just click on this relaunch button and Ghana will be relaunching and expanding it again.

158
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,390
OK.

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,210
And right now the only thing that you have to do is go back to my wallet and since actually the transaction

160
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,700
is already signed as we can see here with the bytecode.

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,330
Well we are ready to deploy the contract and once we do this you will see the transaction will appear

162
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,510
on the finish.

163
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,460
All right let's do this let's deploy the contract warning you we're about to deploy a contract well

164
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,250
they will have warnings but they're right.

165
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,190
But yes we are sure we want to make the transaction happen.

166
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,270
And there we go your transaction has been broadcast to the network.

167
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:40,570
And now if we go back to Ken Nash Well what do we see what are the two things interesting to see here.

168
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,620
Well first the tax count here was incremental to 1.

169
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,260
That's our transaction.

170
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,820
And second we spent 2 cents of ether to make this transaction happen.

171
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,950
That is to sign this transaction and to deploy the contract.

172
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,430
So that was quite cheap when either at the time I'm speaking is around $1000 I think and therefore 2

173
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,590
cents of ether is like $20.

174
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,500
Okay.

175
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,630
So that's the price for deploying a contract that's very cheap because indeed it's much cheaper than

176
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,080
the classic contracted you and a classic deal and saving all these costs is one of the pillars of this

177
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,140
theory and Blache and revolution.

178
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
And now by the way there is another interesting thing to see.

179
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,110
It's the current block that you can see was incremented to one.

180
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,210
And so now what we can check out is delux here.

181
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,690
We see our new blocks.

182
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,890
That was just the block number zero which we already had.

183
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,850
And now we have the black one which contains our recent transaction that we signed right before deploying

184
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,620
the contract.

185
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,190
And if we click on this block Well we have some more details.

186
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,260
We have to get used to guest limit.

187
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,450
We have the time stamp when it was mine so exactly like what we implemented on bison and Mudgal 1 and

188
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,100
2.

189
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,040
We have to plug hash also.

190
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,170
And if we click on this well we have even more data on the transaction.

191
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:09,480
We have the sender address to created contract address which we'll use very soon you'll see and we see

192
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,560
that this transaction was integrated in block number one that was mind to receive this transaction.

193
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,740
And that's the bytecode of the transaction.

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,060
As you can see here transaction data this can also be accessed by clicking on transactions that search

195
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,420
and the action that we just signed.

196
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,970
And again if we click on this we obtain the same data.

197
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,900
All right.

198
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,410
Perfect.

199
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,350
So pretty user friendly.

200
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,610
And so now what we're going to do is since our contract you know you know we have to realize that now

201
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,380
our smart contract is integrated to the block chain.

202
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,010
Well it is time to interact with it.

203
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:55,360
You know we deployed it and remember in my wallet we also have the option to interact with the contract.

204
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,130
But we can only do that of course after deployment and now we can do this.

205
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,090
And it's actually right now that the fun starts.

206
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,970
So speaking of the contract address which I just mentioned you know in cash.

207
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,500
This one right here created a contract address.

208
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:18,310
Well that's the first thing we were asked to put in my wallet when we want to interact with the contract.

209
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,470
So in Ghana let's just copy this address here.

210
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,420
The created contract address.

211
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,170
Copy this contract address.

212
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,780
And now let's go back to my wallet and paste it right here.

213
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,470
All right good.

214
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,840
We have the contract address and now we need to enter the FBI or Jason interface.

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,530
So where are we going to get this.

216
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,820
Well this time it's not going to be in cash.

217
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:50,150
It can be of course in solidity remakes because if you remember just below the byte codes we got to

218
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,390
deploy the contract now to interact with the contract.

219
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,570
We need the API which we can also copy by just clicking on this button.

220
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,530
So that's what I just did.

221
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:07,610
Now let's go back to my wallet and let's paste the API right here and now we have nothing to select

222
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,480
specifically in this API.

223
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,320
We're ready to click on access.

224
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,880
But before we do this let me tell you a few words about this.

225
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,810
AB What is it exactly.

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,540
Well that's just basically the code that will explain to my wallet which actions can be run and how

227
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,250
we can run them.

228
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,920
So by actions I mean you know to buy some at coins to sell some coins to have a look at the equity in

229
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,590
dollars or at coins all this is coded in this FBI.

230
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,230
And basically thanks to it we'll be able to run these actions.

231
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,490
OK.

232
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,790
So no need to go through this and for the details.

233
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,010
Now we're going to access this.

234
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,560
So I just clicked on it.

235
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,440
And now breaking news.

236
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,140
We are ready to buy some odd coins.

237
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,830
As you can see I have to select a function dropdown.

238
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,050
And what do we see.

239
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,540
We see all our functions.

240
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,930
Not only our functions but also the variables you know that can be updated like the equity in USD or

241
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,230
this one which gives us the equity in at coins and we have these other actions that just run some actions

242
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,400
like buying some ad coins or selling some coins.

243
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,380
All right so now we can just play.

244
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,630
Do whatever you want.

245
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,670
Let's start maybe by making sure that the maximum number of coins is 1 million.

246
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:31,310
You know we are the very first investor to buy the coins but let's check that out.

247
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,020
I'm selecting this next at coin.

248
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,030
And there we go we have indeed the one million ad coins available for us.

249
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,250
So that's awesome.

250
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,270
And now since we know they're here let's buy some odd coins.

251
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,170
So I'm going to select the buy at coin's function.

252
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:55,550
Well action now let's input remember the two arguments of our function.

253
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,700
Let's have a look again of our function so just closing the details here.

254
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,770
Remember the buy at Queen's function had two arguments.

255
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,430
First the address of the investor and second the amount of money you want to spend to buy whatever amount

256
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,830
of coins we want.

257
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,840
So that's the first two arguments and that's exactly what we have to import here.

258
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,400
So let's start with investor dress how to get this address.

259
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,320
Well of course to get it we need to go back to get Nash.

260
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,310
And here is the address sender address That's our address.

261
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,870
Let's copy this.

262
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:37,480
Or by the way this address is also the same in the accounts we chose which is this one.

263
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,960
You know this row of index 0.

264
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,390
Well here indeed you can find the exact same address.

265
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,820
All right so again it's the same any way.

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,550
And now let's go back to my wallet.

267
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,650
Let's put our address here the investor address.

268
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,750
And now let's choose which amount of coins you want to buy.

269
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,870
Well I want to buy.

270
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,030
Let's say let's see ten dollars of at coins.

271
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,200
That's not much.

272
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:16,000
But that will give me ten thousand at coins because remember the rate USD coin is 1000 and therefore

273
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,530
$10 of that coin is worth ten thousand at coins.

274
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,590
So that's pretty cool.

275
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,980
Let's get these coins now and to get them we need to click on right here.

276
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,260
Warning again.

277
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:29,720
There we go.

278
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,180
They really love warnings.

279
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,110
Yes limit.

280
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,010
We're all good that's way below the maximum limit.

281
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,530
And now let's generate the transaction by just clicking on general transaction.

282
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,240
All right.

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,560
The transaction is signed.

284
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,550
And to really make this happen well we need to click on.

285
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,470
Yes I am sure.

286
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,900
Make transaction.

287
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,900
And there we go.

288
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,660
The transaction has been broadcasting the network.

289
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,230
Let's check this out on cash.

290
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:02,690
And here it is transaction count was again incremented by one and we can see either in the blocks it

291
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,980
was integrated to block to a new transaction here one transaction we can click on the block if you want.

292
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,010
And here is the transaction we can click on this again to have even more details.

293
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,840
Here we go.

294
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,320
That's our dressed investor dress.

295
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,770
That's the contract address which we entered before and there we go that's the transaction data.

296
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,020
And if we go back to accounts well the balance hasn't changed.

297
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,920
Okay.

298
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,380
And again you can use this shortcut by clicking directly on transactions to see the transaction.

299
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,370
That's this one.

300
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,990
The ones on the top are the most recent ones.

301
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,020
All right.

302
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,870
So there we go.

303
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:45,220
That's our first transaction now let's go back to my wallet and let's see what our equity has become

304
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,680
and to check that out.

305
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:54,640
We need to click on the job done that here and well first let's check out the equity in USD.

306
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,000
All right.

307
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,340
So again we need to put the investor address because indeed in our equity in us the function well there

308
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,640
is one argument which is exactly this investor dress.

309
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,750
So let's get it back in cash.

310
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,330
That's exactly this one.

311
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:20,130
Let's copy this and now let's go back to my wallet here it is let's put the investor address and let's

312
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:28,470
read to check out how much does we have in the platform while this interface where we invest the money

313
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,010
to buy some at coins.

314
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:37,890
And indeed since we just invested $10 to buy 10000 at coins well here that's our equity in dollars.

315
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:47,550
We have $10 invested but now this check out that the equity in at coin's is indeed 10000 at Goines because

316
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,670
$10 is 10000 at coins.

317
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,100
So here I am inputting again our address the address of the investor.

318
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,600
And when we click on read well indeed we have 10000 Atco it's perfect.

319
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,960
Our actions or functions seem to be working very well.

320
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,760
Now let's check out the other tools.

321
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:15,000
So just for fun let's just check out the tool at coin's but and indeed since I'm the only investor playing

322
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,350
with this I see so well of course only 10000 cons were but.

323
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,940
And that's the exact same coins I just bought.

324
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,250
So that's all good.

325
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,630
And now let's just for fun buy some more coins.

326
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:33,360
Let's imagine that coins is becoming hype and therefore now instead of investing $10 we want to invest

327
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,300
$100.

328
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,600
Let's see what happens.

329
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,440
So you click on right and warning again generate transaction.

330
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,340
Yes I'm sure make transaction transaction broadcast we can check very quickly in accounts.

331
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,930
Yes incremental is three.

332
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,830
And we have three blocks.

333
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,630
All good.

334
00:20:52,860 --> 00:21:03,420
And when we go back to here now let's check our equity in let's say at coin's read and there we go we

335
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,440
have one hundred and ten thousand at coin's congratulations.

336
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,760
We are now starting to have a lot of Atuona.

337
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:19,760
And we can check also our equity in dollars read $110 and now just for fun that say that you know the

338
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,980
coins actually turn out to not be that good or just you know we want to get some money back.

339
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,500
Well let's try to sell some coins.

340
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,990
That's the action we haven't tried yet.

341
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:36,270
So sell at coins now we need to input the investor address again.

342
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,650
So there was already copied.

343
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,230
And now let's see what number of at Cone's you want to sell back.

344
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,170
So let's see.

345
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:51,610
Remember we have one hundred and ten thousand at coin's let's say we want to sell 50 thousand at coin's

346
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,640
right 50000.

347
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,080
Let's see what happens.

348
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,030
I'm clicking on right now.

349
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,220
Let's generate the transaction.

350
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:06,440
Yes we are sure make transaction and there we go the transaction has been broadcasting network.

351
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,320
All good.

352
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,540
We can check that again.

353
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:15,040
Well here it is in black for just mind and can actually check the balance.

354
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,190
All good for transactions now.

355
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,640
Congratulations.

356
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,570
And now let's check out the equity and at coin's to see if it was well updated.

357
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:32,770
So let's click on equity at coin's Let's read this.

358
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:42,570
And there we go 110000 minus the 50000 at constat which is sold is indeed equal to sixty thousand at

359
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,240
Cone's.

360
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,970
Perfect.

361
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,960
Everything seems to be working very well.

362
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:54,150
Let's just finish by getting the equity in USD which should be equal to 60000 divided by 1000.

363
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:58,140
That is $60 and indeed $60.

364
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,580
So guys congratulations.

365
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,570
We made this happen.

366
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,650
We have a successful smart contract so there we go.

367
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,640
I think that's the end of the journey.

368
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,390
I was so happy to say this course.

369
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,730
I had a lot of fun.

370
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,120
I hope you liked it too.

371
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,460
So I guess I'll see you for our next course as we have a very exciting year ahead of us in 2018 and

372
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,800
we're truly excited to provide some great content about these new techs.

373
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,390
You know a black chain.

374
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,210
We even want to combine the two.

375
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,190
We'll do this for you.

376
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:31,040
Thank you so much again for your support and I'll see you very soon in some new course.

377
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,700
Until then and Joe bludgeons.
