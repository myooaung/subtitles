[Autogenerated] Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,980
My name is Andrew Estes and welcome to my course Gaining

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,050
operational excellence within a W s.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,890
I am an enterprise cloud architect at CSG International as well

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,590
as founder of Quick to Cloud Operational Excellence is one of the

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,440
five critical pillars that make up the well architected framework

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,640
provided to us by A W s.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,030
And in this course,

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,040
we're going to learn how we can best implement A W s services to gain

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
the most efficient operation for our architectures.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,650
Some of the major topics that we're going to cover include

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,870
advanced CloudWatch logging scenarios were going to configure

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,390
and protect CloudTrail trails.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,440
We're gonna work with leveraging systems manager and parameter store,

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,390
and then we're gonna create repeatable deployments

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,440
using CloudFormation and ops works.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,070
By the end of this course,

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,550
you're going to understand how you can utilize A W s offered

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,640
services to optimize your own workloads and handle your

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,420
operational tasks before beginning this course,

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,120
you should be familiar with a few concepts,

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,280
and those include core A W s concepts.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,860
So some of the core services you need to be comfortable with SSH and then it

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,480
might help to have an operational background or at least an understanding of

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,470
how infrastructure in operational backgrounds work.

26
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,880
After the course,

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,990
you should feel comfortable diving into gaining operational

28
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,540
excellence with courses on CloudFormation deep dives,

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,250
other courses that are a part of this solutions architect,

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,930
professional learning path.

31
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,170
And I have another course called Managing A W s Operations that is

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,530
essentially a deep dive into systems manager.

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,570
So I really hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to

34
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:15,000
optimize our workloads with the gaining operational excellence within a W S course here at Pluralsight.
