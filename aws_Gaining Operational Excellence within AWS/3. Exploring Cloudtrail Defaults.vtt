00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.810
[Autogenerated] alright for our first go.

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.100
Let's just take a look at the default settings in CloudTrail.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.740
So I'm gonna go to CloudTrail here in my console,

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.000
and it brings us to our dashboard screen.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.940
Now what we see here under recent events is the default trail

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.740
that's recording events within CloudTrail.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.540
So if we wanted to we can expand to view all events and

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.580
CloudTrail allows us to view the last 90 days of events within

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.200
our account using the default trail, if you read their instructions,

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.630
you'll see that Hey,

11
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.030
if you want to view a complete log of your CloudTrail events,

12
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.840
create your own trail and then configure it to dump to S3 or CloudWatch.

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740
Now we're going to do that here in upcoming clips.

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.700
But I wanted to point that out.

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.860
This builds on the idea that the default trail provided is

16
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.510
limited as far as customize ations Go Now.

17
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.180
This is an example of a trail here, and it's just put into a table form we can.

18
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.420
See,

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.210
we have filters here at the top we can look for read

20
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.340
only we can Look for event names.

21
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.490
We can do pretty much anything specific to CloudTrail events Now.

22
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.240
I'll just leave it at Reed only for this demo.

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.310
But if you wanted to,

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.810
we could enter a value here and filter on that within this

25
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.640
dashboard here at the bottom of the screen.

26
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.230
So if I wanted to filter for events that were true as re only I

27
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.170
could do true and that's going to filter for me.

28
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840
And there we go right there.

29
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.740
So let me clear this.

30
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.960
And then the next thing we see is our time range.

31
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.940
So this is where we can go back 90 days in view our CloudTrail events.

32
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.340
So you'll see it ends on November 21st,

33
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.980
because that's technically 90 days from today.

34
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.220
So if I wanted to I can view all 90 days, I'll leave this, as is for now.

35
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.350
And we noticed this just shows the most recent events.

36
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.040
Let me refresh this.

37
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.140
I'll scroll down and you can see it has the event time,

38
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.740
the username or the role name that's performing this and then the event name.

39
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.100
Now they also have a resource type and resource name,

40
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.540
and you can see that right there.

41
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.140
There's some examples,

42
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.580
but these particular fields are specific to certain events.

43
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.340
As you can see here, like assume role.

44
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.850
Now, let's just go ahead and actually open up one of these events.

45
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.640
Let me select this one.

46
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.240
And this is what's considered a CloudTrail event.

47
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.370
We C r A.

48
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.840
W s access key that made the call the region that it's in.

49
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.240
If we had an error code, we would see it.

50
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.380
So if someone was trying to access some resource that

51
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.240
they didn't have permissions for, we might see an error code.

52
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.860
Here we have our event, IDE of that particular event, our event name.

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.340
So list buckets the source, which is S3.

54
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.940
We have the time.

55
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.740
Whether or not it's a read only event,

56
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.530
there's a request I'd be There's a source i p address and then

57
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.640
finally the username that perform the action.

58
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.840
So let's click on view event and you can see it shows as JSON.

59
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.120
Now,

60
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.910
this is important because if you export these events in

61
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.060
our log files like we're going to do,

62
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.260
you can parse this JSON for values that you're trying to find or

63
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.140
perform any other action that you want on JSON files.

64
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.440
There's a lot of data in this entire event.

65
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.640
Let me go ahead and close out of this and what we're going to do is we're

66
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.080
going to go ahead and wrap up here now that we have a good overview of the

67
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.540
default trail offered to us by CloudTrail.

68
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.840
And then in the next upcoming clips,

69
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.000
we're going to actually configure our very own custom trail to use within our accounts.
