00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,560
[Autogenerated] first things first, let's go ahead and give a review on what a.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,240
W s.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,920
CloudTrail is now.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,410
CloudTrail is an a W s service offered to us that allows us to enable

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,760
governance compliance and operational and risk auditing of R A.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,440
W s accounts.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:28,130
And it does this by recording events performed by users roles in A W S services.

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,700
Now,

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,640
these events that are being recorded include any

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,540
actionable event from the console, the CLI and any sdk or API call.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,990
So essentially any interaction with our AWS account is

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,640
going to be recorded in CloudTrail.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,740
And the beauty of this is it's enabled in our accounts by default.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,330
So you do not have to do anything to have CloudTrail be

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,540
working immediately upon account creation.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,810
Now we'll talk about customizing CloudTrail and creating our

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,240
own trails outside of the default one.

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,090
But it's important to know that it's enabled by default with

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,190
really no customization around it and to tie back to earlier

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,820
clips in the first module.

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,280
When we de mode are CloudWatch event often invent based trigger.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,880
This is the service that it was using behind the scenes to trigger our rule.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,140
That's a CloudTrail event.

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,450
And then, lastly, it allows us to gain visibility,

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,670
to view, search, download, archive,

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,890
analyze and respond to many different monitored activities that

27
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,840
error happening within all of our accounts.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,490
So it allows us to drill down and see exactly who's

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,960
doing what at what particular time.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,540
It's essentially an audit trail,

31
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,600
and that's very critical for you to know for any of the solution.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,440
Architect exams.

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,440
Any time they mentioned auditing, it almost always is relating to CloudTrail.

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,700
So just keep that in mind now.

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,660
One last tidbit here is trails are regional,

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,640
but they can be created in all regions at the same time.

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,740
And I'll show you what this means here later on in the upcoming clips.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,600
Now let's talk about CloudTrail configuration.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,540
Now CloudTrail is made up of three primary configuration options.

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,170
Now the first one is management events.

41
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,340
So any particular event that happens in our account

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,700
relating to management and these error,

43
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,540
anything relating to dealing with resource is or managing resource is in a W s,

44
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,720
and then we have our data events.

45
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,900
So these error specific to data handling within our

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,980
accounts so you can think S3, for example.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,540
But not the buckets themselves, but rather the objects in the buckets.

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,660
And then, finally,

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,610
we have the ability to store our log files in S3 for a long

50
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,030
period of time and then encrypt those files to protect the

51
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,440
sensitive data that those log files contain.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,240
Now we'll cover all of these in the next upcoming clips,

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,730
but I wanted to get them out in front of you so you can be familiar

54
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,840
with them when we start seeing them in the console.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,300
Now, before we wrap up,

56
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,220
I just want to cover our demo overview that we're

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,840
going to see in the upcoming clips.

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,200
Now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to view

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,220
our default trail and event this Torri within our CloudTrail

60
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,240
service for our AWS account.

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,020
And then after that,

62
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,740
we're going to go ahead and create our very own trail with

63
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,840
customize settings specific to what we need.

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,890
So let's go ahead.

65
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:57,000
We'll wrap up here and in the next upcoming clips will start demo ing and getting hands on experience with CloudTrail
