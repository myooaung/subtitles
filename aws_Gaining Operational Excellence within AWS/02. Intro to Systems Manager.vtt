00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.940
[Autogenerated] Now, what is A W s systems manager,

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.930
A W s systems manager is a service that allows us to view and then control

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.800
our infrastructure within a W s in an automated fashion.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.140
Now, A W s breaks system manager up into different capabilities.

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.540
So let's talk about those really quickly.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.540
The first is operations management,

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.010
and this is essentially a suite of capabilities that help us manage.

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.390
R A.

9
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.240
W s resource is so there's different dashboards and centers that we can

10
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.940
navigate to in order to automate operational tasks.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.730
The second is application management and application

12
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.950
Management is a group of capabilities that helps us manage

13
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.440
our applications running in a W s.

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.220
Now, this is more specific to the application itself,

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.140
as opposed to the resource which would reside in operations management.

16
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.910
This is allowing us to run commands and config.

17
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.140
Our application on our resource is themselves.

18
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.050
The next is actions and change in actions and change

19
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.740
offer exactly what they sound like.

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.540
They let us take actions against a resource or change a resource.

21
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.830
So this is where a lot of the automation comes in and we'll look at

22
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.240
some of the documents that make up this capability.

23
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.560
The next is instances and nodes.

24
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.790
Now,

25
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.280
instances and nodes basically allows us to manage Our A W S E c

26
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.890
two instances are on premise servers and VMS.

27
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.870
So if we have a hybrid environment and even other AWS nodes so this

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.140
is very specific to compute within our accounts,

29
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.360
the very last one we have is shared.

30
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.530
Resource is and shared resource is are essentially used

31
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.370
for managing as well as configuring.

32
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.880
Our AWS resource is so these are what are known as documents SSN

33
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.740
documents which will look at here in a little bit.

34
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.150
And they could be shared across your organization or with other teams

35
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.040
to automate different tasks within your account.

36
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.810
Let's go ahead.

37
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.020
We'll take a break here,

38
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.000
and in the next clip we'll start looking at S S M in a hybrid environment and the differences
