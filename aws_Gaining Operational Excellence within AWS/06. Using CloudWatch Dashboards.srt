1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,430
[Autogenerated] all right,

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:05,940
So now that we have an understanding of CloudWatch metrics,

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,850
we're going to take a look at dashboards now.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,240
Dashboards are not going to be tested over,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,160
but there's something useful for you when you're

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,140
implementing your architectures within AWS.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,240
Now, CloudWatch dashboards, which we can see here on the left,

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,760
are just customizable.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,780
Home page is, if you will, that allow us to specify what resource is.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,240
We want to view on a single pane of glass,

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,710
so let's go ahead and create a dashboard.

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,370
Let me select create.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,130
I'll give it a name.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,320
We'll click on Create here and there we go.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,300
We've now started the process.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,350
Now what this does is it brings us to a widget selection screen, as you can see.

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,640
Currently, there are five different options,

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,960
and each of these is going to display differently now,

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,740
for this will use stacked area.

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,810
I'll click on configure, and this brings us to the screen we saw before.

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,680
It's our ad metric graft screen, so let's go ahead and do the exact same thing.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,310
Will go to E.

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,520
C.

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,740
Two per instance,

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,890
and I'll go down and I'll find our instance IDE and I'll select CPU utilization.

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,340
And there you go.

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,840
It's populated our graph.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,340
And if you notice it's a stacked area Grafana supposed to a line

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,410
graph like it was before and if we wanted to,

30
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,030
we can change that by coming up here.

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,040
We'll leave it as is for now.

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,500
And then the next thing we want to do is we want to give it a name.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,380
Now, this is something descriptive.

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,180
So we can quickly identify what we're actually measuring.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,140
So let me give this a name.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,850
I'll go ahead and save this and then I'll click on

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,400
create widget And there we go.

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,140
We have now created a widget on our dashboard.

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,800
Now, one more important thing here is we want to save the dashboard,

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,410
so make sure you save it whenever you make any changes.

41
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,140
Otherwise, they're going to get wiped out.

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,140
So that's how easy it is to create your very own dashboard.

43
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,710
Now, before we wrap up, I just want to show you two things.

44
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,240
The first is under the main CloudWatch screen.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,410
This is considered a dashboard Now A W s provides this by default

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,860
and you can see we have an alarm's section.

47
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,910
We have crossed service dashboard.

48
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,780
So we can have aggregated metrics within our account,

49
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,560
and then we can have a default dashboard down at the bottom.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,190
Now, one last thing if you go to a service.

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,030
So let's just go to Ec2.

52
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,660
Since that's what we've been using and I load this easy to console.

53
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,840
Let me locate my instance.

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,100
You can see we have a monitoring tab built in.

55
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,940
So if I click on this,

56
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,240
this brings us to a dashboard provided to us by a W s CloudWatch.

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,540
You can see we're measuring data for the last hour.

58
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,690
Or I should say we're presenting data measured within the

59
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,690
last hour and you can see all of the different key metrics

60
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,440
that error offered to us.

61
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,800
Now.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,110
Another thing to notice is we can actually enable detailed

63
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,340
monitoring if we wanted to from this tab.

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,590
Now, just remember, that incurs extra cost.

65
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,640
Now, I'm not going to do that here.

66
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,000
We're actually going to go ahead and wrap up and then move on to CloudWatch alarms
