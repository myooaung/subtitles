[Autogenerated] Welcome back in this clip,

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.480
we're going to look at session manager now.

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.850
Session manager is a means for us to connect to are instances via

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.440
an agent connection as opposed to SSH or Rdp.

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.820
So it eliminates the need for a typical bastion hosts or jump

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.950
server host set up in our architectures.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.440
So let's see how this works.

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.780
A click start session and you can see that we have are managed.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.110
Instantiate just did.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.640
So I'll select that.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.240
Let me start a session with that.

12
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.460
Now I'll have to accept that I'm enabling advanced instances because this is

13
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.030
on Prem and these costs more so just keep that in mind.

14
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.540
But I'm gonna click, accept change my setting and then I'll start the session.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.990
So when I open up this pop up here that I receive,

16
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.240
you can see our session IDE on the top left.

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.940
We have our managed instance ID, and then we're now in a shell.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.840
So I'm on the operating system that we just worked with on

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.640
activating and adding to our SSN managed instances.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.040
So to prove it, let me clear, and then I'm gonna touch attempt file called test.

21
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.320
So that exists in slash temp.

22
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.390
So if I go back to my SSH session and I ls that

23
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.420
directory there it is right here, so we can see that file.

24
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.590
So session manager really allows us to connect.

25
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.600
To are instances via S s M agent,

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.140
as opposed to having to connect over an SSH or Rdp protocol.

27
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.550
This is a very cool tool.

28
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.940
I see it used in a lot of enterprises that want to replace bastion hosts.

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.040
So if you get time, make sure you poke around and play with it.

30
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.850
That's going to do it for this session.

31
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.640
I'll go ahead and terminate this.

32
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.860
And then there we go.

33
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.180
Now, one more thing before we wrap up,

34
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
you could actually view session history and you can

35
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.540
see who created that session.

36
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.520
So we'll go ahead and we'll end here.

37
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.840
And in the next clip, we're gonna look at A W s parameter store,

38
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.000
which is built in to S S M. And then look at some of the use cases around that
