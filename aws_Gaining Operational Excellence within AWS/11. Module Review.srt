1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,840
[Autogenerated] way to go.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:07,430
You have now completed the fourth module in this course before we wrap

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,740
up and end lets us go ahead and have a quick review.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,850
We learned how we can use aws CloudFormation to

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,540
automate our infrastructure deployments.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,980
We looked at the different stacks that they offer,

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,040
like stack sets and nested stacks.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,500
And we gained an understanding of what infrastructure as

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,640
code is and its many different use cases.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,630
We actually gained hands on experience with

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,910
different stacks within CloudFormation.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,580
So we deployed that stack set and then we ended it by

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,580
seeing how we can leverage AWS ops works to automate our

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,140
configuration management tasks.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,290
We can leverage this a ws managed service to have it handled the burden of

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,310
the load for standing up the infrastructure needed for a chef or puppet

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,740
set up that's going to do it for this module.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,600
We'll wrap up here and then in the next clip,

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm just going to do a quick course overview. So we can recap everything that we've learned throughout this course
