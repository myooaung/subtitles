00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.960
[Autogenerated] the beauty of S s m is that we can set it up to run

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.340
an automate our workloads on a hybrid environment.

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.040
Now there are some key differences to know when you're trying

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.740
to configure this on your on prem servers compared to easy to

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.260
so on e c to the s s m agent,

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
which is what systems manager uses to connect to the resource is

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.890
and run commands is usually installed by default.

8
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.340
If you're using the public am is that Amazon provides.

9
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.490
Now you do have to enable and then start the agent.

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.240
It's not necessarily running right away.

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.350
But once you do that,

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.430
you also need to make sure that you're allowing interaction

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.840
with S S M from E C two via the I am role.

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.080
So the instance profile will need SSN permissions which

15
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.440
will look at in order to talk to S S m.

16
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.670
The key difference here on on premise servers is that the agent

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.440
is more than likely not installed by default,

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.560
which makes sense.

19
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.240
This is your home grown compute in internal resource

20
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.040
is as opposed to public cloud.

21
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.740
Now, To enable this, you need to install the A ws provided TLS cert.

22
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.260
And after you do that, you have to create a managed instantiate activation,

23
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.710
which will discuss your soon and receive an IDE and a code

24
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.240
that you use to configure your agent.

25
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.130
So after you have those prerequsites set up,

26
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.040
you install the agent and configure it with the IDE and the code

27
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.840
that you received from the previous steps.

28
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.120
Now I recommend if you're doing this,

29
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.270
that you create a VM template or maybe a boot script,

30
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.600
like a cloud in its script that automatically installs and

31
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.040
configures this agent upon server creation.

32
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.350
Now,

33
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.160
let's go ahead and start diving into some demos so we can get

34
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.640
some hands on experience with this service.

35
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.050
During these demos, we're going to do a few different things.

36
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.240
The first thing we're going to do is install and configure the s s M agent.

37
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.320
Now we'll do this on E.

38
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.520
C to utilizing, and I am role.

39
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.270
And then we'll mimic an on premise server which will live in easy to

40
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.840
but will treat it like it's an on Prem VM and will install and

41
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.970
configure the S S M agent on there as well.

42
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.960
So we can see the differences between E.

43
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.040
C two and on Prem.

44
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.120
And then lastly, we're going to create an inventory of our managed instances.

45
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.440
So we can view what's going on within our applications.

46
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.410
So let's go ahead in this clip here and in the next,

47
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.000
clips will start diving in to the console and the service in viewing how we can use it.
