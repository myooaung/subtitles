00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,600
[Autogenerated] Okay.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,690
Congratulations.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,140
You've made it through the first module.

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,540
Now, before we move on, let's just have a quick wrap up review.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,610
So we started off by seeing how CloudWatch monitors are A W s

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,940
resource is and our applications in our accounts,

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,640
we covered the six key concepts for CloudWatch.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,440
And with that, can you actually name those six key concepts?

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,870
We created alarms based on selected metrics for our use case.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,820
So what we did, if you recall,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,170
is we created an alarm that sent me a notification.

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:45,140
Once R E C two instantiate reached 50% CPU utilization.

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,840
We used CloudWatch events to trigger actions,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,150
and we use both scheduled expressions and event based.

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:59,040
And then we finished up with pushing custom logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,340
So we de mode what it would be like to push logs to CloudWatch from an

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,310
on premise server that's going to do it for this module on configuring

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:18,000
and using CloudWatch for advanced workloads. Let's cut here and then I'll see you in the next module
