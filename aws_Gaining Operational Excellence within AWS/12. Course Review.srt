[Autogenerated] all right, now, before we wrap up everything and in this course,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,740
I just wanted to give a brief course review and

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,040
then some recommended next steps.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,340
So if you recall, we used CloudWatch in advanced scenarios,

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,420
including pushing custom logs from our servers to CloudWatch

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,340
law groups for us to monitor and look at.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,320
We learned how to heavily utilize CloudWatch metrics

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,840
for both monitoring and alerting.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,580
And we looked at enabling,

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,140
configuring and then protecting via validation are CloudTrail trails.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,080
Fourthly, we looked at leveraging systems manager for ops related tasks.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,150
So our normal,

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,350
tedious work that could be done in an automated fashion can leverage

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,340
this service in order to speed it up and building off.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,810
Of that,

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,370
we looked at getting secret values Using a W s

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,340
parameter store within systems manager.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,830
We saw how padding can do work for allowing access,

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,180
and we looked at the different types of parameters that error offered.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,230
And then finally,

21
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,030
we just wrapped up creating repeatable deployments using

22
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,640
both CloudFormation and A W S ops works.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,560
So this allowed us to learn how to implement these infrastructure

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,040
and config management tools using a few templates.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,770
Now that does it for this course.

26
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,620
Thank you for watching for next steps.

27
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,230
I do encourage you to look at the AWS Solutions architect

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,460
professional learning path that they have and follow

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,640
through on some of those courses.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,810
Now, I also have another course called Managing A W s Operations,

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,840
and that is essentially a deep dive on the systems manager service.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,000
So be sure to check that out as well. And with that, Thank you for watching.
