00:02.140 --> 00:08.080
So now we learn about a lot of components in the last section when we build our first application.

00:08.110 --> 00:13.620
I now want to dive deeper into some of those components and into some of the core concepts of ironic

00:13.630 --> 00:17.280
too when it comes to components are working with templates.

00:17.500 --> 00:22.810
I already pointed towards the official documentation and I'm just stressing this again.

00:23.020 --> 00:29.260
Really bring that to your attention and to really get you to go there and definitely check out the components

00:29.260 --> 00:33.870
section tared to learn more about the components you might be interested in.

00:33.880 --> 00:39.880
For example if you want to learn more about the inputs and we'll come back to input specifically in

00:39.880 --> 00:40.600
the next ep.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.850
But anyways if you want to learn more about that simply have a look at the appropriate entry year and

00:45.850 --> 00:51.010
you will find a lot of ways of working with that component of configuring it and how you should use

00:51.010 --> 00:51.370
it.

00:51.490 --> 00:57.280
And as ironic too offers a lot of different components it's simply impossible to cover them all in this

00:57.280 --> 01:00.510
course and honestly will also be pretty boring.

01:00.820 --> 01:07.270
Now besides those components or this component documentation here I also recommend having a look at

01:07.270 --> 01:09.730
the API documentation from time to time.

01:10.030 --> 01:16.330
But the best way to get there for your specific component is not by clicking on API but instead if you

01:16.330 --> 01:21.910
have a component the input component here you should find a link at the top at the beginning of the

01:21.910 --> 01:22.750
component part.

01:22.750 --> 01:30.720
For example here after the first abstract where you are directly redirected to the appropriate API documentation.

01:30.730 --> 01:35.640
Now what's the difference between the API documentation and the component documentation.

01:35.860 --> 01:42.130
Well the IPY documentation contains every class I own two ships with whereas the component documentation

01:42.190 --> 01:45.300
only shows how to use those components.

01:45.370 --> 01:52.210
But if you want to know every single property you can bind and every single thing you can configure

01:52.210 --> 01:59.020
about a component the API documentation is where you might when I go because here you really find well

01:59.230 --> 02:05.530
which properties you can bind which events are emitted and which sace variables you can change for this

02:05.590 --> 02:07.330
specific component.

02:07.360 --> 02:14.820
You know that overwriting of built in set of variables I was discussing in the last section.

02:14.890 --> 02:21.160
So this is how you should work with the documentation and how you can dive deeper into components and

02:21.160 --> 02:22.540
how to configure them.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.900
We have that out of the way.

02:24.010 --> 02:30.540
Let me dive deeper into some of the most important components or things about eye on it too.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.830
Together with you in the next lectures
