WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.100
So here is the application.

00:04.200 --> 00:08.030
And first of all let me show a tiny piece of user interface state.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.300
We are already using here on the log in form if you press log in.

00:13.410 --> 00:15.240
I am showing a spinner.

00:15.240 --> 00:22.080
So here you could argue I am already using some state and actually not just there in our application

00:22.080 --> 00:22.870
code.

00:22.950 --> 00:29.160
We already have a couple of services like the booking service or all of our places service here.

00:29.160 --> 00:33.730
Now these are very simple services but we are managing data in there.

00:33.810 --> 00:37.700
Sure it's dummy data for now but better than nothing.

00:37.740 --> 00:42.990
So we already have some state management in place but of course we can do way more we can make sure

00:42.990 --> 00:48.720
that we filter to places when we click on booking places here to only show the places that were not

00:48.720 --> 00:51.180
created by the currently locked end user.

00:51.420 --> 00:57.660
We can make sure that when we add a new place here that we actually really added and not just show our

00:57.660 --> 00:59.610
dummy places all the time here.

00:59.820 --> 01:05.640
And of course we can make sure that when we book a place here that we really book a place and we don't

01:05.640 --> 01:10.720
just let the data go into the White and while it's more on that of course we can all is a fine tuned

01:10.720 --> 01:17.460
to user interface in a couple of places and also add nice spinners when we're waiting for some action

01:17.460 --> 01:18.270
to complete.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.110
So we all as a want to implement that UI state.

01:21.180 --> 01:28.230
I was talking about let's maybe start by making sure that we can actually add our own places here on

01:28.230 --> 01:36.300
a new offer so that we can offer new places and for that we'll have to work on the places service they

01:36.380 --> 01:44.380
there we have our list of places and now our goal will be to actually add new elements to that list.

01:44.430 --> 01:49.400
And as I mentioned later in a separate module we'll also stored at least on a server in the web.

01:49.410 --> 01:54.750
But for now we'll do it here in memory in our application only now.

01:54.780 --> 02:01.770
We'll still use that place model we created earlier this one where we basically define which kind of

02:01.770 --> 02:07.410
data we want to store in a place like basically a data where fetching your title description price and

02:07.410 --> 02:12.930
a will ability title description price availability that is what I have here to here I also have an

02:12.930 --> 02:17.460
image you are L and we will actually let the user take an image later.

02:17.550 --> 02:22.780
For now we'll just add a hard coded image here because we haven't added that functionality yet.

02:23.010 --> 02:29.330
One new thing which I want to add here though is a new field which is the user I.D..

02:29.340 --> 02:35.430
So the idea of the user who created that place and that will be important later for letting a user book

02:35.550 --> 02:41.550
a place because users should only be able to book places they haven't created let's say for that is

02:41.550 --> 02:42.230
a new field.

02:42.270 --> 02:47.670
I added here to the place model constructor and this means that all the places I create here are now

02:47.670 --> 02:49.090
invalid.

02:49.110 --> 02:53.490
Now I will simply add a dummy lost argument to all of them.

02:53.490 --> 02:59.310
So did we still have some dummy data to go with and the user I.D. can be any data you want right now

02:59.340 --> 03:03.720
because we have no real user and therefore this will do.

03:03.720 --> 03:09.150
But since we need that user I.D. We should also go to the off service and make sure that we don't just

03:09.150 --> 03:15.120
decide whether our users of dedicated or not but then we all store is some kind of user I.D. in here

03:15.560 --> 03:16.020
for that.

03:16.020 --> 03:22.620
I'll add a user I.D. field here and let's say that is the user with ABC as a user I.D. here and of course

03:22.650 --> 03:29.880
then I want to add a gather here user I.D. We're actually returned this user I.D. so that we can't set

03:29.880 --> 03:32.760
it from outside but we can get it from outside.

03:32.790 --> 03:38.130
So now we have that user I.D. in place in the off service and now in the places service it's finally

03:38.130 --> 03:39.770
time to add a new method.

03:39.840 --> 03:45.250
We have one for getting a single place and we have our getter here forgetting all places.

03:45.270 --> 03:51.600
Now it's time for a ad place method which we can call from our forum where we do actually add a new

03:51.600 --> 03:56.330
offer and here we need to get all the data we need to create a new place.

03:56.550 --> 04:01.890
So we'll need the title which should be a string will need the description of a place which should be

04:01.890 --> 04:08.820
a string will need the price which should be a number to be in line with what we're expecting here in

04:08.820 --> 04:09.810
our model.

04:09.930 --> 04:13.090
And then we need these two dates available from and available to.

04:13.500 --> 04:20.570
So here I'll get the date from let's say which is a date and the date to which is a date.

04:20.590 --> 04:26.460
Of course you can name these arguments however you want with all the data we're getting here.

04:26.520 --> 04:33.690
I then want to create a new place and dad will be done by using the new constructor or the new keyword

04:33.700 --> 04:39.700
with the place constructor I should say now they're the first argument actually is the idea of the place

04:39.820 --> 04:41.620
right here in our place.

04:41.770 --> 04:48.430
We need to pass in an idea now later once we added a back end will generate that idea on the server

04:48.430 --> 04:49.460
dynamically.

04:49.570 --> 04:54.290
For now we'll create a pseudo random unique one.

04:54.370 --> 04:58.880
So we'll create the random one but it isn't really unique but it will do for now.

04:58.900 --> 05:05.890
So here we'll use simply use math random to string and in theory we could have the same random number

05:05.890 --> 05:06.760
twice.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.240
But for our purposes here it should do and that shouldn't reoccur.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.680
And that's just a temporary solution.

05:13.150 --> 05:20.020
Then I'll forward to title and the description here in there are places in the constructor for the image

05:20.050 --> 05:27.460
I mentioned we'll have to use a hardcoded value so let's grab one like maybe New York here.

05:27.490 --> 05:30.280
But you can of course use any image link you want.

05:30.400 --> 05:37.360
So I'll use this one pass it in here then I'll have a price and the price here will be the price I get

05:37.360 --> 05:47.230
as an argument and a whale from will be date from available to will be date to with that I'm creating

05:47.230 --> 05:48.830
a new place here.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.260
Now what's it not liking.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.950
Well I also need to pass in my user idea.

05:52.950 --> 05:53.200
Right.

05:53.200 --> 06:00.310
That has all the required I need to pass on the string with my user I.D. the user I.D. however is saved

06:00.310 --> 06:03.360
here and the off service and I do have my getter here.

06:03.370 --> 06:07.370
But how can I no access to user I.D. no place service.

06:07.510 --> 06:12.700
Well the good thing is we're using angular here at an angular we have this concept called dependency

06:12.700 --> 06:13.600
injection.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.950
Now I also touched on this in my angular refresher in case or not your way it is.

06:17.960 --> 06:23.920
And we did use it for this course already it allows us to inject services into Abra things and thus

06:23.920 --> 06:30.220
far we injected services into components but we can also inject services into services so I can check

06:30.220 --> 06:36.850
the off service here into displays this service duties in exactly the same way we inject it into components

06:37.540 --> 06:43.460
I add private here to automatically safety injected argument in a private property and then I'll name

06:43.460 --> 06:47.910
this argument that property of service but that name is up to you.

06:48.250 --> 06:55.060
What matters is the part after the colon and that has to be of service which is imported from your off

06:55.060 --> 07:01.220
service file that injects the service into this component and therefore now everywhere in this component

07:01.220 --> 07:04.900
since it's stored in a property we can use dissolved service.

07:04.900 --> 07:12.790
So down here where I need the user I.D. I can just use this off serve as user I.D. just like that and

07:12.790 --> 07:16.740
now it is will fetch to user I.D. and add it to this new place.

07:16.780 --> 07:24.580
Now we have that new place created and now we can reach out to our places here and basically push our

07:24.580 --> 07:28.130
new place onto that array of places like that.

07:28.360 --> 07:32.250
And this should allow us to add a new place to our list of places.

07:32.300 --> 07:38.140
So with our place of service and off services changed such that we can add new places let's wire everything

07:38.140 --> 07:38.980
up.

07:38.980 --> 07:44.620
Let's go to the office area and they are two new offer and they are of course I want to call my ad place

07:44.620 --> 07:50.590
method when we submit everything here we have on create offer where I check the form validity and now

07:50.590 --> 07:58.090
my goal is to submit or to add this new place or the data for the new place to my play service to the

07:58.190 --> 08:04.870
ad place method and for that I need to inject the place service into the new offer page here and of

08:04.870 --> 08:06.780
course that works as it always does.

08:07.120 --> 08:15.610
I inject my places service with the normal annular dependency injection syntax need to import a service

08:15.610 --> 08:23.050
here at the top and then in on create offer after checking the validity we can call this place a service

08:23.170 --> 08:28.560
at place and we need to pass title description price and the dates.

08:28.780 --> 08:35.890
Now we have our form here and that form has the title description price state from it dates to fields

08:36.290 --> 08:43.870
and therefore we can simply access all these values we can access this form value and then there will

08:43.870 --> 08:50.440
be a title property because we named that control here title and Dale for India automatically created

08:50.440 --> 08:57.160
value object that Angela gives us will have a title property holding that title will also be able to

08:57.160 --> 09:04.330
access the description field on that value object because we have that description control and so on

09:05.020 --> 09:09.820
so description then we have this for and value price.

09:09.880 --> 09:14.180
One important note by default all these values are strings.

09:14.200 --> 09:19.450
So since we need a number here I add a plus in front of that to convert that into a number and then

09:19.450 --> 09:27.790
we have the dates and there I can of course access this forum value date from and since we need to pass

09:27.790 --> 09:35.230
in a date object I will wrap this with a new date call to create a new date object and the same of course

09:35.230 --> 09:37.900
for it is for in value date to

09:41.030 --> 09:47.180
now it is will call ad plays whenever we submit this form and therefore hopefully it adds a new place.

09:47.210 --> 09:52.430
Let's save everything and let's wait for it his application to reload and then let's try adding a new

09:52.430 --> 09:52.910
place.

09:53.090 --> 09:56.770
So here I will simply add a test blaze.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.540
Dust is work.

09:58.580 --> 10:06.380
I will give it a prize of one hundred twenty nine point ninety nine and I will pick a date from January

10:06.680 --> 10:16.100
1st 2019 all the way up to January 1st 2020 let's say and submit this.

10:16.250 --> 10:20.710
Well we should probably add some code to then redirect us will do so.

10:20.720 --> 10:27.700
But if I now go to discover we indeed see our test here and I can click on that and see.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.960
Does this work.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.780
This doesn't look too bad.

10:31.100 --> 10:34.100
So this looks good.

10:34.100 --> 10:38.410
Now the problem is if I go back to offers we still are in this window here.

10:38.870 --> 10:42.610
So we certainly want to do more than just adding this place for one.

10:42.620 --> 10:48.020
Once we're done with this I want to call reset on the form so that all these inputs are cleared again

10:48.500 --> 10:52.430
and I want to navigate away and that can be done with the Angela router.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.320
So let's inject that here.

10:54.320 --> 11:01.700
Private router using the at Angle Angela router package here and with that injected router we can route

11:01.700 --> 11:04.120
programmatically or navigate programmatically here.

11:04.130 --> 11:11.900
This router navigate and I want to go to my starting page let's say or you could also say you want to

11:11.900 --> 11:21.740
go to places taps offers which of course will make sure that we actually go to this page here with our

11:21.830 --> 11:29.130
offer overview if I do that and I saved us the apple reload and they don't wonder our place will be

11:29.130 --> 11:32.040
lost because that was stored in memory only.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.190
Again we will add persistent storage later.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.660
So here let me add.

11:36.660 --> 11:40.360
Does this work with some price send.

11:40.440 --> 11:48.120
Pick a date here like this and then submit this and now I get redirected.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.360
I see my place here which is great.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.050
We see that our output here of course doesn't really reflect the dates we actually pick.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.130
We should change this and we see it.

12:00.140 --> 12:00.820
Hmm.

12:01.010 --> 12:02.070
Where is it.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.180
Don't see it here on the Discover page right.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.050
Where is our place.

12:06.050 --> 12:12.500
So why is the place added in some cases and not an offer that is something we'll take care about next.
