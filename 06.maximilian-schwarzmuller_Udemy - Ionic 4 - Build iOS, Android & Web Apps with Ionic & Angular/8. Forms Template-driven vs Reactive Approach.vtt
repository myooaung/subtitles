You might be aware that angle or has two approaches when it comes to creating forms the template driven

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.030
approach which will lead to anger to inferring we're automatically creating the javascript representation

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.080
of your form for you whenever it detects a form element in your age old code and the reactive approach

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:30.330
which will lead or which means that you created for on your own programmatically in your code and then

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.120
you tell ironic to which form and which form elements in your HVM template.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.650
It has to synchronize with your form object and with the controls you find there.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.740
Great news art and I think to both approaches work so both works you can use either the template driven

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.400
or the reactive approach.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.290
And guess what.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.350
In this app I'm going to show you both approaches and show you how to integrate them with I on to just

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.020
one important information right at the beginning.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.170
It's works really just like it works in any normal or two apps.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.570
The main difference is that you have different input items to work with.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.960
Since I on two ships with some nice components when it comes to using forms or setting up user input

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.780
fields or pages.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.130
So let's dive into which components we may use and then how to use them.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.390
We have the template driven approach first in the next ELECTRESS
