00:02.220 --> 00:04.770
So our application is taking shape here.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.810
Now one thing that of course is not working as it should is if we reload on that does cover page we're

00:09.810 --> 00:15.810
not fetching any places because right now we're only using our fetch places method here which we added

00:15.810 --> 00:18.590
in the plays a service on the off page.

00:18.630 --> 00:24.930
Of course we should use stayed on our pages to basically on all the pages where we need all places and

00:24.930 --> 00:28.980
that of course would be our discover page as well.

00:28.980 --> 00:32.590
So let's go to the Discover page there.

00:32.610 --> 00:38.220
We already inject the places service we set up to subscription here and enjoin in it which of course

00:38.220 --> 00:45.960
is fine but just as before I want to add I and view will enter here to also use the places service here

00:45.990 --> 00:53.850
to call fetch places and then subscribe to that and justice before we can then use it is loading property

00:53.850 --> 00:58.610
here is loading falls to show us better.

00:58.650 --> 01:02.460
So an I and you will enter all set is loading to true.

01:02.700 --> 01:09.060
And then here and is functioning past the subscribe I set is loading back to FALSE and as a side note

01:09.180 --> 01:15.390
of course you can refine the application to check whether you already have data loaded and in that case

01:15.390 --> 01:20.930
you might not want to show a spinner and fetch new data invisibly in the background and only showed

01:20.930 --> 01:25.090
a spinner if you have no data yet that is all possible here.

01:25.110 --> 01:27.110
I will use a simpler approach.

01:27.240 --> 01:32.700
I will simply add were set to this property whenever we start fetching data and we do start fetching

01:32.700 --> 01:38.880
data whenever it is view is about to become visible and in the template of the Discover page.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.760
I therefore can use is loading to show a spinner.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.800
So my idea here is to always show these segments here.

01:45.810 --> 01:52.580
Let's say but then you're in the grid whereas show there are no book about places right now.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.720
That is nice.

01:53.730 --> 01:57.840
But first of all I also want to check if is loading is not true.

01:57.960 --> 02:03.390
So if not is loading and then that condition should be met.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.550
So I'll wrap this in brackets.

02:05.550 --> 02:12.720
So if we're not loading and we have no places then I want to show this message or if we're not loading

02:13.620 --> 02:22.320
and this condition is met then I want to show the places otherwise I'll add a new grid here let's say

02:28.600 --> 02:36.880
and there I will use the same size clauses as before and also centering here I will show my iron spinner

02:37.420 --> 02:44.430
with a color off primary and doesn't hire a grid up here will only be shown if is loading is true and

02:44.440 --> 02:49.870
of course is up to you if you use energy if on the grid on a row on a column whatever basically suits

02:49.870 --> 02:52.310
the rest of the structure you have in place.

02:52.330 --> 02:56.010
So with that changed it is reloads.

02:56.170 --> 02:59.010
We now see the spinner and we're good.

02:59.140 --> 03:02.740
And now of course when I go to offer and they go back I see that's been wrong again and that is what

03:02.740 --> 03:07.210
I meant you could of course change to code such that you only showed the spinner if no data has been

03:07.210 --> 03:13.210
loaded before whatever suits your needs and however you want to have this in your application.
