00:01.870 --> 00:04.950
We had a closer look at buttons and lists.

00:05.060 --> 00:07.190
Let's have a closer look at the grid.

00:07.290 --> 00:13.150
We briefly covered it in the last section on the last application we bult not want to have a closer

00:13.150 --> 00:14.300
look at it.

00:14.300 --> 00:20.770
I Onix grid system is a very flexible system which you can use anywhere in your template even inside

00:20.770 --> 00:21.610
of avor.

00:21.630 --> 00:28.610
I own two components for example in a card element a car component as you saw it in the last section.

00:28.660 --> 00:36.790
It's based on flex box which is a C S S feature which basically makes placing a lining and so on of

00:36.880 --> 00:39.750
items that are very very flexible and easy.

00:40.090 --> 00:42.480
And here you can see how it works.

00:42.550 --> 00:49.780
You can add this ion grid wrapper which is optional though it adds some extra padding and you can then

00:49.810 --> 00:57.690
add in rows and columns and those columns can ever have NO with assigned to them or you use like with

00:57.700 --> 01:04.390
10 with 20 all the sizes you see here to give them a specific with if you don't add it with attribute

01:04.660 --> 01:09.290
they will automatically divide up all the available space between all columns.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.430
So let's see some action back in the application.

01:12.430 --> 01:17.590
I'm actually going to add this on top so that we don't have to scroll down in our application here and

01:17.590 --> 01:20.430
here I will start by adding in grid.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.410
Again keep in mind this is optional.

01:22.420 --> 01:26.210
But I will add it here now then we will add I wrote.

01:26.530 --> 01:31.210
And in this row I will add in column whereas say column.

01:31.210 --> 01:32.850
Now let me save this.

01:33.100 --> 01:36.910
And now if we reload the application we see a column here.

01:36.940 --> 01:40.730
Now it's a bit hard to see how broad this column is right.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.540
So let's add a little styling to it.

01:43.570 --> 01:50.860
I'm going to go to the home s.c.s s file and I'll simply change the look of I and.

01:50.960 --> 01:57.780
So I'm using the selector of this component and I'll give it a border of one pixel dasht and a light

01:57.800 --> 01:58.490
Great.

01:58.640 --> 02:04.550
Now if I save this you won't see that now we can clearly see the world space.

02:04.550 --> 02:11.430
This column takes up with these whistle glue or indication here I'll go back to the template and now

02:11.470 --> 02:15.540
let's add a second column A second column like this.

02:15.640 --> 02:21.200
What you will see now is that now both columns are evenly stretched out across this row.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.270
They both take up the same amount of space.

02:24.320 --> 02:32.900
Now you can't change that by for example going to your first column and using with 67 on it.

02:32.900 --> 02:37.070
Now that will tell I own up to you to make this column more broader.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.930
Or since our second column actually holds some text mixed up.

02:40.970 --> 02:46.520
Let's make the first column smaller by for example placing with 20 on it.

02:46.550 --> 02:50.960
So go back to that column and simply add with 20 like this.

02:51.180 --> 02:56.640
And now you can see that this column is much smaller it even has to wrap a line now.

02:56.930 --> 03:03.230
And in our second column is the broad column as the first one only takes about 20 percent of the with

03:03.230 --> 03:04.520
which is available.

03:04.520 --> 03:09.830
So these are ways of configuring how your column should look like and how much space they should take

03:09.830 --> 03:14.250
up how they should distribute the wearable space amongst each other.

03:14.330 --> 03:23.920
You can also offset columns for example if we add another row in our grid here like this.

03:24.040 --> 03:30.700
And now I add a new column a new column and I want to make sure that this column doesn't sit on the

03:30.700 --> 03:38.970
left edge but instead it's pushed to the right a bit I can add offset and then for example 20 the same

03:38.970 --> 03:39.350
width.

03:39.370 --> 03:41.500
We could use with with in front of it.

03:41.500 --> 03:46.670
Now with offset in front of it let's see what the steps you see.

03:46.690 --> 03:51.520
It pushes the column to the right and makes sure that there is an empty space for the left and does

03:51.520 --> 03:55.590
empty space of course is as broad as this column on the top.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.840
Since we didn't find it to be of size 20 so 20 percent of the available space.

04:00.880 --> 04:05.780
Of course you could also set this to 50 to push as even more to the right.

04:06.190 --> 04:12.460
So these are different ways of using this grid of making sure that you're placing things where you want

04:12.460 --> 04:13.580
to have them placed.

04:13.580 --> 04:20.020
Again I can only invite you to play around with this to really understand how it works and to understand

04:20.020 --> 04:22.930
how you can use it for your specific use case.
