00:02.160 --> 00:07.150
To add icons we can use tools and I'll use image gorilla.

00:07.170 --> 00:11.980
You can just google for that and should find it on ape tools or weapon profusion dot com.

00:12.180 --> 00:19.530
And this is a convenient tool which allows you to specify one PNC file in this format and one splash

00:19.530 --> 00:20.350
screen.

00:20.450 --> 00:28.200
You fall in this format to automatically generate the resources you need for your application and I

00:28.200 --> 00:34.890
will use that to generate my IOW resources for Android we can use a tool built into Android Studio because

00:34.890 --> 00:45.150
it turns out in your IOW app if you have a look ads that SS x c assets folder here in your project that

00:45.480 --> 00:51.660
you have to provide all these icons for your app to support different devices and screen sizes manually

00:51.660 --> 00:56.460
creating all these files is a lot of work and that's what a tool like this does for us.

00:56.460 --> 01:00.080
So here let's choose a file and attached you find.

01:00.090 --> 01:04.650
Example I can you can use here of course for your app you should use your own icon.

01:04.710 --> 01:06.680
Let's use that as I can here.

01:06.690 --> 01:09.240
Let's use the splash screen as well.

01:09.270 --> 01:15.180
Splash screen and then select IOW down there.

01:15.180 --> 01:18.980
You don't need to select anything else as like IOW not IOW ionic.

01:19.050 --> 01:27.300
I w is fine and click Kapow and this will now generate these assets for you and once it's done it will

01:27.300 --> 01:28.990
give you a download.

01:29.010 --> 01:35.830
Here we are download dead CIP file it in that downloaded and extract that zip file you'll find that

01:35.880 --> 01:42.820
I was folder with your app icons and your launch screen images you don't actually need all these files

01:42.850 --> 01:49.480
but now here in tax code you can just open that assets folder you go to app icon and now drag and drop

01:49.480 --> 01:52.090
the icons into the places where they belong.

01:52.150 --> 01:58.600
So you we have twenty point and then 2x free X will That's all what we have here is let's drag to X

01:58.600 --> 02:06.210
in there and free X and their we have twenty nine point two X and free x.

02:06.270 --> 02:14.010
So let's drag this in here and this and here we have forty point two X and free X..

02:14.010 --> 02:20.840
So let's drag two X in here and free X and here we have 60 points 2x and 3x.

02:20.850 --> 02:30.300
So same game of course let's track these files and here we have 20 points 1 and 2 x so let's drag these

02:30.300 --> 02:34.610
files in here we have twenty nine points 1 x and 2 x.

02:34.650 --> 02:41.930
So make sure to also drag these files and your 40 points 1 x and 2 x.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.160
Now I have no forty point one x.

02:45.390 --> 02:50.520
So what I did here is I quickly generate this off screen in photoshop.

02:50.550 --> 02:54.300
It's simply 40 by 30 image a half the size of the two x.

02:54.300 --> 02:58.350
So I took the 2 x 1 and basically just halved its dimensions.

02:58.350 --> 03:04.110
You find that attached to this video here so that you can continue but if you are missing it for your

03:04.110 --> 03:08.560
project simply generate it in your own image editing tool.

03:08.640 --> 03:16.820
Now for a 76 pixels we need 1 x and 2 x and I do have them here so let's drag and drop them in here.

03:17.190 --> 03:22.200
We have eighty three not 5 pixels to X and we do have that here as well.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.450
So let's drag that in.

03:24.900 --> 03:34.230
However for me it didn't like that generated 1 so I created a fixed size by halving the one that I had

03:34.230 --> 03:35.780
here which was too big.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.420
Again you'll find that fixed one attached to this video.

03:38.550 --> 03:43.750
And if you're getting an error for any of these icons just manually adjust them.

03:43.770 --> 03:46.950
Now last but not least that marketing I can we can direct it in here.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.830
So not all these icons are replaced for the splash screen here.

03:50.850 --> 03:57.180
Let's have a look at that launch image folder and there we have so many icons.

03:57.180 --> 04:06.370
Now I will simply use one the same launch image here so I'll direct the same PMG in to all these fields

04:06.370 --> 04:13.750
use the same image for all the y sizes you can of course go into more detail here and manually justice

04:13.990 --> 04:16.870
for all kinds of devices.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.060
With that I was prepared.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.310
Now what about Android there.

04:21.310 --> 04:27.370
Conveniently we have a built in tool to generate these assets for that you can click on app your right

04:27.370 --> 04:31.930
click on resources and add a new image asset.

04:31.930 --> 04:34.360
And here you can now choose what you want to generate.

04:34.360 --> 04:39.130
Now I want to generate launcher icons adaptive and legacy.

04:39.280 --> 04:49.830
And here you can leave the name as it is but you want to replace that path here to the image and there

04:49.830 --> 04:51.040
choose your icon.

04:51.040 --> 04:57.100
You file and open that and now it basically generates all these icons for you.

04:57.210 --> 05:06.240
If you're not not happy with what is generated here you can of course for example trim them here pick

05:06.240 --> 05:09.480
a background color that is white

05:15.640 --> 05:20.470
and then maybe go with that and of course again feel free to play around with that and adjust it to

05:20.470 --> 05:21.160
your needs

05:25.770 --> 05:31.890
can then click next and this will now basically replace the existing icon or I can Ken's with that new

05:31.890 --> 05:41.810
one so that you automatically have a project that uses Well a new set of icons your own one to be precise.

05:41.820 --> 05:47.310
Now for the splash screen we still need a tool and they're able to go back to image gorilla.

05:47.550 --> 05:52.950
And of course we could have done that right at the start but now we'll also check Android here and try

05:52.950 --> 06:01.820
again with that selection and now yea I just will restart image gorilla add my splash stream check Android

06:02.480 --> 06:10.090
and Kapow and just generates the android splash screens and once you downloaded that and extracted it

06:10.090 --> 06:14.790
you will have an android folder here in your extract that bundle.

06:14.890 --> 06:20.650
And in that droid will files your folders here you have icons to what you can ignore but you also have

06:20.650 --> 06:22.420
that screen page you file.

06:22.420 --> 06:28.790
And now of course in our project here we can replace our splash screen here.

06:28.820 --> 06:38.240
Splash splash P and T with these new screen false and I'll quickly do that in visual pseudocode here

06:38.520 --> 06:40.550
by going to source rest.

06:40.670 --> 06:45.220
And then here we have these tribal folders and organized a bit differently.

06:45.230 --> 06:49.270
They are really stored on our device and there.

06:49.270 --> 06:52.300
I want to replace these splash P and C files here.

06:53.230 --> 07:02.290
So with that make sure you rename these generated files to splash PMG and then drag them from the folder

07:02.290 --> 07:09.370
in which they are for example from tribal land HDB HD API folder in the extract that generate a splash

07:09.370 --> 07:16.360
screen project drag them into this folder here and replace the existing splash screen of course and

07:16.360 --> 07:18.180
that gives you your splash screen.

07:18.400 --> 07:24.970
And now I'll do this for all these your bowl folders here where I have a splash p and you file

07:37.470 --> 07:45.960
now in the port folders you can just use your normal draw bowl HD P.I. folder assets you find in that

07:46.230 --> 07:57.440
bundle so basically these assets here for example and with all of them replaced here let's try running

07:57.560 --> 07:59.050
our app again.

07:59.180 --> 08:05.240
So you're on android I'll run the app and bring it up on an emulator and there we should now see that

08:05.250 --> 08:07.430
icon and new splash screen of course.

08:07.430 --> 08:09.900
So that would be the hope that this is the case.

08:10.010 --> 08:16.730
Let's run it on Android first and thereafter also try it on ISIS of course.

08:16.750 --> 08:24.070
Now let's start to the application and here's our splash screen and here's our application.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.090
Now that's Android.

08:26.200 --> 08:35.440
Let's now give IAW a try and for that let's run this on an iPhone simulator like that.

08:35.440 --> 08:45.420
Click the play button here and let's see if that works here's our device starting up and that looks

08:45.420 --> 08:45.660
good.

08:45.660 --> 08:51.180
We see the splash screen here and if I close that here's also where I can.
