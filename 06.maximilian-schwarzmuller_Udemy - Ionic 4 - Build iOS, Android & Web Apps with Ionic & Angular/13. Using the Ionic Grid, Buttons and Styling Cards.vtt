00:02.670 --> 00:09.870
In the last lecture we created that basic plus card we could say a card with a content and a header.

00:09.970 --> 00:13.280
Not super amazing but it already does not look that bad.

00:13.540 --> 00:17.170
However we need more information on our card.

00:17.170 --> 00:22.830
We also need a link to click favorite or unfavorite before adding that link.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.610
Let me work on the card content.

00:25.690 --> 00:32.350
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap my quote here in a paragraph because I also want

00:32.350 --> 00:39.590
to add another paragraph where I output the offer or the person who made this quote so we can access

00:39.590 --> 00:42.400
this at quote person with this property.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.450
You can see that this property exists and I'll quote data.

00:46.770 --> 00:56.560
And with that we should now see that we have a multi-line card here with the text and then the person.

00:56.830 --> 01:00.900
But the issue is the person does not really stand out.

01:00.900 --> 01:01.850
You're right.

01:01.990 --> 01:05.900
We're not really able to recognize that this is the offer.

01:06.110 --> 01:07.980
I'll come back to this issue.

01:08.140 --> 01:13.090
But let's first finish the card content wise and let's add a button.

01:13.110 --> 01:16.190
You favorite this how can we do this.

01:16.270 --> 01:22.810
It would be nice to have this button below this content here and there a couple of ways to achieve this.

01:22.840 --> 01:31.190
I'm going to show you how to do this with the ionic grid ironic to ships with its own grid.

01:31.360 --> 01:38.130
And as always you can learn more about it by simply going to the component documentation and their grid.

01:38.500 --> 01:44.580
It's a grid as you might know it from Ambrosius as frameworks where you have this great wrapper.

01:44.620 --> 01:51.460
Then you can place rows inside of it your rows may have columns and you can optionally define the width

01:51.460 --> 01:52.510
of such columns.

01:52.570 --> 01:57.490
If you don't define the widths they will automatically split up the available content.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.840
Since this grid uses flex blocks s.c.s as feature.

02:01.870 --> 02:08.200
So this is the grid you can use and you can use it anywhere in your ionic to templates not just in a

02:08.200 --> 02:10.050
card anywhere.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.830
I'm going to use elements of this grid in a card though.

02:14.020 --> 02:24.380
So let's go back to our application I want to go below my cart content here and start adding iron row.

02:24.460 --> 02:27.320
So this means this is my content.

02:27.430 --> 02:33.280
Text wise now I'm adding a row for buttons and so on.

02:33.310 --> 02:40.840
You could also add grid to wrap the row but this would introduce additional spacing which I don't want

02:40.840 --> 02:41.580
to have.

02:41.650 --> 02:47.380
So I'm starting with iron row and then I'll add I call a column.

02:47.410 --> 02:52.840
Now I want this column to stretch over the full width so I'm not providing any with property.

02:53.020 --> 02:59.510
You could do it like with 50 to have this column only take up half the space.

02:59.860 --> 03:06.850
Instead as I just said I want to Rapide or I want to take up all the space however I want to align any

03:06.850 --> 03:12.000
text to the right text right as the help or directive which does this.

03:12.100 --> 03:19.660
I showed you where to find more about those helper directives at the end of the last core section so

03:19.660 --> 03:26.260
inside of this column I now want to have a button which allows me to favorite this quote here.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.560
So the caption could be favorite.

03:29.920 --> 03:35.890
And on this button of course 150 I and Button directive to make it look nice.

03:35.890 --> 03:43.470
Now if we do it like this let's see how this looks if we really DIAK go to the library click on a category.

03:43.540 --> 03:48.040
We get this fact favorite button here at the bottom right.

03:48.130 --> 03:53.340
It doesn't look super bad but I don't like how that button stands out.

03:53.740 --> 03:57.420
Thankfully we get different ways of styling buttons.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.310
And here again just search nowhere to learn more.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.790
We can have a look at the buttons documentation to learn about all the different styles.

04:05.890 --> 04:11.290
And I really like that style here the clear style where we don't have any border.

04:11.320 --> 04:18.880
So what I'll do is I'm going to add another directive to the button which is named clear and once I

04:18.880 --> 04:21.910
edit this if we have a look at our app you'll see that.

04:21.910 --> 04:28.200
Now we simply get the text here without any outline without any background.

04:28.210 --> 04:31.720
This looks pretty good but you can also change the sizing.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.460
We can set it to small.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.790
Alternatives would be medium which is the default.

04:35.830 --> 04:36.820
And big.

04:37.090 --> 04:41.760
Now of small does should look much better.

04:41.770 --> 04:49.000
Now we have a decent little favorite button which doesn't stand out too much but it's clearly wearable.

04:49.300 --> 04:55.900
Now with the buttons styled correctly of course all that a click listener and I want to say on ADD to

04:56.030 --> 04:59.780
favorite as a method name here to add this quote as a favorite.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.620
And of course I need to pass the quote.

05:01.660 --> 05:06.070
Remember this is the variable from the loop you're doing it on ADD favorite method.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.050
Once we handle it so of we can use it.

05:08.050 --> 05:16.070
Once we handle it I should say now I have to come back to the spot later when we actually are able to

05:16.070 --> 05:22.530
favorite a quote because then we also need to have a way to switch this button for a unfavorite button.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.980
But for now I'm going to leave it like this.

05:25.980 --> 05:30.770
And with Dad we created a nice little code card here.

05:31.460 --> 05:32.650
With some text

05:35.940 --> 05:38.990
the offer and this nice button.

05:39.030 --> 05:43.750
Now what I still want to change is to style of this offer.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.960
We're going to do this in the next lecture
