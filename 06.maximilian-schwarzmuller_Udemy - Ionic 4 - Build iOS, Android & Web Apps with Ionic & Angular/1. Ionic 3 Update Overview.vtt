00:02.760 --> 00:04.960
Ionic 3.0 was released.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.530
And that's not as big as it sounds.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.800
It should break your old code.

00:09.930 --> 00:15.630
But let's take a look at what happened on the official Get up page get up dot com slash deriv. Dokos

00:15.630 --> 00:16.840
slash ironic.

00:16.890 --> 00:21.260
You can click on releases to find the official release notes here.

00:21.270 --> 00:25.300
You'll also find some instructions on how to upgrade your existing project.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.320
It isn't that difficult and you may follow from these instructions to upgrade.

00:29.610 --> 00:33.000
However there are two important things which I want to highlight.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.970
The first important thing is the new ionic native package which you don't have to use but which you

00:38.970 --> 00:41.280
can use ionic native Reed.

00:41.310 --> 00:49.260
We used to in this course and if you do decide to use the new version the way you add or you use these

00:49.260 --> 00:53.010
native plug ins like the camera and on actually changes.

00:53.200 --> 01:00.450
And I will show you how to upgrade the awesome places app to work free of ionic and daemonic native

01:00.450 --> 01:02.870
package in the next lecture.

01:02.940 --> 01:08.860
After this video ends with you I will not do this so definitely hold onto this and have a look at this

01:08.860 --> 01:11.940
lecture to see how to upgrade what I want to highlight.

01:11.940 --> 01:16.380
Here is the ever important change and that affects the grid.

01:16.680 --> 01:22.710
Because here if we scroll down to breaking changes we see that the grid was changed and I didn't use

01:22.710 --> 01:26.910
to grid that much in this course or when I used it.

01:26.940 --> 01:31.710
I used to in a way which will still work because the overall grid components and so on you use still

01:31.710 --> 01:37.890
are the same but you may have a look at the blog post which is linked here to find out if your project

01:37.890 --> 01:38.830
is affected.

01:38.910 --> 01:44.670
Because whilst the overall components are the same the way the grid works behind the scenes changed

01:44.760 --> 01:51.260
some new features were added and some of the directives you used on your components won't work anymore

01:51.510 --> 01:55.260
and that is something I want to have a look at right now.

01:55.260 --> 01:57.630
So you're prepared a simple application.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.180
Start a project just created it.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.920
It's using I onic free.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.330
And here I get two columns.

02:03.330 --> 02:06.620
That's to code for it is now with the old CRID.

02:06.620 --> 02:13.590
Or you could do as you could say call and then let's say 50 to make is 50 percent off the page wide

02:14.040 --> 02:20.430
so he could add call 50 here too and we would have two columns which both take 50 percent of the available

02:20.430 --> 02:21.480
space.

02:21.490 --> 02:25.490
Now if we save this and we let our app reload.

02:25.830 --> 02:30.570
Well what we see here is that actually is not how we should use the grid anymore.

02:31.480 --> 02:36.320
Instead what we should do is we should use call six.

02:36.370 --> 02:39.760
So now the grid uses a 12th column lay out.

02:39.880 --> 02:44.530
And if you want to convert from your old way call 50 50 percent of the width.

02:44.620 --> 02:50.680
Well you should take 50 percent of the columns you have available so 50 percent of 12 columns makes

02:50.690 --> 02:53.840
Col 6 and that is how you should change it.

02:53.860 --> 02:59.240
Think in columns instead of percentages and you have 12 columns at a maximum.

02:59.560 --> 03:05.920
So if we save this we will see the same result as before but now that actually is the way you should

03:05.950 --> 03:06.610
do it.

03:06.610 --> 03:14.140
Use these classes directives here and again have a look at the blog post to find out what else changed.

03:14.140 --> 03:19.540
If some other code of yours is affected by the change this here and how you may take advantage of the

03:19.540 --> 03:23.470
new Brit so that's great if we go back to the release notes.

03:23.470 --> 03:27.700
We see that something about the type of the changed year and you should have a look.

03:27.700 --> 03:33.910
If data affects your code chances are it doesn't at least you didn't use it in due course.

03:34.330 --> 03:37.040
And if you were using the sleights component.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.130
Also something we didn't take a closer look at.

03:39.130 --> 03:43.670
In discourse you might also want to have a look at the changes listed here.

03:43.810 --> 03:46.690
So overall your apps shouldn't break.

03:46.700 --> 03:51.240
Definitely make sure to read Virtud instructions though if you are interested in this.

03:51.370 --> 03:57.250
And with that I'd say let's dive into the next lecture where I will actually upgrade the awesome places

03:57.250 --> 03:59.260
application to ionic free.
