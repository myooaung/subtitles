00:02.110 --> 00:04.420
So were you able to create those pages on your own.

00:04.420 --> 00:05.590
Let's find out together.

00:05.650 --> 00:07.450
I'm starting an a blank project.

00:07.450 --> 00:10.180
You probably chose the same approach.

00:10.180 --> 00:14.370
Now in this project I want to create all those pages we need.

00:14.650 --> 00:18.670
And you learn that we can use to see live words or do it manually.

00:18.670 --> 00:23.010
Now here I will use to Selye despite all the boilerplate it will give us.

00:23.110 --> 00:28.840
So if I want to generate page I can generate a new page and as let out in the last budget we need a

00:28.840 --> 00:33.310
page for our library which will hold the categories of quotes.

00:33.310 --> 00:38.310
Then we need a page 40 individual quotes inside of one of the chosen categories.

00:38.620 --> 00:44.320
We need the individual quote page if we tab on a quote in our favorites page which we haven't written

00:44.320 --> 00:46.710
yet to display in a modal.

00:46.720 --> 00:52.060
Speaking of that we showed this blady or we should create the favorite's page of course which allows

00:52.060 --> 00:54.180
us to display all our favorites quotes.

00:54.490 --> 00:57.890
And last but not least we need the settings page.

00:57.940 --> 01:02.560
Actually we will soon need an additional page but I will come back to this.

01:02.890 --> 01:09.250
Now with these changes in place we can get rid of the home page year of this whole folder and that of

01:09.250 --> 01:12.670
course will break our app but will soon fix it.

01:12.670 --> 01:15.130
With that we get the pages we need.

01:15.130 --> 01:23.180
Thus far though to hook them up we will use tabs navigation soon before doing that though.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.620
Let's simply make dead favorite's page a root page.

01:26.620 --> 01:33.760
We can do this in the app folder here here in the AB component we're setting up what our root page should

01:33.760 --> 01:34.230
be.

01:34.270 --> 01:38.000
And currently it's set to our home page which of course doesn't exist anymore.

01:38.230 --> 01:46.600
So let's simply get rid of that import here at the top and let's replace home page with favorite's page

01:48.300 --> 01:49.170
like this.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.090
Of course we also now need to add import.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.350
So we should add the import of favorite's page.

01:55.360 --> 02:00.280
Your and of course specify the path.

02:00.330 --> 02:04.850
Now the path is simply in the pages folder and there add favorites.

02:04.890 --> 02:09.430
Favorites like this with this if I saved this and I own it.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.460
Serve is already running for me here.

02:11.490 --> 02:17.190
It will report this project and if we reloaders we see an error.

02:17.190 --> 02:18.590
Now what's this error.

02:18.930 --> 02:23.210
Now the error is that I didn't clean up my apt module here.

02:23.220 --> 02:27.120
I'm still referencing the home page and I didn't add the new page.

02:27.130 --> 02:34.070
So don't forget this day is something you will run into quite a lot because it's easy to forget.

02:34.080 --> 02:40.100
Always make sure to add the pages you're using here and clean up any pages you might not use anymore.

02:40.170 --> 02:45.650
So I delete the home page and its import and now I'm adding the favorites page and the favorites page

02:45.650 --> 02:47.010
import to your name.

02:47.010 --> 02:49.800
Also adding it to entry components.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.820
I could also already get all the other pages and it will do so in a second.

02:53.820 --> 02:56.320
Let me first show you the running application though.

02:56.490 --> 03:01.110
So with data changed in YAB module we should see the favorite's page.

03:01.200 --> 03:08.190
Not very amazing and definitely something we can improve when it comes to styling but it works.

03:08.430 --> 03:14.010
Now before finishing this would you want to add all the pages so that it will work when we start using

03:14.010 --> 03:20.100
them and then in the next lecture of course we should also think about how we want to navigate around

03:20.150 --> 03:24.260
we want to use those tabs in the end right and we haven't learned how to do that yet.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.190
So let's learn this in the next lecture.

03:26.220 --> 03:29.410
But before doing this again let's add all the other pages.

03:29.550 --> 03:32.070
So let's add the library page and its import.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.760
Let's add the quotes page and its import.

03:34.830 --> 03:40.400
Let's add the single quote page and its import and let's add the settings page and its import.

03:40.410 --> 03:45.870
So again make sure that you also add all those imports here at the top from the pages folder and then

03:45.870 --> 03:50.220
the appropriate subfolder is all to make sure to copy all those pages.

03:50.220 --> 03:56.560
So we're going to load them through ironic TOS navigation stack and add them to entry components down

03:56.560 --> 04:02.120
there so that angle or two is actually able to give us instances of those components when we need them.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.750
With that set up we created all the pages.

04:04.860 --> 04:10.860
The next step is to set up the tabs navigation and I'm not going to ask you to do this in advance because

04:10.860 --> 04:12.100
we haven't learned it yet.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.140
We will do so in the next lecture though.
