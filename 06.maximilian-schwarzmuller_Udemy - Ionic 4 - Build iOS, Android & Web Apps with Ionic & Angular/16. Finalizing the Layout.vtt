Now we can fix the styling by simply using the techniques we already learned about, by using the grid

00:07.840 --> 00:11.020
and some of these CSS utility classes.

00:11.020 --> 00:13.390
So let's start with the grid.

00:13.420 --> 00:18.570
I can essentially just copy my grid setup I used up there,

00:18.820 --> 00:21.830
so size-md 6, offset-md 3,

00:21.850 --> 00:25.450
we can copy that and add that to our other columns as well.

00:25.450 --> 00:31.030
So in this second row where I have the expense list, I will add it here and I will also add it to the

00:31.030 --> 00:36.370
column here where I output my total expenses. With this simple change,

00:36.370 --> 00:42.010
we make sure that these columns in separate rows but still columns in these rows have the same size

00:42.010 --> 00:44.260
as the column in the first row

00:44.260 --> 00:53.470
and therefore now if we add food here, this looks way better in my opinion. Now I also want to have some

00:53.680 --> 01:00.760
padding here on this output down there, for that we can go to that paragraph down there and let's try

01:00.760 --> 01:04.770
adding margin here, the CSS utility attribute.

01:04.900 --> 01:07.850
If you do that and you reload, you will see that

01:07.900 --> 01:13.600
now this has the same default margin as the other elements and therefore it nicely aligns here on

01:13.600 --> 01:14.920
the left.

01:14.920 --> 01:22.120
So this again uses the power of these CSS utility attributes to quickly add some default core styles

01:22.120 --> 01:25.290
like margins or paddings to different elements.

01:25.330 --> 01:28.450
And with that, I'd say we have quite a nice application here.
