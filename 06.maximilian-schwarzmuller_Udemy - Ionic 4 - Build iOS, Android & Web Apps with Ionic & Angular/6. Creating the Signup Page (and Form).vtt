00:02.230 --> 00:07.600
Let's start working on the sign up page because this will be the first page we need when we're brand

00:07.660 --> 00:14.740
new to this app we already finished the already had a section here with the button and the sign up title.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.200
Now let's work on the content.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.990
And I want to keep this content super simple.

00:19.210 --> 00:24.880
I'll add a form to the content because we obviously need a form to sign up a new user and we'll handle

00:24.880 --> 00:27.530
these foody template driven approach of English.

00:27.580 --> 00:31.630
Of course you can feel free to use the reactive approach if you prefer Adis.

00:31.860 --> 00:36.830
And in this form I'm going to add I a list and then I add items for the individual controls.

00:37.030 --> 00:43.210
So again you learn this an iron label to indicate what you want to use or to enter for example the e-mail

00:43.210 --> 00:49.290
address does is how we will authenticate a user here with fire based And later if you're using a different

00:49.300 --> 00:56.350
back and or a different way of authenticating user you can of course add your controls your information

00:56.500 --> 01:04.130
inputs your besides the label to which I assigned fixed attributes to give it this fixed style.

01:04.150 --> 01:10.630
I also need the input itself which allows the user to add his data to input his data and set this to

01:10.630 --> 01:16.400
type e-mail to all to bring up a special keyboard on a mobile device which helps me with and through

01:16.420 --> 01:17.990
e-mails.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.180
I'll also add and model because I'll use the template driven approach.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.190
And this means we all need to assign a name here.

01:25.240 --> 01:30.940
This is the name by which it will be stored in the Chavis object angle or to stores or creates for us

01:30.940 --> 01:31.710
in the end.

01:32.020 --> 01:36.640
So here I'll give this a name of email and I'll add the required validator.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.210
You could also add a pattern validator to make sure it's a valid email address.

01:41.230 --> 01:47.470
I'll leave this out for now because I really want to focus on the core topic of this section here which

01:47.470 --> 01:48.420
is authentication.

01:48.420 --> 01:51.110
HTP But of course you can improve this.

01:51.130 --> 01:54.730
And this is always a good practice to do if you feel like doing so.

01:55.060 --> 01:58.280
So this is the input for the e-mail address.

01:58.510 --> 02:06.220
Now I'm going to duplicate this I an item to add another input for the password and I'll only add one

02:06.220 --> 02:07.130
password input.

02:07.150 --> 02:12.370
Of course you could again improved as formed by adding a number one to force the user to confirm his

02:12.370 --> 02:14.700
password and adding some validation logic.

02:14.710 --> 02:19.450
But that's all normal angular to code or angle or code.

02:19.480 --> 02:24.800
So therefore here again I'm focusing on the topic at hand which is the integration itself.

02:25.060 --> 02:31.210
This password inport will input will be of type password Alief may mall on it but I'll give it a name

02:31.210 --> 02:33.880
of password because it is what old store.

02:34.230 --> 02:39.390
And I'm going to add one extra validator does mean Langguth directive.

02:39.450 --> 02:46.090
Angular ships with which allows me to validate the length of the password firebase will actually require

02:46.090 --> 02:48.800
a password to be at least six characters long.

02:48.880 --> 02:54.460
So therefore I will enter the sixth year and again adjustors to the needs of your specific back and

02:54.460 --> 02:57.080
or your specific application.

02:57.100 --> 03:02.740
Now with DST two inputs are in place the missing piece of course is a button which allows me to submit

03:02.740 --> 03:03.240
this.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.980
So I'll add a new button here.

03:05.080 --> 03:10.720
Place I an button on it make it a block button to have it span over the full width and I'll make it

03:10.720 --> 03:11.720
of type submit.

03:11.740 --> 03:16.640
So that actually submits the form of say sign up on the button here.

03:16.810 --> 03:20.520
And I want to disable the button if the form is not valid.

03:20.710 --> 03:23.680
For this however I need to get a reference to the form.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.160
We learned how to do this.

03:25.180 --> 03:32.170
I'll go to my foreign element at this f local reference on it referencing Engy form to again get a reference

03:32.170 --> 03:34.440
to the form angular created for me.

03:34.630 --> 03:40.720
And then I can use to stound a year in the disable property binding to say disable it if the form is

03:40.720 --> 03:42.080
not valid.

03:42.370 --> 03:48.110
So this sets up the form missing piece of course and you submit to make it something biddable.

03:48.130 --> 03:53.660
And here are simply call on sign up and I'll pass the form as an argument.

03:53.980 --> 04:00.300
So with this I can now go to the typescript file to the component itself remove as component X does

04:00.340 --> 04:02.160
comment and all the boilerplate.

04:02.170 --> 04:03.990
I don't need as of now.

04:04.240 --> 04:11.400
And instead at the on sign up method where I'll get my form of type Engy form as an argument.

04:11.410 --> 04:14.900
Make sure to import Engy form from angular forms.

04:14.920 --> 04:21.940
This type I'm assigning here and then for now I can simply lock the form value to see that this worked.

04:21.940 --> 04:27.220
Now let me say for us and let's see if the sign up process process works as it should.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.710
If you sign up page here we see the form.

04:30.730 --> 04:36.300
Now let's enter the e-mail address here and then a password which is at least six characters long.

04:36.340 --> 04:39.370
If I had sign up we see an object with email and password.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.320
So it looks pretty good to me.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.560
Now you also see my secret password here.

04:43.750 --> 04:48.100
With that out of the way the next step is to do the same for the sign in page.

04:48.280 --> 04:53.680
And as it's pretty similar to the sign up page this staff that is a challenge you should try solving

04:53.680 --> 04:54.330
yourself.

04:54.370 --> 04:56.260
Let's do it together in the next lecture
