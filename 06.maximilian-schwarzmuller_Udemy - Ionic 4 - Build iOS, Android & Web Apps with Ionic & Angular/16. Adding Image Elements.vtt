Let's talk about images in Ionic. Now

00:05.450 --> 00:13.190
thus far I always use the ion-img element and that is a special Ionic component that in the end will

00:13.190 --> 00:16.410
wrap the normal web, HTML,

00:16.510 --> 00:21.610
IMG, image tag but will add extra optimizations to it.

00:21.920 --> 00:29.240
Now inside of a virtual scrolling list, if you have items with images, you should always use ion-img

00:29.270 --> 00:35.600
because ion-virtual-scroll and ion-img will work together as such that images are loaded efficiently

00:35.600 --> 00:42.350
in advance as well but even outside of a virtual scrolling list, I strongly recommend considering

00:42.350 --> 00:46.900
and well if possible using the and ion-img element. Why?

00:48.410 --> 00:56.600
Because this element loads images lazily, which means only when they are really needed. It will not load

00:56.660 --> 01:00.140
images that are not visible or about to become visible,

01:00.560 --> 01:06.850
so if you have a longer list of elements or simply a page with a lot of content on it and you got images

01:06.860 --> 01:13.060
somewhere down if you scroll down, then this will only load the image when you are about to see it

01:13.190 --> 01:17.180
and why is this better than always loading all images in advance?

01:17.180 --> 01:24.170
Well it hits your bandwidth, your network bandwidth less which can be a thing for users of your app in

01:24.170 --> 01:31.340
let's say areas with bad internet connection or with limited bandwidth plans on their mobile providers. 

01:31.370 --> 01:32.620
So that is one thing

01:32.690 --> 01:39.920
and of course your page also simply is downloading faster if you're not loading all images in advance

01:40.370 --> 01:45.560
and therefore ion-img is how you should include images in your Ionic app.

01:45.560 --> 01:51.380
Now what about ion-thumbnail or ion-avatar as you also saw it in this app already?

01:51.380 --> 01:58.880
These are simply wrappers, ion-thumbnail renders a square image for example and ion-avatar simply renders

01:58.910 --> 02:00.200
a rounded image,

02:00.470 --> 02:05.570
so this is simply just some styling that makes your image or whatever you have in there look good

02:05.570 --> 02:11.930
and that's also worth pointing out. Into ion-thumbnail or ion-avatar,

02:11.930 --> 02:14.990
you don't have to pass in an ion-img,

02:15.050 --> 02:18.470
you can also pass in some text or whatever you want,

02:18.500 --> 02:23.900
ion-avatar just gives you a rounded element with that content inside of it,

02:23.900 --> 02:31.400
ion-thumbnail gives you a square element but in both cases if you do use an image, they will automatically

02:31.400 --> 02:34.520
adjust this image to look good inside of that container,

02:34.550 --> 02:38.390
so to center it and make sure it has the right dimensions.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.880
That is how you should use images,

02:39.890 --> 02:43.250
not too complicated but still worth pointing out.
