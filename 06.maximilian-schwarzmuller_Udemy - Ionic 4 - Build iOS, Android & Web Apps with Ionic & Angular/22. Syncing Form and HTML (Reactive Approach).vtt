00:01.950 --> 00:07.230
In a last lecture we created a form using the reactive approach a very basic form I should say using

00:07.230 --> 00:09.210
foreign group and form control.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.890
You could of course also use the form builder.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.590
But now I want to use synchronized with HVM.

00:15.900 --> 00:22.740
So in my HMO code first of all need to inform English too that I got my own form for this form element

00:22.920 --> 00:26.690
and added I don't want English to to create a forum for me.

00:26.850 --> 00:36.030
I do this by binding the form group property or directive here on this forum element.

00:36.030 --> 00:43.710
So by binding this property of this form group directive I do tell and let you please use my form instead

00:43.710 --> 00:51.030
of your form and therefore I need to pass my for in the recipe for this property which I saw in here

00:51.060 --> 00:53.190
where I assigned my own form.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.780
That's the first step.

00:54.780 --> 01:00.630
Now the former is synchronized but I also need to tell you which input refers to which control in my

01:00.630 --> 01:01.940
form right.

01:02.010 --> 01:08.770
A DUDAS for the first input here which should hold the title by adding a form control name directive.

01:08.970 --> 01:15.900
And since I only assign a string here we don't need to use the square brackets here but the string is

01:15.900 --> 01:20.410
simply title and this is the name of this control I'm using here.

01:20.430 --> 01:23.030
So of course this has to be the same.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.690
Now that's the same for the text area.

01:25.690 --> 01:30.670
Hirable use form control name to assign this to the Description Control.

01:30.930 --> 01:37.560
And last but not least the dropdown you could think this is complicated to hook up but it's super easy.

01:37.560 --> 01:43.860
You just go to unselect And that's important select not the option DS select component is the overall

01:44.250 --> 01:45.300
input.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.880
And there again you use form control name and assign this to difficulty and angler you will figure out

01:50.880 --> 01:52.360
the rest behind the scenes.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.620
Super easy with this in place.

01:55.840 --> 02:00.520
Let's save this and to be able to see something when we submitted.

02:00.720 --> 02:08.460
I also will at the end submit event here to the form element and execute on submit.

02:08.460 --> 02:12.640
Now this method doesn't exist yet so will quickly created here.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.420
In my typescript file on submit.

02:16.420 --> 02:21.370
I don't need to pass the form as an argument because it's already stored in this property Sewer's so

02:21.370 --> 02:25.150
I can access it in my typescript file and for no.

02:25.180 --> 02:33.150
Now all I want to do is I want to log the whole recipe form here with this emplace Let's save this.

02:33.150 --> 02:38.210
And also important note you don't need to import to reject the forms module.

02:38.230 --> 02:44.950
This is done automatically by a sonic module just like before with the normal forms module.

02:44.980 --> 02:46.530
So let's see this in action now.

02:46.570 --> 02:51.110
If I go to recipes and open up my page this does not look good.

02:51.130 --> 02:56.440
I do get the error that form group expects a form group instance.

02:56.440 --> 03:03.340
Now if I go back to my page here we get a recipe for him and this recipe form of course is a type for

03:03.370 --> 03:06.690
group and I'm assigning my form group.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.790
But what's going wrong.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.190
Well I'm never calling this initialize form right.

03:12.220 --> 03:18.100
So let's do this here an engine in it let's call initialize form there to actually create a form.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.990
Sounds kind of important.

03:20.260 --> 03:21.990
So let's do this.

03:23.510 --> 03:24.950
And with that let's try it again.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.290
Let's go to this new page.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.780
Now it looks better.

03:28.040 --> 03:36.740
And now let's try to create a tasty recipe or like a schnitzel which is very tasty and that's awesome

03:36.740 --> 03:40.660
description for recipe everyone likes descriptions like these.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.400
And don't switch just to heart and take a new recipe.

03:44.540 --> 03:45.170
And here we go.

03:45.170 --> 03:49.010
This is our form group as you can see on the value property.

03:49.010 --> 03:53.090
Our form is correctly created and stored and synchronized.

03:53.090 --> 03:59.740
These are the values I entered or when we look at difficulty chose in the dropdown.

03:59.750 --> 04:03.280
So this is working important first step.

04:03.290 --> 04:11.090
Now let's continue our work on this form on this page to also add the option of adding ingredients to

04:11.090 --> 04:12.040
this recipe.
