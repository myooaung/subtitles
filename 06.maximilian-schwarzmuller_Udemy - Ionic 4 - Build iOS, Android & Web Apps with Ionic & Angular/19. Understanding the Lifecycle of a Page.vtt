00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.980
As I always said we're going to dive a lot deeper into navigation on how to use this and different use

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.940
cases brought this course when we build real apps.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.340
That's the more fun way anyways.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.840
So we're almost at the end of this basic introduction to the navigation part which is key of course

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.390
because it's so important to understand how ironic to works.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.790
There's one thing I want to show you where I want to explain to you though and that is the life cycle

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.020
of a page a page and with a page I mean a component which we treat as a page because you load it from

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.420
the navigation stack by pushing and popping has certain methods which get executed by ionic too.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.250
And it's important to understand those methods only get executed when there's page so when this component

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.630
is loaded by pushing it or by popping to it the methods I'm talking about are the following ones.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.130
The first method executed when a page is loaded is the item you can enter Meffert.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.940
So if we add this method to your page Iyonix you will execute it.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.220
And this method serves as a navigation guard.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.210
It has to return true or false or a promise resolving to True or false which simply allows or denies

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.580
the access to the page.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.480
So you can use this to protect a page and to see if a user is allowed to visit this page.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.460
You will see this later in the course when we actually use of vindication.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.720
Let's say we are allowed to access a page the next Hooghly which is then read is the I view did load

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.410
method.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.810
This method is executed right after the page has been loaded.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.710
And it's important that this method will not be executed if the page was cached Ionic.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.650
You will cache your pages for example if you have a page and you click on a button which pushes a new

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.200
page the page you were on still is on the stack of pages and therefore it is cached.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.320
So if you then click on the back button on the next page and you are therefore taken to the page where

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.640
you were before.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.340
It will not be recreated.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.140
It will be taken from the cache.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.880
So I view that load will not be executed.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.310
Each time you see a page it will only be executed if the page is actually treated there after we reach

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.800
I-and you will enter.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.000
Now this is executed whenever a page is about to become active no matter if it's taken from the cache

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.350
or was newly created after we'll enter we reach.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.510
And you did enter as you might guess it is executed right after the page did become active.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.030
So once you are able to fully see this page.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.750
And just like I am you will enter all the fired and cached.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.350
Well if you want to navigate away we have to you can leave method which is kind of the opposite to do

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.760
can enter method.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.400
It all has a navigation Guard which decides if we are allowed to leave a page or not.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.030
So it also has to return true or false or a promise resolving to True or false.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.180
Granted that we are allowed to leave.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.150
We don't reach I and you will leave which is executed right before the page is about to become an active

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.620
and then we execute.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.910
I am viewed deadly offered a page became inactive.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.570
Well and if the page is destroyed and not cached then I in view will unload is executed.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.260
So this is a great place to run some code.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.350
You need to do with a Pages destroyed so to do some cleanup and things like that.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.640
Let's see this in action in the next lecture
