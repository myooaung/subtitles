00:02.620 --> 00:07.720
To create a new offer on the offers page in the toolbar, we need

00:07.720 --> 00:08.230
an icon

00:08.230 --> 00:11.380
or a button that actually let's us go to that new page.

00:11.390 --> 00:13.270
It actually is quite trivial,

00:13.270 --> 00:18.540
we can add another ion buttons group because any button you add to your toolbar should always be in

00:18.560 --> 00:20.030
such an ion buttons group  

00:20.290 --> 00:25.450
and here the slot will be primary and you can of course find out which slots exist in the official docs,

00:25.450 --> 00:29.380
primary typically is at the end of the toolbar. In there,

00:29.380 --> 00:34.870
I'll now add my ion button and in that ion button, I'll add my ion icon with a name of add

00:34.870 --> 00:41.020
and that will render a nice plus. I'll give that icon a slot of icon only, so that inside of this

00:41.020 --> 00:41.510
button,

00:41.560 --> 00:49.500
it's positioned perfectly to be the only icon in there. Now on the button, we want to go to our new page

00:49.800 --> 00:56.250
and if we have a quick look at the places-routing again, that would be under places tabs offers/

00:56.520 --> 01:00.800
new, this page here. So back in the offers page,

01:00.810 --> 01:10.420
we of course can simply add a router link now with a hardcoded value of places tabs offers new and

01:10.420 --> 01:11.730
that should already be all.

01:11.730 --> 01:19.040
If this page now reloads, we can press the plus button and here we are on the new offer

01:19.040 --> 01:31.740
page. Now on that new offer page, I'll adjust the title, new offer and to also have a back button, we can add

01:31.770 --> 01:45.170
ion buttons slot start and then the ion back button with a default ref of places tabs offers and

01:45.310 --> 01:51.250
now as this page reloads, we should see the new title, we see the back button and we can go back and forth

01:51.250 --> 01:51.760
here now.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.670
So this is now working as it should,

01:55.780 --> 01:58.390
how can we go to that edit page then?

01:58.390 --> 02:01.040
Well right now we have no direct way, later

02:01.060 --> 02:08.890
I'll add a way for us to slide these items so that we can then expose an edit button. For now

02:08.980 --> 02:14.260
we haven't learned how to slide these items yet, let's simply make sure that we can't go to the edit place

02:14.260 --> 02:17.580
from the offer detail page here.

02:17.650 --> 02:22.200
So on the offer bookings page is how we called it, there

02:22.240 --> 02:30.670
we can add another button with some margin and maybe a color of primary, of course you can also use other

02:30.790 --> 02:34.790
colors like secondary, tertiary, danger, warning, whatever you want.

02:34.990 --> 02:45.440
Color primary for me it is, I'll say add it here and I will simply add a router link and that will now be

02:45.440 --> 02:51.530
a bit tricky because that router link needs to be bound dynamically because I need that ID of the

02:51.530 --> 02:58.040
place I want to edit, right, in places-routing, I do pass that ID here as a dynamic segment and on

02:58.040 --> 03:05.290
the offered bookings page, we of course have that ID but currently I'm not extracting it.

03:05.330 --> 03:10.810
So let's extract it now so that we can then forward it to the edit offer page.
