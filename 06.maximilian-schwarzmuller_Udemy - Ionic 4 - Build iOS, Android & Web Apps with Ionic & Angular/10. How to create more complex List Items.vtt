00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.400
In the last year we created this basic list with a button inside of it.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.200
Now let's style it a bit nicer.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.990
The cool thing about an item directive be placed on the button which makes this a list item and makes

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.690
this look nice is that we can actually put a lot of content inside of this button instead of the button

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.670
element and will automatically align this nicely.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.820
For example we can use something we haven't seen yet.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.780
And I can this is another component ionic ships with and I and I can see probably what allows us to

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.010
easily add Ike into our page.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.470
The main thing we need to add here is the name property here we set up which I Can we want to use and

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.570
keep in mind the quotes I'm providing with de-code groups here already have.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.610
I can property and this island property is filled with.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.590
I can name I took from the ionic to I can library so we can use this name.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.550
So in the library template we can easily go to the Name property and use strange Laplacian here or alternatively

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.350
simply bind name why are property binding.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.800
And now add d I can name here and again it is already provided so we can simply x' quote group and then

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.930
access I can.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.660
This is the name of the property holding this name.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.480
With this we should see a nice icon so let's save this and let's have a look at our changed but now

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.120
looks better we have.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.300
I can well we have no text but we're going to work on this in a second.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.300
Let me go back to the editor and to actually display a text here.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.990
I'm going to add a heading let's say age 2.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.150
Of course you can choose a different font size and I'm going to use string interpolation to X's quote

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.440
group and output the category name category like this.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.860
I'm also going to add a paragraph to have some text the load heading and here I simply want to output

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:09.310
Worldgroup quotes and now the length to get the number of quotes in this quote group and behind that

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.920
I'm simply going to say quotes.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.620
So let's save this and let's have a look at the changed application looks OK.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.570
But what I don't like here is that the Eicken sits on top of this heading.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.460
And also I want to change the heading later on.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.180
So how can we start or how can we change the placing of the I can hear.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.370
I am Aikins this element here take more than just the name property.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.970
We can also add a property to tell the I can where it should align itself inside of an item.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.670
This is important.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.820
This is how I want it to work.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.120
In general a lot of the components work to Gaverick in some ways.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.350
And you can always learn more about this in the official documentation for your specific use case.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.570
This use case here is a pretty common one you have.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.230
I can inside of an item and keep in mind this button is simply kind of for an item.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.680
It is of course a button but with the item directive we rely on it to treat it as an item in my iron

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.820
list.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.110
Now since his partner has Dyster I an item directive enty I can as used inside of the Spartan we can

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.210
add the item left directive to the Iken and what this will tell the I can is position yourself on the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.800
left.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.610
If you're placed inside of an item element which is the case of course you could also say I end right

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.560
here to position on the left.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.440
So let me change this to my left and save to recompile this.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.370
Now if you go to the library you see the I can ask nicely aligned on the left you're on the right.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.920
We see the category name and we see the number of quotes in this category.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.480
The missing piece now is.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.380
I want to change the style of this category title.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.340
I didn't even do that.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.050
Indeed I showed you before but I think it would look nicer if you wouldn't have the lowercase versions

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.110
here but instead if you would turn this to uppercase now we can simply use a pipe here nothing on to

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.510
a specific and normal angler to pipe instead by adding the pipe symbol to the category title you're

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.870
simply using the uppercase pipe.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.420
This is a pipe angle or two ships with and this will simply turn the whole string into uppercase.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.130
So now if you have a look at this again we see that the titles are now uppercase icons on the left.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.960
This looks pretty good.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.260
I'd say we reached a good state of our app already in the next with you.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.940
I wanna see how we can actually click those elements click those items here and then go to the quotes

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.860
page which will give us all the quotes for the chosen category.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.860
Let's start working on this in the next video
