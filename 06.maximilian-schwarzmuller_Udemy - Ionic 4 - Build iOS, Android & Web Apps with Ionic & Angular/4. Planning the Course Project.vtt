00:02.320 --> 00:08.680
It's now time to change to our main course project because that will be a way bigger app that actually

00:08.680 --> 00:10.830
implements all the navigation concepts

00:10.840 --> 00:13.670
I want to show you and for later modules,

00:13.690 --> 00:20.440
it also allows me to add all these cool features like accessing the device camera and so on which I want

00:20.440 --> 00:21.730
to show you.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.410
So what are we going to build?

00:23.410 --> 00:25.990
Well you saw it in the first course module already,

00:26.290 --> 00:33.790
we're going to build that place booking app here, where people can offer their places and you can book

00:33.790 --> 00:36.660
other places, a little bit like AirBnB-like

00:36.700 --> 00:40.620
you could say. Therefore we'll have a couple of different pages,

00:40.660 --> 00:44.280
we definitely need a page where people can find places.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.670
Now what can we see on that page?

00:45.670 --> 00:52.780
We can see that we'll have a toolbar with a side menu and we'll also use tabs navigation here where

00:52.780 --> 00:58.300
one tab is obviously the tab for finding places. On the page,

00:58.300 --> 01:03.750
we then have let's say a featured place and then a list of all the other places you could rent

01:03.880 --> 01:09.760
and at the top, I want to have a toggle where you can basically toggle between all places which includes

01:09.760 --> 01:15.130
the ones you offered and bookable places which only includes the ones that are not offered you by

01:15.130 --> 01:17.560
you which are bookable indeed.

01:17.560 --> 01:24.370
Now this is one thing, when you tap on a place let's say place 2 here, we'll be taken to the place detail

01:24.370 --> 01:27.940
page which is now is still on the same stack of pages here,

01:28.090 --> 01:29.490
just pushed on top of it

01:29.500 --> 01:35.590
so to say and there we see the image and we can see title, maybe a short description, whatever we want

01:35.900 --> 01:41.680
and we'll have a button that allows us to book that place which will actually open a booking modal and

01:41.680 --> 01:48.430
a modal is basically an overlay not pushed on top of the page stack but instead simply a visual overlay

01:48.430 --> 01:53.110
on the current page and you'll learn how to open such a modal in this module as well.

01:54.450 --> 02:01.350
Then thereafter, we'll not just have the places area where we can view and book places, we'll also be

02:01.350 --> 02:04.710
able to offer places and that will be our other tab.

02:04.710 --> 02:10.110
So in the tab navigation at the bottom, one tab is for viewing places we can book or we want to book

02:10.200 --> 02:12.980
and the other tab is for offering our own places.

02:13.020 --> 02:18.980
There we'll also have that top bar where we can bring in the side drawer and we'll have an

02:18.990 --> 02:24.900
add new place I can which we can tap to get into the mode of adding a new place,

02:24.930 --> 02:28.710
more on that later. If we tap one of the places we offered here,

02:28.710 --> 02:30.270
we'll see the offer details,

02:30.330 --> 02:36.780
so again that is then pushed on top of that stack of pages where we can see who booked our places or we

02:36.780 --> 02:40.210
see basically the bookings for this place we offered.

02:40.210 --> 02:42.090
Now that's not all, on that offer page

02:42.090 --> 02:47.740
as I mentioned, we can press that plus button and that will take us to the new offer page. By the way,

02:47.820 --> 02:55.560
we'll also implement ways of editing existing offers, so existing places we're offering and when we're

02:55.560 --> 03:01.830
talking about bookings which we can go to from the side menu, there we'll have a link to go to the our

03:01.830 --> 03:07.870
bookings page where we now don't see the bookings of places we offered but bookings we made for other

03:07.870 --> 03:13.510
places. On that page, we'll also be able to swipe our bookings to remove them.

03:13.560 --> 03:18.840
And last but not least, we'll also have an authentication screen which is basically controlled with a

03:18.840 --> 03:24.240
guard whether we see that or the other screens which we see if we're not logged in, where we then have to login

03:24.240 --> 03:27.160
first to go to all the other pages.

03:27.180 --> 03:31.830
That is the rough setup, now we'll not add all the functionality in this module,

03:31.830 --> 03:38.280
otherwise this module will take like 15 hours or something like that. We'll add all these different pages

03:38.610 --> 03:44.550
and we'll add the navigation concepts to go around. The content on the pages will then be added 

03:44.550 --> 03:50.850
step-by-step with the other modules where we will learn things like fetching user input, accessing the device

03:50.850 --> 03:57.390
camera, loading data in different formats, working with a back-end server and so on.

03:57.390 --> 04:03.060
So let's now start with setting up the project and with actually creating our page structure and adding

04:03.060 --> 04:04.590
the different types of navigation.
