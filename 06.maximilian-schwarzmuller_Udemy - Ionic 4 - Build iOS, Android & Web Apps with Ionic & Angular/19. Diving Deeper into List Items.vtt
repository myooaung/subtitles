We already learned how to output a list with ion list.

00:06.640 --> 00:14.900
When we did so we actually added or we used button with an item on it.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.280
We can do this there's nothing wrong with this.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.240
No I want to show an alternative.

00:19.270 --> 00:26.080
I'll use the I an item component and number a component ionic to ships with which also allows us to

00:26.080 --> 00:33.310
create a nice item like style with a split over multiple rows and a separator in between the difference

00:33.310 --> 00:39.850
to the button with an item is that this will not display this arrow on the right which kind of indicates

00:39.850 --> 00:44.180
that we can tap on it and go to a separate or to a new page.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.080
So this is the item I'll use your tool to show an alternative.

00:49.150 --> 00:54.920
And of course I want to use it as an item component multiple times for all the favorite quotes I have.

00:55.150 --> 01:02.130
So let's place energy forward on it and loop through all the quotes so we can say it quote of quotes.

01:02.170 --> 01:08.080
Keep in mind quotes of course our array of favorite quotes so we'll looping through all of them and

01:08.080 --> 01:14.290
then side of this iron item component I could play Asya age two element of course you can choose number

01:14.290 --> 01:21.240
1 age 1 whatever style you want and in there I can simply say Well personally I'd put the offer of the

01:21.240 --> 01:27.980
squad or who made this quote and then a paragraph with the quote itself maybe so quote text.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.490
Let's have a look at this.

01:29.530 --> 01:35.230
Let's see how this looks like if we load her application of course we see nothing because we have no

01:35.230 --> 01:36.550
favorite quote.

01:36.700 --> 01:41.870
If we now add a quote to our favorites and go back to your you see this is our quote.

01:42.130 --> 01:47.590
Now what you also see is that if you pick a longer quote like this one first of all you see it works

01:47.590 --> 01:53.140
fine it shows the full array but you will see that this get cut off here and this is the default behavior

01:53.140 --> 01:54.410
of view on it too.

01:54.460 --> 01:58.170
There's only that much space and such an item.

01:58.270 --> 02:01.050
So it's normal that this gets cut off.

02:01.270 --> 02:08.140
That's no issue though because I want to have those items being able to click or clickable but I also

02:08.140 --> 02:14.090
want to make sure that they don't load a new page as we do here.

02:14.110 --> 02:16.090
So a page we can click back.

02:16.090 --> 02:20.060
Instead I want to show a modal so an overlay over the current page.

02:20.110 --> 02:24.790
Which is why I didn't use button with an item because I don't want to have this arrow indicating that

02:24.790 --> 02:26.830
we can go to a separate page.

02:26.890 --> 02:31.270
I just want to have this like a preview here where you can tap on to learn more.

02:31.570 --> 02:35.320
So with this we get the basic item.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.270
Now what's missing of course is the modal.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.500
We actually open when tapping this item.

02:40.510 --> 02:42.000
Let's work on this next
