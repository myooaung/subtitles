00:01.880 --> 00:07.370
Now that you had an introduction to what I wanted to is and the prerequisites off this course it's time

00:07.370 --> 00:08.490
to get started.

00:08.630 --> 00:15.640
And what better way to get started than to install on to create our first application for this.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.790
We will first need to install node.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.540
J.S. now no chases a server side language.

00:20.540 --> 00:26.500
And the word is we're not going to develop any server side application of course but we will need no

00:26.580 --> 00:28.270
yes for two reasons.

00:28.280 --> 00:35.450
The major reason is that we will use NPM notes package manager which is kind of the facto package management

00:35.450 --> 00:40.430
tool when we talk about front end development or app development here.

00:40.670 --> 00:47.300
So this will be a tool we use to install the dependencies are projects need for example English you

00:47.510 --> 00:49.860
in fact does will be done automatically for us.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.900
But still we will need this package installed and we will need no chess itself because the ionic framework

00:57.200 --> 01:03.260
or onic toolset we will use also ships with a little development server which allows us to preview our

01:03.260 --> 01:04.580
app in the browser.

01:04.580 --> 01:05.890
You will see this in a second.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.230
And for this it needs no chest to spin up.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.040
A simple development server.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.660
So make sure to download the latest version here.

01:12.660 --> 01:19.160
Seven point four in my case though 6.9 should also work but should be on the safe side by picking latest

01:19.160 --> 01:26.240
one simply downloaded walk for the installer and once installation finished you have no chance and installed

01:26.360 --> 01:28.970
and you are ready to continue with the next steps.

01:29.270 --> 01:32.130
The next step takes us to the command line or terminal.

01:32.180 --> 01:34.430
There we need to install ionic and Cordoba.

01:34.430 --> 01:40.850
This step has only to be executed once and you will need to do that to get the ionic CLID toolset which

01:40.850 --> 01:46.020
then allows you to create ionic projects Anzalone to install ionic in Cordova.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.770
We will use NPM so you can type NPM.

01:48.770 --> 01:51.400
This command is now available since you installed node.

01:51.420 --> 01:57.420
JS NPM install and then we need ionic and Cordoba.

01:57.440 --> 02:05.110
These two packages make sure to add the dash d flag at the end to get the glow or to install it globally.

02:05.110 --> 02:11.060
I should say so that you can execute the a command from anywhere on your machine and on Windows you

02:11.060 --> 02:16.550
can hit enter on Mac and Linux you probably need to add a pseudo in front of it to get the right permissions.

02:16.550 --> 02:21.850
After hitting enter you might be prompted to enter a password and thereafter the installation will begin.

02:22.010 --> 02:27.320
Now this can take a couple of minutes or at least quite some time and I'll be back once it finished

02:28.830 --> 02:30.950
so the installation finished on my machine.

02:30.990 --> 02:36.680
And with that we're ready to create our first I want it to project and therefore our first application.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.810
Make sure to navigate into a folder where you want to create the project.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.770
Here in my case I am already in such a folder.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.640
You can then run ironic.

02:45.650 --> 02:52.950
This command is now available since you globally install a onic Iyonix start will create a new project.

02:52.950 --> 02:55.480
Then you simply enter your project name.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.970
This can be first for example or whichever name you want to use.

03:00.030 --> 03:05.690
Now you could hit enter but that would give you an ironic one project we want to do today on to project

03:05.700 --> 03:07.580
using angle or 2 though.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.000
Therefore we need to add dash dash 2 as a flag.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.460
Now with this hit enter and this will create a new folder.

03:14.460 --> 03:21.750
The first app folder and it will create your first project initiate all the dependencies and so on and

03:21.750 --> 03:26.760
it will take a couple of seconds and thereafter we're ready to view our first reader application.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.800
See you in a second the project set up process finish your mission.

03:31.830 --> 03:34.920
And with that I can now navigate into this newly created folder.

03:34.980 --> 03:41.950
So the first app and then there you can now run Unix serve the surf command center and I recommend offered

03:41.970 --> 03:48.250
by the onic Seelye and it will compile your application to javascript as SNH team.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.920
Not to a native app yet.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.830
I will later show you how to do this.

03:52.080 --> 03:57.630
And then it will spin up a little development server running at the address you see here which will

03:57.660 --> 03:59.280
host your application.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.240
Sounds strange.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.730
Well more about that in a second.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.890
Let's view or at first.

04:03.930 --> 04:09.050
Here it is in this browser window here it automatically open this window if it doesn't do that for you.

04:09.050 --> 04:10.500
Navigate there manually.

04:10.650 --> 04:18.060
It shows our first ironic app and it was just a default start a project on X like creates We will later

04:18.060 --> 04:20.970
learn how to create empty projects.

04:20.970 --> 04:27.190
Now this certainly looks strange seeing mobile in quotation marks AB run in the browser.

04:27.270 --> 04:29.780
And keep in mind it is no mobile app yet.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.280
It's a javascript's Yes.

04:31.290 --> 04:35.420
SAGAL app we haven't compiled it to a native app yet.

04:35.460 --> 04:41.190
The great thing is this browser window this app running in the browser is a great place to test your

04:41.190 --> 04:44.520
application because it will watch your files.

04:44.520 --> 04:49.020
This process keeps running and will automatically recompile whenever you change something.

04:49.230 --> 04:54.540
And therefore you have a quick and easy way of seeing your application and testing your features.

04:54.540 --> 04:59.290
That being said you of course won't be able to test features like the device camera and so on.

04:59.370 --> 05:04.550
But again we will later learn how to test our native devices and how to ship it on native devices.

05:04.620 --> 05:11.010
But generally you typically use that browser app to develop the majority of your application because

05:11.010 --> 05:15.670
it's so fast so easy to debug and such a great tool for development.

05:15.690 --> 05:22.050
Now again it looks strange like this but in Chrome which I recommend using you can open up your developer

05:22.050 --> 05:30.690
tools and there you have this device mode here which you can toggle by clicking on this mobile phone

05:30.830 --> 05:32.900
iPad like I can here.

05:33.240 --> 05:39.530
This will switch to device mode and now it looks much more like an application running on the device.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.050
Here you can even choose which device you want to simulate.

05:43.050 --> 05:44.390
Make sure to reload the page.

05:44.400 --> 05:48.710
If you switch to the wise and then you see how the app will look like on the DeWyze.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.110
Now that being said it's not 100 percent correct emulation.

05:53.160 --> 05:58.470
It's still in the browser in the end but it gives you a pretty good feeling of how it will look and

05:58.470 --> 06:00.020
work like in the end.

06:00.480 --> 06:06.360
And it also switches between the US style and the material designed for Android.

06:06.360 --> 06:11.010
If you switch to the wise as you can see by the icons here at the bottom and to click effect when I

06:11.010 --> 06:11.860
click on it.

06:11.940 --> 06:18.640
So it is pretty powerful and it does more than just switch the stylus it really emulates a mobile phone

06:18.840 --> 06:21.540
as far as a browser can do that.

06:21.570 --> 06:26.190
So this will actually be the mode we will work in the majority of the course just because it's so easy

06:26.190 --> 06:27.980
to debug and to work with.

06:28.110 --> 06:31.060
And with that I'd say we got our first application.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.250
We got a couple of taps here.

06:33.270 --> 06:39.270
Now let's change something about this application to really get a feeling on how to work with ionic

06:39.290 --> 06:39.570
to
