00:02.130 --> 00:06.740
For the links in our menu or for the items here, I want to add links.

00:06.820 --> 00:09.730
Now how does this work? Just as it works anywhere else

00:09.730 --> 00:13.650
because sometimes it's hard to keep this in mind

00:13.660 --> 00:15.910
but we're still in an Angular app here,

00:15.910 --> 00:17.900
this is a normal Angular template,

00:17.950 --> 00:21.520
so of course you can use things like router link in here.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.420
And indeed we can,

00:22.420 --> 00:32.260
so we can add a router link here and go to places tabs discover for this first item and for this

00:32.290 --> 00:33.390
second item here,

00:33.400 --> 00:39.340
I can add a router link and go to bookings because if you have a look at your app routing module, we

00:39.340 --> 00:48.450
got that bookings route that loads the bookings module. And for logout, well there, I actually want to

00:48.450 --> 00:49.960
add a click listener

00:50.100 --> 00:51.470
and then do something else

00:51.470 --> 00:57.780
and there I want to trigger on logout and I will add an onLogout method to my component here therefore

00:59.420 --> 01:01.620
but I'll not do anything there, at the moment

01:01.620 --> 01:07.430
just have it there, we'll add login and so on later in the course.

01:07.430 --> 01:10.940
So now if we save that, we should have some links here in that menu, so

01:10.970 --> 01:17.260
let's wait for the application to reload and let's try going to the bookings page and it kind of works.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.210
Here it is

01:18.290 --> 01:24.770
but wouldn't it be nice if that menu closed after going there because right now, if I go somewhere, if

01:24.770 --> 01:30.890
I click something, it stays open and by the way for logout, you also see we got no animation when I play

01:30.890 --> 01:38.060
this, when I click this, reason for that is by default an ion item is not a button, the click will still be registered

01:38.090 --> 01:39.850
and will still execute on logout

01:39.860 --> 01:45.430
but to have that nice ripple animation, you should add button here as an attribute to ion item.

01:46.010 --> 01:50.680
But this is not related to the issue of the menu not closing, it will just fix that,

01:50.690 --> 01:54.300
when this page reloads, we now get a ripple effect here too.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.840
But what about closing the menu when we select an item? For that,

01:58.850 --> 02:00.260
we got two options,

02:00.260 --> 02:07.590
one option is we could add our own click listener, inject the menu controller and then manually call close,

02:07.640 --> 02:09.390
you learned how that would work.

02:09.650 --> 02:12.060
But to me, that sounds really cumbersome,

02:12.110 --> 02:13.700
there is a way easier way of doing that,

02:13.700 --> 02:21.860
there is a special component Ionic gives you. You can wrap your list items or anything in your app anywhere,

02:22.400 --> 02:26.370
that should close or should toggle to be precise

02:26.540 --> 02:35.540
the main menu with ion menu toggle. The difference to ion menu button is that this will now not render

02:36.350 --> 02:41.750
a hamburger and open the menu, instead it will render nothing but you can wrap it around anything that

02:41.750 --> 02:45.350
should toggle the menu, doesn't have to be inside of the menu by the way,

02:45.350 --> 02:48.590
you could have this anywhere in your application.

02:48.590 --> 02:53.960
Now of course, ion menu toggle also takes a menu attribute in case you're using an ID on your menu

02:53.990 --> 02:59.290
so that you can tell Ionic which menu you're trying to toggle, if you don't set an ID,

02:59.390 --> 03:07.760
it will use the main menu it detects and I will simply wrap ion menu toggle around all my list items here

03:08.210 --> 03:17.310
so that they all will close the menu when I press them,

03:17.350 --> 03:18.280
here I am.

03:18.340 --> 03:21.910
So now with ion menu toggle wrapped around all items,

03:21.910 --> 03:27.930
now as this reloads, the menu closes when I tap one of these icons.

03:27.960 --> 03:34.440
So let's now make sure we also fixed that bookings page here and add the menu icon there too, first

03:34.440 --> 03:37.240
of all I set the title to your bookings 

03:37.320 --> 03:45.700
and then here I'll add ion buttons with a slot of start and in there, add the ion menu button

03:45.810 --> 03:50.640
and now we will be able to open the menu from inside our bookings as well.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.320
So let's wait for this to finish,

03:52.420 --> 03:58.700
discover places, bookings, all working just fine.

03:58.710 --> 04:01.590
So this is now how we can add such a side menu,

04:01.650 --> 04:03.810
not too difficult as you can tell

04:03.840 --> 04:09.870
and really powerful with all these special components and with the menu controller that allow us to

04:09.870 --> 04:12.960
control the menu from anywhere on our page.
