00:02.160 --> 00:09.120
Thus far we create our library of quotes and we're able to click favorite there and add quotes to our

00:09.180 --> 00:11.070
quotes array.

00:11.070 --> 00:16.110
Right now we're also able to add multiple or at the same code multiple times do it because we don't

00:16.110 --> 00:18.420
really have a check here to avoid this.

00:18.420 --> 00:19.800
We'll work on this soon.

00:19.890 --> 00:25.810
But before doing this I want to output our favorite quotes here on the Favorites tab.

00:25.830 --> 00:28.010
So let's work on this component or this page.

00:28.020 --> 00:36.390
Next on the favorites page here our first clean up my class again my typescript class get rid of all

00:36.390 --> 00:38.330
the things I don't need as of now.

00:38.490 --> 00:42.710
And also clean up this comment in the generate a template.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.760
And now the goal of course is to get to quotes.

00:45.810 --> 00:52.800
So we do doesn't it have secret code obviously here all have quotes property which is of type quote

00:53.100 --> 00:55.910
to be imported from our quote interface.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.140
And of course it's not just one quote.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.270
It's an array of quotes.

01:00.450 --> 01:05.720
So these are these are the favorite quotes we have now in order to get them.

01:05.730 --> 01:14.820
We of course need our quote servers so let's injected our quotes servers like this for on quotes service

01:14.880 --> 01:20.700
or type quotes service of course make sure to also add this import at the top with the quote service

01:20.700 --> 01:21.660
injected.

01:21.780 --> 01:25.130
We need someplace to actually load our quotes.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.810
Our favorite quotes.

01:27.030 --> 01:29.330
And you could do this in the constructor.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.860
You could do it as an engine in it.

01:31.860 --> 01:38.250
You could do this and I interviewed did the load though again be aware that this will not be executed

01:38.250 --> 01:45.210
if the page was cached so you might maybe get into some situation where you're not seeing the latest

01:45.210 --> 01:46.190
state.

01:46.260 --> 01:49.480
So I'm view will entrail looks pretty good.

01:49.500 --> 01:55.870
This will always be executed even if the page was cached and will be executed right before it's displayed.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.470
So in IDE you will enter.

01:58.650 --> 02:05.790
I want to assign or I want to load my quotes assign them to the quotes property here and I do this for

02:05.790 --> 02:10.250
the quote service which of course has Haraszti get favorite quotes method.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.590
This is all this loads the array of favorite quotes.

02:13.590 --> 02:19.800
Keep in mind it loads a copy of the durations views slice your slice with no arguments.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.950
Just to bring this back to your attention.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.000
Simply copy the whole array and gives us back a copy of that array.

02:27.390 --> 02:32.750
So with that were loading the quotes were storing them in the quotes array.

02:32.910 --> 02:38.530
Now it would be nice to output them in the template in that template here.

02:38.580 --> 02:43.450
I want to first of all changed the title to favorite quotes.

02:43.770 --> 02:47.720
And next I went to output a list of items.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.370
Let's do this in the next video.
