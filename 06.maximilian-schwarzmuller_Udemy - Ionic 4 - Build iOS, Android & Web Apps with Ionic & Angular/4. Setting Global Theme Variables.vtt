Currently our application uses to default on a theme which uses a blue primary color.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.600
Now I want to use different colors.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.820
And how do we do that in our code.

00:13.820 --> 00:21.470
You will find that theme folder and there you find the variables SPSS file in here.

00:21.470 --> 00:26.600
These here these things with the two dashes at the beginning are CSA as variables.

00:26.780 --> 00:32.290
They have to start with two dashes at the beginning to separate them from normal CSA as rules.

00:32.540 --> 00:36.410
And these things here can be configure to your likings.

00:36.410 --> 00:43.730
Here we're storing a bunch of colors in hex format and RG B values but you can also set up C as as variables

00:43.970 --> 00:50.360
that store padding the size so something like pixel values or Rams so you can not just or colors but

00:50.360 --> 00:53.550
of course colors are a very prominent use case.

00:53.570 --> 00:59.810
Now here you see the nine colors ionic gives you to choose from and you can now find you in every single

00:59.810 --> 01:00.710
one.

01:00.710 --> 01:06.710
So for example if we go to the primary color which is the color we mostly use in this app thus far.

01:06.710 --> 01:09.590
Then here in V as code I can hover over that.

01:09.590 --> 01:14.700
To get this color picker and then here I want to choose a different color.

01:14.780 --> 01:24.400
So let's say I want to use something like like this color a rad reddish color.

01:24.400 --> 01:31.930
If I choose that and I only change that first variable here and I now save that the app will reload

01:33.100 --> 01:37.200
and it automatically uses this color you see here on the button already.

01:37.250 --> 01:44.060
And you also see it here in the Tap Bar in the segment that control on the hamburger I can here on this

01:44.060 --> 01:44.980
button.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.540
And that is the amazing thing.

01:46.550 --> 01:50.970
You get this change out of the blocks with only one change in your code.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.500
And that's the idea behind theming and these global rules.

01:54.650 --> 02:01.310
You set up your global variables here and Ionic consumes them automatically because it's still such

02:01.310 --> 02:08.120
that it uses these variables and therefore you can change your settings in no time and apply your own

02:08.120 --> 02:10.610
theme when it comes to coloring here.

02:10.610 --> 02:12.720
But you're not restricted to coloring.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.090
You can also set other things as well.

02:15.120 --> 02:22.910
And for Dad let's dive into these advanced theming guide here temporarily and let's have a look and

02:22.910 --> 02:26.280
scroll down to global there and application variables.

02:26.390 --> 02:31.940
And there you see you could also set I had fun family to set your general fun family in the application

02:32.540 --> 02:38.000
or iron margin to set the general margin that will be used for example when you're using the margin

02:38.000 --> 02:42.650
utility attribute but also the margin some components use as a default anyways.

02:42.710 --> 02:49.160
So for example here let's say we add iron so that there's iron padding sentenced to 10 rem which is

02:49.160 --> 02:50.930
an extremely large value.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.200
And then I have a look at the off page there.

02:53.240 --> 02:58.230
I'm using the padding attribute on iron content so therefore now as does reloads.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.330
You see we have the large padding here.

03:00.350 --> 03:06.590
Now obviously that is way too large but it shows you how easy it is for you to adjust this to your requirements

03:06.800 --> 03:09.790
and changed your overall padding on your application.

03:09.890 --> 03:15.110
Probably not to 10 rem if you want to have a nice application but still if you're fine tuning this to

03:15.110 --> 03:20.390
not use the default of 16 pixels but you want 14 pixels you can set it like this.

03:20.390 --> 03:25.220
No I'm happy with the default and hence I'll comment this out but nonetheless you can set it up just

03:25.220 --> 03:26.040
like that.
