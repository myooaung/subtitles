WEBVTT

00:02.010 --> 00:03.790
We already achieved a lot.

00:03.790 --> 00:10.650
There's not much missing one missing pieces that we're able to add the ingredients of a recipe to the

00:10.650 --> 00:12.260
recipe service.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.940
You can try this on your own.

00:13.950 --> 00:17.210
We already got everything we need to get our shopping list service.

00:17.220 --> 00:21.030
We got the method there to add multiple items at once.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.730
So that should be something you can use for this.

00:23.730 --> 00:28.320
I'll wait a couple of seconds to let you pause the video and then it will show you my approach in solving

00:28.320 --> 00:31.160
this so.

00:31.190 --> 00:34.990
Time to add multiple ingredients to our shopping list.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.730
I'll do this and your recipe page team will follow here.

00:37.730 --> 00:44.120
I got the on add ingredients Methot and well I'm not implementing as of now so let's change this and

00:44.120 --> 00:48.080
let's implemented here in on add ingredients.

00:48.080 --> 00:54.500
I want to access my shopping lists service so I need two injectors I'll add here to the constructor

00:54.530 --> 00:55.790
private as.

00:55.820 --> 01:01.190
Service would be a fitting name to inject the shopping list service here.

01:01.190 --> 01:05.930
Make sure you also add the import here to Spaf and wiste.

01:05.930 --> 01:09.550
With this adage you're in on add ingredients.

01:09.550 --> 01:16.960
I would simply call shopping the service add items and then I want to pass all ingredients off the currently

01:16.960 --> 01:21.290
loaded recipe and keep in mind ingredients year is an array of ingredients.

01:21.370 --> 01:22.910
Following my model here.

01:22.930 --> 01:27.860
So this is perfectly valid data to pass to this method and that's all.

01:27.880 --> 01:34.860
This should allow me to add a new or two add my ingredients to the service before showing this.

01:34.870 --> 01:37.570
Let's also hook up the but not here.

01:37.570 --> 01:44.230
Let's also hook up to you on THE LEAD recipe method to your so we'll add this to in the same component

01:44.290 --> 01:49.060
because we're on the same page though and this will use the recipe service.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.890
So let's make sure to check this to you.

01:51.890 --> 01:59.850
RESSA PS service of type recipes service.

01:59.990 --> 02:06.890
Also this import needs to be added of course and with this inject it in on the lead recipe.

02:06.890 --> 02:13.740
I can call this recipe service remove recipe and there I need the index.

02:13.770 --> 02:18.420
Well we're already storing this here right because we're getting this as an argument when this page

02:18.420 --> 02:22.030
is loaded so it can simply pass days to this method.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.890
Well with this in place we should be able to both add items to the shopping list and delete recipes.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.480
Let's see the in-action are running application all go there again.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.430
Add a new recipe.

02:35.430 --> 02:37.270
One you haven't seen before of course.

02:37.270 --> 02:39.460
Very tasty it is today.

02:39.810 --> 02:40.540
Abdus.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.080
And let's add two ingredients.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.730
French fries.

02:44.910 --> 02:48.690
And of course also the meat like this.

02:48.690 --> 02:54.360
Let's add it here and let me click the Add ingredients to shopping list button and if we now go to the

02:54.360 --> 02:55.470
shopping list.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.510
U.S. French fries and meat.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.600
Of course we can take them to remove them and this is the first part working.

03:02.790 --> 03:07.290
Now let's also delete the recipe and go back.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.150
It's gone.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.210
The missing piece of course is if we click delete.

03:11.310 --> 03:16.190
It would be nice if we would be navigated back automatically because we deleted it and it would be buried

03:16.190 --> 03:22.380
back to stay on this page because then we could still click the edit button and try to edit it a recipe

03:22.380 --> 03:24.450
which doesn't exist anymore.

03:24.660 --> 03:33.860
So definitely one extra thing to implement here is to call Neph controller and then the pop to root

03:33.920 --> 03:36.700
method to get back to the root page.

03:36.770 --> 03:44.190
And with this change in place now we can let this recompile one more time and add a new recipe.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.640
One more time.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.120
A very tasty Schnitzler is of course like this.

03:50.960 --> 03:56.540
Managing reliance adds some French fries here at this recipe.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.380
Click on it delete it and we're back.

03:59.390 --> 04:00.260
It's gone.

04:00.260 --> 04:04.220
We can create a new one but we can't edit the old one.

04:04.310 --> 04:10.810
That is our core functionality finished all the pages hooked up being able to create new recipes edit

04:10.820 --> 04:15.500
existing ones and also to manage our shopping list here.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.070
Awesome
