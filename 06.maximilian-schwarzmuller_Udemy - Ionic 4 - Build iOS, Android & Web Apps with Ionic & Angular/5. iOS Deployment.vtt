00:02.260 --> 00:05.020
We saw how we can deploy to Android.

00:05.050 --> 00:07.990
Now what about ISIS.

00:07.990 --> 00:15.340
Well first of all in your X code project you should make sure you have a provisioning profile here chosen.

00:15.340 --> 00:19.090
And now you also need an apple developer account where you pay for it.

00:19.090 --> 00:24.250
So you need a paid Apple Developer account because only paying Apple developers can publish apps to

00:24.250 --> 00:25.070
the App Store.

00:25.090 --> 00:26.740
That is how it is.

00:26.740 --> 00:32.230
So make sure to log into your Apple Developer account and get such a paid account.

00:32.230 --> 00:34.110
If you don't have one yet.

00:34.340 --> 00:41.740
Once you have this and you are locked in you can start setting everything up to deploy your app for

00:41.740 --> 00:42.600
that first of all.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.930
Go to certificates I.D. and profiles and there.

00:46.960 --> 00:57.600
Go to app I.D. and add a new app I.D. Now give it any description you want like pair BNP and assign

00:57.670 --> 01:03.790
an explicit app I.D. here which should simply be that app I.D. you are using here as a bundle identifier

01:03.790 --> 01:04.330
as well.

01:04.450 --> 01:11.590
So let's add that here check any extra services you might be using we are not using any of these services

01:11.590 --> 01:19.720
and click continue and register now with that app I.D. registered we completed the first step.

01:19.720 --> 01:28.080
The next step is that we create the app itself here on this apple back and you could say for that you

01:28.080 --> 01:34.920
need to go to the App Store connect section in your apple developer account go to app store connect

01:36.160 --> 01:42.570
and here on the top click on users and access and go to my apps there on my apps page click on that

01:42.580 --> 01:51.320
plus here to create a new app and there again select your name which is then also the name being used

01:51.410 --> 01:51.890
everywhere.

01:51.890 --> 01:56.080
Choose your platform which should be IOW your primary language.

01:56.090 --> 02:04.230
Which for me is English choose your identifier and it can take a few seconds before you see the one

02:04.230 --> 02:05.610
you just created.

02:05.610 --> 02:08.600
Here so we'll check back later

02:11.420 --> 02:15.070
if it's not there you were here for the first time as it was for me.

02:15.140 --> 02:19.850
So now I added everything here and selected my identifier here.

02:19.850 --> 02:25.610
You can gift is your own identifier that shows up on your payment statements and so on so you can add

02:25.610 --> 02:30.550
whatever you want here and then click Create once you're happy.

02:30.550 --> 02:34.170
This creates your own app here on App Store connect.

02:34.180 --> 02:41.320
And just as on the google play console here you can fill out everything that will be seen in the Apple

02:41.500 --> 02:42.300
App Store.

02:42.310 --> 02:45.240
So make sure to thoroughly fill this out.

02:45.250 --> 02:51.320
Now let's go back to X killer because it's here where we will deploy this app and here stop you are

02:51.340 --> 02:59.050
currently running app on the emulator then I'll choose generic IOW device as a target here in this dropdown

02:59.470 --> 03:03.590
and then go to product archive here.

03:03.610 --> 03:05.690
This will now bundle your app for deployment.

03:05.710 --> 03:10.050
Judy Apple App Store Wednesday's finishes.

03:10.180 --> 03:16.750
Is ex code organizer your should open up and there you see your archives.

03:16.750 --> 03:22.900
Now I created to here you probably only see one and then you can click distribute the app to upload

03:22.930 --> 03:28.720
that to the App Store and then finally release it there from inside app iTunes Connect.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.940
This is how you deploy your ISF.
