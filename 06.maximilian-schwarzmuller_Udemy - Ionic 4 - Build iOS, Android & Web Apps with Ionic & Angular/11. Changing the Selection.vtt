If we want to change our selection we can't do that at the moment because we remove that button.

00:08.750 --> 00:14.870
Well the solution of course is that we make the image clickable for dad at a roll of button there and

00:14.990 --> 00:17.380
I'll then add a click listener here.

00:17.420 --> 00:18.740
The role is not required.

00:18.740 --> 00:24.830
I just edit this for accessibility it's not required for the click to work and then I'll fire on pick

00:24.830 --> 00:25.700
location here.

00:25.730 --> 00:34.590
When that image is clicked let's give this a try and wait for that to reload let's select the location

00:34.920 --> 00:39.600
and let's say we're picking a nice place in Sydney

00:42.300 --> 00:43.490
somewhere.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.650
Here.

00:45.860 --> 00:46.400
There it is.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.050
Now if a tap does again I can override doesn't pick a different place.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.520
This doesn't look too bad.

00:52.520 --> 00:59.490
This gives us a nice way of opening our map and picking places there.
