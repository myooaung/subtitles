00:01.960 --> 00:05.080
The basics of all lists should now hopefully be set.

00:05.080 --> 00:10.440
It's also important to understand how you can place elements inside of your list items.

00:10.750 --> 00:16.830
Let's start with an item here but you could do the same for the button and let's say we also have a

00:16.880 --> 00:17.670
icon in there.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.970
So I and I can.

00:18.970 --> 00:19.980
Element.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.620
Now here let's use the star.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.710
I can again.

00:25.810 --> 00:29.860
And if we save it like this let's have a look at our finished element.

00:29.910 --> 00:31.340
It doesn't look too bad.

00:31.350 --> 00:34.670
And if that's the look you need there's no need to change anything.

00:35.040 --> 00:42.090
But sometimes you want to have that star really to be on the left of your list item and to not sit on

00:42.090 --> 00:51.440
the same line like this for that case you can go to the iron element and add item left.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.510
Now this is not only available on Aikins.

00:54.630 --> 01:00.660
This can be added to elements here generally to tell them where to sit in the eye an item.

01:00.720 --> 01:06.630
If we do this on the eye can you see now it's pushed to the left and it's no longer on top of this line

01:06.630 --> 01:07.190
here.

01:07.230 --> 01:12.810
It's also big bigger bigger bigger so that it's easier to see with that we're positioning it on the

01:12.810 --> 01:13.200
left.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.690
And of course we could also position it on the right like this.

01:17.820 --> 01:22.580
And there's not even a need to also change the position here in the flow.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.960
It will result in the same result.

01:26.130 --> 01:34.800
So item left and item right are important features important tools to determine where certain things

01:34.860 --> 01:36.290
should be positioned.

01:36.480 --> 01:46.090
We're talking about content in items going to move the iron in your back on top of the text here.

01:46.110 --> 01:51.160
It's also important to understand that we can have more than just normal text here.

01:51.330 --> 01:56.060
Let's add a paragraph where we say a moral item and let's see if that changes anything.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.000
Yes it does.

01:58.050 --> 02:01.140
Now it's styled well more gray ish.

02:01.140 --> 02:05.190
It has this paragraph style so it is just an alternative.

02:05.520 --> 02:13.230
And if you want to have that fat black text you typically would use heading tech for example age 1 the

02:13.230 --> 02:17.490
heading of the item for example like this.

02:17.490 --> 02:23.890
If you save this now you will see you automatically get a multi line item where you.

02:23.940 --> 02:30.180
I can hear it's nicely aligned vertically to the center of your item.

02:30.180 --> 02:33.930
So these are different tools you have and of course you can also use age 5.

02:33.930 --> 02:39.190
Take for example to make this a bit smaller but still have with black and not Drage like the paragraph.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.610
And with that you should be able to really structure the item the way you want to have it structured.

02:44.610 --> 02:50.580
Now I already pointed towards the documentation and you can learn more how to add an avatar for example

02:50.580 --> 02:56.490
with an avatar as a wrapper for a normal image here which allows you to get this nice look you see here

02:56.550 --> 02:57.650
on the right.

02:57.750 --> 02:58.960
Again noticed it here.

02:58.980 --> 03:04.000
Item left is used to position as an avatar item on the left.

03:04.020 --> 03:11.040
So these are different ways of structuring the content in your list and your list items and make sure

03:11.040 --> 03:16.050
to consult this documentation to learn more about features like avatars for example
