00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.320
So I'm again back in X code loaded by project they're connected my iPhone.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.080
I now click on the run button and this will install it on the iPhone.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.430
Now let's see it run there.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.440
This is the app now we're running on the iPhone.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.250
And I'll start by signing up a new user.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:29.000
So let me add the test free user with the test free at taske dot com.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.740
Email address and I'll enter a valid password here sign up sign you up.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.690
There we are.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.380
Looks good.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.410
Looks promising.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.860
Let's like out first and let's try that.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.620
Sign in with dead newly created user test free at test dot com.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.800
This also allows us to test something else in a second.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.140
Once I did hopefully entered the right password here if I now go to recipes and try to load recipes

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.670
here this shouldn't work right because we're now on a different user.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.010
Shall we.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.050
So we shouldn't see the recipes of the average user and indeed we don't.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.470
So let's now create a new recipe here.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.870
Again it's maybe getting boring but you know I don't have that many recipes.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.460
That's at Tastee Let's switch this to hard to mix it up let's add the ingredient it's all about testing

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.620
anyways right.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.200
So French fries like this let's add it here.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.880
And let's click.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.050
New recipe to have this recipe.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.510
And now I want to store it is it's I want to store this year by clicking on save.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.230
Please wait.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.940
Looks good.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.000
Looks good.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.900
Let's get rid of it here let's load it.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.540
Well awesome here it is.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.960
Now if I click on Add ingredients to shopping list here let's go to the shopping list.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.660
Clicked twice so you'll see both ingredients.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.330
Not too bad.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.480
Let's save them.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.660
Now let's try this after deleting them.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.230
Here we are.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.780
The data is back.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.990
This looks pretty good to me.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.540
We got a working application.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.790
We got a working authentication flow and were able to send our data to the server and retrieve it from

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.300
there.
