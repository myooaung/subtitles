00:02.380 --> 00:05.620
The loading controller is not everything,

00:05.620 --> 00:11.320
I also want to tweak the way we can book an event. Right now of course, we're not really doing booking

00:11.530 --> 00:17.140
but in the place detail page, at least we are opening that modal through the modal controller.

00:17.140 --> 00:21.400
Now that's nice, it's another controller, we're in controller mood here anyways

00:21.640 --> 00:27.250
but the modal controller is not the only thing I want to show in this component here.

00:27.310 --> 00:35.860
Instead I want to introduce the actionsheet controller, an actionsheet is basically a set of options

00:35.890 --> 00:42.350
that slides up from the bottom of the page. To use it in the place detail page,

00:42.350 --> 00:50.030
I'll inject my actionsheet controller which is of type actionsheet controller and unsurprisingly, the

00:50.120 --> 00:59.030
actionsheet controller here is imported from @ionic/angular up here and with the actionsheet controller

00:59.290 --> 00:59.840
injected,

00:59.930 --> 01:07.580
I want to open my actionsheet when onBookPlace is triggered, so when this book place button here is pressed

01:07.670 --> 01:13.900
on the place detail page. So I'll not open the modal right away, instead I'll use the actionsheet controller

01:13.900 --> 01:16.620
and create a new actionsheet.

01:16.690 --> 01:20.080
Now on that actionsheet, you can set a bunch of options,

01:20.200 --> 01:26.470
for example a header which will be choose an action and you can of course choose any header you want

01:27.130 --> 01:33.160
and then it's mostly about the buttons you add. You add multiple buttons here and every button can be

01:33.160 --> 01:36.660
a Javascript object where you can configure it in detail,

01:36.670 --> 01:46.210
for example you can set its text and I want to make my places bookable by letting the users select

01:46.210 --> 01:53.980
their own dates inside of the modal which will open up or by giving them a randomly generated timespan,

01:53.980 --> 01:59.380
so with some starting and ending date which is randomly generated. And therefore one option here will

01:59.380 --> 02:03.250
be select date and the other button,

02:03.250 --> 02:10.020
so the second button I'll add here will have a text of a random date. Now last but not least, I also want

02:10.020 --> 02:16.390
to have a cancel button in case I pressed that book button accidentally or I simply want to cancel,

02:16.410 --> 02:19.110
so here the text will be cancel.

02:19.170 --> 02:25.620
Now of course right now we would have three buttons and these buttons wouldn't do much and therefore

02:25.680 --> 02:28.180
you can for one assign a role,

02:28.200 --> 02:36.000
for example here on the cancel button, you can set role and now role can be set to cancel or destructive. 

02:36.540 --> 02:42.720
Now destructive will basically color the button red and you should use that option on options where you

02:42.720 --> 02:48.570
will delete something and you'll have to write the logic for deleting it on your own and I'll show you

02:48.780 --> 02:55.310
how to attach your own logic to a button in a second but basically this colors the button red. Now cancelling

02:55.320 --> 03:01.410
on the other hand, so role cancel will not color it red but this will always be the bottommost button

03:01.410 --> 03:07.380
which makes sense because once you see the actionsheet, you will have seen that in other apps too and

03:07.380 --> 03:12.330
it makes sense that the bottommost button which is the easiest one to reach with your fingers is the

03:12.330 --> 03:18.340
one that allows you to cancel this operation. If you assign no role, it'll be a regular button in your

03:18.340 --> 03:26.590
set of options and then, you can add a handler method which defines which code should run

03:26.700 --> 03:32.720
once this gets pressed and here I'll assign anonymous functions in both cases.

03:32.970 --> 03:39.390
Now in both cases, I actually want to open my modal through the modal controller. So therefore, I'll add

03:39.420 --> 03:54.460
a new method here, openBookingModal and add a mode here which is let's say either select or random, so

03:54.460 --> 03:56.420
this is just a Typescript,

03:56.650 --> 03:57.960
should be a pipe symbol,

03:57.980 --> 04:03.730
this is just a Typescript type assignment which means mode has to be a string but not any string,

04:03.730 --> 04:12.130
it has to be exactly select or random. So I'm accepting two values for the mode string here and then here,

04:12.140 --> 04:20.320
I'll simply console log mode and I then want to call this code here that uses the modal controller and

04:20.320 --> 04:24.250
later we'll add logic to pass that mode into the modal,

04:24.250 --> 04:26.190
obviously you already learned how it works

04:26.200 --> 04:30.910
so feel free to do it right now already but we'll use that information in the modal later,

04:30.910 --> 04:36.430
for now I'll just log the mode here and open my modal. Now here in the handler,

04:36.430 --> 04:47.610
I can call this openBookingModal and here I'll pass select and for the other function here, I'll pass

04:47.820 --> 04:54.470
random. So in both cases, I open the modal but I pass select or random based on which option was chosen

04:54.470 --> 04:56.000
in the actionsheet.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.910
Now as with all these controllers, calling create alone creates the element but doesn't show it,

05:01.910 --> 05:08.450
so this also gives us a promise where in the function that is called inside of the then block, we get

05:08.510 --> 05:17.420
our actionsheet element and on this actionsheet element, we can now call present to open it.

05:17.420 --> 05:22.680
And now with all of that, let's have a look at the result and let's see what this gives us.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.190
So let me login here,

05:24.440 --> 05:27.970
wait for this and go to a place and click book

05:28.160 --> 05:32.000
and this is the actionsheet on Android, cancelling closes it

05:32.260 --> 05:35.340
and if I choose select date, the modal opens

05:35.390 --> 05:38.030
and here you see select being output

05:38.030 --> 05:42.750
and if I choose random date, the modal opens too

05:42.770 --> 05:45.590
but here you saw random being output.

05:45.590 --> 05:49.790
Now let me show you the same on an iPhone because there, the actionsheet

05:49.790 --> 05:51.300
simply looks different,

05:51.500 --> 05:59.290
reload, login and then here go to the booking page,

05:59.290 --> 06:05.880
click book and it's a little bit cut off here at the bottom since it's too big.

06:05.900 --> 06:06.770
Now we can see it,

06:06.770 --> 06:08.210
so let's click book.

06:08.210 --> 06:15.230
Here is the actionsheet, I can cancel and I can also select the date, open the modal or choose a random

06:15.230 --> 06:15.780
date,

06:15.800 --> 06:20.000
open the modal and you see the different outputs here on the right.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.680
So this is the actionsheet,

06:21.680 --> 06:23.270
also very useful

06:23.270 --> 06:29.720
and of course there are some other controllers like toasts and so on and you should simply check the official

06:29.720 --> 06:36.650
docs to learn about all components you have including all these controllers and whenever you see something

06:36.650 --> 06:41.220
with controller, you know in an Ionic Angular app, you can inject it,

06:41.270 --> 06:46.730
you can create it with the create method, you learned all about it here in the official docs and you can

06:46.730 --> 06:48.380
then show it in your app.
