00:02.260 --> 00:06.770
In the last lecture we made sure that we fetched the quotes that we have to state a source.

00:06.810 --> 00:13.780
Now I want to work on the library template to actually output a list of the quotes I'll start titled

00:13.800 --> 00:14.390
though.

00:14.460 --> 00:19.800
All I want to change here is I want to set a few codes library to be a bit more descriptive of what

00:19.800 --> 00:21.530
this page really does.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.000
I am content with the padding directive is fine.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.280
I want to have some spacing at the edges and then I'm going to Erda h free heading your way I say.

00:31.280 --> 00:34.190
Select your favorite quote.

00:34.430 --> 00:41.770
And actually we can add the text center directive here to center that text.

00:41.780 --> 00:49.520
I think that looks nicer below that I'm going to add a new component and does d i n list component.

00:49.790 --> 00:52.720
Now i n last second point we haven't seen yet.

00:52.850 --> 00:56.180
And as you might guess is allows us to create lists.

00:56.180 --> 00:57.860
Now here's an important thing.

00:58.040 --> 01:03.860
It does not mean that you always have to use either list when outputting a list of items.

01:04.010 --> 01:10.460
So you could think that I-List has to be used if you are using energy for on some element right that

01:10.460 --> 01:12.450
you have to wrap this with iron list.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.840
And this is not the case.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.860
And list is simply a component.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.370
You can use to style certain things nicer in a list like view.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.940
Let's see that in the official documentation here.

01:26.960 --> 01:33.280
If we go back from the API docs to the components docs and we have a look at lists you will be able

01:33.280 --> 01:39.560
to see that there are loads of different ways of styling lists in ionic too.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.450
And you can of course go through all of them to really find the list which fits your needs.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.800
You can combine it with a lot of other components.

01:46.810 --> 01:49.990
And we're going to see a couple of ways for this course.

01:49.990 --> 01:55.510
Now the traditional use search is to use ion list with a Buckland's side of it.

01:55.510 --> 01:58.200
This button will then have the entry for directive on it.

01:58.210 --> 02:03.590
As you probably want to have multiple list items and you can simply handle the click on the button.

02:03.700 --> 02:04.570
Important.

02:04.690 --> 02:09.320
The button needs to have as I an item directive on it does this need it.

02:09.340 --> 02:15.790
Because it is connection of having a wrapping iron list element and then the iron item element inside

02:15.790 --> 02:21.610
of it will lead to this style you see on the right here which you might recognize from a mobile app

02:21.610 --> 02:22.830
on your phone.

02:22.840 --> 02:27.880
So what this gives you I and list gives you is structure of having several rows.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.250
This nice separated between rows.

02:30.370 --> 02:35.180
And since you use a button with an item you get this nice arrow on the right here.

02:35.260 --> 02:38.600
This is all idlest in conjunction with button does.

02:38.890 --> 02:46.660
As an alternative to a button with an item you can also use the iron list with an iron item inside of

02:46.660 --> 02:46.860
it.

02:46.870 --> 02:48.890
But I'll come back to this later.

02:49.150 --> 02:55.450
So let's start with I'll list with a button inside of it because instead we want to have a list with

02:55.450 --> 03:02.290
clickable elements you would use an item instead of button if you will want to have a non clickable.

03:02.290 --> 03:08.500
Which of course also sometimes is the case you probably will have clickable list items more often though

03:09.040 --> 03:10.470
as I just explained to you.

03:10.510 --> 03:16.060
You need to place an item on the button to make it look nice and actually let them displayed how it

03:16.270 --> 03:22.060
looks with out an item first that you see the friends and I want to repeat that but of course.

03:22.090 --> 03:28.650
So I'll use as you for to loop through all the quote categories in my code collection here.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.890
So I will simply say a lot and I'm going to name it code group.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.180
You could also name it category whatever you want of quote collection.

03:37.180 --> 03:41.030
So all this property just initialized with the data from the code start.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.170
TS file.

03:43.180 --> 03:47.590
And this will replicate the bottom inside of this button.

03:47.650 --> 03:56.230
I want to start simple by simply saying quote let me save this to show you how this will look like we're

03:56.230 --> 03:58.350
going to fine tune this in a second.

03:59.310 --> 04:06.400
If we do it like this and we go to the library this looks relatively ugly because this is the non stop

04:06.440 --> 04:07.030
button.

04:07.110 --> 04:12.000
Notice that we don't use either button on it so it doesn't have this nice button look.

04:12.090 --> 04:15.170
It's pretty actually and it's not across multiple rows.

04:15.270 --> 04:17.910
Instead it sits directly next to each other.

04:17.910 --> 04:22.940
So I and list alone does not create multiple rows and so on.

04:22.950 --> 04:28.010
See how this changes once you add an item this directive to the button.

04:28.320 --> 04:36.060
If I do that and now I save this and I go back to the library you see it looks much nicer out of the

04:36.060 --> 04:36.800
box.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.170
This now looks great.

04:38.250 --> 04:42.960
We have separators in between and that split up over multiple lines.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.410
How does this look if we remove iron list.

04:45.570 --> 04:47.430
Let's also take a look at this.

04:47.580 --> 04:54.570
If remove the iron list directive and have a look at it you see it still looks OK but it's indented

04:54.570 --> 04:55.570
a bit differently.

04:55.590 --> 04:58.830
And the list doesn't start with a separate above it.

04:59.040 --> 05:05.650
So let's go back to idlest and placed a button inside of it again.

05:06.690 --> 05:11.910
To really have to separate that space for our list and reloaded one more time.

05:11.930 --> 05:16.970
And here we are back to it and now you see if you have to start in and separator on your list.

05:17.330 --> 05:22.410
So this looks pretty decent of course clicking the buttons doesn't do anything but it already placed

05:22.410 --> 05:25.810
this nice animation and shows just nice effect.

05:25.970 --> 05:26.990
That's next.

05:26.990 --> 05:35.390
Also filthies Aikins horridus these buttons with more life to have more than just quote here.

05:35.570 --> 05:39.710
Remember we instead wanted to have the following.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.860
We wanted to have a list with the Iken next to it.

05:42.860 --> 05:48.690
Then the category has a heading and then there's a preview of how many quotes we have inside of that.

05:48.770 --> 05:52.400
So let's work on days style of the individual list items.

05:52.410 --> 05:52.850
Next
