00:02.240 --> 00:08.960
So in this module, I walked you through Capacitor and I explained how you can use Capacitor to get a

00:08.960 --> 00:16.250
real native app that holds your Ionic app, for both Android and iOS. You saw how you can easily

00:16.460 --> 00:23.360
build your app for Android and iOS and run it on emulators or real devices through Android Studio

00:23.390 --> 00:24.770
or Xcode.

00:24.770 --> 00:30.980
You also saw that live reload mechanism and I did mention that I will stick to the web app for now because

00:30.980 --> 00:34.370
it's a bit faster and easier to debug. Nonetheless

00:34.370 --> 00:36.600
now we know how to build a web app,

00:36.620 --> 00:44.180
we know how to build our native apps and that already allows us to build apps for free platforms with

00:44.180 --> 00:46.140
one and the same codebase

00:46.140 --> 00:48.500
and that is just amazing.

00:48.530 --> 00:55.550
Now let's continue with Ionic now and with developing Ionic apps because now we know how to turn them

00:55.550 --> 00:57.260
into what we want them to be.

00:57.260 --> 01:00.860
Well now we can focus on the logic inside the app again.
