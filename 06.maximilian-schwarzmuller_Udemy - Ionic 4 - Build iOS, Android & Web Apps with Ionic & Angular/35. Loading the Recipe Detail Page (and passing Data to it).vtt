00:02.040 --> 00:05.390
Now fetching the recipe is something you should be able to do.

00:05.400 --> 00:11.640
Keep in mind we're passing it or we may pass it here in onload recipe.

00:11.730 --> 00:14.290
If we click this button here.

00:14.550 --> 00:20.010
So you need to hook up this method and somehow pass the recipe which was selected here.

00:20.010 --> 00:24.180
And make sure that you then extract the data in the recipe detail page.

00:24.210 --> 00:25.850
So two steps to do here.

00:25.890 --> 00:29.970
I believe you can do this in a couple of seconds which gives you time to pause.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.860
I will do this together with you.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.280
So what are you able to do this.

00:36.420 --> 00:40.280
Let's start in the recipes page here and on load recipe.

00:40.350 --> 00:45.650
I want to load the recipe detail page so the single recipe page here for this.

00:45.690 --> 00:49.630
I of course need the nav controller which we already have and check that here.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.720
So hirable use it to push a new page.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.450
And this will be my recipe page.

00:56.460 --> 00:57.150
This one here.

00:57.210 --> 01:02.530
Make sure to add to import of the recipes page or two.

01:02.580 --> 01:09.390
Now this loads the recipe or loads the page but we also need to pass the recipe we selected.

01:09.390 --> 01:13.960
Remember we're replicating this pattern does item here with Engy for.

01:14.250 --> 01:22.860
So I want to pass the recipe as an argument and actually I do also need the index because keep in mind

01:22.890 --> 01:31.100
in the recipes serve as the update recipe method expects to get the index of the recipe to update.

01:31.140 --> 01:33.820
Therefore we definitely need to pass this.

01:33.870 --> 01:38.390
I wise we won't be able to find out which index the recipe has We're editing.

01:38.630 --> 01:44.940
So in my recipes each time I'll file and template of the recipes to onload recipe.

01:44.940 --> 01:48.960
I will pass both the recipe and the index of this recipe.

01:49.020 --> 01:53.520
I'm extracting both in the entry for loop and the typescript file.

01:53.520 --> 02:00.990
I therefore know that I will get the recipe itself which is of type recipe of course and the index which

02:00.990 --> 02:06.760
is a number and I can then simply pass this as arguments when pushing.

02:06.960 --> 02:12.480
So here a little pass passive javascript object because you can pass multiple arguments divided with

02:12.480 --> 02:13.400
a comma here.

02:13.410 --> 02:16.060
That would be a different argument for the push method.

02:16.230 --> 02:20.360
Instead if you want to push more arguments you wrap them in an object.

02:20.490 --> 02:27.710
And here I will pass my recipe which of course holds de-value I pass with this recipe argument and it

02:27.720 --> 02:34.100
will have a property named index which holds the value passed and the index argument like this.

02:34.250 --> 02:41.220
With that I'm passing the data to this recipe page and in the recipe page we can now retrieve it with

02:41.220 --> 02:42.580
Neph parens.

02:42.660 --> 02:49.170
So let me get rid of this year and it will actually keep the injected Neph control and parents for now

02:49.200 --> 02:50.490
since I need both.

02:51.060 --> 02:53.250
And then I want to retrieve the data.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.380
Now I could use I-and you will enter again.

02:55.380 --> 03:00.330
That of course would also mean that I have to place a question mark ifort after recipe because the template

03:00.330 --> 03:05.370
would get rendered before the data is there because I and you will enter will be executed there after

03:05.380 --> 03:05.750
often.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.360
That's important to keep in mind.

03:07.650 --> 03:14.940
Therefore I will use good old on inat again which will be executed before the template is rendered.

03:14.940 --> 03:21.520
Make sure to also imported from an angler court in Engy on in it.

03:21.550 --> 03:27.130
I will then simply retrieve my data and I need this recipe property.

03:27.130 --> 03:30.960
That's the property I'm using Froud my template.

03:31.240 --> 03:37.650
So here and here I'm referencing it all the time it's uninitialized at the beginning.

03:37.660 --> 03:45.310
So in on in it I will set the recipe equal to naff parens and then get a recipe.

03:45.310 --> 03:51.310
Remember I passed two properties to the object that pass your do to have two properties to the object.

03:51.310 --> 03:53.320
I passed your recipe and index.

03:53.320 --> 04:01.430
Now I'm getting recipe so I'm getting the recipe here and I also want to store the index.

04:01.510 --> 04:05.950
Does this number so I can also Agonum set this right away.

04:05.950 --> 04:11.820
Index is Nav. parens get indexed as the second property passed.

04:12.070 --> 04:14.290
So if that i'm retrieving all the data.

04:14.290 --> 04:16.690
Now this should also allow me to see it on the page.

04:16.690 --> 04:23.140
So if we save this now we should be able to navigate to the detail of a recipe and see our detail page

04:23.170 --> 04:25.080
being populated with the data.

04:25.330 --> 04:33.130
Let's quickly add a new recipe your well-known schnitzel here I'm going to add some french fries so

04:33.130 --> 04:36.310
that we can see if this list is output correctly.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.380
Let's actually add a second ingredient to really have a list.

04:39.490 --> 04:42.870
So maybe the meat itself.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.060
Now let's take a new recipe.

04:44.060 --> 04:44.710
Here we are.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.080
Click on it looks good to me.

04:47.110 --> 04:49.860
We got our title difficulty.

04:49.900 --> 04:56.070
The description here then we got a list of items we get to add ingredients to shopping list button and

04:56.060 --> 05:02.140
then we also have is two bodies two buttons here at the bottom.

05:02.140 --> 05:10.130
Now a couple of things I will fix though I want to center the title and the difficulty and description

05:10.210 --> 05:17.920
and this button so quickly go back to that template here and to centredness all I will simply add text

05:17.920 --> 05:25.930
center to the column containing the title and difficulty soda's text center helper directive I to officers

05:26.350 --> 05:36.390
text center do the same forward at description text center and forwarders button here add ingredients

05:36.390 --> 05:37.950
to shopping list.

05:37.950 --> 05:50.390
I will also say text text center like this and if we now Wakely shareit is out like it is now it looks

05:50.390 --> 05:56.400
like I wanted to look however genius as I am I forgot to add some ingredients.

05:56.510 --> 05:58.420
So let's quickly do this.

05:59.530 --> 06:05.770
Add ingredient spaghetti like this now and you recipe.

06:05.780 --> 06:06.950
Let's have a look.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.250
This looks pretty good now.

06:08.270 --> 06:09.710
Looks the way I wanted to look.

06:09.860 --> 06:16.400
Now with dad out of the way we can continue working on this and make this added recipe Buttman works

06:16.400 --> 06:20.750
so that we actually are loading the ad in the recipe page again.

06:20.750 --> 06:25.630
But now with well a real recipe we can add it so in added mode.

06:25.630 --> 06:28.800
Now go ahead and try it on your own if you want.

06:28.850 --> 06:32.580
In a couple of seconds or in the next lecture we will do this to.
