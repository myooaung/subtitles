00:02.310 --> 00:08.470
Now when I went to output a modal upon clicking that of course you already have a map modal so that

00:08.460 --> 00:10.080
is stored in a shared module.

00:10.150 --> 00:16.630
So in the place detailed module let's simply import the shared module now and this unlocks that map

00:16.660 --> 00:24.400
modal component knowing the place detailed page H H2 mail file when we click that image and therefore

00:24.400 --> 00:32.740
again I will add a roll of button here if we click that image I want to open that modal so I call a

00:32.740 --> 00:37.260
method here on show full map whatever you want to call it.

00:37.680 --> 00:45.790
Let's add this method to the place detail page typescript file here like this and then there we now

00:45.790 --> 00:47.020
want to open a modal.

00:47.260 --> 00:52.750
Good thing is we already injected the modal controller so we can just use it and create a new modal

00:52.750 --> 00:56.110
here and add the component we want to use is the

00:58.690 --> 01:03.490
map modal component which you then also need to import into this file here.

01:09.460 --> 01:09.970
Like that

01:13.150 --> 01:23.830
and then we get our modal element here which we can use to present the modal if we do that.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.510
This should reload and if I now tap this indeed that opens.

01:27.520 --> 01:34.330
But the problem is it's not centered on the location we picked and we can even click somewhere and this

01:34.330 --> 01:38.200
doesn't do any harm but it's not the behavior I want.

01:38.200 --> 01:42.070
Instead this modal should open and center on the pick location.

01:42.070 --> 01:45.970
Put a marker there and clicking shouldn't do anything.

01:45.970 --> 01:49.880
So we'll have to add some logic to the map modal to make this happen.

01:50.760 --> 01:59.530
In the map modal component here I want to add some properties which are buyable from outside.

01:59.530 --> 02:06.160
For example the center right now we always start at this center which is a nice default maybe but which

02:06.160 --> 02:10.100
should not be our center we pick in all cases.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.760
So let me set this as a default here but all this will make center findable by adding at input in front

02:15.760 --> 02:19.500
of it which has to be imported from at Angola court.

02:19.720 --> 02:25.010
Now at input make sure we can set that center from outside.

02:25.040 --> 02:30.980
I also will add another findable property which is named selectable and this is true by default.

02:30.980 --> 02:36.380
This means can we actually select a new place or not and we can use this later to determine whether

02:36.380 --> 02:38.480
we want to have that click listener or not.

02:41.300 --> 02:49.280
I'll also add another findable property which is my close button text because that should just be close.

02:49.280 --> 02:54.090
If we're viewing the map and only you can pick something cancel makes sense.

02:54.140 --> 02:59.660
So cancel is my default but I want to be able to overwrite this and I'll add another findable property

02:59.660 --> 03:02.180
with just a title showing a toolbar.

03:02.180 --> 03:08.630
The default is pick up place or pick location but of course this doesn't make sense if we open the model

03:08.630 --> 03:10.880
to show the picked location.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.130
So we should be able to overwrite this as well.

03:13.250 --> 03:18.290
So having all these defaults is great so that we don't have to parse all the data whenever we open that

03:18.290 --> 03:18.770
model.

03:18.830 --> 03:21.870
But if we want to change something we can do that.

03:22.070 --> 03:24.360
Now let's adjust our logic a little bit.

03:24.470 --> 03:29.330
For example only if it is selectable we need to add that click listener.

03:29.330 --> 03:35.390
So here where I set up this listener I only want to do this if this selectable is true.

03:35.390 --> 03:39.350
Otherwise there is no reason to make this clickable.

03:39.470 --> 03:46.310
That of course means that in energy on destroy I should check if this click listener is set cause it

03:46.310 --> 03:47.240
will not be set.

03:47.240 --> 03:53.660
If we're just viewing this in preview mode so to say and therefore we can only remove it if click listener

03:53.660 --> 03:59.300
is set and we should check for that on cancel well that still is a thing we should still have that around

03:59.840 --> 04:06.710
and now we can use the new center we added here instead of that default center we used all the time.

04:06.740 --> 04:14.580
So this should be this center and we want to have some logic to add a marker so add another check here.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.330
We're actually here as Al's case.

04:16.340 --> 04:19.450
If this is selectable we add a click listener and no marker.

04:19.580 --> 04:23.400
If it is not selectable we add no click listener but a marker.

04:23.870 --> 04:33.110
So here I'll create a new marker by calling new Google Maps dot marker and now we configure that marker

04:33.110 --> 04:36.860
here with a javascript object we passed to the constructor.

04:36.860 --> 04:42.720
It needs a position and this should be the center because we want to put that marker on the pick location.

04:42.800 --> 04:49.370
It needs a map object and that will be the map we're building there we're creating here so I'll pass

04:49.370 --> 04:56.450
this map here as a second property so the property name is map and the value is also map and then we

04:56.450 --> 04:58.910
can use the shortcut here of just writing map.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.350
But maybe this is clearer.

05:00.350 --> 05:02.770
So let's go with that syntax.

05:03.530 --> 05:08.870
And last but not least a Title 14 marker could be picked location whatever you want.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.910
Now the marketers create it.

05:11.940 --> 05:17.790
You did not just have to call markers set map and pass the map object to which it should be added which

05:17.790 --> 05:19.490
is our map here.

05:21.870 --> 05:23.270
So that should add a marker.

05:23.310 --> 05:29.460
If we opened as a non selectable mode the last remaining thing is that we need to make sure to set all

05:29.460 --> 05:33.360
that data when we do open the map in non selectable mode.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.380
So basically when we want to open it from the place detail page.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.900
So let's head over to the place detail page here.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.590
And when we create the model here we can set the component props.

05:43.800 --> 05:48.500
And that is an object where we can now bind all these properties we just set up here.

05:48.540 --> 05:55.110
So center selectable close button text and title center here should be our

05:57.820 --> 06:00.550
place and there to location.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.850
And there we have latitude and longitude.

06:02.890 --> 06:09.640
So we want to pass on an object here that just is our default here has a lat and long key but combined

06:09.640 --> 06:15.970
in one object let's pass an object with a lap key where we set this location let along key where we

06:15.970 --> 06:19.070
set this place location LNG.

06:19.090 --> 06:27.810
That is our center therefore now besides the center we of course all the one to set selectable to fault

06:27.830 --> 06:30.250
here because this now is not selectable.

06:30.480 --> 06:37.730
We'll set the close button text here to just close let's say instead of cancel at the title to

06:40.240 --> 06:48.370
this place location and maybe the address we picked might be too long but still let's give this a try.

06:48.370 --> 06:52.540
So now with that let's go back to the map model one more time.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.930
We added everything all the logic here inside of the model.

06:55.930 --> 06:56.810
Let's now go.

06:56.860 --> 06:58.990
Or instead of the typescript file I should say.

06:58.990 --> 07:01.200
Let's now go to the template and there.

07:01.210 --> 07:09.270
Let's take advantage of the binders full title we have and of the binder all close button text here

07:09.310 --> 07:12.360
because that is what I want to display there ultimately.

07:12.500 --> 07:17.320
Now let's save doesn't let's wait for this to reload and let's see if it works out the way we want but

07:17.320 --> 07:18.500
now it has this.

07:18.580 --> 07:24.160
Indeed I see the address here it's cut off but that's OK and it is centered on the selection we had

07:24.160 --> 07:32.990
it adds this marker and clicking doesn't do anything we can close it and let's now add a new offer y

07:32.990 --> 07:38.800
place in Munich not actually where I live

07:45.550 --> 07:50.350
we choose some dates here and no you can't actually stay there I'm sorry and no it isn't really where

07:50.350 --> 08:00.500
I live so let's now pick that place in Munich here it's head all the way over to Germany and Munich

08:02.500 --> 08:10.470
and now there I can go in the direction where I used to live roughly at least which was around there

08:15.070 --> 08:22.730
let's add that place and if I now discovered that here it is and that looks good.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.620
So everything works the way it should.

08:24.650 --> 08:31.280
And with that we added Google Maps to this ionic application and this will work on mobile devices and

08:31.400 --> 08:33.800
also as you can see here in the web.
