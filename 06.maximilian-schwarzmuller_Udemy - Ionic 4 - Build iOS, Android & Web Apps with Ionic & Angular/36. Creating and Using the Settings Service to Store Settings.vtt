00:02.230 --> 00:10.150
Were you successful it was kind of advanced really normal anguage you stuff but kind of something we

00:10.150 --> 00:14.640
haven't done yet in the course so let's now do it together in the services folder.

00:14.650 --> 00:21.760
I will create a news service called settings and in those newly created file I'll simply export a class

00:21.760 --> 00:25.950
named setting's service in there.

00:25.960 --> 00:32.940
I want to have a private property which will name all the background and it's false initially here.

00:33.070 --> 00:36.880
I want to now be able to switch this.

00:36.910 --> 00:46.030
So I was set add a method set background and I expect to get information if I want to switch it on or

00:46.030 --> 00:47.170
not.

00:47.170 --> 00:52.940
So all this is old and this simply is a boolean.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.110
Then I want to set this all background equal to is all.

00:57.360 --> 01:03.180
So if we now switch or if we call this method of pass true we're setting this to true our otherwise

01:03.180 --> 01:04.990
but setting a false.

01:05.210 --> 01:12.060
I'm also already implementing a chat check although it is old background you could name it does use

01:12.090 --> 01:14.040
all Baghran whatever you want.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.460
And here is simply return this on background.

01:17.460 --> 01:21.640
This allows you to check if it is set to True or false.

01:21.750 --> 01:29.640
This is the service now in the settings file here in the settings typed file in on toggle I want to

01:29.640 --> 01:33.620
exorcise service in order to be able to access it.

01:33.630 --> 01:38.630
I will provide it in the app module because I will use it in different places in the app.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.190
Here are provide my settings service.

01:41.310 --> 01:47.540
Make sure to also add the import at the top your and with that provided.

01:47.850 --> 01:49.080
And these settings start.

01:49.090 --> 01:50.330
TS file.

01:50.330 --> 01:51.790
I can now injected.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.260
So in the constructor all unchecked settings.

01:55.320 --> 02:04.010
Service like this and also add the import of course and with that service object that in the on Pongal

02:04.020 --> 02:05.000
Meffert.

02:05.190 --> 02:12.400
It's now time to use the settings service to call set background and to set it equal to toggle checked.

02:12.540 --> 02:19.720
So this switch will switch to Fahd's if we switch to target default and the other way around.

02:19.740 --> 02:25.200
I also want to implement check Allt background method.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.220
Your and you will see why we need a second here.

02:30.220 --> 02:35.620
I want to get access to my settings service and call its old all background and simply return this as

02:35.620 --> 02:39.640
a result of this method and we do need this method here.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.690
In our age Tim alfalfa follow the settings.

02:42.730 --> 02:48.570
Of course we all want to display the current state of this because imagine we switched us on.

02:48.610 --> 02:51.300
Then we leave the page and therefore is destroyed.

02:51.310 --> 02:57.910
Maybe not kept around the cache and we come back later and now it would start at the unchecked state

02:57.910 --> 03:01.960
again even though in the service it is checked.

03:02.170 --> 03:07.500
So we would not be able to uncheck it because it already has unchecked so do get my point.

03:07.510 --> 03:12.140
It's then not working correctly we're not seeing the current state.

03:12.570 --> 03:16.940
Therefore Thankfully I talk or does not only emit an event.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.760
It also takes input.

03:19.760 --> 03:25.720
ID offers us to bind a property to the checked property.

03:25.720 --> 03:33.590
We can set this to true or false or of course to be a result of our check or Bakra method because this

03:33.590 --> 03:34.960
will return true or false.

03:34.970 --> 03:35.680
In the end.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.660
So here I will check all background.

03:38.900 --> 03:45.660
And now what this does is it makes sure that we always set the toggle to the currently stored state

03:45.830 --> 03:49.460
to state stored in our service.

03:49.460 --> 03:54.450
Now with this in place let's save this and see if this works.

03:54.470 --> 03:58.760
Before we done in the next lecture actually add our alternative background.

03:58.760 --> 04:05.720
So in the settings now if I switch this on and I go to some other pages click on this here do some other

04:05.730 --> 04:08.330
work and then I come back to the settings.

04:08.450 --> 04:14.030
You see it's still switched on because it's correctly stored in the service and correctly passed to

04:14.030 --> 04:15.830
the checked property.

04:15.830 --> 04:19.160
With that let's actually implement our alternative background.

04:19.170 --> 04:20.110
