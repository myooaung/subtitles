00:02.010 --> 00:06.660
In the last lecture we made sure that we actually can add recipes to our recipes.

00:07.170 --> 00:10.180
Now it's time to output them here on the recipes page.

00:10.180 --> 00:11.900
This is your challenge.

00:12.030 --> 00:13.400
I'll put them here.

00:13.410 --> 00:20.550
Choose any style you want beaded a card a normal list whatever you like what you learn about and output

00:20.580 --> 00:22.540
the recipes here on this page.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.480
You get the service the service already has a method to retrieve the recipes and you should have the

00:27.480 --> 00:32.340
knowledge to loop through those items and I'll put something in the template whatever you like.

00:32.370 --> 00:35.320
I'm going to show you my approach in a couple of seconds.

00:38.030 --> 00:40.070
So were you successful.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.420
Let's have a look.

00:41.420 --> 00:42.840
This is how I would do it.

00:42.890 --> 00:45.430
And this is only one way of doing it of course.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.800
I'll go to the Recipes page here to the template.

00:49.130 --> 00:53.600
And right now we only have the plus year in the nav bar.

00:53.630 --> 00:57.500
Now I will add something to the content and I'll keep it super simple here.

00:57.650 --> 01:03.890
I'll add I and list with a button and on the button I'll add an item to make this look like a list item

01:04.030 --> 01:09.110
I want of a button because this will be used to navigate to a new page and then I want to have this

01:09.170 --> 01:12.570
arrow on the right and that touch effect when we touch it.

01:13.310 --> 01:19.940
I will of course use energy for two loop to free something and that something will be my recipes I will

01:19.940 --> 01:23.710
store them in their recipes property and yes this hasn't been created yet.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.800
We will do so in a second.

01:25.820 --> 01:31.150
I will also retrieve the index of the current recipe because that's something very interesting to me.

01:31.190 --> 01:39.170
I will need this for editing a recipe for example and therefore all this will be passed when we navigate

01:39.170 --> 01:39.910
away.

01:40.010 --> 01:45.840
Therefore let's add a click listener and add the on load recipe method here.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.400
Now if you didn't add this yet this is perfectly fine.

01:48.470 --> 01:53.830
I will fill it with life in the next lecture or two in the bottom.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.160
I'll add age to tag where I output the title of the recipe.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.670
Keep in mind title is one of the properties we defined in the recipe model.

02:02.690 --> 02:06.460
Your so this is the title of the recipe.

02:08.140 --> 02:12.960
And Below this I will add a new element you haven't heard about yet.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.660
That's the i n.

02:14.670 --> 02:23.130
Note Now note is simply a nicely styled component which Well lets look like a tiny note.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.290
You'll see how it looks like in a second.

02:25.720 --> 02:30.880
So here I will use recipe difficulty to output the difficulty of this recipe.

02:30.910 --> 02:34.690
Again you will see how this looks like in a second before showing this.

02:34.690 --> 02:39.810
However we need to populate this recipe's array and then also add this method.

02:39.810 --> 02:43.340
Though we will fill this method with live in the next lecture.

02:43.720 --> 02:50.410
So let's go to the typescript file first and add the lecture even though it doesn't do anything as of

02:50.410 --> 02:58.120
now so it's just the empty method right now and I want to load my recipes so I want to have an array

02:58.120 --> 03:02.750
of recipes recipes here which is of type recipe array of course.

03:02.770 --> 03:06.550
Make sure to import recipe from your models folder.

03:06.550 --> 03:10.540
Now we need to initialize this and there are different ways of initializing this.

03:10.540 --> 03:13.660
Obviously now we can use ion.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.870
You will enter again.

03:16.360 --> 03:23.220
So if you have a look at the shopping list we use data there too so we can simply copy that added here

03:23.450 --> 03:24.790
and here of course.

03:24.790 --> 03:29.260
I now want to initialize my recipe's now to do so.

03:29.470 --> 03:36.340
I need to inject my service so my recipe is service which is of type of recipe service year.

03:36.340 --> 03:45.870
Make sure to add this import and after service injected I can simply say this recipe's equals this recipe's

03:45.870 --> 03:47.260
service.

03:47.350 --> 03:49.460
Get items like this

03:53.100 --> 03:58.200
now in my recipe service It's called get recipes.

03:58.210 --> 03:59.650
That's why it didn't work.

03:59.650 --> 04:04.620
So get recipes and stuff that we're getting the recipes whenever we're loading this.

04:04.630 --> 04:13.360
Do you hear now with this place let's save this and let's see if it works as we expect that to work.

04:13.360 --> 04:22.670
If we go back to the application and go there and add a new recipe again the well-known schnitzel which

04:22.670 --> 04:26.780
is you guessed it very tasty and I'm not going to add any ingredients.

04:26.780 --> 04:32.560
For now let's add it were taken back to the root page which is this page and we see our recipe.

04:32.570 --> 04:36.910
We can click on it nothing happens of course because we haven't talked about this method.

04:36.980 --> 04:40.130
And here you see the i node in action.

04:40.130 --> 04:42.180
It simply gives you this style.

04:42.230 --> 04:47.010
It's kind of like a paragraph just a bit bigger font size I believe.

04:47.010 --> 04:53.810
So just a null turtle if to have is styled nicely and to have this kind of additional information on

04:53.810 --> 04:55.050
your item.

04:55.490 --> 05:01.760
So if this were able to output a list of recipes to see that it really is a list time to add more risk

05:01.790 --> 05:03.050
Bagheri I'd say so.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.370
They are tasty too.

05:04.490 --> 05:06.750
Now we see two items that looks great.

05:06.770 --> 05:13.610
Now let's add the logic to be able to go to the detail page when we click on one of those items.
