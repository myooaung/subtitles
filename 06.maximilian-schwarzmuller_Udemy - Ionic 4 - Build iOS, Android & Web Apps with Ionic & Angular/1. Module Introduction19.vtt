00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.440
Well you really achieve a lot throughout the course.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.740
You learn a lot about ionic to building applications using the many features I wanted to offer you from

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.940
the building components over navigation to native to wise features and storage and much more with all

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.060
those skills gained with all those applications build the missing pieces to learn how to take those

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.890
applications built them for production and push them to an store.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.530
This is what this module is about.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.300
We will learn how we can actually use our own Eichen and splash screen and not use that core to the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.810
default.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.510
We saw throughout this course you will also learn how to adjust the app configuration.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.430
Like the name or the details which will show up in the App Store and in the end we're going to publish

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.570
this app to the Google Play store and you will also learn how to publish it to the Apple App Store.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.860
Which steps are required to get there to get to the point where you can work on the end you will actually

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.540
see in the App Store and then hit that publish button.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:13.710
This is the last piece of this course or the last piece you need to really build your own app find unit

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.000
tested on real devices as we learn before and then publish it.
