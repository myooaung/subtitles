00:01.930 --> 00:07.450
Let's start with publishing our app to the Android app store and I can strongly recommend the official

00:07.450 --> 00:14.180
documentation on the developer pages for Android of course you can find a link to all those documentations.

00:14.270 --> 00:18.760
I'll show you're in the section in the last lecture off this core section.

00:19.090 --> 00:23.200
You can also find it easily by googling for Android publish app.

00:23.200 --> 00:28.270
So here you will find a detailed guide on how you may publish your app and then you can also go through

00:28.270 --> 00:30.670
how to prepare you for these words in your app.

00:30.670 --> 00:35.400
And then important for us now how we sign our app this is what we will need right now.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.410
And we can do this through Android studio.

00:38.440 --> 00:44.230
So let's quickly do this for this I hope my project here and then I'll go to the platforms folder and

00:44.230 --> 00:49.830
then open the Android folder here as a project in Android studio and we're done.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.010
We can go back to the documentation and follow through the steps.

00:53.260 --> 01:00.460
So we should click on build generate signed a Piquet's So build and then either generate signed AP Kate

01:00.520 --> 01:02.980
this would give us a signed bundle.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.620
Here we select the module and we only have one which is Android.

01:06.880 --> 01:13.210
And now we need to point to a key story a key story as simply as a little package holding the keys with

01:13.210 --> 01:18.100
which we can sign our package to make sure that only we can sign it.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.560
You can either choose an existing war or create a new store.

01:21.790 --> 01:27.310
And here I strongly recommend falling through the steps guided here on the official documentation where

01:27.310 --> 01:30.260
you will learn how to set up such an Yuki's store.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.250
So I configured this here with my settings.

01:33.250 --> 01:40.680
David any alias chose my own passwords for the keys store and for the key itself and then filled out

01:40.680 --> 01:42.940
my personal information with that I'm clicking OK.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.030
Now I actually ate at that key store it also took my password which I entered there with that we can

01:48.030 --> 01:49.170
go to the next page.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.520
And now we have to enter our password here.

01:51.540 --> 01:52.660
So let's do this.

01:53.710 --> 01:57.250
And with that done we can now choose where it should store does.

01:57.260 --> 02:03.130
AP OK then if we want to build for debug which we don't want we want to build for release and we can

02:03.130 --> 02:04.250
simply hit finish.

02:04.330 --> 02:09.470
And this will now automatically build our project and give us this signed.

02:09.490 --> 02:15.850
AP Okay let's have a look at it here in the Android folder in the platforms folder in my project.

02:15.850 --> 02:17.090
You see a whole lot of files.

02:17.110 --> 02:21.250
And it's this Android release AP which holds our application.

02:21.340 --> 02:24.320
This is the file we can publish to the app stores.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.660
Now on the federal documentation you can also find a way how to set up this build process to do all

02:29.680 --> 02:30.890
that automatically.

02:31.030 --> 02:35.490
And in the documentation I was pointing to earlier on the ionic framework docs.

02:35.500 --> 02:40.860
You can also find ways of doing all those commands in the command line with to control command.

02:40.890 --> 02:42.700
John assigner package and so on.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.240
So these are alternatives.

02:44.470 --> 02:50.080
I'm going to continue with this step here with the Google Play store so we can simply go to the Google

02:50.080 --> 02:56.790
Play Store developer console by searching for Google Play Store console that should do the trick.

02:56.860 --> 02:59.680
And you were taken to the developer console.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.670
Now you will need to sign up and pay the $25 as I was mentioning.

03:03.910 --> 03:09.280
And then after logging in and having a paid account you are here where you can now create an application

03:09.850 --> 03:11.110
and start creating it.

03:11.110 --> 03:15.770
So here it's city or some places at the default language is English is OK.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.990
We can create the app now.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.260
And with that it added this app and now you can go through the normal publishing process where you fill

03:23.260 --> 03:26.760
out all these things provide some images and so on.

03:26.920 --> 03:31.480
And that is something I won't do with you here because it simply is a whole lot to fill out.

03:31.570 --> 03:37.490
But it is all of this crud very well here on the Android documentation if you want to go into this.

03:37.540 --> 03:43.660
If you really want to publish your application you fully work here in this interface.

03:43.660 --> 03:44.630
From now on.

03:44.890 --> 03:50.230
And then in the end you go to AP K here and also upload your AP k.

03:50.350 --> 03:56.740
And here we simply choose to JPK we just created in platforms Android and then this Android release

03:56.760 --> 03:57.570
a bouquet.

03:57.760 --> 04:05.870
We do this it will now upload this AP came to the Google Play store here which seems to work on once

04:05.870 --> 04:11.090
we did this and we filled out all the ambers sections here.

04:11.300 --> 04:17.800
We can click on publish and ship our application to the app store is also a final note.

04:17.840 --> 04:24.000
Note that it automatically took that identifier dis ID here which is set up in de-conflict file appear.

04:24.020 --> 04:28.850
So if you change that here this will also affect which IDs used here and that should of course be the

04:28.850 --> 04:30.100
same ID.

04:30.240 --> 04:36.410
This is how you can build your application for police for Android and how you then get started setting

04:36.410 --> 04:39.620
it up here in the Google Play develop a console to ship it.
