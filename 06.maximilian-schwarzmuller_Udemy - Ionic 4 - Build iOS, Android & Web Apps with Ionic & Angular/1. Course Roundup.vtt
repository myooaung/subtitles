00:02.290 --> 00:03.170
Great job.

00:03.250 --> 00:04.150
You did it.

00:04.150 --> 00:07.890
You finished this course and you learn so much about ionic.

00:07.930 --> 00:11.570
You'll learn how it works all the basics how to use its components.

00:11.590 --> 00:17.380
Where to find more about the components how to style your application how to turn it into a native app

00:17.380 --> 00:20.130
and run it on IOW and Android.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.350
How to tap into native device features like the camera.

00:23.350 --> 00:28.280
We're adding Google Apps how to add authentication and so much more.

00:28.420 --> 00:36.490
I can only encourage you to go on go on on this route and build stuff build demo projects set your own

00:36.490 --> 00:43.840
goals clone simplified versions of popular applications and build your own clones with ionic and angular.

00:43.840 --> 00:51.070
So did you have to dive into problems did you face challenges which you can solve with the tools taught

00:51.070 --> 00:57.040
in this course and the resources I show you in the course most importantly the official box of course

00:57.550 --> 01:04.870
that will turn you into a complete ionic developer or a get angular developer though as you already

01:04.870 --> 01:10.840
saw in this course the way you'll learn ionic of course is a way that should allow you to easily apply

01:10.840 --> 01:16.440
that same knowledge to react or view or whatever you want to use with ionic.

01:16.450 --> 01:22.450
With that I hope you like the course and I hope I potentially see you in our courses like my progressive

01:22.450 --> 01:24.530
web of course which is a great next step.

01:24.580 --> 01:29.710
My complete angular course if you want to learn more about that or the standstill and web components

01:29.710 --> 01:34.420
course if you want to learn more about what happened behind the scenes of ionic.
