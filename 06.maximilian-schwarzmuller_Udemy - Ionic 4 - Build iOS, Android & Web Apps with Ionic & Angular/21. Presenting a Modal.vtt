To display them all I'll go back to my favorites component because this is where I'm able to tap on

00:08.590 --> 00:16.480
one of my items here one of my quotes to display a mole and I'll first add a click listener to this

00:16.480 --> 00:17.310
item.

00:17.370 --> 00:24.460
Click and are simply named as on that view quote and of course I'll pass to quote one of you as an argument

00:25.000 --> 00:28.050
in the body of this component and therefore can I add you on view.

00:28.050 --> 00:31.740
Quote Mefford where I know I will get a quote of type quote.

00:32.170 --> 00:39.190
And here here's the place where I want to open the mole in order to create a motile we need to inject

00:39.400 --> 00:43.140
a helpful close eye on it to give us bimodal controller.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.180
So let's add this to the constructor mode.

00:46.190 --> 00:54.460
The controller would be a fitting name and the type is modal controller not modal controller needs to

00:54.460 --> 00:56.340
be imported from my onic angler.

00:56.350 --> 01:04.700
So let's add the import modal controller from ionic angler just like this.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.040
And as does get all the tools we need to create a modal.

01:08.530 --> 01:14.160
I would say the word isn't a constant name of modal any name you want of course and then exits Dimeola

01:14.190 --> 01:17.950
control we just inject it and there we have a create method.

01:17.950 --> 01:20.170
This is a common theme you see an eye on it too.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.790
You saw it on the alert there.

01:22.810 --> 01:26.950
We also had the create method on the alert controller.

01:26.950 --> 01:32.080
Now we have to create method on the modal controller as you see this again throughout the course.

01:32.080 --> 01:38.600
There are a lot of controllers for yet Mole's alerts but later we also see a loader and so on.

01:38.650 --> 01:44.120
Which all have a create method to create these overlays we have in our application.

01:44.140 --> 01:49.000
There are a couple of a whaleboat overlays models and other being two of them and are always created

01:49.000 --> 01:50.390
with decreed method.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.810
Here we are of course all need to pass some data to configure this model and the data we need to pass

01:54.810 --> 01:57.570
year actually is the page we want to load.

01:57.700 --> 02:04.480
So the quote page makes sure to alter add import at the top that we're telling ionic to.

02:04.510 --> 02:06.790
This is the content of our model.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.260
With this we're setting up the model now with modal pre-sent we can display it to the user.

02:14.260 --> 02:18.830
Now let's save this to see it in action and go back to a running application.

02:18.850 --> 02:23.350
Let's quickly add a quote to our favorites so that we have one to click on.

02:23.350 --> 02:26.350
Now let me click on it and here you go.

02:26.350 --> 02:31.650
This is our model of course we can't get rid of it right now because we haven't hooked up all the buttons.

02:31.660 --> 02:37.540
That is what we're going to do next before we Denne also start adding some or passing some data to the

02:37.540 --> 02:39.540
model model which we can display here.
