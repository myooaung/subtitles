00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.440
In the last lecture we finished this new place page here on this forum.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.440
Now I want to be able to pick a location and I'll start with the manual selection of a location.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.800
Now for this I'm going to add a third party package to this project because I'm going to use England

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.970
to package which allows us to use Google maps in our angler to repr and therefore also in our ionic

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.530
to app I can add this package we're running.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.910
And Pieman store so install it through NPM dash dash save to also store entry in the package adjacent

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.730
file and then the name of the pectus Engler to Google Maps.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.450
So this will pull down these English to Google Maps package as you may have guessed by the name and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.010
we've said we're good to go and to include it in our app now included in our app.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.650
I'll start working on the set location page which is the page will open which will hold as Google Maps

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.070
snippet or does Google Maps part where we can then tab on the map to select the location.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.090
So open the template and removed is comment here.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.120
Change the title to maybe say choose location and then in the content field here in the content of this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.030
page I'm going to add iron grids to nicely structure to content with the eye and roll.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.940
And then I'd call them as of as always.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.290
And then we want to include such the map extract here.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.340
Since we installed this first party package we have a new component we can use.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.670
It's called SLBM.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.530
That's the offer of this package.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.870
Google Map enter does component here.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.960
And again this component was added by this English to Google Maps package and this will create such

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.820
map extract on our screen.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.660
Now if we add this on its own like this we wouldn't see anything in order to see something we need to

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.820
go to our s.c.s file and change the styling of this.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.050
So here we going to use the same selector as the IBM Google map and we have to set a height.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.510
This is mandatory.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.570
You can find more information in the official docs office package but this is mandatory to be set.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.380
Otherwise you won't see anything.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.690
I'm going to choose a height of 250 pixels and you can of course play around with this value.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.600
Now in order to see if this actually changes something and if we are already able to see a map let's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.350
save this.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.640
And let's now go to the place HDMI file see which method we called here on open map and let's implement

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.890
this method in the app place page component here because here I now want to open this map.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.530
I want this set location map.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.520
I just said location page.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.760
I just worked on Therefore here the goal is to open a set location page.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.230
I will do this through a mobile.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.250
So here in the constructor I'll simply inject the modal controller so to simply open this as an overlay

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.710
instead of a new page on the navigation Steg WIPs.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.000
Let's add de-construct like this with this object that also makes sure to import modal controller from

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.590
ionic angler and an on open map.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.210
I'll then create this model with the modal controller and to create Meffert and pass the set location

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.440
page as an argument.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.500
As you learned it make sure you also import this page at the top thereafter.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.250
So with this edit i can now pre-sent the modal and this should already allow us to see there's motile

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.130
and the map on it.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.790
Notice that I on ex-service still running for me here.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.350
So if I go back to the plage we see some error here.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.170
The reason for this is that adding this element does Google map element like this is not enough.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.230
This alone won't do the trick.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.540
Instead we also have to configure it and we do it as in the app module.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.430
Here we have to add something to imports and this is called AGM core module.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.260
This is exposed by angler's to Google maps so you can import from England to the maps slash chord.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.610
Make sure to add this import angler to Google Maps slash chord.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.690
And this has a for root method we can execute where we have to pass some configuration in order to use

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.160
the Google Maps API.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.780
We have to get an API key.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.460
So let's get such a key together now.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.580
Now you can find out how to get such a keep by visiting the official Englert you Google Maps documentation

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.690
simply go to England maps dot com.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.290
There's a D page of this package and then click on getting started there.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.470
If you scroll down a bit to the installation part and then to setting it up you'll find a link on how

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.450
to get this API key.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.640
It said developers dot Google dot com slash maps slash documentation slash Chalis strips slash get Ebby

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.860
keep your L and there you have this nice button get a key if you click on this.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.510
You have to select the project and you will see your firebase project's Europe because firebase is part

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.190
of Google and therefore are closely linked.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.530
But you can also create a new project in there and create this project and enable the API.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.500
So let's do this year and we're done.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.430
This is your API Keizer make sure to copy your Kieta one you generated.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.030
Canonically helpful copy but now you're on the right and then go back to your project and you need to

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.590
add this key here.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.730
Now as for rules in this Optik you're passing to forward on HCM coord module at a property named API

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.160
here.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.210
And this naming is important it's the insert word.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.960
So capital K and lowercase a at the beginning and then as a string entry your AP Ickey the one you just

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.010
copied.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.120
Now we have to someplace if you now save this and let it recompile.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.400
Now the app should work correctly as you can see if you go no go no go backload low click on new place

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.980
and now click select on map.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.930
It opens up and does this Google Maps.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.040
It's just centered somewhere in the ocean so that is why it's all blue at the beginning.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.910
But you see you have a working app here.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.980
Now we're going to refine this in the next lectures.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.690
But the nice thing is this is working daises are working snippet of course we can't dismiss the mold

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.790
model and all this.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.080
So we're going to work on this at the first step has been taken
