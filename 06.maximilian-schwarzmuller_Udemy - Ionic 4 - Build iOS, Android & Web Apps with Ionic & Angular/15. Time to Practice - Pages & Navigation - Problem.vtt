I think it's time to now practice the things you've learned thus far.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.140
I prepared a little assignment for you.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.120
You can find this basic project attached to this lecture to get started right away.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.030
I got four exercises for your next assignment.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.110
This should be doable with the knowledge you have gained until now in the first exercise once you trade

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.350
to new pages a shop and a buyout page and you can even create them to see a lie or manually though I

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.990
do recommend that you at least create one of them manually to really get a feeling for how that works

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.960
and that in the end it's a normal angler to component because it's so key to keep in mind and exercise

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.480
too.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.150
I don't want you to hook up those pages.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.230
You should add a button to the home page which leads to the shop page and a button to the shop page

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.030
which leads to the bio page.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.950
Oh as a side note Don't forget to register your pages.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.040
You should know where to register them and exercise free.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.240
We're going to fill this with more life.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.000
We're able to go to the shop and the bio page but we're not passing any data.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.080
Well if we're building kind of a shop here we should pass the different products to the bio page.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.500
So make sure to add more buttons to the shop page.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.070
For example two new buttons.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.900
You can also add more of course and give them different captions.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.360
For example milk red apples whichever product you want to have in your shop.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.200
All three buttons should lead to the Byard page but this should also pass some data so that you load

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.000
the biote page with different paid data.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.990
And of course you should also display that data on the bio page.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.940
Well in the last exercise I want you to add a by Button Judy biote page and this button should actually

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.730
take you back to the root page.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.720
So to the home page all things we've learned thus far.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.710
Good luck with that in the next with you.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.460
You can see my solution for this assignment.
