00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.680
In the last lecture we created all the pages we're going to need.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.800
They're still in their roll for them.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.010
We haven't added any special content to them but we didn't do that because our app is not really working

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.030
that great.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.620
Instead if we have a look at our running application and let it reload here.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.530
Well see we only see the blank favorite's page.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.680
We get no tabs to navigate around.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
And also of course we have no side menu or come back to the site manual later.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.140
But I want to start with the tabs first and tap's navigation is something we haven't looked at yet.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.330
So let's take a closer look now.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.040
To understand how we can navigate around with tap's or a side menu we have to go back to does navigation

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.580
stack.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.300
This stack of pages I want to use.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.020
Until now we always saw a single stack.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.100
That means if we click on a button we push a new page on that stack and we view that page the bottom

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.080
page here in this case.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.710
Now I own it too is also able to handle multiple stacks of pages kind of it will always have one root

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.030
stack but inside of the stack you can split it up.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.230
Let's see an example here.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.900
We're using a tap's page at this tap's page sits on the root stack.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.110
However when we click a page click a tab here or should say it will load two different Suppe stacks

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.990
of pages.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.220
So if the page loaded Fruita tab we navigate around and push new pages on the stack.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.740
This will be on the stack for this tab.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.310
And if we then switched the tab we were on a totally new stack of pages and you will see this in action

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.100
soon.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.460
As a side note you will also later see us when we implement a side menu because there we will also have

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.530
two different stacks of pages.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.120
That's the theory.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.550
Now let's implement is in practice by actually adding tabs to our application
