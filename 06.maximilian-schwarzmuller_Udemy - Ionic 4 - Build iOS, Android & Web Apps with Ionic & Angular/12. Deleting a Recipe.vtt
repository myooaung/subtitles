WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:08.320
We added a service, we added basic routing, so we added state management and navigation, two important features

00:08.320 --> 00:09.470
for using Angular

00:09.490 --> 00:15.070
and of course we have all the other nice features of being able to just use ngFor instead of writing

00:15.070 --> 00:18.830
our own Javascript logic to add elements dynamically to the DOM

00:18.940 --> 00:25.030
and this shows us why using Angular is nice and it also shows you that it works together with Ionic

00:25.030 --> 00:26.250
just fine.

00:26.320 --> 00:32.200
Now it is especially awesome to see it work together with Angular when we do need extra features like

00:32.200 --> 00:39.100
that alert controller. Remember that previously, if we wanted an alert controller, we had to integrate

00:39.380 --> 00:47.230
ion-alert-controller as a component and then we had to get access to it programmatically so that we

00:47.230 --> 00:48.240
could use it.

00:48.250 --> 00:54.370
Now you see I even get an error that Angular doesn't know that alert controller because the Ionic Angular

00:54.370 --> 01:00.970
package doesn't even wrap it into an Angular component as it does for all the other components,

01:01.000 --> 01:06.850
the reason for that is that we now use this alert controller differently, more conveniently. To show you

01:06.850 --> 01:07.670
how to use it,

01:07.690 --> 01:12.040
let's edit our app a little bit and let's make sure we can delete a recipe here,

01:12.040 --> 01:14.800
shall we? For this in our toolbar,

01:14.830 --> 01:19.870
I'll add another ion-buttons element, slot here is primary,

01:19.900 --> 01:26.800
this will be by default at the end of the toolbar and I'll add an ion-button in there where I want to

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
have an ion-icon,

01:28.810 --> 01:39.550
let's find a nice icon for deleting something on ionicons.com. If we search for delete, this trash

01:39.550 --> 01:42.250
bin here will do, the name is trash,

01:42.460 --> 01:46.680
so here I'll give this a name of trash.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.680
I only want to have the icon, so on the ion-icon,

01:49.750 --> 01:52.320
I'll give it a slot of icon only,

01:52.330 --> 01:54.550
so in that button I'll now only have that icon,

01:54.550 --> 01:55.570
that is what this does.

02:00.070 --> 02:07.170
And if we now save that, on the app as it reloads, if we go to the detail page here, you see that trash

02:07.170 --> 02:08.010
bin here.

02:08.110 --> 02:11.600
Now when I tap this, I want to delete this recipe. For that,

02:11.610 --> 02:20.710
let's go to the recipe service and let's add a delete recipe method and we need the recipeId of

02:20.710 --> 02:23.310
the recipe that should be deleted of course.

02:23.350 --> 02:27.310
And then I will set this recipes equal to this

02:27.340 --> 02:31.940
recipes filter, filter is another function built into default

02:31.960 --> 02:33.480
normal Javascript

02:33.870 --> 02:38.260
and this will execute a function on every element in this recipes array

02:38.380 --> 02:41.770
and if this function then returns true, it will keep this element,

02:41.770 --> 02:46.960
otherwise it will get rid of it and I of course want to keep all elements but the element with the recipe

02:46.960 --> 02:53.570
ID here. So I go through all my recipes here and I want to return true if I want to keep it and false

02:53.600 --> 02:54.800
if I want to drop it,

02:54.920 --> 02:59.130
so I will return recipeId equal to recipeId,

02:59.240 --> 03:03.980
that would now return true for all elements where the IDs are equal

03:03.980 --> 03:10.040
but actually, I want to drop the element where the ID is equal, so I will check if it's not equal here.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.950
Now this is delete recipe,

03:13.210 --> 03:21.040
with delete recipe added, we can use it in the recipe detail component. There on this button,

03:21.040 --> 03:26.890
let's add a click listener and execute onDeleteRecipe or whatever you want to call it,

03:26.920 --> 03:32.610
let's add this method into recipe detail page component file here and in there,

03:32.740 --> 03:40.000
I want to use my recipes service and call delete recipe for the recipeId we loaded here.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.840
Now I'm only storing it in ngOnInit but I do have my loaded recipe,

03:44.920 --> 03:48.900
so this loaded recipe and there the ID,

03:48.910 --> 03:52.110
this is in the end the ID I want to pass to delete recipe.

03:52.300 --> 03:56.560
Now once we're done deleting, of course I want to leave that page because the data for this page will

03:56.560 --> 04:02.850
have been gone and therefore I'll inject the router

04:03.050 --> 04:11.840
and with that, I mean the normal Angular router from @angular/router and after deleting here, I

04:11.840 --> 04:18.560
will call this router navigate and now I will go to just /recipes here.

04:20.550 --> 04:27.040
Well let's see if that works.

04:27.140 --> 04:31.790
It does but of course I wanted to show you how we can use that alert controller in a nicer way.
