00:02.220 --> 00:07.620
Now for that let's say we want to ask the user whether he really wants to delete the recipe before we

00:07.620 --> 00:13.020
go ahead and do it and hence in recipe detail, in this recipe detail page,

00:13.080 --> 00:20.770
I want to show an alert. Now as I mentioned, we don't include ion-alert-controller in our template anymore

00:20.820 --> 00:29.790
and then select it with a Javascript, instead you can now thanks to @ionic/angular simply inject your

00:30.090 --> 00:34.640
alert controller let's say and the same will work for the other controllers we'll learn about throughout

00:34.650 --> 00:39.050
the course and the type here is alert controller.

00:39.150 --> 00:46.930
Now alert controller and that's important needs to be imported from @ionic/angular because this wrapper

00:46.950 --> 00:52.170
package gives you this convenient access to the alert controller and it does so by not giving you a

00:52.170 --> 00:53.270
default component

00:53.280 --> 00:59.610
you have to add to your templates and then access manually but by giving you a service in the end that

00:59.610 --> 01:03.500
gives you all the features of the alert controller.

01:03.510 --> 01:09.090
So now we can use this alert controller service down there to create a new alert

01:09.200 --> 01:15.360
and here thanks to Typescript, we even get auto-completion and we can see what we can set here by hitting

01:15.750 --> 01:17.240
control space.

01:17.550 --> 01:23.770
So we pass an object to create and in there, we can see what we can set on this alert,

01:23.850 --> 01:25.920
for example we can add a header of

01:25.920 --> 01:28.270
are you sure

01:28.350 --> 01:30.350
and then let's say a message of

01:30.540 --> 01:34.490
do you really want to delete the recipe

01:34.710 --> 01:40.530
and then we can add some buttons and here, I of course also want to give the user the option of replying

01:40.530 --> 01:41.750
with no.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.460
So buttons here will not just be an array where I have

01:44.580 --> 01:45.660
OK,

01:45.920 --> 01:53.460
instead we can pass an object in here to configure a button in a bit more detail and that object can have

01:53.460 --> 01:56.690
a text, a role and a handler.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.200
Now let me add a text here and there,

01:59.220 --> 02:02.770
I want to have the text of let's say cancel.

02:02.850 --> 02:09.030
We can give this a role of cancel and that will actually just close the dialog and not do anything else

02:10.790 --> 02:16.560
and I can add a second button with a text of delete and there,

02:16.560 --> 02:17.000
well indeed

02:17.010 --> 02:24.890
I want to delete this. Now create returns a promise which actually gives us this alert element, this hasn't

02:24.890 --> 02:31.180
changed and then we can call alert el present.

02:31.210 --> 02:37.150
Now I only want to delete if this button is pressed and for that I can define a handler here which in the

02:37.150 --> 02:39.220
end is just defining a function

02:39.230 --> 02:43.510
and here I'm defining an anonymous arrow function that holds the code that should execute when

02:43.540 --> 02:44.620
this button is pressed.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.550
So there, I will delete and navigate, on cancel,

02:47.560 --> 02:48.280
I'll do nothing,

02:48.280 --> 02:50.230
just the alert will be closed.

02:50.230 --> 02:52.160
Then we present this alert here and

02:52.210 --> 02:55.890
that should be all we need with this alert controller being injected

02:55.900 --> 02:58.310
now which of course is pretty nice.

02:58.420 --> 02:59.730
So let's wait for this

03:00.010 --> 03:04.960
and if I now click this trash bin, I get this nice alert,

03:05.070 --> 03:07.540
if I click cancel, nothing happens

03:07.540 --> 03:12.760
but if I click delete, then we go ahead, we delete this and we are navigated.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.780
So this now works as it should work

03:15.880 --> 03:22.840
and this is another major advantage of using Angular here with the @ionic/angular package.

03:22.840 --> 03:28.600
We got very easy access to that alert controller and we can inject this anywhere where we want to show

03:28.770 --> 03:29.290
an alert.
