00:02.040 --> 00:08.840
End the last video we made good progress and we felt our list of items here was some life make them

00:08.900 --> 00:13.990
made them look nicer and now we're displaying all the categories for our favorite quotes.

00:14.060 --> 00:20.090
The next step is to be able to actually tab one of those categories and see the quotes for that category.

00:20.120 --> 00:26.240
Now for that we're going to work with the quotes page which is responsible for displaying all quotes

00:26.300 --> 00:28.590
off of a chosen category.

00:28.610 --> 00:34.280
So the first step is to go there and again I'll clean that up if we need something off that stuff I'll

00:34.330 --> 00:41.600
add a later and I'm also going to clean up the template now in the template.

00:41.600 --> 00:47.500
I want to display the title or the category title here at the top so I'm going to delete it for now

00:47.510 --> 00:49.490
we're going to change this soon.

00:49.850 --> 00:56.220
And in the content there I actually want to display the individual quotes.

00:56.330 --> 01:03.710
Let's have a look at how that should look like if we click a category we want to lotas quotes page here.

01:03.710 --> 01:08.080
And as you can see there we get a couple of cards displaying those codes.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.130
So those nice boxes with that shadow behind and so on.

01:12.380 --> 01:14.890
So this is how I want this page to look.

01:15.080 --> 01:21.130
Now before working on the actual look let's start with the more important step.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.560
Passing the data we need to know which category was chosen right.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.520
We need to know which codes should be rendered.

01:27.530 --> 01:34.580
So let's start with this in order to load the right codes when clicking on one of our categories here.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.310
We need to be able to pass that data.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.400
We learned how to pass data when clicking element.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.850
So let's first start by implementing the click listener to our button here.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.810
I'm going to structured is over multiple lines so that it's gets easier to read.

01:49.970 --> 01:57.250
And here we can simply use the nav push directive and point to the let's say quote's page.

01:57.250 --> 02:03.800
Now this property needs to be created in the library Dotty's file now and it should of course hold a

02:03.800 --> 02:05.720
reference to the quotes page.

02:05.720 --> 02:11.660
So make sure to add to him or two quotes page here at the top and then assign this value to those quotes

02:11.660 --> 02:14.480
page property which we're using in this directive.

02:14.720 --> 02:21.640
And we also need to pass some data so all at the nav parens property or directive it is here which is

02:21.690 --> 02:23.290
uses property binding.

02:23.540 --> 02:28.030
And now the question is which data do we want to pass to the quotes page now.

02:28.100 --> 02:32.140
Well I would say we want to pass de-selected quote group.

02:32.390 --> 02:39.540
We already fetched a quote group here in the loop so we could simply pass on quote group to pass this

02:39.620 --> 02:42.980
array or this object we just selected.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.390
And I think this is a fine approach.

02:45.410 --> 02:53.090
Now with this we're passing the quote group of the current iteration to the quotes page which we're

02:53.090 --> 02:55.440
loading for the nav push directive.

02:55.820 --> 02:58.040
Let's see if this already works.

02:58.040 --> 03:04.460
If I save this and go back to the application and let it rebuild that's quick on one of those categories.

03:04.940 --> 03:07.150
Well we clearly load a different page.

03:07.160 --> 03:12.020
We don't see anything though which is a good sign because I deleted the title and the quotes page.

03:12.020 --> 03:14.220
So we're probably seeing that page.

03:14.270 --> 03:19.210
Let's see if we actually see it by retrieving the data and changing the title of the page though.

03:19.580 --> 03:23.690
Now to retrieve the data we need to inject something.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.720
Now what do we need to inject.

03:25.730 --> 03:30.430
This is a good chance for you to pause the video and practice this on your own.

03:30.440 --> 03:36.680
How do you get the data we're adding or we're sending to this page as you see it has something to do

03:36.680 --> 03:41.680
with injection possed of it you know I'll be back in a few seconds to solve the puzzle.

03:44.980 --> 03:47.470
Were you able to do that successfully on your own.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.090
Let's do it together.

03:49.390 --> 03:56.570
In the constructor I'm going to create a new argument and all the property fruiterer's shortcut by adding

03:56.570 --> 04:02.630
the accessor in front of it which will name Neph parents more important than a name is to type.

04:02.740 --> 04:07.650
And this is naff parents to be imported from ionic angular.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.000
This is the correct import.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.080
Now with that added we can retrieve the data we're getting.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.700
I want to store it in a new property.

04:18.750 --> 04:28.240
I'm going to name those quote group and a quote group simply has dissed type your but without the area

04:28.240 --> 04:30.320
of course it's not an array of such groups.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.540
It's a single group.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.520
So let me assign the type.

04:33.760 --> 04:38.200
And of course this means we have to import the quote interface here.

04:38.380 --> 04:45.580
Now with this added I want you assign Diskworld trube property I want to give it a value and I want

04:45.580 --> 04:48.260
to retrieve disvalue from naff parens.

04:48.550 --> 04:53.850
Now I could retrieve the data here in the constructor body and there would be nothing wrong with that.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.380
But I want to show an alternative.

04:55.480 --> 05:00.340
I'm going to use I and you did load days page lifecycle look.

05:00.430 --> 05:05.740
Now this lifeso look will not be executed if the page was cached but that's no problem because if the

05:05.740 --> 05:11.160
page was cached Well the data is already loaded right so no need to fetch it again.

05:11.180 --> 05:18.670
Because while we're already displaying the quotes so here I'm going to say this quote group equals does

05:18.750 --> 05:21.700
naff parents and then just data.

05:21.730 --> 05:24.630
Because keep in mind this is what we're passing here.

05:24.670 --> 05:27.630
We're just passing the troop of the current iteration.

05:27.790 --> 05:32.650
Since this is an array of quote groups and we're expecting a single element here.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.440
This is exactly the data we need with dad.

05:35.450 --> 05:40.210
We're getting the quote group now we of course also need to display it and I'm doing this here in the

05:40.210 --> 05:41.110
title.

05:41.110 --> 05:53.360
I can simply say quote group which is the name of this property your quote group and then which name

05:53.410 --> 05:55.450
well the name is category.

05:55.460 --> 05:56.030
Right.

05:56.030 --> 05:59.710
This is a quote group here and this is the name of the category.

05:59.840 --> 06:08.780
So let me simply say whoops your quote group category and also add the upper case pipe here to make

06:08.780 --> 06:10.520
it uppercase.

06:10.550 --> 06:14.470
Now with this let's go to our application and see this in action.

06:14.690 --> 06:17.980
If I click on inspirational Well we're getting an error.

06:17.990 --> 06:19.710
What's going wrong here.

06:19.730 --> 06:21.410
I did this on purpose.

06:21.410 --> 06:24.230
Can you figure out why we're getting this error.

06:26.590 --> 06:28.960
Well I'm going to solve it there.

06:28.960 --> 06:33.720
In theory it is nothing wrong with fetching our naff parents Year in.

06:33.730 --> 06:37.080
I interviewed a load except for a one use case.

06:37.120 --> 06:45.190
If we want to display them in our template because the template will actually get to read it before

06:45.250 --> 06:45.990
we reach.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.920
And you did load because the template template creation so is handled by angular too.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.740
And that is simply done before I want to triggers the items you did load hook.

06:56.800 --> 07:01.710
So one solution would be to place a question mark after gwo group here.

07:01.780 --> 07:05.520
This tells angler to only try to access category.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.800
If quote group is a way lable.

07:07.960 --> 07:12.640
If we do this and save that and have a look at the application again.

07:12.850 --> 07:19.090
You see now it works correctly because now initially when angler first creates and renders template

07:19.570 --> 07:25.580
it will simply skip that step since it knows it's not available yet and once it becomes available.

07:25.600 --> 07:31.800
Because we reached our interview did load it work correctly Riera entered a dawn.

07:31.810 --> 07:37.290
No this is one approach we can take and I'm going to comment this out and also add a comment to your

07:38.470 --> 07:40.630
ADD Elvis operator.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.680
That's the question mark.

07:41.680 --> 07:46.100
That's the name of the operator in template to use this approach.

07:46.100 --> 07:52.360
So for for while to keep this in mind for future reference if you want to use this approach I'm going

07:52.360 --> 07:56.960
to use another approach and are simply going to add on in a live look.

07:57.070 --> 08:00.060
And of course as mentioned before you could simply use the constructor.

08:00.070 --> 08:02.190
Just want to show some alternatives here.

08:02.320 --> 08:09.640
So add on in it and with that you can simply add the engine in a method here and say this quote group

08:09.730 --> 08:16.960
equals this naff parents data and with that I can get rid of the question mark in the template because

08:16.990 --> 08:21.020
now on and it is always executed for the template is rendered.

08:21.100 --> 08:26.740
So now we're fetching the data before the template gets rendered and therefore you will see that it

08:26.740 --> 08:28.190
still works as before.

08:28.210 --> 08:30.520
But now without the question mark operator.

08:30.700 --> 08:35.800
I thought this would be important to understand in which order those hooks are reached and that you

08:35.800 --> 08:37.620
can use view that load.

08:37.630 --> 08:38.400
I am new to load.

08:38.410 --> 08:44.820
Nothing wrong with that but that it is executed after the first time the template was rendered.

08:45.100 --> 08:50.350
So a lot of talking about the state a passing lot of work here but it's really important to understand

08:50.350 --> 08:54.010
how this works and I hope that this is now a set with dad.

08:54.040 --> 09:00.460
We can continue and learn about some new components when we actually start working on the template of

09:00.460 --> 09:02.320
our quotes page here.
