If you have a place on your application where you want to style some text, let's say on the discover

00:07.180 --> 00:16.280
page here in our paragraph, in the ion-card content which would essentially be that text here below

00:16.280 --> 00:21.800
the image and there, let's say we want to give that text a different color, then you actually will have

00:21.800 --> 00:28.190
multiple ways, for example of course you can simply select that paragraph tag with CSS and assign your

00:28.190 --> 00:33.170
own color, use an inline style and so on but you can also wrap this.

00:33.170 --> 00:42.430
Now you could use an ion-label here to wrap this and there, you actually can set a color property and

00:42.430 --> 00:48.970
you could set this to a primary or let's say to danger here, so that we can clearly see it.

00:49.230 --> 00:52.030
And if you do that as this page reloads,

00:52.390 --> 00:53.470
you actually see it's red.

00:53.740 --> 00:53.950
OK,

00:53.980 --> 00:57.490
so you can do that. If we inspect this now,

00:57.820 --> 01:04.210
we see that here is our paragraph and the label is in the paragraph there

01:04.330 --> 01:11.170
and this does not do much, it actually assigns quite a lot of attributes and classes here

01:11.170 --> 01:18.100
but if we have a look at the actual styles that are having effect or that are assigned, then we see we're

01:18.100 --> 01:29.000
using that danger color here for this label. And all the other label effects are not really kicking

01:29.000 --> 01:31.320
in because it's not in an ion-item,

01:31.370 --> 01:34.600
it's not connected to an input or anything like that.

01:34.610 --> 01:39.560
Now in cases like this, of course you can use the label, as you see it works, it looks OK,

01:39.620 --> 01:45.300
it will also not be a performance issue but if you just want to style some text, you can also use

01:45.380 --> 01:46.570
ion-text here.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.130
If you wrap ion-text, this also has a color property and you will see as this reloads,

01:52.190 --> 01:53.870
you have the same effect.

01:53.990 --> 02:01.190
Now ultimately, you are of course free to use what you want therefore but it is a good idea, a good practice

02:01.520 --> 02:07.970
to use ion-text whenever you are simply having the goal of styling some text. If you just want to

02:07.970 --> 02:14.510
change the color of a text, use ion-text, if you want to have multiple text nodes, multiple text elements,

02:14.540 --> 02:20.390
multiple h1 and paragraphs in an ion-item, use ion-label instead.

02:20.630 --> 02:25.300
You can't really mess this up if you're using an ion-label here, it's not a problem at all,

02:25.370 --> 02:31.190
just keep in mind if you're only trying to color the text or anything like that, use ion-text, if you're

02:31.190 --> 02:37.250
in an ion-item or you're working with a form control, then use ion-label instead.
