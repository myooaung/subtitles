The last thing I want to show you when we talk about styling and theming our utility attributes you

00:07.860 --> 00:12.820
always saw me use some of them for example the padding here.

00:12.960 --> 00:19.560
This utility directive are unique to ships with a lot of such utility directives or attributes as they

00:19.560 --> 00:20.450
call it.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.770
And here you can see a list of them and what they do.

00:22.800 --> 00:28.530
For example you can also get convenience attributes you can add to your elements which centered text.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.320
Here we see the padding we already used.

00:30.330 --> 00:35.940
You can also kind of be more specific about that you only want to have top or left padding and so on.

00:35.940 --> 00:39.490
So these are all these helpful directives.

00:39.510 --> 00:43.490
You will see me use them for the chorus and I will explain what they do.

00:43.590 --> 00:50.070
But if you want to do some research and see if there is a directive you need it for your specific task.

00:50.070 --> 00:52.190
This is where you should look for it.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.670
Now with that I'd say let's move on to our first application.
