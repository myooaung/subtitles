I'm back on Geonic to documentation any component documentation to be precise and I want to actually

00:08.140 --> 00:12.980
ask quite a lot of components which allow you to create nice user interfaces.

00:13.090 --> 00:18.870
Actually too many you covered them all Step-By-Step but most of them are pretty straightforward to use.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.730
And you also get detailed descriptions when checking them out here.

00:21.760 --> 00:26.980
For example if you have a look at the checkbox you will see some examples and how to use a checkbox

00:27.100 --> 00:33.850
as you can see it's pretty straightforward and you will also be able to see that something we will use

00:33.850 --> 00:40.640
in our up of course to you have a lot of ionic components for components you would have in normal age

00:40.640 --> 00:46.450
Jamail 2 for example ion label which allows you to create a nicely looking nicely styled label but in

00:46.450 --> 00:52.860
the end it's the same as the normal HVM label element just have some extra features.

00:53.260 --> 01:01.090
So I definitely recommend having a look at this component documentation for your use case for the import

01:01.090 --> 01:01.630
components.

01:01.630 --> 01:02.770
You're going to need.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.990
You're going to see a few throughout this app here.

01:06.070 --> 01:08.690
But again there are just too many to cover them all.

01:08.770 --> 01:14.450
However using them is really straightforward and should be a breeze with this documentation.

01:14.620 --> 01:19.100
Now enough of the documentation let's dive into using some of them in our own app here
