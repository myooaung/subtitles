00:02.090 --> 00:08.090
And The Last Lecture we added some parts or a template here to allow us to manage our ingredients.

00:08.100 --> 00:14.510
Now when I hook up this managed ingredients button to present us with a choice on what you want to do.

00:14.700 --> 00:23.330
So add a new method here to my types of class the EDID recipe types class and all manage ingredients.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.580
I want to open up a so-called action sheet.

00:26.580 --> 00:31.270
Now you can have a look at what this is in the official documentation and directions sheets.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.020
And there you can see a preview.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.840
This is an actual sheet so this option sliding up from the bottom.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.630
And now we will implement this together.

00:38.700 --> 00:44.280
As always if you want to dive super deep into it check out the documentation here and also the API docs

00:44.310 --> 00:48.600
on action sheets to create such an active sheet.

00:48.630 --> 00:54.900
We do need to inject a certain controller and you might recall this pattern from dialogue's.

00:54.900 --> 01:00.530
For example there we also had a dialog controller and it's the same for accedes.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.250
So I'll go to the constructor and add an action sheet controller.

01:05.250 --> 01:10.530
Of course you can choose a different name but in the end it is of type activated controller and this

01:10.530 --> 01:13.310
needs to be imported from ionic angular.

01:13.740 --> 01:20.790
Now if this inject that we can create action here in the on manage ingredients method I would store

01:20.800 --> 01:25.720
this new sheet in a new constant named action sheet.

01:25.900 --> 01:29.620
And here I will say this X Enschede controller create.

01:29.830 --> 01:36.940
So like before with the dialog for example there we also called the create method to create such a controller

01:37.030 --> 01:42.790
such a shit I should say are such a dialogue before manually we actually should control or we need to

01:42.790 --> 01:48.880
pass an object and all possible properties you can set can be found in the documentation.

01:49.150 --> 01:57.160
What you will probably need is a title here I want to say what do you want to do and then 20 percent

01:57.160 --> 01:59.750
a couple of buttons from which the user is able to choose.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.500
That's the main purpose of such an action sheet.

02:02.500 --> 02:10.040
So buttons is an array of buttons and each button can now be a channel script object where we define

02:10.040 --> 02:12.040
the text of the button for example.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.050
Add ingredient and then a handler.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.760
Now come back to this handler later.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.230
For now it will be empty.

02:20.350 --> 02:21.570
Function.

02:21.730 --> 02:30.430
I'll also be fine and that red button this button should be remove all ingredients so that if we already

02:30.430 --> 02:36.300
have ingredients we delete them all so that we are able to clear our list of ingredients and hirable

02:36.310 --> 02:38.500
assign a new property to this button.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.080
The row property which are set to destructive.

02:42.250 --> 02:47.880
Again a list of all away level roles can be found on the official documentation.

02:47.890 --> 02:54.310
What this directive will do is it will automatically make as read so that it really stands out that

02:54.310 --> 02:58.620
this button Well destroys something that we should proceed with caution.

02:58.680 --> 03:04.950
And here again I also need to define a handler which again will be an empty erro function for now I

03:04.990 --> 03:06.720
will revisit this later.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.260
Well and finally I'll add a last button to this.

03:11.290 --> 03:20.290
This button here will simply have a text of cancell and a roll of cancel and I won't assign a handler

03:20.410 --> 03:23.560
and therefore it will simply close the action sheet.

03:23.650 --> 03:27.150
As a side note all buttons will close the action.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.940
But normally the handler code runs before this.

03:29.980 --> 03:34.120
But if you don't have a handler Well it will just close it and that's exactly what the cancel button

03:34.120 --> 03:34.970
should do.

03:35.290 --> 03:39.160
So kind of similar with the buttons of the dialog.

03:39.190 --> 03:44.600
I showed you in the last ep but now this extra steep sliding up from the bottom.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.980
Now it's not doing SUPER much right now right.

03:46.990 --> 03:49.430
With all those handlers being empty.

03:49.490 --> 03:53.160
That populate those handlers with some live in the next lecture.
