WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:08.140
We're now able to sign into our apt to create users and we're now able to also track if we're signed

00:08.140 --> 00:10.140
in or not as a next step.

00:10.180 --> 00:16.660
I want to add a functionality which allows me to save a shopping list so that if I have to moÃ«t items

00:16.720 --> 00:23.560
on this list that I can actually save this to a server and fetch it later if I log into this app again

00:23.590 --> 00:29.380
because it's not stored on some device storage as a side note we will dive into storing something on

00:29.380 --> 00:31.640
the local device in the next app.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.750
So how shall we start.

00:33.820 --> 00:39.340
What would be nice if we had some dropdown menu here which allows us to choose between saving and loading

00:39.340 --> 00:40.060
the data.

00:40.240 --> 00:46.300
And ironic too has a nice component which helps us with that in the ionic to component documentation.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.200
You can have a look at the pop over.

00:48.220 --> 00:53.770
This is the element we're going to use you pop over just this nice pop over well that's where the name

00:53.770 --> 00:54.470
comes from.

00:54.490 --> 01:00.730
You saw in the app demo at the beginning of the section it's pretty simple to implement and it has some

01:00.730 --> 01:03.190
similarity to modal.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.580
So let's have a look at how it works in order to implement a pop over.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.170
We first need a page which will serve estus pop over.

01:11.170 --> 01:18.640
This again is the similarity to the mode I was referring to it as the model has a full page behind the

01:18.640 --> 01:23.480
scenes or loads a full page as a pop over to the current page.

01:23.770 --> 01:30.370
Now I would create this page in a subfolder to the shopping list folder.

01:30.490 --> 01:34.270
I'll name it s l options shopping list options.

01:34.270 --> 01:41.020
This will be the name of this page so I'll create a new file here s l options dot TS and you could use

01:41.020 --> 01:45.730
the sealife words but you can't create pages in a subfolder with the Seelye which.

01:45.820 --> 01:47.530
Which is why I'll do it manually.

01:47.860 --> 01:56.500
So you're all export does class s SL options is the name of these options page though is the name of

01:56.510 --> 02:03.910
this component and of course it is a type compound word it is a angular component I should say.

02:03.910 --> 02:08.590
So let's add two component decorator to this class here to make it a component.

02:08.960 --> 02:17.120
I'll add a selector here which is page s.l options and more importantly I'll add a template and I'll

02:17.120 --> 02:20.600
use tactics because I want to create the inline template.

02:20.600 --> 02:27.920
Now here the template I'll set up the page I want to display as a pop over fruit as pop over feature.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.650
We're going to implement in a second.

02:30.680 --> 02:36.650
Now here you can basically create a normal page make it look however you want though important you don't

02:36.710 --> 02:43.400
add Ironhead are in and I'm content just add and you want to have inside of your pop over because it

02:43.400 --> 02:46.380
will only be icons and there will be no header and footer.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.740
It's kind of a limited page.

02:49.750 --> 02:50.820
You were at in here.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.640
This is important to keep in mind for a pop over only create the page content here.

02:55.670 --> 03:02.230
What you would normally place between I-and content and here I would simply use the ion grid queues

03:02.450 --> 03:07.370
You could also structure this as a list whatever you like in this thread.

03:07.400 --> 03:13.250
I'm going to the text center direct because I want to center everything I'll have I in row of course

03:14.090 --> 03:22.760
and in I in row I'll add mine Culham where I will have age free element let's say where I say store

03:22.850 --> 03:30.710
and load and you could style is different to use a different element of course or add another row below

03:30.740 --> 03:32.860
this I-and row.

03:33.080 --> 03:41.300
And in this row I want to have my first button this button will then hold my Or you will present me

03:41.300 --> 03:44.410
with the store option or with the load option let's say.

03:44.540 --> 03:48.130
So add a button with I and button placed on it.

03:48.200 --> 03:55.580
I want to have the outline look to have no background but just border and you can change this of course

03:55.940 --> 04:03.380
and I'll add a click listener Raul say on action load because here this will trigger do you load action

04:03.380 --> 04:06.820
let's say and I of course have to implement this method thereafter.

04:06.830 --> 04:14.530
So here I will give it a caption of load list and then I'll add another row below that row here with

04:14.530 --> 04:22.550
an average column where either you guessed it will also add another button of course again with iron

04:22.590 --> 04:26.210
button out line at a click Lisner way.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.720
Fire on action this time with the store argument.

04:30.760 --> 04:36.130
And you could also pass S.R.O and one year it's arguments whatever you prefer.

04:36.130 --> 04:46.030
So save the last days ISDE caption and with that I got my basic template set up four days Essel options

04:46.030 --> 04:47.020
page.

04:47.020 --> 04:53.560
Now of course I also need to add the on load Meffert which you will know on action of last year on the

04:53.560 --> 04:58.120
action method which will be responsible for executing the correct action.

04:58.390 --> 05:06.490
And what I want to do here is I want to dismiss the pop over so I will inject the view controller remembered

05:06.540 --> 05:08.470
the modal lecture.

05:08.470 --> 05:15.700
This is how you do dismiss the modal and this works the same for a pop over which like a modal simply

05:15.700 --> 05:18.590
is an overlay to the currently loaded page.

05:18.850 --> 05:25.330
So here I can then use the View Controller to dismiss this page and that is where I actually want to

05:25.570 --> 05:27.770
pass my action.

05:27.850 --> 05:31.100
So your D action is a string load or store.

05:31.450 --> 05:37.890
And I will simply pass on this action and I won't pass it like this and said Astorino Chavez could object.

05:37.910 --> 05:42.240
We're all set action to action so stored in a property named action.

05:42.310 --> 05:48.180
And this allows me to then handle this action on the shopping list page instead of this pop over.

05:48.190 --> 05:54.430
You don't have to use this pattern but I like to have all my shopping related code in the shopping list

05:54.430 --> 05:55.850
page itself.

05:56.320 --> 06:03.550
So with this we're almost there but we can see this pop over right now in order to see it all go to

06:03.550 --> 06:05.890
the shopping list HDMI file.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.930
And here I need to add it to the nav bar.

06:07.930 --> 06:11.410
I want to have a button which opens to pop over.

06:11.410 --> 06:17.310
Now I will add a new and buttons block here because I don't want to place it at the start.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.230
Instead I want to place it at the end.

06:21.500 --> 06:28.460
And this new button here will of course received the iron button styling it will only hold and I can

06:28.820 --> 06:29.830
add up and click.

06:29.990 --> 06:34.580
I want to trigger on show options which will trigger this pop over.

06:34.940 --> 06:40.610
And then the button I simply place the eye and I can already found a fitting one with the name more

06:40.670 --> 06:45.790
which will just be free dots which kind of indicates you compress on me to get more options.

06:45.840 --> 06:51.820
Again Giusti I can you prefer Well with that your shopping list typescript file.

06:51.850 --> 06:58.050
I'll add this new method on show options and here I want to present this pop over.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.340
We created a page we will use as a template.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.070
But right now we're not using this.

07:02.170 --> 07:08.080
We will use it for a special control of though and you probably guessed the name of this control or

07:09.030 --> 07:14.920
I'm storing it in a property name pop over controller does name is up to you of course but then it is

07:14.920 --> 07:24.070
of type pop over controller which needs to be imported from ionic angular like this here.

07:24.490 --> 07:31.270
So if this I'm injecting the pop over controller storing it in this property we're now in on show options.

07:31.270 --> 07:34.820
I can treat a new pop over like this.

07:34.870 --> 07:37.200
Pop over controller create.

07:37.300 --> 07:42.200
And now here we're not passing a Chavez trip object as we do for alert controller and so on.

07:42.430 --> 07:48.190
But like for the mobile controller here we simply passed the page we want to load.

07:48.220 --> 07:56.560
So the s l option page and of course we also need to add this page to our declarations aere in our app

07:56.560 --> 07:57.160
module.

07:57.160 --> 08:03.610
So let's quickly do this and also add the import in this file and also added two entry components because

08:03.610 --> 08:11.450
we're still not loading those fluids selector or frood England to router Now if this in place we're

08:11.810 --> 08:13.850
creating this pop over.

08:13.880 --> 08:20.570
Now what I can do is I can simply presented and will implement the rest of the logic later.

08:20.570 --> 08:23.690
For now let's stick with that and let's see if this actually works.

08:23.780 --> 08:32.130
If we are able to see a pop over so we see the three dots if I click on it we see store and load.

08:32.280 --> 08:37.150
It doesn't look like a pop although it's simply a dialogue in the middle of the screen.

08:37.260 --> 08:41.010
So something is not working as expected.

08:41.010 --> 08:48.150
The reason it's not working as expected is that the pop over has no chance of knowing where this button

08:48.150 --> 08:50.130
sits which triggered the event.

08:50.280 --> 08:55.050
Well theoretically you could argue it would have a chance but it's not inferring this automatically.

08:55.380 --> 09:02.490
Instead in the template off the shopping list page we have to pass the event object cutis on show options

09:02.490 --> 09:07.130
method where we create this model where we are not mold what we create as pop or where it is.

09:07.200 --> 09:14.170
And then on the pre-sent method I actually have to pass some arguments and here there is a research

09:14.190 --> 09:16.990
property name Eevee for event.

09:17.220 --> 09:22.680
So here we received this event we're passing on with a dollar sign event here.

09:22.950 --> 09:27.810
Since it's a click listener We know that this will be of type mouse event.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.830
But this doesn't really matter does type assignment here.

09:31.950 --> 09:39.460
What matters though is that we assign this event object we're getting here as an argument to this property

09:39.610 --> 09:42.460
in this object we're passing to the present method.

09:42.670 --> 09:49.510
And this will allow the pop over to extract where to render itself because the mouse event will store

09:49.510 --> 09:55.560
the coordinates of this event and therefore it's able to determine where we actually trigger event where

09:55.630 --> 09:57.750
in place if we now go back and click on it.

09:57.850 --> 10:03.510
Now you see it actually loads at the top and points to where we trigger event.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.880
Now this is working correctly.

10:05.970 --> 10:08.340
With that we got our pop over.

10:08.470 --> 10:12.030
We can now continue working on making those buttons work.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.670
So we actually are able to load and save our data.
