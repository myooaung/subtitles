00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.300
You know the procedure let's first see what we're going to build and the section this is the app we

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.030
are going to build.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.690
And since it will mainly be about using native device Futurist it of course runs on my native device

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.080
here.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.810
I'm mirroring the screen.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.230
It's the awesome places.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.390
And as the name indicates we can add awesome places.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.930
So let's add one here we are.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.160
Now we could start by giving those title like let's say my home since I'm well sitting at home and this

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.090
will be awesome place I can say something about right now.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.890
It a short description.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.290
It's awesome Of course so.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.620
Let's quickly notice here that it is awesome.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.080
And more importantly let's now pick a location.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.110
Now I could locate myself here using geolocation and fetching my current location but I don't really

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.770
want to do it as here because I don't really want to show where I live right.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.100
So instead I'm going to pick select on map which will open Google Maps and this is centered somewhere

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.140
in New York City.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.780
I would live there but I think we have a lot of awesome places there.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.730
So let's pick any place by tapping there confirming this is our awesome place.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.980
And now let's also take a picture now.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.180
This will be my actual camera.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.600
And now do you see how many others as you can see the picture in the picture and the picture and so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.990
on.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.060
So let's now take this awesome picture here.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.100
Looks good to me.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.230
Let's use that photo.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.160
Here we are.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.390
So now this awesome place is stored down there.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.160
My screen and well the Google Maps part here.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.590
And now if that I can add this place so seems like it worked.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.570
Let's go back and hear my all someplace else on this nice card on the homescreen and we can tap it to

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.800
see the information and then we reclosed the model or if we wish to do so to simply delete it.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.050
This is the app we're going to build.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.730
It doesn't have super many pages.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.980
It's less about the pages and the styling.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.860
We already worked on this a lot in the last apps in this app I really want to focus on using those native

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.140
device features like the camera like the location.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.280
And also you might not have noticed this but also on how to store things how to store this image on

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.610
our device for example and also how to store the places on our device so that if we were to close this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.580
app and reopen it that they are still there.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.160
And just to demonstrate this data persistency I added the number place and now I'm going to kill my

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.610
app and restart it.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.830
And guess what the place is still there and the image is also still there.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.380
So somehow both are stored on my device and this is what I'm talking about.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.790
This is what will also cover so if dead.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.530
Let's dive into building this app in the next lecture.
