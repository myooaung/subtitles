00:01.970 --> 00:06.320
So now that we built and added that our first application let's see what else discourse has in store

00:06.320 --> 00:07.270
for you.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.260
We're almost done getting started.

00:09.260 --> 00:14.600
And in the next section we're going to have super deep into ionic too in the next section we're going

00:14.600 --> 00:19.100
to have a look at some of ionic to SpaceX which we definitely need to understand before we can start

00:19.100 --> 00:21.860
building apps such as How is the project structured.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.010
What are pages.

00:23.120 --> 00:28.040
How do we navigate around and I want ironic to end much more with data and out of the way it's time

00:28.040 --> 00:29.300
to build our first EP.

00:29.330 --> 00:34.490
The favorite quotes app will be a basic app which covers a lot of the features it too gives us like

00:34.490 --> 00:35.120
components.

00:35.120 --> 00:40.750
We will also learn how to Femen style or how to manage data and how to integrate more complex navigations

00:40.790 --> 00:43.520
like having tabs or a side menu.

00:43.520 --> 00:49.160
After building the first application I'll dive deeper into the ionic two components and show you where

00:49.160 --> 00:53.490
to learn more and dive deeper into some specific components which are very important.

00:53.750 --> 00:59.020
Until then we only saw the app run the browser and this is great for testing and seeing how it works.

00:59.120 --> 01:04.780
But we also need to test it on real devices to really judge if it is a fitting candidate for release

01:05.030 --> 01:10.160
and therefore we will thereafter have a look at how we can run our app on emulators or real devices

01:10.160 --> 01:12.910
for both iOS and Android.

01:12.950 --> 01:17.390
After finishing this section we'll build our next ep the recipe book.

01:17.390 --> 01:23.440
This will all use a lot of components navigation and so on but it will also specifically focus on forms

01:23.440 --> 01:27.260
of validation and managing user input or managing data in general.

01:27.260 --> 01:34.910
So we have these user input driven focus thereafter will enhance the application and also add HTP and

01:34.910 --> 01:41.120
authentication cutis recipe book so that we are able to store our recipes on a server on a per account

01:41.180 --> 01:46.340
level so that we are able to also sign up and sign in users something you will probably need in any

01:46.340 --> 01:48.320
application you're building.

01:48.440 --> 01:54.890
After having added this we will dive into the last application the awesome places app this application

01:54.890 --> 02:00.650
will use something we haven't used before in this course native device features and device storage of

02:00.710 --> 02:06.470
that I mean features like using the camera or accessing the file system and also how we may store our

02:06.470 --> 02:12.470
data which we thus far always stored in services which of course don't persist and are deleted if we

02:12.470 --> 02:13.760
kill the application.

02:13.760 --> 02:19.850
So how we can store data on the device in a database on the device for example something you will probably

02:19.850 --> 02:21.960
need for any application you're going to build.

02:22.070 --> 02:28.370
And with this fourth EP in this course we will have a closer look at this well and with all that build

02:28.460 --> 02:33.690
it's time to learn how we may deploy our app and prepare it for deployment before shipping it to stores.

02:33.890 --> 02:40.370
And if that's not enough for you I also got to resections with tips and tricks which show you how you

02:40.370 --> 02:45.430
may implement certain things in your ionic too which don't really fit into one of the average sections

02:45.430 --> 02:52.490
here in the course and angular recap section where you can dive into any law or if you feel like you

02:52.490 --> 02:58.700
need to refresh your knowledge on it and definitely feel free to skip ahead to this section right now

02:59.000 --> 03:04.070
if you feel like you need to do this before going for the course which probably makes sense if you want

03:04.070 --> 03:05.730
to refresh your knowledge.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.560
So with that out of the way daises of what I offer you in this course.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.370
Let's next also have a look at how you get the most out of discourse
