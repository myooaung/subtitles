00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:09.970
Awesome you did you learned a lot about AM on to your fruity main part of this chorus.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.420
I still get a section with some tips and tricks examples you might need in your application and they're

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.380
also as angler.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.540
To recap section which you might not need if you're at this point off the course but you should now

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.910
be confident using all these tools.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.810
We learned in this course to build awesome ionic to applications.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.950
You learn how to project to work which components are shipped with how navigation works how to access

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.320
native device features and much more.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.860
You'll learn how to take your anger to knowledge and take that to build native apps for real devices

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.420
for Android and iOS devices with those skills gained.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.290
I can only encourage you to take them to practice with them.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.940
But some example project.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.090
Think about apps you might want to build and then start building them set your own challenges.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.000
Dive deeper into this.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.230
Use the official ionic documentation to learn more about that specific component you want to use and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.500
then take that knowledge in both the next real project you wanted to build with it build a real application

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.920
which you then publish in the app stores.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.600
I would be so proud to see you do that.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.570
I would be so happy to see you do that and I strongly believe you've now got all the tools it takes

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.820
to do so.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.290
Definitely share anything you did publish.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.670
Definitely share any work you were able to create after finishing this course.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.560
I am very interested in seeing this and what this.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.370
I can only hope to see you again in future courses see you in the queue in A.S.C. what you built with

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.690
all the knowledge you gained and just wish you a great time.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.290
