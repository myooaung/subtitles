00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.050
In this section we both uncover application and like the first application.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.950
This really is the application as you could build it for a real project.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.650
Well almost D.S. management kind of has an issue but we'll come back to this later in the course and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.890
learn how we can save our data somewhere where it persists so that it isn't wiped out the next time

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.540
we start the application.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.370
Besides dead you'll learn a lot.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.470
You learn how to handle user input how to fetch it how to validate it and how to use both the template

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.890
driven anti reactive approach.
