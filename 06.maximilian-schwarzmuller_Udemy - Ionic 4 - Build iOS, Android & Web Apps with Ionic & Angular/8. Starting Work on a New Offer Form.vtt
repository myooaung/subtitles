00:02.340 --> 00:08.580
Let's work on that new offer PAGE AND FOR DAD I'M INTO PLACES offers new offer folder and here's the

00:08.580 --> 00:09.360
new offer.

00:09.360 --> 00:15.840
HD team Al filed here I had my grip playground I don't need that anymore so let's remove that I will

00:15.840 --> 00:17.330
work with the iron grip though.

00:17.340 --> 00:23.820
But now in a more beautiful way and indeed I will use the grid and not iron list here to structure my

00:23.820 --> 00:28.980
different inputs because I always want to have some input sit next to each other now and that will not

00:28.980 --> 00:33.300
work with the iron and list that only positions items from top to bottom.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.800
So let's start.

00:34.810 --> 00:43.980
And first of all I'll assign a size here for this column and I'll make sure that if we are on smaller

00:44.010 --> 00:53.190
devices or bigger we only take six columns and I add my offset s m of three here and then I'll start

00:53.190 --> 00:59.340
with the first iron item that will wrap my first iron label and iron and put here and the first input

00:59.340 --> 01:02.160
is all about the title of the place we're offering.

01:02.190 --> 01:10.160
So all gives us a label of title and then add iron input type text here.

01:10.360 --> 01:17.920
Now what do I haven't shown you thus far about what you can set on these inputs here are our special

01:17.920 --> 01:24.560
attributes ionic supports like auto complete and auto correct.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.710
And they will do just what it sounds like.

01:26.710 --> 01:33.130
They will make sure that especially also on real mobile devices you get auto correction and auto completion

01:33.130 --> 01:39.040
turn on and of course you can admit this if you don't want that behavior or explicitly set it to false

01:39.040 --> 01:39.400
even.

01:39.730 --> 01:48.010
But here I will add it also to show these attributes you can set and that is then my title here.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.370
Now we're not done with a title.

01:50.670 --> 01:58.460
I also want to allow users to enter a description and therefore in a new ion row I'll add a number I

01:58.460 --> 02:07.710
in column which will get the same sizing and offset as the first column and then design column I'll

02:07.710 --> 02:09.940
add yet another ion item with it.

02:10.140 --> 02:15.660
I in labeling it which is our short description for the place we're creating.

02:15.870 --> 02:22.140
And there I'll add i in text area actually just as we have a text area.

02:22.150 --> 02:30.210
Normal HDL ionic all day has one and just as in normal HDL the ion text area is simply the input that

02:30.210 --> 02:35.310
can span across multiple lines and allows us to enter longer text.

02:35.310 --> 02:40.800
Now by the way since I've regarded both labels should have a position of floating.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.850
So let me add it to the title label and then of course also to the short description label here.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.490
Now back to the text area.

02:48.630 --> 02:54.780
Just as on the text area each time all element you can add a rose attribute and set this to the amount

02:54.780 --> 02:57.390
of rows this text area should show as a default.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.420
And I'll set this to free.

02:59.820 --> 03:05.640
And in general you can configure this as you can configure the normal aged him l text area and check

03:05.640 --> 03:11.500
your official ionic docs to learn all about these components and how you can configure them which attributes

03:11.540 --> 03:13.670
support and so on.

03:13.800 --> 03:20.520
So that's the text area below that I want to have input for the price and therefore I'll just copy that

03:20.520 --> 03:28.710
first ion row with the title in there edit here and replace the title label here with price and this

03:28.710 --> 03:35.190
will be of type no because users should indeed enter a number here and not some text and therefore I

03:35.190 --> 03:42.010
don't need auto completion or auto correction on their so thus far the text area is new but other than

03:42.010 --> 03:43.780
that it's pretty standard.

03:43.780 --> 03:49.030
Now let's have a look at a component that is not that much of a standard component but that is pretty

03:49.030 --> 03:51.820
common in mobile apps and that is pretty powerful.
