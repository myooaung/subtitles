Let's first of all have a look at which kind of performance we need in this app.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.700
And there will have to offer indication for him.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.450
I got this single e-mail input here.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.490
Now obviously I'm not just interested in fetching the e-mail.

00:15.500 --> 00:21.260
I also want to get a password and I want to allow the user to switch between the sign up and log in

00:21.260 --> 00:21.890
mode.

00:21.890 --> 00:24.190
So that is one thing we'll have to work on.

00:24.530 --> 00:26.770
Then we also can book places.

00:26.840 --> 00:33.350
So here on that booking model which we can open in two different ways with our own custom date being

00:33.350 --> 00:36.070
selected or a random date already filled in.

00:36.080 --> 00:42.530
So in this model I want to allow the user to enter some booking data and for example select the date

00:42.530 --> 00:46.010
range for which you want to book that place.

00:46.010 --> 00:50.540
Now last but not least on offers we can of course add a new offering here.

00:50.540 --> 00:56.390
So currently I have my great playground there that is of course not what will leave here.

00:56.390 --> 01:00.930
Instead here I want to have a nice form that we can use to create a new offer.

01:01.250 --> 01:04.310
So a new place we want all four to be precise.

01:04.310 --> 01:10.200
This is what I want to add here in this application three different forms.

01:10.220 --> 01:14.840
I will use both the template driven anti reactive forms approach in this module and therefore let's

01:14.840 --> 01:18.230
dive in and let's actually start with the authentication form here.
