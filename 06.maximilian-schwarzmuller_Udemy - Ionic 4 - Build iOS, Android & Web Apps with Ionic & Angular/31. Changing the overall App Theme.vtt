00:02.110 --> 00:05.640
In the last lecture we implemented this sliding effect here.

00:05.680 --> 00:09.040
And with that I'm pretty happy with the core functionality.

00:09.090 --> 00:14.490
Now there's one thing missing though and that is the theming.

00:14.650 --> 00:17.550
And actually there are two things missing.

00:17.590 --> 00:19.170
You see the settings page here.

00:19.180 --> 00:20.960
We're not using it at all.

00:21.010 --> 00:28.870
Now I want to start with the theming before I come to implementing this side menu and the settings page

00:29.050 --> 00:31.720
which has only one setting related to theming.

00:31.750 --> 00:36.010
It will allow us to switch to background to change the background.

00:36.340 --> 00:42.880
At the end of the last core section I briefly gave you an overview over how theming works in an ironic

00:42.920 --> 00:46.300
two application you may or may not recall this.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.800
We haven't really worked with it.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.490
Now it's the time to do that.

00:49.840 --> 00:56.800
I explained that we have this theme folder with this variable's file which contains a couple of variables.

00:56.830 --> 01:03.690
I want to use this and which allows us to define our own variables or to override built in variables.

01:03.730 --> 01:09.360
Again as mentioned before a good place to learn more is the official resource or the official documentation.

01:09.730 --> 01:15.970
And here's the theming resource you can learn more about how theming generally works and how you can

01:15.970 --> 01:18.730
override the built in variables.

01:18.790 --> 01:26.190
So here you'll see the overwriting ionic variables document and you got a list of all built in variables

01:26.210 --> 01:28.990
can override quite a lot.

01:28.990 --> 01:33.580
The cool thing is here you can also search for some of them and I will explain how that works.

01:33.580 --> 01:41.230
Now let's go back to our editor and let's say we want to change a couple of things we want to change

01:41.290 --> 01:43.990
the default color the primary color.

01:44.350 --> 01:46.850
Maybe we also want to add our own color.

01:46.870 --> 01:54.980
We can then use so that we can not only say color danger and so on but also color our own color.

01:55.480 --> 02:03.540
And I also want to override one built in variable the padding right now and it's not that bad.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.870
But right now we have quite a lot of padding here.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.120
I'd say CD4 padding are used for mobile apps.

02:09.140 --> 02:10.350
There's nothing wrong with it.

02:10.360 --> 02:15.010
But I also want to show how you can could change this very very easily.

02:15.010 --> 02:20.760
We're introducing this padding Freudians padding attribute here.

02:20.890 --> 02:27.510
It would be kind of tedious to remove does attribute everywhere and overwrite us with our own styling.

02:27.580 --> 02:33.400
It's much easier to go to this variable's file and here under shared variables though you can edit anywhere

02:33.400 --> 02:34.260
in this file.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.940
So I'm just adding it here to keep the general structure eye on it to wants to us to keep to make this

02:39.970 --> 02:41.620
easier to understand.

02:42.040 --> 02:49.360
I can add a variable and it can either add a new variable like my own variable which I then could use

02:49.360 --> 02:51.860
for my s.c.s as files.

02:51.880 --> 02:56.370
And this is a kind of advanced if you're familiar with how SAS and variables work.

02:56.830 --> 03:02.090
But the easy way is to overwrite the built in one like content padding.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.850
This is a variable.

03:03.900 --> 03:10.360
Ionic team Autum already created for me and we can see that this is the case year and the overwriting

03:10.370 --> 03:12.100
ionic variables document.

03:12.280 --> 03:19.860
If I search for content padding you see does exist and the default value is 16 pixels.

03:19.870 --> 03:23.030
Now how do you find out if a variable exists.

03:23.230 --> 03:28.690
Well if you're interested in padding a great start would be to search for padding and you see that padding

03:28.690 --> 03:34.720
is defined differently for different types of components which kind of makes sense because you don't

03:34.720 --> 03:37.710
want to have 16 pixels of padding everywhere.

03:38.050 --> 03:45.490
If I'm adding padding here on the content it should definitely not be the same number as if I were to

03:45.490 --> 03:47.350
add padding here maybe.

03:47.620 --> 03:54.430
So therefore the ionic team created different numbers of padding for different components you can use

03:54.430 --> 04:00.310
the padding directive on quite a lot of Kontum But you see that somewhere in between there also is this

04:00.310 --> 04:06.040
contemned padding which you can find out if you search for content padding like this you don't have

04:06.040 --> 04:07.650
to put the dash in between.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.230
So it is quite a powerful search.

04:09.230 --> 04:13.720
It tells us content padding it exists so we can override it again.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.390
Default values are 16 pixels so this would achieve nothing.

04:17.530 --> 04:26.050
But we could change it to 8 pixels so Hoffert if I do this and I save this is already enough to lower

04:26.170 --> 04:26.970
the padding.

04:27.010 --> 04:28.750
You see it's closer to the edge.

04:28.750 --> 04:33.960
Now this gets especially visible if I reduced this to one for example.

04:33.970 --> 04:42.530
Now it's much smaller and if my set is to Ciro while now there still is a little bit of padding.

04:42.720 --> 04:48.420
But here for example is no padding and a little bit of padding we have for the cards simply stems from

04:48.420 --> 04:52.500
the card element itself which has some margins set up.

04:52.590 --> 04:59.870
So let's set this to 8 pixels to lower DD spacier a little bit.

05:00.390 --> 05:05.980
And as I said I also want to overwrite the color and introduce my own one.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.580
Now you learned how to add your own variables or how to overwrite existing ones for colorists.

05:11.580 --> 05:14.880
We get this useful colorists map here.

05:14.880 --> 05:22.090
This is a color is variable and it holds a couple of predefined colors but we can also add our own ones.

05:22.230 --> 05:28.910
For example if I want to set a specific color for the background of a quote I could name a quote back

05:28.910 --> 05:30.570
background any name you want.

05:30.990 --> 05:34.920
And I prepared a color which I found pretty nice.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.310
Let's say it does hex code here.

05:38.570 --> 05:45.800
With this I'm setting up my own color and I can now use this for example here in the favorite's page

05:46.190 --> 05:51.650
for my quotes there and I'll sign it on the and item here.

05:51.880 --> 05:59.870
Antique color property and simply use quote background the name I just set up in the color map in the

05:59.870 --> 06:01.490
variables file.

06:01.490 --> 06:07.370
If I save this and let it rebuild have a look at the new background of my quotes If I favorite this

06:07.370 --> 06:08.220
quote.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.320
Now you see it has this light greenish background.

06:11.330 --> 06:18.050
This is how easy you can change parts of your app and keep in mind you can now reuse quote background

06:18.530 --> 06:25.430
with the color property here anywhere in your app where ever you want to use it.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.850
So that's pretty pretty powerful.

06:29.030 --> 06:32.230
Now the other thing you can do of course is override defaults.

06:32.270 --> 06:38.450
So the primary color here for example can also be changed and also already prepared a nice color for

06:38.510 --> 06:39.430
this.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.290
So I want to change just to this hex code.

06:42.290 --> 06:48.560
F F B B series 0 which has this nice nice golden light touch.

06:48.800 --> 06:55.340
And now you see everything which was blue before it's now in this golden style.

06:55.340 --> 07:00.710
This is how easy it is to style your application and to change the theming.

07:00.710 --> 07:02.990
This is what makes ionic two really fun.

07:03.020 --> 07:08.880
It's super simple to really fine tune to your needs and to adjust to your theme.

07:08.900 --> 07:14.360
So now with that with themed our app the missing pieces a side menu with the settings page we're going

07:14.360 --> 07:15.510
to work on this next
