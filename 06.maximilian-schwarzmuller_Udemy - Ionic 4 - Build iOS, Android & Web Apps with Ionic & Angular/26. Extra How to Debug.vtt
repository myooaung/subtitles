Now when working with native device features debugging is something which can be kind of tricky.

00:07.400 --> 00:13.500
And one to guide you to go to those Corda the pages which you can find in the ionic documentation under

00:13.530 --> 00:15.000
installation at the very bottom.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.520
Those platform guides.

00:16.860 --> 00:24.360
And there you will also find parts on how you may debug your application for example within X killed

00:24.390 --> 00:25.350
by opening it there.

00:25.350 --> 00:29.250
Make sure to run ionic build Aiwass before doing this.

00:29.340 --> 00:35.610
Then you can open it there and then you can follow the steps described here to debug the next code.

00:35.670 --> 00:41.160
For example you get this console very you can also log with console log to check the state of a certain

00:41.160 --> 00:42.600
property at some point of time.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.560
So these are tools you can use in this case.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.190
And for Android it's the same.

00:47.190 --> 00:53.700
Check out the core of the documentation and here you will also find a debugging area where you can find

00:53.700 --> 01:00.500
her to debug with Android studio so that you're also able to find your errors by having a look at this.

01:00.630 --> 01:03.460
And by seeing a console log and so on.

01:03.570 --> 01:09.210
So these are useful tools to narrow down what's going wrong again especially useful might be to place

01:09.210 --> 01:15.920
their occasional console lock statement in there to see what this file name actually is or whatever

01:15.930 --> 01:16.960
might be wrong.

01:16.980 --> 01:23.580
Also lock those error messages and then view them in the log of X code or Android way Android studio

01:23.730 --> 01:25.510
to find out what went wrong.

01:25.530 --> 01:31.060
This is how you can narrow down the problem to find out what's going wrong on the native device.

01:31.230 --> 01:33.070
And again just because it's so good.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.930
Always consider having a look at the official documentation here.

01:36.960 --> 01:43.200
It's really great when it comes to debugging or to finding out which features you have to use in a certain

01:43.200 --> 01:43.780
way.
