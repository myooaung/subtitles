So let's add some tabs to the places page now. Tabs are a common navigation concept you see in mobile

00:09.170 --> 00:15.020
apps, you can of course use them on web apps just as well but you especially see them in mobile apps

00:15.980 --> 00:21.200
and tabs basically allow you to, well press the different tabs in the bottom tab bar and then load different

00:21.200 --> 00:23.510
pages based on which tab you pressed.

00:23.570 --> 00:29.510
One important takeaway is that you will have separate navigation page stacks and that just means that

00:29.840 --> 00:35.780
when you are in tab one, so on the left side here and there let's say you have a button which takes you

00:35.810 --> 00:42.080
to some child page and you go there and then you press the other tab without going back first, then on

00:42.080 --> 00:48.950
the other tab, you also go to let's say a child page and another child page, so you have three pages

00:48.950 --> 00:53.840
on the page stack on the right tab and two pages on the page stack in the left

00:53.840 --> 00:59.870
tab. If you then go back from the right tab to the left tab, you'll go back to that previous page stack

00:59.870 --> 01:00.790
with the two pages

01:00.830 --> 01:04.430
and if you go back to the second tab, you'll go back to that stack page.

01:04.430 --> 01:11.510
So the separate page stacks are kept around and are separated from each other so they don't mix or anything

01:11.510 --> 01:12.260
like that and

01:12.350 --> 01:18.830
that of course is very useful for making sure that navigation is stored and users don't reset their

01:18.830 --> 01:24.230
navigation by using tabs which would be a strange user experience.

01:24.230 --> 01:27.410
So how do we implement the tabs into our application then?
