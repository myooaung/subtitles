00:02.280 --> 00:07.980
That uploading logic should go into our places service where we have the average logic for storing a

00:07.980 --> 00:09.420
place as well.

00:09.480 --> 00:16.480
Now we have the app place method here now essentially want to add a new method which I'll name upload

00:16.570 --> 00:22.850
image which gets the image which here always is I'll file it must not be a string here and that is the

00:22.850 --> 00:28.910
reason why I added this string to file conversion function earlier in this module.

00:28.910 --> 00:35.390
Now we'll send an HDP request your cute AT REST API endpoint which was added through debt firebase cloud

00:35.390 --> 00:38.780
function and we'll append some form data there.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.350
So let's create a new content upload data which is a new form data object.

00:43.370 --> 00:50.170
This is a default javascript construct that we can use to group data which is of mixed type.

00:50.180 --> 00:55.430
So basically files and text group that together and attach it to a request.

00:55.430 --> 01:02.990
Now to add upload data I will append a new key or a new field which gets a name of image that should

01:02.990 --> 01:03.710
be my image.

01:03.740 --> 01:07.120
So that image file and that should be it.

01:07.190 --> 01:09.630
That should be all you need to do.

01:09.980 --> 01:17.690
Then we can use the angular age to be client to send the post request to that you are L which was created

01:17.690 --> 01:21.650
here so let's copy that you are L an added in here.

01:23.490 --> 01:29.250
And as a second argument at this upload data form data object we created.

01:29.250 --> 01:33.630
Now what the cloud function will give you back can be defined here between the angle brackets off the

01:33.630 --> 01:39.960
post method we'll get back a javascript object in the end where we have a image you are L which is a

01:39.960 --> 01:46.200
string and the image POV which is a string you are L is a you or L we can use from anywhere to view

01:46.200 --> 01:51.480
the image path is the local path on the back and in case we should need that.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.500
Now with that let's return this year.

01:54.510 --> 02:01.660
This will return is observable which in the end sets up everything for this image upload and let's head

02:01.750 --> 02:05.830
over to the new offer page which is where we want to use that method.

02:05.830 --> 02:13.580
Now in the new offer page here in on create offer I now want to upload the image.

02:13.990 --> 02:20.460
So here once the loading control was shown I'll not call this place a service at place but this places

02:20.490 --> 02:28.060
service upload not update place but upload image and I want to forward this image file.

02:28.060 --> 02:33.360
Good thing is in our form here will only have such files so I can access this forum.

02:33.490 --> 02:41.530
Get image value and that will be a file because we ensure that in on image picked we convert everything

02:41.530 --> 02:46.940
to a file and we don't update this control to hold a file.

02:47.050 --> 02:51.440
So this is the value I pass to upload image and now this returns the observable.

02:51.450 --> 02:59.130
That wraps it is upload H2 DP request therefore I'll add pipe here and then add a switch map which needs

02:59.130 --> 03:05.870
to be imported from our X J S slash operators where we will get that upload response.

03:05.910 --> 03:14.750
So basically dead object with the image you are L.A. image path and in there I now want to call this

03:14.750 --> 03:21.540
place service at place and return that because this all the returns and observable and inside of switch

03:21.540 --> 03:27.650
map we do have to return unobservable and the special thing now justice that I need to add my image

03:27.660 --> 03:32.840
your L Q MY PLACE NOW ADD place.

03:32.870 --> 03:41.220
Thus far we have a look at the place a service at place takes no image you are L because right now we

03:41.220 --> 03:48.300
always hardcoded that time to change dead and time to accept an image you are L which is a string here

03:48.600 --> 03:57.050
and use that in here and now with the add place changed back to the new offer page we have to pass this

03:57.050 --> 04:03.240
image you are all here and thankfully we can because in our upload response we have that image you are

04:03.240 --> 04:09.200
L and if you're wondering where does this coming from in this cloud function we have the logic to generate

04:09.200 --> 04:16.000
this year L and return it as part of the response here.

04:16.050 --> 04:21.810
So now we returned isn't our switch map here so that India and we can subscribe to all of that and we

04:21.810 --> 04:30.270
should still have our place create it in our database and the image uploaded so let's save this and

04:30.900 --> 04:38.520
let that recompile and let's test it in the browser first here I'll add Munich a lovely city

04:41.490 --> 04:43.470
and add my availability

04:47.630 --> 04:55.590
choose our location and mix it up I'll locate myself and we have a little a back here I see with the

04:55.590 --> 04:57.890
button and the loader we should fix that.

04:58.110 --> 05:03.940
Take a picture and you're all used to file picture picture actually and submit this.

05:04.500 --> 05:15.340
It's creating a place uploading the image and that didn't entirely work.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.430
We seem to have problems fetching the image.

05:17.470 --> 05:26.240
So if we have a look in the database where we have all the offered places the bottom most places the

05:26.240 --> 05:28.340
most recent one and here we have that.

05:28.340 --> 05:34.070
You are El so let's grab that you were El and let's try to view it in the browser.

05:35.360 --> 05:35.990
We get an error.

05:35.990 --> 05:37.530
Permission denied.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.610
The reason for that simply is that in the storage if we have a look

05:44.210 --> 05:49.310
we have to get started here first of all but then we should see that images folder in there.

05:49.310 --> 05:49.580
Yeah.

05:49.580 --> 05:50.840
Thank you so much.

05:53.010 --> 05:53.760
We should see that.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.080
Imagine if I click on that.

05:57.160 --> 05:57.850
This looks good.

05:57.850 --> 06:03.820
So it was uploaded but under rules of that storage you need to allow access to everyone and right now

06:03.820 --> 06:06.160
we're only allowing access to authenticate it users.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.450
We have no authenticated users right now.

06:08.500 --> 06:14.340
So for the moment I'll just set this to true to give everyone access with this updated rule.

06:14.470 --> 06:21.930
If we reload this page here we should be able to fetch and display the image and we can all of course

06:21.930 --> 06:27.720
here in the Discover page where we currently seem to have a bug with the virtual scrolling.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.720
So let's quickly clean up some places here.

06:30.870 --> 06:32.840
You could use that I list to fix that.

06:32.840 --> 06:37.530
Back here let's delete a couple of places

06:48.980 --> 06:52.770
and here we see our newly added place.

06:52.790 --> 07:00.800
Now let's quickly fix the pictures again where we saw the loading indicator next to the button.

07:00.850 --> 07:07.720
We simply need to change this condition here and showed a button if we don't have a selected application

07:07.720 --> 07:13.150
image or if we don't have a preview and we're not loading.

07:13.150 --> 07:19.570
So it needs to be grouped like this was that we should not have that issue anymore.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.700
Let's quickly check that if I had a new place

07:24.490 --> 07:25.900
that if I select the location.

07:25.900 --> 07:26.370
Yeah.

07:26.410 --> 07:27.310
Now it is this fixed.
