In the last lecture I explained that it is kind of a requirement for this course.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.020
And indeed I strongly recommend having some English to knowledge as well as some HVM El NCSA Smollett

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.800
if you want to get the most out of this course.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.680
There's one important requirement I want to bring to your attention right away though if you want to

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:30.080
develop an iOS app you unfortunately really need a Mac or Mac OS wherever dad runs down.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.050
So this is definitely needed.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.170
You will be able of course to create your regular Q app and you are also able to kind of brither you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.870
it how it would look like on an S T Y is in your browser.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.540
I will show you how that works in one of the next lectures.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.080
But if you really are then one to ship it to native devices and one to ship it to the app store you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.740
need a Mac.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.500
That's just how the iOS eco system works.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.630
However for Android there are no such limitations.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.230
And again you are able to develop an app up to a certain point but from that point on you will need

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.800
a Mac
