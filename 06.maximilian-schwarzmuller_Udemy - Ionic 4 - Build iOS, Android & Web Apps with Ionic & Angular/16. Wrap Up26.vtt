00:02.150 --> 00:08.810
So that's it with this first Angular and Ionic module. This is of course a very simple application we

00:08.810 --> 00:09.480
built here,

00:09.500 --> 00:13.320
we'll build a way more complex application for the rest of this course.

00:13.580 --> 00:19.250
But I hope that it's now clear how Ionic and Angular work together, that you still only build on a normal

00:19.280 --> 00:20.170
Angular app here

00:20.180 --> 00:26.570
but you can use these Ionic components, that using Ionic components is easier, especially when you think

00:26.570 --> 00:29.060
about things like the alert controller

00:29.060 --> 00:31.510
and therefore we now have the best of both worlds.

00:31.550 --> 00:35.120
Let's use that best of both worlds to build amazing apps then.
