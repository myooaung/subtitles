00:02.110 --> 00:09.550
Time to implement are alternative background the first step is to add it here in our theme folder in

00:09.560 --> 00:11.000
the variables file.

00:11.030 --> 00:12.820
We have our normal background.

00:12.980 --> 00:16.210
Let's now add the alternative quote background.

00:16.220 --> 00:18.210
This would be a fitting name I think.

00:18.470 --> 00:20.320
And I already created a hex code.

00:20.330 --> 00:25.540
You may use its f 9 b c too.

00:25.580 --> 00:36.560
So this is all light yellow color and I want to use this old background when ever we will have this

00:36.650 --> 00:38.570
option turned on in our settings.

00:38.900 --> 00:42.900
So let's go to our favorites right now here.

00:42.930 --> 00:46.120
We're assigning quote background as to color.

00:46.130 --> 00:53.570
Now nothing wrong with that but I want to change this if we actually do have to do all background turned

00:53.570 --> 00:56.980
on now in order to change this.

00:57.260 --> 01:04.660
I somehow need to pass a different name here depending on whether it's switched on or not.

01:04.670 --> 01:10.390
So I'll implement a helper method here in the typed file a claim and get background.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.520
And here I want to access my setting service.

01:13.520 --> 01:21.050
So let's check this setting service your settings service of typesetting service of course like this.

01:21.050 --> 01:24.140
Make sure to add the import at the top.

01:24.140 --> 01:32.490
And with that added In get background what I want to do is I simply want to return this setting service.

01:32.580 --> 01:34.040
It's all background.

01:34.170 --> 01:37.660
If this is the case I'm using a turn their expression here.

01:37.890 --> 01:42.840
I want to return old quote background as a string.

01:42.840 --> 01:48.570
Otherwise I would just return quote background.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.720
Now this is one way of doing this.

01:50.770 --> 01:59.290
We can now go to our favorites team a file set up color of wire property binding like this and now not

01:59.380 --> 02:07.550
no longer pass a string but instead pass the result of our Get background method here like this.

02:07.660 --> 02:13.960
And if we now save doesn't have a look at this running application we should see that by default it

02:13.960 --> 02:17.340
has the normal background.

02:17.340 --> 02:24.370
Here we add a new quote like this looks like the normal greenish background.

02:24.470 --> 02:31.410
Now I go to settings and switches on and go back you see that golden or yellow like background.

02:31.410 --> 02:36.720
So this is working great but I also want to show you an alternative because it's something important

02:36.720 --> 02:39.310
to all to learn about how you may use your colors.

02:39.420 --> 02:45.090
There's nothing wrong with this approach but you can also choose another approach.

02:45.120 --> 02:53.190
You could also create a special class here in the s.c.s as file and name it all out and in there you're

02:53.220 --> 02:54.850
setting the background color.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.270
And now I'm using a helper method on a gift.

02:57.330 --> 02:59.030
It's called Color.

02:59.070 --> 03:03.120
Here we specify the variable will which holds our color.

03:03.170 --> 03:05.040
That's the color is variable.

03:05.070 --> 03:11.350
Remember that's this very well you could reference any variable here if you have a number variable holding

03:11.350 --> 03:12.880
a color that would be fine too.

03:13.090 --> 03:15.120
But here that's a colorist variable.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.850
And we're not done yet.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.780
This color Meffert.

03:18.790 --> 03:23.440
And again this is only available because we're using s.c.s SCEA it's a helper method created by the

03:23.440 --> 03:28.020
ionic team discolors Mikko's method takes another argument.

03:28.060 --> 03:30.440
And here we have to identify the color.

03:30.500 --> 03:34.640
So Allt quote background for example.

03:34.660 --> 03:41.340
So this is the string we're using in those colors map here all quote background.

03:41.440 --> 03:50.740
So with that I'm now fetching this color dynamically from my variable's file and when the SAS code gets

03:50.740 --> 03:55.400
compiled to real C S S This of course will be replaced with the actual hex code.

03:55.870 --> 04:03.700
So now I treat this all class so we could also say that instead of using this approach here we're leaving

04:03.700 --> 04:07.850
it at the default of using quote background with just a color.

04:08.470 --> 04:19.060
And instead I'm adding the energy class directive and here I'm passing an object and I add the alt class.

04:19.270 --> 04:26.360
If we have you all back Bronzeville adding another class or another method excuse me is all background.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.550
Let's implement this method too.

04:28.990 --> 04:34.170
And here I simply return this setting servers is all background.

04:34.180 --> 04:38.260
Now if you say this you should see the same result as before.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.670
Now differently or achieve differently with Angi class and so on.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.900
Let me favorite this.

04:44.940 --> 04:46.300
See the green background.

04:46.300 --> 04:50.290
Go to settings switch it on CD yellow one.

04:50.350 --> 04:52.700
Switch it off see the green one again.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.980
Probably yes.

04:54.070 --> 04:55.890
So now we have a different approach.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.390
Both approaches work fine.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.890
There is no clear winner whatever you prefer.

04:59.890 --> 05:05.940
The second one uses C-s asked to do this and to assign a special class you can of course always use

05:05.950 --> 05:07.280
Engy style.

05:07.330 --> 05:11.680
There is no limit to your imagination how you can do this.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.230
These are two approaches.

05:13.390 --> 05:16.030
And with that we get a finished application.

05:16.030 --> 05:18.610
Let's take a closer look in the next lecture.
