Now that we learn how this project should look like in the end and that we prepared all these pages,

00:08.130 --> 00:12.600
let's first of all start by adjusting this main routing configuration.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.930
I don't want to have all these routes as root routes like this,

00:16.380 --> 00:22.800
instead I only want to have the root routes here which really are a kind of top level routes and

00:22.800 --> 00:29.210
that would be auth which obviously is something we load as a first route in case we never logged in.

00:29.250 --> 00:34.020
I want to have my places there which will then be the page with the tabs and where I then set up its

00:34.020 --> 00:35.300
own routing

00:35.580 --> 00:41.160
and I want to have my bookings here as a top level route too because that is not a nested route inside

00:41.160 --> 00:42.680
of places or anything like that,

00:42.690 --> 00:47.830
it is a sibling to places logically. All these other routes are not needed here,

00:47.850 --> 00:51.790
I don't want to set them up as top level routes and therefore I'll delete them.

00:51.990 --> 00:57.190
And here as a default when we're logging in, for now I will redirect to places here, later we'll add

00:57.190 --> 01:03.030
an auth guard here and find out whether we are allowed to visit the places and if we're not authenticated,

01:03.030 --> 01:03.980
we'll redirect to auth

01:04.010 --> 01:05.840
but that's something we'll do later, for now

01:05.850 --> 01:07.920
let's redirect to places.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.410
So that is my top level configuration

01:10.410 --> 01:18.330
and with that, when we run Ionic serve, we should load that places module here obviously and that places

01:18.420 --> 01:22.860
module basically is responsible for rendering the places page,

01:22.860 --> 01:30.380
so what we should see in the end is this places page with the title of just places here. And we do,

01:30.430 --> 01:32.020
here it is,

01:32.020 --> 01:36.080
that is our places page. That's the route configuration adjusted,

01:36.080 --> 01:44.090
now in the places page, I don't want to start setting up anything too fancy, I'll just fix the title, instead

01:44.150 --> 01:50.420
I want to dive right into tabs and explain how you can add tabs to have a tab bar which then allows

01:50.420 --> 01:56.730
you to switch between the find a place or discover a place and offer a place

01:56.750 --> 01:57.290
page.
