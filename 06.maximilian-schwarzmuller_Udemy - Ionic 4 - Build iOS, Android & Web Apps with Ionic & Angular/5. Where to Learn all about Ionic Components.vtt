Now which Ionic components can we add?

00:05.860 --> 00:12.620
There are over a hundred of pre-built Ionic components and you find them all in the official Ionic docs.

00:12.700 --> 00:17.700
Now definitely feel free to browse through these docs and play around with them,

00:17.830 --> 00:23.200
you can either do this here on the right where you also have some nice icons showing what this Ionic

00:23.200 --> 00:24.850
does or what it's used for

00:24.850 --> 00:28.520
or just go through these grouped components here on the left.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.570
Now it's impossible to learn them all by heart,

00:31.660 --> 00:37.180
you will learn them automatically by using but use these docs when you're building an app, really do

00:37.180 --> 00:37.620
that.

00:37.630 --> 00:39.790
This is your go-to reference,

00:39.820 --> 00:40.980
it's always up-to-date,

00:40.990 --> 00:46.900
it's directly generated from the source code actually and therefore, this is the place to go.

00:46.900 --> 00:53.550
For example if you inspect that button here, that ion-button, here you even see an example,

00:53.570 --> 00:54.520
a small example,

00:54.550 --> 01:00.730
not every component has this as of now but some components do show you an example for iOS and material

01:00.730 --> 01:04.500
design which is the Android style and you have a description here

01:04.540 --> 01:07.420
on the left and you do have that for all components.

01:07.420 --> 01:11.940
There you learned what this component does, how you use it,

01:12.250 --> 01:18.460
some general or important ways of configuring it, like for example here setting the fill mode to clear

01:18.520 --> 01:24.060
outline or solid to define how the button looks like. You have some usage examples here,

01:24.100 --> 01:28.880
so simply some code examples with some different configurations,

01:29.050 --> 01:33.970
please be aware that you have both Javascript and Angular versions which for this code of course don't

01:34.030 --> 01:35.090
differ though

01:35.560 --> 01:37.580
and then you have a list of all the properties

01:37.600 --> 01:41.180
and this is also generated directly from the source code

01:41.380 --> 01:47.140
and there you see which properties you can set and you can set all these properties also as attributes

01:47.410 --> 01:52.480
on the element therefore and which values you can pass in for every attribute,

01:52.480 --> 01:58.360
so that should be very helpful in using this. You see custom events that are emitted by this component,

01:58.450 --> 02:01.850
so non-default HTML events that are emitted,

02:01.930 --> 02:05.790
we have access to the default ones like click and so on as well,

02:05.830 --> 02:11.230
that is the case for all web components and that will become important later when we dive into styling,

02:11.520 --> 02:17.350
you see which CSS properties you can overwrite for this component to control its look.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.900
So there is a lot of stuff in there,

02:19.900 --> 02:22.030
definitely use these docs.

02:22.070 --> 02:27.340
Now let's use these docs and let's start creating our little budget planner.
