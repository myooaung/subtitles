WEBVTT

00:02.580 --> 00:07.800
Let us start by finishing this service here and therefore to get place method.

00:07.860 --> 00:09.740
I'm returning a single place here.

00:09.780 --> 00:14.910
Now we'll have to change this since our places are managed and observable.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.430
I want to return in observable here too.

00:17.790 --> 00:26.340
So I will reach out to my places getter which returns a subscriber able subject as you learned and therefore

00:26.340 --> 00:29.460
we can subscribe here now.

00:29.470 --> 00:34.900
In the end I don't want as of drive in here though I want to get my latest list and we can do it as

00:34.900 --> 00:38.130
we've take one as you learned in that pipe method.

00:38.140 --> 00:45.010
Now the good thing is here and get place I now want to change this so did I return and observable of

00:45.010 --> 00:53.260
places here as well simply to have a cleaner flow of data because our list of places is in an observable

00:53.530 --> 00:56.940
I want to return a single observable here as well.

00:57.310 --> 01:00.640
And every year I will return this place's pipe.

01:00.640 --> 01:06.610
Take one but this would be the list of places where actually you would not even be that it would be

01:06.610 --> 01:08.950
an observable to which we can subscribe.

01:09.040 --> 01:15.700
Which then once you subscribe gives us that list of places because we basically have everything in place

01:15.760 --> 01:17.380
except for the subscription.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.390
That's the difference to the code down there.

01:19.390 --> 01:21.700
Here we do subscribe up there.

01:21.700 --> 01:22.750
We don't.

01:22.750 --> 01:27.730
But I don't want to return that list of places I want to return a single place.

01:27.730 --> 01:31.080
Good thing is we can add another operator for this.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.740
We can add the filter operator.

01:33.760 --> 01:39.280
This allows us to filter down our array but I don't actually want to filter it down.

01:39.280 --> 01:45.270
I want to return exactly one element and therefore you could simply add map here.

01:45.290 --> 01:46.920
What does map do.

01:47.120 --> 01:51.440
I can use a map here as a second operator after take which means map.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.660
Now we'll get what.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.380
Take gives us.

01:54.380 --> 02:00.980
Here we pass the function to map and that will be our array of places the array of places take one gives

02:00.980 --> 02:02.280
us essentially.

02:02.600 --> 02:09.470
And now I want to find only one of the places in there and returned it so I can remove my return statement

02:09.530 --> 02:10.310
into debt.

02:10.310 --> 02:17.570
Function pass to map here instead of this places I use just places which is my array of places I can

02:17.570 --> 02:20.480
use that find logic I already had in place.

02:20.720 --> 02:26.780
This day offer will return a javascript object and map then automatically wraps us in an observable

02:27.050 --> 02:32.690
so did what we return overall here still isn't observable to which you can subscribe.

02:32.780 --> 02:37.240
Now we're done with the service but now we need to change a couple of components.

02:37.360 --> 02:44.750
Let's start with the offers page setting up our offers like this won't work because this places service

02:44.750 --> 02:48.150
places does no longer yield an array of places.

02:48.170 --> 02:55.330
Instead it's what it's dead subject it's said subscriber a subject which eventually will yield an array

02:55.330 --> 02:56.680
of places.

02:56.680 --> 03:05.330
So instead here we'll have to say this places service places subscribe to get our current list of places.

03:05.380 --> 03:12.370
But here I will now not add take one because India offers page I always am when I get future updated

03:12.550 --> 03:14.040
places lists.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.380
So here I will subscribe and that gives me my places.

03:17.380 --> 03:21.480
Then we can simply say this offers equal to places in here and important.

03:21.490 --> 03:26.590
This has to be inside of this function you pass to subscribe because this function will be executed

03:26.740 --> 03:33.760
whenever our list of places changes and then we can reassign that new list to our offers list here to

03:33.760 --> 03:39.430
our offers array here which we use in that component and which we all see was in the template.

03:39.430 --> 03:45.100
Now one thing you should do when working with our X J S when you're setting up your own subscription

03:45.220 --> 03:48.940
for your own self managed subject and observable is.

03:49.090 --> 03:56.470
So basically not things where you subscribe to anglers routing parameters but to your own subjects then

03:56.470 --> 04:02.260
you should clear this subscription whenever the page is destroyed to a white memory leaks.

04:02.260 --> 04:08.950
Therefore I'll add a new private property Laci's sub which is of type subscription.

04:08.950 --> 04:15.700
Now this subscription thing needs to be imported from our X J S so from the same package subject stems

04:15.700 --> 04:23.950
from and now with that added here we can store our subscription in it because subscribe actually returns

04:23.980 --> 04:25.350
a subscription object.

04:25.600 --> 04:33.040
So this place's sub is now equal to whatever a subscriber turns us and destroyed when the component

04:33.040 --> 04:39.670
gets destroyed we should add the on destroy life cycle hook which is imported from at Angela core and

04:39.670 --> 04:47.980
that forces us to add a new energy on destroy method here and there I'll check if this plays sub is

04:47.980 --> 04:57.280
basically truest which means it was set then I will call this place a sub unsubscribe.

04:57.570 --> 04:58.880
Now this is the pattern.

04:58.990 --> 05:07.700
I will also add it might discover page there all the one to load my places not by assigning it like

05:07.700 --> 05:12.780
this but instead since places is an observable by subscribing here.

05:12.860 --> 05:18.950
I also want to know about future updates and therefore I will pass in my function here where I get my

05:18.950 --> 05:25.730
places and I will set this loaded place as equal to places here and whenever my place is changed I will

05:25.970 --> 05:27.360
know about it here.

05:27.410 --> 05:34.790
Of course this code here where I basically get my my list of loaded places without the feature place

05:34.940 --> 05:41.210
that should all be moved in here now just as before we should unsubscribe here.

05:41.270 --> 05:49.940
So I will add a private property places sub which holds my subscription subscription is imported from

05:50.030 --> 05:55.890
our X J S just as before and then we store our subscription your places.

05:55.900 --> 06:02.740
Sup is equal to that and then we should add on destroy to clear dead when we're not in need of it anymore.

06:02.870 --> 06:10.130
So add on destroy which is imported from at Angola court and then in your component somewhere at the

06:10.130 --> 06:19.440
energy on destroy method and in there I'll check if this Laci's sub is a thing and if it is a thing

06:19.710 --> 06:22.620
then I will call unsubscribe here.

06:22.740 --> 06:27.200
Now we're fetching all the places in both offer and this cover.

06:27.210 --> 06:30.120
Now we also fetch a single place in the place.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.630
Detail page here.

06:31.710 --> 06:34.010
So there we need to adjust the code as well.

06:34.050 --> 06:35.690
Because if you check your place.

06:35.730 --> 06:40.500
Service of course and get place where now all the returning and observable.

06:40.500 --> 06:46.740
So in place detail loading a place like this won't work anymore instead it's now also an observable

06:47.580 --> 06:50.330
and hence this place tourists get place.

06:50.550 --> 06:57.850
Now all that gives us something we can subscribe to and in there we now get our place no place else

06:57.890 --> 06:59.390
but a single place.

06:59.690 --> 07:10.100
And therefore this place so our place here will now be equal to the place I'm getting here as an argument.

07:10.130 --> 07:17.550
So the place we loaded justice before you want to clear up that subscription when you're not requiring

07:17.550 --> 07:25.860
it anymore that for a year I will add my place sub which is of type subscription subscription just as

07:25.860 --> 07:29.920
before of course needs to be imported from our exchanges.

07:30.180 --> 07:37.890
So make sure you import subscription from our X J.S. and with subscription import that lets us sign

07:37.890 --> 07:39.000
it in here.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.670
Now you don't need to manage the root param map subscription that is coming from angular and angular

07:44.670 --> 07:50.430
will take care for its lifecycle management but your own subscription you want to manage yourself so

07:50.430 --> 07:58.530
let's store it here in place up and then at the on destroy interface which you import from the angular

07:58.530 --> 08:04.500
core to make sure that you're forced to add energy on destroying this component somewhere.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.010
Here for example.

08:06.020 --> 08:13.170
And then there again I check if this place this place sup is a thing and if it is a thing then I call

08:13.170 --> 08:16.360
this place sup unsubscribe.

08:16.470 --> 08:17.770
Perfect.

08:17.870 --> 08:22.710
Now last but not least let's have a look at the edit all for a page because there I'm also loading a

08:22.710 --> 08:27.720
single place of course and therefore here we should adjust the code as well and definitely feel free

08:27.720 --> 08:30.180
to pass the video at this point and try it on your own

08:33.150 --> 08:40.740
I will simply call subscribe here get my single place and therefore call this place equals to place.

08:40.800 --> 08:46.950
Now the whole forum which I initialize here which depends on the place should also be moved into this

08:47.940 --> 08:53.250
observable function out for because I need my place here so I can only initialize the forum once I got

08:53.250 --> 08:53.880
that place.

08:54.900 --> 09:05.710
Then I want to add my private place sub here which is of type subscription and you want to import subscription

09:05.710 --> 09:15.520
from our exchange just as before and all of Justice before ad D on destroy lifecycle hook interface

09:15.520 --> 09:24.070
here from entering the core so that you are forced to use energy all and destroy to check if this place

09:24.130 --> 09:32.390
sub is set and if it is set you want to call this place up and subscribe here in NGO and destroy.

09:32.770 --> 09:39.640
And of course for this to work you should also save your subscription so this place up is equal to what

09:39.820 --> 09:43.840
I subscribe to here with all that in place.

09:43.940 --> 09:48.710
Let's save all these files and see if that works or if we overlooked something.

09:48.710 --> 09:52.990
There seems to be an error in the offer booking page

09:58.750 --> 10:00.740
we have a look at this file.

10:00.790 --> 10:01.020
Yeah.

10:01.030 --> 10:04.750
Here I'm also getting a single place and Anjan in it.

10:05.050 --> 10:07.320
Of course that for he we should also justice.

10:07.900 --> 10:14.320
So instead of getting our place like this we should subscribe here get all plays and that and its functions

10:14.320 --> 10:19.990
at this place equal to place and justice before clear to subscription when we don't need it anymore.

10:20.010 --> 10:28.800
So I had a private place sub here which is of type subscription subscription your subscription asked

10:28.800 --> 10:37.290
before imported from our X J S on destroy added here from at Angola core and they are for with on destroy

10:37.300 --> 10:44.260
Edit First of all we have to store our subscriptions of this place sub is equal to our subscription

10:44.260 --> 10:54.400
we're setting up here and then we also add NGO and destroy here check if this place sub is set and if

10:54.400 --> 11:02.440
it is set then we call unsubscribe on it and now we have that in place here as well for the offer booking

11:02.440 --> 11:04.230
page.

11:04.340 --> 11:12.770
So now let's see that looks better here I think we now go back to our application go to offers we add

11:12.770 --> 11:15.880
a new place test.

11:16.070 --> 11:20.530
Does this work we add our price here

11:26.040 --> 11:31.530
this year and finish up the creation of our offered place.

11:31.530 --> 11:36.660
Now we see it here the exact same scenario as before but now we can see our place here.

11:36.660 --> 11:42.240
We all see it here because now with that subject driven approach even if this page never reloads we

11:42.240 --> 11:47.400
set up that subscription when it loads initially and that subscription keeps on going even whilst we're

11:47.400 --> 11:53.580
not seeing the page and hence when we add a new place all the subscribed parts of our application all

11:53.580 --> 11:59.640
the subscriptions are updated and we can get our new list of places and do something with it there and

11:59.640 --> 12:05.910
hence here I can also go to my add detail page where I see the title up there and I can start booking

12:05.910 --> 12:10.380
my place here so that doesn't look too bad.

12:10.420 --> 12:16.000
Let's now make sure we displayed a right dates here and let's maybe all the fake that Detroit Nation

12:16.060 --> 12:22.150
off our date takes a little bit longer so that we can add a nice UI loading spinner.
