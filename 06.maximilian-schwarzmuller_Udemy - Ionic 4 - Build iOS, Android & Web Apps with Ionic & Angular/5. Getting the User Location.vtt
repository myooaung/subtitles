00:02.160 --> 00:07.980
For this I'm restarting my local development server with ionic Onyx so that I can also viewed as in

00:07.980 --> 00:14.430
the browser first before we have a look at it on mobile devices and let's then go to our location picker

00:14.490 --> 00:15.520
component.

00:15.660 --> 00:22.530
There we have that button that right now always triggers that map modal to open up where users can pick

00:22.530 --> 00:23.610
and address.

00:23.610 --> 00:27.850
Now thus far that of course worked quite well but now I want to provide alternative.

00:27.890 --> 00:35.360
One I'll allow users to pick a location by locating by auto locating them and to enable this.

00:35.400 --> 00:41.100
I want to show an access sheet which prompts the user whether he wants to pick up place on a map or

00:41.100 --> 00:42.720
whether the user wants to.

00:42.810 --> 00:48.000
Well auto locate himself and they offer in the location picker component.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.640
We should inject the action sheet controller action sheet controller

00:57.030 --> 01:03.930
from at ionic angular as we did before in this course as well of course and with the action sheet controller

01:04.160 --> 01:09.460
injected in on pick location which is the method fired when we click this button.

01:09.540 --> 01:15.930
I will not immediately open up that model instead here I will use that action sheet controller to create

01:15.930 --> 01:23.820
my action sheet and in that action sheet here I'll have a header where I say please choose or whatever

01:23.820 --> 01:30.180
you like and then I'll have my buttons and there I need different buttons I want to have two buttons

01:30.180 --> 01:40.000
basically or free buttons here actually the first button has a text of auto locate and of course you

01:40.000 --> 01:46.330
can named as however you want and there will need a handler function that does indeed use that geo location

01:46.330 --> 01:54.460
plug in the second button will have a text of pick on map and that there and our handler function will

01:54.460 --> 01:59.200
have to open that model and then the last button will be the cancel button.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.680
I will not add my own handler here.

02:01.780 --> 02:09.470
Instead what I'll do here is I'll just set a roll and set that roll to cancel so that is the action

02:09.470 --> 02:12.190
sheet which we create in the then block.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.370
We then get the action sheet element which is created for us.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.110
We can use that element to present it.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.030
Now we will have different scenarios here.

02:22.050 --> 02:28.190
Now let me grab that code with the map modal here and actually outsourced is it into a new private method

02:28.610 --> 02:32.590
which I'll name open map like this.

02:32.810 --> 02:37.970
And then there I'll execute that code for the mode lands on and in this handler here for pick on map.

02:37.970 --> 02:44.480
I'll just call this open map because I want to execute that logic which we previously ran all the time.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.880
Here in this handler I want to automatically locate the user and for Dad I'll add another new method

02:50.300 --> 02:51.620
locate user.

02:51.650 --> 02:53.050
Sounds like a fitting name.

02:53.100 --> 02:59.240
And then there will use a capacitor plug in one of the baked in core plugins to be precise which will

02:59.300 --> 03:01.580
automatically log locate the user.

03:01.580 --> 03:05.180
So here in this handler we call this locate user.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.230
Fine.

03:06.350 --> 03:09.770
So now we have these different scenarios in locate user.

03:09.770 --> 03:18.730
I now want to use capacitor and to be precise I want to use the geo location plug in here.

03:18.740 --> 03:24.580
Now here you learn how to use it and the first important step whenever you're using any plugin is that

03:24.590 --> 03:31.070
you should check what you need to set up regarding the permissions because on both as an android you

03:31.070 --> 03:37.460
need to specify which permissions your app is going to need and also provide messages that are shown

03:37.460 --> 03:43.430
to the user when the device prompts the user for that permission and therefore you should always check

03:43.430 --> 03:51.620
these plugin notes and we learn that for a geo location we have that location always usage description

03:51.620 --> 03:57.950
we have to set for ISIS and that went in usage description and for Android we have to add these keys

03:57.950 --> 04:02.150
here to the Android manifest X AML file.

04:02.150 --> 04:08.030
Let's start with I was so in the project here in the IRS folder in the app folder and there in the app

04:08.030 --> 04:15.820
folder you'll have that info populist file and then here you should check for D keys you find here and

04:15.830 --> 04:21.920
as location always usage description and as location went in the usage description and if they're not

04:21.920 --> 04:28.580
there you have to set them on your own here however they are and here are messages between these string

04:28.580 --> 04:31.430
tags which you can customize to your likings.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.180
I will go with the default ones.

04:33.470 --> 04:34.880
So nothing to do for us.

04:34.880 --> 04:41.690
Let's check Android there in the app folder under source main.

04:41.750 --> 04:47.990
We find the android manifest excel file and here we learned that we should have that user's permissions

04:48.020 --> 04:54.620
element with access course location then the same with access find location and then that uses features

04:54.780 --> 04:55.780
tag here.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.700
So let's check for that.

04:57.920 --> 05:03.380
If we scroll down here we have a permissions area and here you see indeed discourse course and the fine

05:03.380 --> 05:05.300
location and also that uses feature.

05:05.300 --> 05:10.240
Thing is basically already set up for you know on the other hand since this is a default here.

05:10.340 --> 05:15.770
If you build an application that does not need that feature you might want to consider removing these

05:15.770 --> 05:22.310
permissions requests 0 or D permissions descriptions because you're basically indicating that you need

05:22.310 --> 05:24.100
permissions that you don't actually need.

05:24.140 --> 05:29.270
And of course you want to ensure that your application needs as little permissions as possible.

05:29.270 --> 05:33.980
So here however we don't have to do anything permissions are all set up and therefore we can now use

05:33.980 --> 05:37.150
that geo location plugin just as before.

05:37.310 --> 05:45.320
This starts by importing plug ins from at capacitor core and justice before I will.

05:45.350 --> 05:52.430
All they import capacitor because this now allows me to go down to locate user which is where we want

05:52.430 --> 06:02.700
you all to locate the user and there I can first of all check capacitor is plugging away lable and then

06:02.700 --> 06:09.280
the name is geo location and make sure you type this correctly of course if this is not the case and

06:09.280 --> 06:15.340
hence I checked the opposite then I want to return here I don't want to continue off the next code though

06:15.340 --> 06:20.380
we probably should also give the user some indication that this failed and that he should use the map

06:20.810 --> 06:26.860
and therefore he could either automatically open the map or as I will do it here fro an alert with the

06:26.860 --> 06:33.490
alert controller which you have to inject from at eye on a angle or of course just as the average controllers.

06:33.700 --> 06:46.220
And then here in that scenario here I will create an alert with a header of could not fetch location

06:48.760 --> 06:55.170
and then a message where we say please use the map to pick a location or anything like that.

06:55.180 --> 07:02.110
So this is our fallback for cases for scenarios where we just can't use the geo location plugin for

07:02.110 --> 07:06.910
whichever reason for example because the platform the application runs on thousands reported.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.010
Maybe this runs on an older browser and therefore it's not a whale.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.660
If we make it past does it check we know that the plugin is available.

07:15.660 --> 07:24.270
So now we can access plugins dot geo location and then here we want to use to get current position method

07:24.300 --> 07:26.730
which does just what it sounds like.

07:26.760 --> 07:32.310
This gives us a promise and we definitely should catch errors here as well because an error can occur

07:32.310 --> 07:33.990
for any reason.

07:33.990 --> 07:40.770
For example we theoretically have a platform where we can fetch the location but we currently just can't

07:40.770 --> 07:45.060
get a location because the G.P.S. signal is weak or anything like that.

07:45.120 --> 07:50.340
So we definitely want to handle the error and I want to show the same alert I have here and therefore

07:50.340 --> 07:58.050
all cut cut this code here and add a new private method show error alert or any name you want.

07:58.170 --> 08:02.940
And of course you're creating a dissolve and not enough we get that alert element and then block and

08:02.940 --> 08:07.560
therefore we then of course all the want to present that so we should do this here as well.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.290
But now we can call this show

08:14.080 --> 08:18.000
error alert here and also do this in the catch block here.

08:18.010 --> 08:27.160
If we do have an error in a then block we should have a position and that you position will have the

08:27.190 --> 08:30.040
structure you can find here on the official docks.

08:30.190 --> 08:37.420
If you have a look at get current location here at the bottom you'll see that we'll have a course field

08:37.570 --> 08:42.960
and that will basically be a javascript object with a latitude and longitude field.

08:43.060 --> 08:49.420
So here we basically get our coordinates and I'll named us coordinates which is of type coordinates

08:51.580 --> 08:58.720
you might remember that we defined coordinates in our own location model file that is an interface we

08:58.720 --> 08:59.650
defined here.

08:59.860 --> 09:05.200
So I'm creating such a coordinates object here and the value is a javascript object that needs a land

09:05.200 --> 09:13.950
key and that land key can be retrieved from DU position here from that argument we're getting and that

09:13.950 --> 09:23.150
Geo position object we're getting will have a coords field and the coords field here will have a latitude

09:23.570 --> 09:32.300
field and similarly for the LNG key we have to set we can get you position coords and then it would

09:32.300 --> 09:35.180
be a long etude like that.
