00:01.920 --> 00:08.790
We finished our recipe book here we're going to improve it in the next section but we'll learn how to

00:08.790 --> 00:16.770
use HTP to also store our recipes on a server because that's the downside of our app as it is.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.520
Our data is not persistent.

00:18.540 --> 00:24.240
Whenever we reload the app or restart it on our phone all the data will be lost.

00:24.270 --> 00:30.040
Therefore in the next section we will have a look at how we can store it on a server actually.

00:30.180 --> 00:34.590
Also there are things you can improve besides styling or so on.

00:34.590 --> 00:41.810
You can try adding more features to your recipes and more controls to your recipe for him here.

00:41.820 --> 00:47.720
You can also think about making an alert when clicking the delete recipe button right.

00:47.730 --> 00:53.550
Because right now it simply is the case that if I click on The Lead it's gone.

00:53.550 --> 00:57.170
You can follow an alert to ask if you really want to delete it.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.180
These are tiny little improvements you could work on.

01:00.180 --> 01:06.990
You could also think about when adding an ingredient like meat that you also show an amount field so

01:06.990 --> 01:13.860
that you don't have to use our dummy amount of one which we're using here in onset mate when mapping

01:13.860 --> 01:17.850
Freudian gradients but that you actually allow the user to setter's.

01:17.850 --> 01:23.300
These are all possible improvements and I strongly encourage you to type into them and work with that

01:23.310 --> 01:27.320
to really understand with that and get more practice.

01:27.420 --> 01:32.850
Always consult official documentation if you're having some problems with some of my onic tools components

01:32.910 --> 01:36.480
or you are not sure how to use them.

01:36.990 --> 01:44.370
I'd say let's finish this appier or Lattin has finished a section by see to run on a real device.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.950
So I'll be back with it running on my DeWyze in a second.

01:48.380 --> 01:50.330
I open it an X code again.

01:50.400 --> 01:56.940
I already got my signing certificate signed I do show in the section about running at all real devices

01:56.940 --> 02:02.670
and emulators how to set this up so check out this section and the appropriate iOS lecture in there

02:02.670 --> 02:04.490
to learn how I did this.

02:04.500 --> 02:10.570
And with that I already got my iPhone connected so I can hit enter to now start the app on my iPhone.

02:10.580 --> 02:12.590
Let's see the run there in a second.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.300
So here's the app running on my device.

02:15.330 --> 02:18.990
I'm just mirroring the screen but this is on my actual device.

02:19.260 --> 02:25.610
Let's quickly add a new recipe and I know you want it let's add a schnitzel here.

02:25.610 --> 02:32.100
Also here you see that indeed the keyboard slides up if we enter the input here.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.840
So this is the schnitzel.

02:33.850 --> 02:37.230
And as you know it's very tasty.

02:37.230 --> 02:40.030
So time to make it very tasty here too.

02:40.470 --> 02:46.510
And let's go to the difficulty and set this too hard for now and add ingredients.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.680
This all looks so great.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.330
I'm so happy here.

02:49.350 --> 02:53.750
Let's set these two spaghetti for schnitzel.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.040
Well yeah I guess that's super important.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.010
And let's add another ingredient here.

02:58.200 --> 03:03.040
I want to add French fries schnitzel with french fries and spaghetti.

03:03.060 --> 03:05.020
That is how kings eat.

03:05.070 --> 03:06.630
So let's edit here too.

03:06.840 --> 03:13.560
And with this let me click on shopping list and go back just to demonstrate that this persists so these

03:13.560 --> 03:16.310
are two different navigation stacks I was talking about.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.930
So that's like a new recipe.

03:17.960 --> 03:18.760
Here it is.

03:18.770 --> 03:20.550
Let's use it here.

03:20.640 --> 03:21.260
Looks good.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.650
And well I don't think that spaghetti fit in there.

03:24.690 --> 03:27.590
So let's maybe clear the ingredients and add them again.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.490
And yes there will be another improvement.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.680
Make your ingredients deliverable one by one.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.830
Should be too hard to implement and certainly a nice challenge for you too.

03:36.060 --> 03:41.040
So with that let's add a new ingredient and that would be meat instead of spaghetti.

03:41.220 --> 03:44.510
And of course also the French fries again.

03:45.270 --> 03:53.790
So like this French fries not Grise fries.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.560
Let's save this click added.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.490
Here we are.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.480
This looks much better.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.540
Let me add it to the shopping list.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.370
Here it is.

04:03.400 --> 04:08.680
And I think on my shopping list I definitely need some bread to go with that deliciousness.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.860
So when is enough let's added and I think I have French fries at home so let's check this up.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.710
This is our application working fine.

04:17.710 --> 04:22.890
I don't need to Schnitzler recipe anymore let's deleted gone it is running on my phone.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.030
I really like it.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.950
Again as I mentioned before there are things you can improve.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.640
But I think we have a very good state here.

04:29.740 --> 04:35.950
Let's now move on to the next lecture and dive into some other things like how can we actually authenticate

04:35.950 --> 04:41.110
users in our eye on two application and how can we generally reach out to the Web.

04:41.140 --> 04:49.510
For example on this app you're to store our recipes in or on some server while we're going to dive into

04:49.510 --> 04:51.160
this in the next module
