00:02.640 --> 00:09.000
Now 40 image upload will use Firebase storage and obviously that's just one alternative and I'll just

00:09.000 --> 00:12.270
show a dummy a demo implementation of this.

00:12.390 --> 00:18.750
If you really want to build an app with file upload you might want to use your firebase SDK if you want

00:18.750 --> 00:25.650
to use Firebase or any average service and that services SDK or documentation to learn how to efficiently

00:25.680 --> 00:28.940
upload files or image has to get storage.

00:29.220 --> 00:35.710
Here I will build my own REST API and points that accepts an image file and then returns us to you or

00:35.720 --> 00:36.900
l to where it's stored.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.720
So do you see a very generic way of uploading this but this is just a demo.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.290
I'm not using you firebase SDK here because then you would only know how to do it with the firebase

00:47.400 --> 00:48.450
SDK.

00:48.450 --> 00:53.700
I want you to understand what happens under the hood though they have 4 will use that custom REST API

00:53.700 --> 01:00.030
endpoint nonetheless if you are planning to use Firebase for your project for your real project look

01:00.030 --> 01:05.970
into view firebase SDK where you can use the built in uploading functionalities which are easier and

01:06.000 --> 01:07.910
all the more performance at better.

01:07.950 --> 01:11.840
Or if you're using an average service check that services documentation.

01:12.090 --> 01:19.410
Now for that custom API endpoint I'm talking about we'll use a feature called Cloud functions here and

01:19.440 --> 01:24.910
to create such a function which essentially allows us to create our own code that will run when we send

01:24.910 --> 01:27.030
the request to a certain end point.

01:27.030 --> 01:29.040
We will use the firebase based tools.

01:29.040 --> 01:35.490
You can google for firebase tools to find that github repository here and there you see that for using

01:35.490 --> 01:40.560
the tools you have to run this installation command which will install them globally on your machine.

01:40.980 --> 01:41.840
So let's do that.

01:41.830 --> 01:48.380
Now on Mac and Linux you now might need to add a pseudo in front of this and be prompted to enter your

01:48.650 --> 01:53.390
password thereafter and this will now install the firebase tools globally on your machine.

01:53.390 --> 01:59.330
Now we use the firebase tools you're only to create that cloud function which in turn allows us to add

01:59.330 --> 02:04.690
code that executes when we send the image to a certain custom Rest Api endpoint.

02:04.730 --> 02:07.400
As I said Does this just a demo here.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.740
So with that installed Well we can run here as firebase in it.

02:11.780 --> 02:19.610
In this project in this ionic project here you should choose functions and only functions simply navigate

02:19.610 --> 02:21.200
their impress space.

02:21.230 --> 02:24.320
You shouldn't check storage or anything like that.

02:24.430 --> 02:29.680
Thereafter hit enter and there choose your project here which is ironic.

02:29.870 --> 02:30.500
Course for me.

02:30.530 --> 02:35.410
So far this project you all use for your database choose javascript here.

02:35.510 --> 02:42.980
And for a listing ask no to a wide unnecessary errors or changes you need to make and you can choose

02:43.070 --> 02:49.280
yes for the dependencies to install them and what this will do is it will now give you a brand new functions

02:49.280 --> 02:55.610
folder with an index J.S. file and its own dependencies set and in this index J is all you can write

02:55.610 --> 02:57.140
your own cloud functions.

02:57.140 --> 03:02.150
Now I'll not give you an introduction to Firebase cloud functions here because here we'll just use it

03:02.150 --> 03:04.780
as a tool to reach our goal.

03:04.850 --> 03:09.860
If you want to learn more about that check the official cloud function documentation and attach to this

03:09.860 --> 03:15.100
video you'll also find helpful video an article I created on that.

03:15.260 --> 03:20.990
Now the cloud function which I want to add here is a cloud function you find attached so you can just

03:20.990 --> 03:28.510
copy and paste that in you can replace everything in a file with that attached code no dead code is

03:28.600 --> 03:36.340
almost ready to use but you need to tweak some things there everywhere you where you see this project

03:36.350 --> 03:38.110
idea here.

03:38.190 --> 03:39.890
You need to plug in yours.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.610
Now what is your project idea.

03:41.610 --> 03:49.940
You can find that and you firebase console here if you go to Settings project settings this is your

03:49.940 --> 03:51.170
project idea here.

03:51.230 --> 03:59.630
So grab that I.D. and replace all occurrences of ionic complete prep here with your project I.D. You

03:59.700 --> 04:07.040
will all that we'll need to install a couple of dependencies which we need for that go to package start

04:07.070 --> 04:13.830
Jason and add in the dependencies you'll find in a separate file attached to this video with these words

04:13.830 --> 04:14.070
here

04:18.150 --> 04:23.910
thereafter go into your terminal and navigate into that function's folder in your ionic project and

04:23.910 --> 04:29.460
rerun npm install and this will now install all these dependencies and thereafter dysfunction should

04:29.460 --> 04:30.720
be ready to deploy.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.120
So now you can run.

04:33.150 --> 04:35.750
You can go back to your main project folder if you want to.

04:35.760 --> 04:44.940
You can run firebase deploy and this will now build your function and upload it to your firebase project.

04:44.980 --> 04:50.980
Now once this is deployed you can see your function the far firebase web console if you go to functions

04:52.730 --> 04:57.720
and there you also see that rest api endpoint to which you can send the request later.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.800
Now let's work on the uploading logic in our front end here.
