We're able to communicate with a server that is great.

00:05.990 --> 00:09.760
Let's now come back to some core features our application needs.

00:09.770 --> 00:13.400
Besides being able to store and persist our data.

00:13.670 --> 00:21.740
And for that since we're managing places people can book maps comes to mind specifically Google Maps

00:22.120 --> 00:29.300
will add Google Maps to our application here to make sure that users can pick a place or pick the place

00:29.300 --> 00:31.000
on the map where their location is.

00:31.010 --> 00:38.450
When you add a new location when you add a new offer we'll also use an API provided by Google that translates

00:38.450 --> 00:45.170
coordinates into a real address that we can display to humans and we'll use to Google Maps static image

00:45.290 --> 00:52.880
API or static Maps API to display a preview ofthe location on our screens.

00:53.390 --> 00:54.450
So that's what we'll do.

00:54.450 --> 01:00.230
Well first of all focus on setting up the Google Maps API or actually API is dead.

01:00.230 --> 01:06.530
We will use in this course and as a second step we will then make sure that we actually add all these

01:06.530 --> 01:08.510
things to the application.

01:08.510 --> 01:15.440
Now obviously it does as an example or we're using some service here that is specific to our app but

01:15.440 --> 01:21.140
I thought including Google maps would be pretty interesting since chances are high that in any app you're

01:21.140 --> 01:25.040
building you will need Google Maps or you will use Google maps.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.230
So let's get started and let's use it in this app.
