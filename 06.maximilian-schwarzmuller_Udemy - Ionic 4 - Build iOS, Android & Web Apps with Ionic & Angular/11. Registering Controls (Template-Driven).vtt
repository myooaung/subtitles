00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.920
Now if you're feeling confident using template driven forms in English to you and there's nothing special

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.970
about this when doing it in an ironic to.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:19.120
You can already start hooking up those two inputs year to form try to fetch for more the foreign value

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.810
and the submit button is hit and try printing it to the console.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.360
That's the thing we're going to do next.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.450
So you may now pause to video and try it on your own before we then solve this together.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.770
Were you successful.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.680
Well let's have a look at how I would do this.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.480
I'll go back to my template and as I mentioned before we're going to use a template term approach so

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.850
this is the place to work with this form.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.350
And just to repeat this the template driven approach anger 2 will automatically create the forum in

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.240
the background in javascript for us when it detects this form element here.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.810
So we don't have to do anything to let it detectors but we still have to tell Engler to which controls

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.790
our form actually has it will not automatically infer this.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.580
And you can really see why it wouldn't make sense for letting angular to infer this automatically because

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.660
what you could argue that in a normal web app where you only use HDMI elements and even there you could

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.750
create your own controls.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.230
But if you were to use that then you could theoretically say well if there is an input element in a

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.670
form element angle or to ship be able to add this automatically as a control.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.320
However even if you would make this argument and there are reasons against it now it's definitely defeated

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.870
because here we're not using a normal input element.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.090
We're using an eye or an input component.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.390
And how would angler to know that this actually works as a control for it for days for him.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.350
So therefore we have to inform English to you.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.540
And we do this in the template driven approach by adding ngi model this directive to dis input by placing

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.470
it on this input on this component here.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.800
Now important in normal English to web apps you need to add form's module to your imports array an already

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.390
import from an angle or forums in an ironic to Eb.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.520
You don't need to do this because it is ionic module will automatically provide you with this module

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.960
with the form's module because forms and inputs are such a common thing in apps and mobile apps.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.370
So you don't need to add forms module here.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.390
So with this we placed N-G model on the input we have registered it.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.120
Very important make sure that you have this name attribute set otherwise angle is not able to assign

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.050
a name to this control in its javascript representation of this forum.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.590
So if that the formis caller's control or is now registered also and you can do the same on the amount

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.490
of course and you model and if you wanted to use one way binding to pre-populated with a well you you

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.890
could of course also do this with square brackets.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.800
Or you could use two way binding.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.110
It works like a normal Angler or two template driven form.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.260
Nothing special about this.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.180
So with that the controls are registered.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.730
We also already got our submit button.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.840
The next step of course is to make this form submit a bill let's work on this in the next lectures.
