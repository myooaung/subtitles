As always you find more and more fertile docks here in the guide section under theming.

00:08.650 --> 00:10.900
There you can learn how theming generally works.

00:10.900 --> 00:15.940
You can learn more about sears as variables and so on but I will walk you through the important concepts

00:15.940 --> 00:16.930
here in this module.

00:17.200 --> 00:23.220
But one thing I want to bring to your attention right now already is this Sears as utilities thing here.

00:23.380 --> 00:29.230
Now we had a look at this a couple of times already fraught this course I'm talking about these utilities

00:29.230 --> 00:36.760
see us as attributes you can add to any element to for example align your text or to align your items

00:36.850 --> 00:39.560
in an ionic grid and so on.

00:39.550 --> 00:42.460
Now this is of course all the related to styling.

00:42.460 --> 00:48.010
These are just some default styles which you can by the way also adjust through C as as variables but

00:48.010 --> 00:52.480
more on that later that you can drop on any element in your application.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.910
So definitely be aware of this page and feel free to dive into it if you need some general styling like

00:58.000 --> 00:59.350
I want to add a margin.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.990
Well then you can just drop the margin attribute on the item instead of writing your own C as as rule

01:06.120 --> 01:10.680
but with that let's dive into our actual code now and play around with the theme and so on.
