Well later once we add HTTP requests, you should also be aware of the network page. Right now,

00:08.770 --> 00:15.430
this only contains all the Javascript files we download, Ionic automatically splits the code by component

00:15.430 --> 00:16.920
and therefore we have a lot of downloads

00:16.930 --> 00:21.090
but this is actually good because it keeps the different chunks of the apps small

00:21.400 --> 00:26.770
and later once we also send our requests to a back-end to store data there or fetch data from there,

00:26.980 --> 00:29.020
you can see these requests there too

00:29.020 --> 00:34.420
and you can always look into the request and see the data it holds and this can help you understand when

00:34.420 --> 00:35.560
a request is sent,

00:35.560 --> 00:38.330
if there are requests being sent that shouldn't be sent

00:38.500 --> 00:45.730
and if they hold the correct data. You also sometimes have visual issues, that the UI doesn't look the

00:45.730 --> 00:47.760
way you would have expected it to

00:47.770 --> 00:53.260
and in this case, the elements tab is great. Here in the browser, you see your complete DOM with all the

00:53.260 --> 00:56.120
elements and you can dive into them here,

00:56.290 --> 01:01.860
you can inspect the styling, all the classes that are added to an element down here.

01:02.020 --> 01:07.570
You can see which class in which file is responsible for this style in case you want to change it

01:07.570 --> 01:13.000
if it's one of your files or if it's an Ionic file, you know which style you need to overwrite in one

01:13.000 --> 01:14.110
of your files.

01:14.410 --> 01:20.140
You can also select an element directly in your page by clicking on this button up there and then selecting

01:20.140 --> 01:21.740
what you want to inspect

01:21.880 --> 01:29.110
and on the right here, you also see a nice representation of how much margin this has, a border padding

01:29.320 --> 01:33.250
and the size and so on and again, you can dive into way more here,

01:33.280 --> 01:39.880
find out which event listeners are registered and so on and so on. There is way more you can do, which

01:39.880 --> 01:41.820
properties you can set on this element,

01:41.830 --> 01:45.920
there really are tons of things you can do here

01:46.150 --> 01:51.100
and again, this is something you can learn if you dive into the Chrome developer tools in general,

01:51.100 --> 01:57.520
this is nothing Ionic specific. But keep the elements tab in mind for any visual or layout issues

01:57.520 --> 01:58.210
you have,

01:58.210 --> 02:04.630
this helps you debug them. Also important especially once you are finishing up your app are the performance

02:04.690 --> 02:09.790
and memory tabs here, the performance and memory tabs allow you to measure exactly that.

02:09.970 --> 02:16.450
You can record a snapshot of the performance of your application, stop that and then you see how long

02:16.450 --> 02:18.370
execution of different scripts took

02:18.370 --> 02:23.830
and you can see if a script is blocking something, if a script is taking too long and in memory, you can

02:23.830 --> 02:25.450
spot memory leaks.

02:25.450 --> 02:32.800
You can basically take a snapshot here to see how your memory is occupied and by which processes and

02:32.800 --> 02:35.220
so on and this can be really helpful

02:35.230 --> 02:41.780
and again, the official docs are a great place to learn more about how to read this and so on.

02:41.830 --> 02:48.730
Most important for you here, for the immediate bug fixing are things like console log, setting breakpoints,

02:49.030 --> 02:51.370
and also inspecting the UI of course.
