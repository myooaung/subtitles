In this section we learn how to run our app on different devices and simulators.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.320
And as you saw.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.420
Yes walls it can be a bit tricky.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.210
It's definitely doable and it is important step.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.980
And in the end I guess it wasn't that hard.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.360
Make sure to consult the documents I linked in the articles of the sections on to really dive deeper

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.220
into this especially if you're encountering some issues that should allow you to get started and to

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.950
successfully run your app on native devices which again is something you definitely have to do before

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.990
shipping your app to an app store.
