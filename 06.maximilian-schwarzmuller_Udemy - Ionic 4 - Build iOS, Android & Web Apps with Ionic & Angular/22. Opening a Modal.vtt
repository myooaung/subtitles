00:02.130 --> 00:08.670
With that there's just one thing missing and that is when I click book here on a place detail, I don't

00:08.670 --> 00:10.230
actually want to go back,

00:10.560 --> 00:17.670
I wanted to open a modal, right? Now how does opening modals work in an Ionic Angular app? Just as the

00:17.670 --> 00:18.310
rest,

00:18.330 --> 00:20.780
it's actually pretty simple. Now

00:20.820 --> 00:26.970
the modal will actually be a new component for me and therefore I'll first of all generate this with

00:27.060 --> 00:28.670
Ionic generate

00:28.810 --> 00:32.100
and now this is not really a page here, I'll not lazy load it,

00:32.100 --> 00:33.390
that wouldn't work,

00:33.390 --> 00:39.170
instead it's a regular component which we can generate with Ionic generate component and I will generate

00:39.170 --> 00:47.280
it in my bookings folder because the component will be responsible for making a booking and there, I'll name

00:47.290 --> 00:51.750
it create booking let's say, you can of course use any name you want.

00:51.790 --> 00:56.080
This will generate the create booking component here in the bookings folder,

00:56.080 --> 00:56.680
there it is

00:57.400 --> 01:01.150
and in there, I still want to have a header even though it's not a page,

01:01.540 --> 01:06.920
I will load it in a modal which will occupy the full screen, so I'll add a header with a toolbar with

01:06.920 --> 01:22.100
a title, book this place and then ion content where I'll for now just add a h1, tag book this place and then we'll

01:22.100 --> 01:23.750
add more later.

01:23.750 --> 01:30.230
So this is the component I want to open as a modal, so as a full screen at least on mobile, full screen

01:30.440 --> 01:37.650
overlay. How do we achieve that? In the place where I want to open the modal which is in my place

01:37.650 --> 01:38.490
detail component

01:38.490 --> 01:43.780
when I press that button here, there in onBookPlace,

01:43.800 --> 01:47.190
I now don't want to navigate back as I did it before, instead

01:47.280 --> 01:50.520
well unsurprisingly I want to open that modal. For this,

01:50.520 --> 01:55.670
we can inject something into this component and that is the modal controller.

01:55.670 --> 02:01.620
It's of type modal controller and you do import modal controller from Ionic Angular, just like all these

02:01.620 --> 02:04.200
other special Ionic controllers,

02:04.200 --> 02:10.710
the modal controller allows you to open a modal. So in on book place, you can use this modal controller

02:10.770 --> 02:13.730
and call that create method.

02:13.760 --> 02:18.350
Now the create method takes an object where you configure that modal and most importantly, you need to

02:18.350 --> 02:22.810
set a component here and that is the component that should be opened as a modal.

02:22.880 --> 02:27.180
There you simply point at your component class, so the value for this

02:27.200 --> 02:33.490
in my case here is create booking component. So you point at the create booking component class without

02:33.490 --> 02:35.360
the new keyword or anything like that

02:35.540 --> 02:38.930
and you need to import the create booking component here,

02:39.050 --> 02:44.620
let me actually use a relative path here, like this.

02:44.820 --> 02:48.530
So now create booking component is imported here,

02:48.560 --> 02:54.500
one thing we got to do here to make this work though is we need to register this component or we need

02:54.500 --> 02:56.030
to declare it.

02:56.240 --> 03:01.070
Now currently that's done in the bookings module because Ionic generate found that this is the nearest

03:01.070 --> 03:06.250
module to the create booking component but it's actually not the module I want to use.

03:06.260 --> 03:11.750
So let me remove it from the declarations there and let me remove the import there and instead, I will

03:11.750 --> 03:12.920
declare it in the place

03:12.920 --> 03:17.360
detail module because in the place detail component, I will open it.

03:17.360 --> 03:22.040
So in the place detail module, I will add my create booking component.

03:22.160 --> 03:28.100
Now important, if you had multiple components in your app or which are in different Angular modules that

03:28.100 --> 03:34.220
would open one and the same modal component, then you could create a shared module with that component

03:34.220 --> 03:39.670
in it that you import into all the other components where you need to open it. So here

03:39.680 --> 03:44.180
I'd only need the create booking component in the place detail module though, so it's fine to add it like

03:44.180 --> 03:45.170
this,

03:45.170 --> 03:49.570
obviously you want to add an import at the top like that

03:50.710 --> 03:51.670
and now it's declared,

03:51.680 --> 03:53.740
now we can create it here.

03:53.930 --> 03:59.900
Now just as with the alerts you saw earlier, this gives us a promise where we get our modal element and

03:59.900 --> 04:04.900
now we can call modal el present to actually show it.

04:04.940 --> 04:09.200
So create just creates it but doesn't show it, present will show it.

04:09.230 --> 04:13.820
Now you can configure other things here too, whether it's animated, whether you want to add your own CSS

04:13.820 --> 04:16.280
classes, some advanced things,

04:16.280 --> 04:21.530
if you can close it with the keyboard, things like that, component props will become important later but

04:21.530 --> 04:29.690
for now, let's just open it with this trick here. So back on our application, let's login,

04:30.260 --> 04:35.000
let's go to a place, let's click book and we get an error.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Now this error here is a typical error

04:38.000 --> 04:44.600
you will face a lot when working with modals and therefore I'm deliberately showing it to you. No component

04:44.600 --> 04:46.820
factory found for create booking component,

04:46.820 --> 04:52.370
did you add it to ngModule entry components and this is a really good error message because it already

04:52.370 --> 04:59.690
shows us the solution. When you're opening a component or when you're rendering a component, in a way

04:59.690 --> 05:00.800
like we're doing it here,

05:01.190 --> 05:08.120
so neither by using routing to show it and we aren't using routing, we're not using the Angular router, we

05:08.120 --> 05:11.390
haven't configured any route that would load that component

05:11.750 --> 05:14.150
and we're also not using it by its selector,

05:14.150 --> 05:18.400
we're not including the selector of this component into any of our templates.

05:18.470 --> 05:24.770
So if you're doing neither of these two things, then you need to add the component to a special array

05:24.770 --> 05:28.970
in your module which is named entry components,

05:29.210 --> 05:31.850
so you simply add your component there.

05:31.850 --> 05:33.310
Now why is this required?

05:33.320 --> 05:39.050
It let's Angular know that this eventually will be created programmatically and that Angular should basically

05:39.050 --> 05:44.130
be prepared to render that component when you require it to.

05:44.180 --> 05:50.510
So adding create booking component to entry components of the place detail page module is the solution

05:51.080 --> 05:56.750
and now once you do that, when this reloads and you login and you go to your place and you click book,

05:56.750 --> 05:59.610
here is our modal sliding up from the top

05:59.750 --> 06:04.400
and of course I haven't shown this in a while but of course we have different animations for different

06:04.400 --> 06:04.930
devices,

06:04.940 --> 06:07.160
so if I show this on an iPhone here,

06:10.270 --> 06:12.620
there it slides up like that.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.620
So that is pretty sweet,

06:14.620 --> 06:17.530
now how can we pass data into that modal,

06:17.530 --> 06:21.610
how can we close it and how can we pass data back?

06:21.610 --> 06:24.370
These are typical questions you have when working with modals.
