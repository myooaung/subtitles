WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:05.810
So we want to deploy our app here.

00:05.930 --> 00:08.390
As a native app that is what I'll start with.

00:08.390 --> 00:12.820
And for these native apps I want to have my own icons and my own splash screen.

00:12.860 --> 00:19.350
Now before we actually at these let's build our app so that we can open it an Android Studio and exit

00:19.350 --> 00:22.400
code and prepare it for deployment.

00:22.400 --> 00:29.150
For this what you can do is you can simply run energy build dash dash brought to build your application

00:29.150 --> 00:32.380
for production with the help of the angular CLIA.

00:32.780 --> 00:37.970
And for this command to work you need to make sure you have the angular seal I installed globally on

00:37.970 --> 00:39.100
your machine.

00:39.110 --> 00:45.770
Notice we'll take your web app and build it as it would build any regular normal angular app which you

00:45.950 --> 00:50.000
don't build as an eye on a gap or what you don't plan on publishing.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.260
As a native app.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.210
So this is what we'll do now.

00:53.210 --> 01:01.930
Let's wait for that to finish because with this finished you can now run ionic capacitor sync Android

01:02.120 --> 01:08.090
and what this will do is will take your built Web app and basically copy it into the Android folder

01:08.420 --> 01:11.630
and then you repeat that command for Iowa's important.

01:11.630 --> 01:17.840
You can only build for ISIS if you are building this on Mac OS on Windows or Linux you can only build

01:17.840 --> 01:18.890
for Android.

01:18.890 --> 01:25.150
Now this simply takes to build the web app and all the copies it into the Iaw and Android folders so

01:25.150 --> 01:33.430
that we can continue their side note you can always go into the capacitor conflict Jason File and adjust

01:33.430 --> 01:36.640
your app ideas here which should then be picked up.

01:36.700 --> 01:41.740
Once you do run ionic capacitor run or ionic capacitors sync.

01:41.740 --> 01:48.100
So this is that unique app identifier which you need to set to deploy wrap because this will uniquely

01:48.100 --> 01:50.490
identify your app in the app stores.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.530
So definitely make sure you set this.

01:52.600 --> 01:57.790
And as I explained earlier and of course this should be set to an identifier which looks like a reverse

01:57.820 --> 02:03.550
domain which doesn't have to really exist but which in the end is your unique identifier which is why

02:03.550 --> 02:07.150
here you typically use your company or your personal name.

02:07.270 --> 02:13.540
You end with dot com or you start with dot com therefore and then you have like a descriptor of your

02:13.540 --> 02:14.060
app.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.420
And of course that can be whatever you want.

02:16.450 --> 02:18.020
Typically you'd of course not name it.

02:18.020 --> 02:25.420
Udemy course I want to angular but something like Michael company dot fitness track or 2019 or whatever

02:25.420 --> 02:26.710
your name is.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.380
But that's just a side note.

02:28.570 --> 02:35.530
I will also show you how to adjust it from inside X code or Android Studio and that's the next step.

02:35.980 --> 02:45.710
Let's run ionic capacitor open Android to open our project in Android Studio and then of course repeat

02:45.710 --> 02:52.860
the same with IOW if you're on a Mac to also open it in X code.

02:52.860 --> 02:58.650
Now here's the project an Android Studio and it should automatically have that Android manifest X email

02:58.650 --> 03:00.060
file opened here.

03:00.060 --> 03:06.780
You can also open that in Visual Studio code here in the Android folder under app and there in the source

03:06.870 --> 03:12.790
folder you should find that Android manifest file with just that same file.

03:12.790 --> 03:18.400
Now what you'll notice here for me at least is that the package I that is used here is indeed not the

03:18.400 --> 03:23.530
one coded or added to this capacitor contact file I showed you.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.360
Well maybe there's changes in the future because I think it should.

03:27.430 --> 03:33.750
But right now to adjust your app I.D. for Android editors here in the Android manifest file in that

03:33.760 --> 03:40.840
Android folder and set it just as I described it a few seconds ago to that unique identifier formatted

03:40.840 --> 03:47.950
like a U R L or a reverse you are l make sure to adjust that here and you can learn more about that

03:47.950 --> 03:53.740
in the capacitor documentation if you scroll down to Android configuration there you'll also learn that

03:53.740 --> 03:58.090
you should change at the app I.D. here in your android manifest.

03:58.660 --> 04:05.530
You also learn how you can change your app name here and for that you go into the resources folder in

04:05.530 --> 04:10.130
the Android folder there and then undervalues strings excel.

04:10.240 --> 04:19.190
Here you find your app name and I will named is pair B and B because that's what we're bowling your

04:20.460 --> 04:26.010
and I'll also name my main activity pair B and B because that is what essentially gets shown in that

04:26.040 --> 04:36.840
task manager for example and I will also update my package name here to match that package name I have

04:36.840 --> 04:39.690
provided here in that capacity or conflict file.

04:39.690 --> 04:47.070
So in these three places also that to my identifier chosen there and also in the Android manifest.

04:47.100 --> 04:54.150
So if I go back out there to the Android manifest here I also want to use my identifier and you find

04:54.540 --> 04:59.390
most of these steps also described here the important steps are all mentioned here.

04:59.430 --> 05:04.300
Now with that set up we should all check our permissions sent there.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.420
We already had a look earlier in this course.

05:06.420 --> 05:10.570
You basically described what your app is allowed to do.

05:10.590 --> 05:13.430
Now we definitely want internet access.

05:13.620 --> 05:16.090
We also want to be able to write to our storage.

05:16.090 --> 05:22.240
We want to be able to get that location network state should be determined camera.

05:22.350 --> 05:29.340
We actually don't need to record audio or modify the audio settings so you should be able to remove

05:29.370 --> 05:30.660
these two permissions.

05:30.660 --> 05:36.810
But in the end you should always check of course with what your app uses and thoroughly tested after

05:36.810 --> 05:42.750
changing the android manifest so that we prepared Android.

05:42.930 --> 05:50.970
Now to also prepare Io s let me open does up an X code.

05:51.050 --> 05:51.740
Here I am.

05:51.740 --> 05:58.010
And side note just as you can configure Android here in your project folder you can all dive into IOW

05:58.010 --> 06:05.180
there in the app app folder and in that app app folder you'll find the info list which is a file where

06:05.180 --> 06:11.900
you can configure a lot of things like for example your display name of the application which will all

06:11.900 --> 06:20.120
and a pair be and be here there also are dynamically injected things like though which you should not

06:20.180 --> 06:26.620
overwrite here no back in X code here in the open project you can click on your project here on the

06:26.620 --> 06:32.800
left there you can also edit the things that just showed you in the configuration like for example that

06:32.800 --> 06:38.710
display name here it also did pick up that identifier is specified in the capacitor conflict so no need

06:38.710 --> 06:39.710
to change it here.

06:39.870 --> 06:45.530
And before you deploy you should also set your worships here to aberration.

06:45.550 --> 06:50.980
That is a scene from outside that version which you should of course change whenever you up they trap

06:51.230 --> 06:56.020
and an internal build which definitely should change it's not visible to the outside but it internally

06:56.050 --> 06:58.220
and in the App Store controls.

06:58.270 --> 07:05.650
Which version is the most recent version and so on for Android to go back to that we have something

07:05.650 --> 07:12.900
similar if you go into that Android folder there in the app folder we have that built graded file where

07:12.910 --> 07:17.980
you all just set a world name that is visible to the outside world which you can set to whatever you

07:17.980 --> 07:23.740
want and your internal version which you should also always change whenever you're deploying a new app

07:23.740 --> 07:30.760
version and here we have another case where we definitely should add our application I.D..

07:31.200 --> 07:37.440
So with that Android is prepared I w is prepared and if you want to configure more you're definitely

07:37.440 --> 07:42.130
dive into the official documentation for publishing Android and Iowa's apps.

07:42.150 --> 07:45.360
I also wanted to show you how to generate these icons right.

07:45.360 --> 07:50.040
So now with the app generally prepared let's do this next.
