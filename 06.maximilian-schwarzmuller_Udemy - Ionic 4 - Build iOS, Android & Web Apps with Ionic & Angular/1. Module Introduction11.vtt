00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.450
In this module we will learn more about the I want to project structure how that works what was created

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.450
for us there.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.810
And how does an ironic to actually get started.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.380
Then we'll dive into how navigation works in ionic two applications because that differs significantly

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.480
to a normal angler to web application.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.560
We will also learn the difference between pages and components and how both concepts are connected and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.270
then dive deeper into pages how to create them how to use them and which lifecycle they follow.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.010
We will also have a look at ionic two components all those built in components which allow us to create

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.000
you full native applications where we can learn more about them how to use them and then we will also

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.750
have a look at how we can adjust the styling and the theme of our application to our needs.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.740
So there are all the basics covered and always keep in mind all the things you are learning and this

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.260
module will later then be used in all the apps we build.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.040
So here we're laying out the very important fundamentals but we're done extensively going to practice

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.150
it for this course in all the apps we're building.
