In the last lecture we editors quote status source.

00:05.000 --> 00:13.640
Let's now use it in our favorites component but to use there we also need to be able to well mark a

00:13.640 --> 00:14.870
quote as favorite.

00:14.930 --> 00:19.100
So the first step actually leads to the library component here.

00:19.130 --> 00:25.550
We want to be able to well load all quotes and then display them so that we're able to favorite it and

00:25.550 --> 00:26.860
so on.

00:26.950 --> 00:32.780
First I will do some cleanup here if we need Nav. controller and so on I will imported later.

00:32.810 --> 00:38.230
I want to start with a clean component and this also makes for a better learning experience I believe

00:38.960 --> 00:41.720
and will also clean up the template a bit.

00:42.050 --> 00:45.860
So let's start by actually importing the quotes.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.340
How do we do that.

00:47.750 --> 00:51.540
Well since we have a static data source here it's pretty simple.

00:51.920 --> 00:58.610
I add a property here to the library page and I'll name a quote collection since well it is my collection

00:58.610 --> 01:06.350
of quotes and this will be of type and you could say but actually we do know the structure of this right.

01:06.350 --> 01:13.850
We do know how a code looks like and we do know that quotes are organized in kind of categories.

01:13.850 --> 01:20.030
So we can create fitting interfaces for this so that we can define the types explicitly.

01:20.030 --> 01:26.780
Let's do this year I'm going to add a new interface and I'm going to name the file quote interface start

01:28.490 --> 01:30.380
TS in there.

01:30.380 --> 01:37.790
All it will do is out explore the interface which will name quote of course and a quote simply has an

01:37.790 --> 01:40.490
ID a person and a Text property.

01:40.820 --> 01:45.490
So ID is a number you could say but actually I chose a string.

01:45.500 --> 01:53.090
So let's set this two type String prisoners type string and the text itself of course alters a string.

01:53.090 --> 01:57.920
Now it could also create the interface for D category.

01:58.130 --> 02:03.770
But actually I'm only going to use to category here in the library page so I can simply find a type

02:03.770 --> 02:13.270
here so quote collection will simply be of type Object where we have the category property.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.950
And again you could store it in an interface if you want.

02:15.950 --> 02:22.490
Which is the string where we have the quotes which is of type quote import quote from the interface

02:22.520 --> 02:23.990
pointing to that path.

02:24.260 --> 02:25.750
And of course it's not a single quote.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.170
It's an array of quotes.

02:27.500 --> 02:31.040
And we also have as I can property which is a string.

02:31.040 --> 02:38.660
So basically those free properties category quotes and I can this is how my code collection data will

02:38.660 --> 02:39.950
look like.

02:39.950 --> 02:45.970
Now with this set up we can simply set this in let's say the on in Hook.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.330
So let's implement DE on in its lifecycle.

02:49.490 --> 02:54.940
And if you're wondering if we're going to learn on how to add or get data from a server.

02:54.980 --> 02:59.450
Yes we will learn this in a later app but I don't want to crowd it all into one apps are we going to

02:59.450 --> 03:03.410
start with this static data source here at the on.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.700
Import from at angular core.

03:05.960 --> 03:13.700
And with this added You can now add where you have to add DNG on and add method to your class here and

03:13.750 --> 03:14.450
an end to an end.

03:14.450 --> 03:20.200
I want to set this quote collection equal to quotes now quotes.

03:20.210 --> 03:22.630
Is this array in the quotes file.

03:22.640 --> 03:28.180
So I have to import this file in this file in the library that TS file to use it.

03:28.430 --> 03:29.510
So I'm importing this.

03:29.540 --> 03:35.330
Ask what it's you can choose any name you want here because I'm having a default export here.

03:35.330 --> 03:39.890
So all I'm exporting in this file is desirÃ©e it's not a named export.

03:40.100 --> 03:43.010
I choose quotes because I'm using quotes down there.

03:43.280 --> 03:53.290
And we of course import these from the Rube's from the data folder and they're from the quotes file

03:53.410 --> 03:55.040
just like this.

03:55.330 --> 03:58.060
Does this tipoff we're importing quotes from.

03:58.330 --> 04:01.100
And now I'm getting an error that we have a type mismatch.

04:01.150 --> 04:06.570
And the reason is dead of course called collections not a single object but an array of such objects.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.610
So I should make this an array here too.

04:08.830 --> 04:14.650
If it works correctly so make sure to add the square brackets at the end of your code collection type

04:14.650 --> 04:16.160
definition here.

04:16.180 --> 04:22.930
So if this were importing all the quotes we added data the next step is to work on our template to actually

04:22.930 --> 04:25.860
output the data as a list of items.
