00:02.210 --> 00:10.760
So I created a blank project with ironic start your project name plank and then dashed as we to as you

00:10.760 --> 00:16.160
can see here and I want to start by creating all the pages we're going to need in this app.

00:16.190 --> 00:22.100
We of course have your home page by default as we have a blank starting project and we actually won't

00:22.100 --> 00:24.420
need this so I can already delete it.

00:24.740 --> 00:28.050
And now I want to add some new pages which we will actually need.

00:28.070 --> 00:33.500
I'm going to use to see live for days again where we can generate a page with the generate command generate

00:33.500 --> 00:37.680
page and then we can simply enter the page name here.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.850
The question of course is which pages do we need.

00:41.180 --> 00:47.960
Well we certainly need a tap's page because we have the tabs at the bottom and remember that is a separate

00:47.960 --> 00:49.950
page where these tabs live.

00:50.210 --> 00:56.510
We will then certainly need a shopping list page which holds the list of items we have on the you shopping

00:56.510 --> 00:58.850
list and allows us to add new items.

00:58.880 --> 01:05.770
We will also need a recipe's list which shows the recipes be stored in our app and we will need the

01:06.020 --> 01:14.510
recipe component or page year which allows us to do was a single recipe and which has these add ingredients

01:14.510 --> 01:16.120
to shopping list button.

01:16.340 --> 01:21.590
And finally we need a page which allows us to create and edit recipes.

01:21.590 --> 01:26.420
Now you could create two separate pages one for editing and one for recreating.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.310
But if you think about it it actually uses the same input fields right.

01:31.310 --> 01:38.340
There is no big difference the only difference probably is that in one case editing we pre populate

01:38.350 --> 01:42.250
the fields with well use whereas when we create a new recipe we don't.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.690
But besides that there is no difference.

01:44.720 --> 01:49.310
So I'm going to treat the adage recipe page which will serve for both.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.070
Changing an existing recipe or creating a new one.

01:52.070 --> 01:56.970
Of course you could pick a different name or split it up in two pages if you prefer this.

01:56.990 --> 02:03.260
So with this those pages are created and are stored in the pages folder and this are actually all the

02:03.260 --> 02:09.920
pages we're going to use We're going to need throughout this course module for this app.

02:09.920 --> 02:16.850
Now with the pages generated the next step is to add them to the app module and then I will start hooking

02:16.850 --> 02:21.500
them up to the tabs or I will start setting up the tabs invigoration.

02:21.770 --> 02:24.160
Let's first register them to the app Marchal.

02:24.170 --> 02:29.540
Here are two declarations I will simply add all the newly created pages and I will remove the home page.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.900
Let's do that first so that I don't forget this.

02:32.010 --> 02:33.820
Also remove the import from the home page.

02:33.830 --> 02:40.820
It of course doesn't exist anymore and whatever can add newly created pages like the added recipe page

02:41.180 --> 02:44.490
or recipe page and so on so will quickly do this.

02:46.070 --> 02:51.760
And once we added all those pages your tudy declarations aere.

02:51.980 --> 02:56.930
You of course are probably aware that you also need to add all those imports pointing to the individual

02:56.930 --> 03:03.120
files in their pages folders and then that you need to copy all the pages in the declarations that array

03:03.500 --> 03:07.450
and also add them to the entry components.

03:07.460 --> 03:15.620
Here to inform ironic too that it should be aware of those pages and that it should be able to generate

03:15.620 --> 03:18.250
them for us when we need them since we load them through.

03:18.370 --> 03:22.900
I don't like to use navigation conceptus stack of pages.

03:22.940 --> 03:27.560
Speaking of that in the next lecture I want to set up this tap's navigation.

03:27.560 --> 03:33.020
We learned this before and then we can move on and start working on even individual pages
