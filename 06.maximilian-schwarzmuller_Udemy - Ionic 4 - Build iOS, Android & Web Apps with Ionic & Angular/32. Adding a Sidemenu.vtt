00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.230
Now that we add the theming let's add this side menu which allows us to go to the settings to switch

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.890
to an alternative background adding aside menus something we haven't done yet.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.360
So let's dive into it.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.880
I want to add the side menu kind of on the routes page even above the current route page which would

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.470
be The Tapps page.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.770
I want to have a side menu but no jailable on both taps.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.850
But if we don't open the menu and choose one of its items I want to go to a totally different page.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.340
I want to replace the current root page you could say if I go to the settings page I don't want to have

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.040
those tabs at the bottom so the menu needs to be able to edit my route page.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.820
Therefore it makes sense to go into the root component and here to the template of the root component

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.630
here.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.690
I'm setting up there which initializes our navigation stack and which initialize our route page.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.930
And since I just said that I want to be able to dynamically switches are actually at my menu here.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.580
We add a menu with the menu component.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340
This is again a bolt in component.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.160
I want it to ships with Iron Man you need to know where it should render its content.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:25.250
And I want to render my content here on this navigation stack so I will create a local reference.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.760
This is normal angler to send text with the hash tag here and I can pasters here.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.690
I have to bind to the content property and I will bind to this content reference maybe this naming is

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.730
confusing.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.240
So let's simply name it Neph maybe.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.310
So the content of the menu item I select should get rendered in this navigation stack.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.260
This is what I'm telling ironic to you.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.990
This is again this picture of splitting up the navigation stack I showed you earlier and of course with

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.950
that I'm making sure where I want to render my content.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.210
Now I can style the menu.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.280
You place the same elements in your as you place in the page so we can have a header.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.260
This is optional though with a toolbar Nada and nav bar.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.870
This is a toolbar.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.500
It's not a nav bar because it doesn't have any navigation elements.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.900
It shouldn't have a back button of course because it's in a menu.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.750
It's not a separate page.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.470
So toolbar has the same look but it's handled differently behind the scenes.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.730
Again it won't have a back button and so on.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.270
I will also add a title where I simply say menu you could of course change this and very important.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.570
We need a content the content of that menu.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.420
Now any year I want to have an iron list and you can style your menu the way you want to it.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.220
You can use the grid to order elements in the way you want to order them you can implement the image

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.690
if you want to the image in your menu really.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.370
You are free to style this however you want.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.730
You're choosing a list and I will add a button of course with an item since it is inside of a list and

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:21.980
in there I want to have our I and I can which should have a name of setting's and I can then say item

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.440
left to align it on the left and I'll have my settings text.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.220
Old and duplicate this button to also have my codes button and maybe I should make the first button

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.240
the court's buttons are here.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.930
I want to go to my quotes app and I know that there is a quote I can the I can repository of ionic to

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.110
you can of course always look this up in the documentation if you're searching for a specific I can

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.950
so I've got two entries in my menu quotes button and a Settings button.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.640
Of course I should also hook them up to lead to the correct page or to load the correct page.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.670
All of course add a click listener for that where a load on load or way I want to execute on load.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.300
And in this case your I want to load the tabs page.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.930
This of course is the property I haven't created yet here in this case I want to exit the same method

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.220
on load but I want to load the settings page.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.760
This is another property I haven't created yet.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.050
So let's quickly let's quickly create those properties in the app component file.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.450
I do have a route page as of now.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:39.310
Now I want to set up a tap's page property which holds my taps page and the settings page which holds

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.170
my settings page.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.670
Obviously.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:52.930
So with this I'm storing those pages in properties I can get back to the HGL file and get rid of root

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.620
page here.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.930
That should be the taps page by default.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.630
That of course also means that I can lead read page here and only using taps page and settings page

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.070
now.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.250
And by default again I want to load the Tapps page but now I need to implement on load to be able to

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.350
switch to page through the menu.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:16.750
So I'll add on load here and in on load I expect to get the page which is of type and because it can

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.480
be it has page or settings page which are two different types of course.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.490
And that here I simply want to.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.130
Well what I want to replace my currently active route page.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.880
So I kind of want to replace this part here.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.610
The root attribute of my navigation stack.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.620
How can I do this.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.820
Let's find out in the next lecture
