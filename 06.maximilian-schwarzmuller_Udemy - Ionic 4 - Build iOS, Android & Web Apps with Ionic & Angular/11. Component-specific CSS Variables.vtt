00:02.480 --> 00:07.720
Now we had a look at all the core building blocks to styling in ionic apps.

00:07.730 --> 00:14.780
By the way no matter if your building an ionic angular or just ionic vanilla app now feel free to of

00:14.780 --> 00:21.010
course continue exploring the docks to learn about all the different properties you can sentence on.

00:21.020 --> 00:27.830
One thing I want to point you add is that in the component documentation you'll also find for each component

00:28.250 --> 00:34.730
let's say for the button you will not only find an explanation on how to use it and which properties

00:34.730 --> 00:41.180
and attributes you can set but if you scroll down to the bottom you'll also find any sensible CSR as

00:41.180 --> 00:43.480
properties for Dad specific component.

00:43.550 --> 00:46.880
If there are any and how would you use these components.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.260
Now that is all important to learn.

00:49.400 --> 00:55.610
You see that for a button you can set the background background act the way that box SHADOW BORDER WITH

00:55.820 --> 00:56.750
and so on.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.150
So what can you do with that.

00:59.210 --> 01:06.530
You can set debt of course not by going to variables and adding it to root because if you start adding

01:08.080 --> 01:14.800
dash dash eye and background here which is a variable that is mentioned here for buttons then this will

01:14.800 --> 01:17.020
not have the effect you want.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.170
Or by the way it's just named background it is will even less have the effect you want.

01:22.230 --> 01:28.290
Instead what you do is simply you set up your own variables for the specific selector.

01:28.380 --> 01:35.190
So in the example of the button for ion dash button and that's all important you select ionic components

01:35.280 --> 01:37.290
just like normal H2 to all elements.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.180
If you want to select them by tag.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.480
So this is absolutely supported.

01:41.640 --> 01:46.380
And now for ion button you could set up anything you could set the color to white to set a white text

01:46.390 --> 01:50.400
color but here you can now also use these special variables.

01:50.400 --> 01:57.800
So here you could now set background to blue and that automatically every button would have a blue background.

01:57.870 --> 02:04.890
If you haven't assigned a specific color so if you as for example on your off page if you are styling

02:04.890 --> 02:09.180
a button with color primary it will still have that primary color as you can tell.

02:09.270 --> 02:14.100
But if you would remove that we're talking about the default styling that would normally be a grey ish

02:14.100 --> 02:14.660
look.

02:14.670 --> 02:20.190
Now if you remove that and you got that blue look or that blue color set up then you got a blue color

02:20.340 --> 02:21.410
out of the box.

02:21.540 --> 02:27.120
So that is what this would allow you to do and you do assign these components specific variables by

02:27.120 --> 02:33.900
using the components selector and then applying the variable or setting the variable you want to set.

02:33.930 --> 02:39.090
Here I'm doing this in the variables SPSS file and therefore this will have an effect application wide

02:39.420 --> 02:45.150
but you could even do that of course in a component SAS file to scope it to that component.

02:45.150 --> 02:51.720
So if we're talking about the offer item again here I could also target my eye and text and set up some

02:51.720 --> 02:57.240
specific styles for that and then only iron text instead of offer item would be affected.

02:57.300 --> 03:03.420
So Dad would not be having an effect application wide hence it's important to also keep in mind that

03:03.720 --> 03:10.560
where you set this up plays an important role and that in general you can also set component specific

03:10.560 --> 03:12.930
properties for the color.

03:12.930 --> 03:19.410
This might be less necessary because often you want to use your main theme but maybe you want to change

03:19.410 --> 03:25.940
the way the shadow looks on all buttons because by default here on Android we have a slight drop shadow.

03:26.160 --> 03:30.050
Maybe you're not happy with that and you want to use a different one.

03:30.050 --> 03:38.820
Well then you can simply add iron button and then set shadow which is simply this box shadow.

03:38.880 --> 03:46.650
This variable so box dash shadow then we could set this to let's say two pixels two pixels 20 pixels

03:47.040 --> 03:51.400
and then this shadow style overall.

03:51.420 --> 03:56.670
So now this would be a default value you would assign to the box shadow property.

03:56.700 --> 04:02.460
Here I'm assigning it to the box shadow variable which as we learned is supported by ionic and is picked

04:02.460 --> 04:07.880
up by the button and therefore now we have a larger shadow on this button as you can tell.

04:07.920 --> 04:13.590
So this is all to what you can do you have these component specific properties or variables you can

04:13.590 --> 04:19.320
set and you can not just use component selectors to style anything even outside of variables of course

04:19.320 --> 04:25.380
you can still apply normal CSX rules but you can also use these C as as variables to set application

04:25.380 --> 04:29.940
wide or component wide styles for a specific ionic component.
