To synchronize this and make sure that our template is connected to this programmatically created form.

00:08.210 --> 00:15.350
We use a bunch of directives which are unlocked by adding the reactive forms module to our energy module

00:15.350 --> 00:16.390
here.

00:16.460 --> 00:22.940
First of all we want to use a form wrapper again so I'll add does form element the regular form H html

00:22.970 --> 00:31.030
element around my entire grid that contains all these form inputs on this form wrapper I will add a

00:31.030 --> 00:38.890
new directive form group to which I bind dynamically and this will point at my form property and that

00:38.980 --> 00:43.260
is just that form we're creating programmatically here.

00:43.270 --> 00:49.750
So now does overall form is subject to that but of course I need to tell angular which of my programmatically

00:49.750 --> 00:55.810
could created controls your belongs to which template control because it does not automatically try

00:55.810 --> 00:56.980
to figure that out.

00:56.980 --> 01:02.110
And honestly it would have a hard time because whilst for us humans it's pretty clear that this is our

01:02.110 --> 01:04.210
title because we have that label here.

01:04.210 --> 01:11.350
It's not really that clear that this input here should hold the value for this title control and it

01:11.350 --> 01:14.100
would be pretty bad if Anglo would make such guesses.

01:14.200 --> 01:21.490
So instead we tell it by adding the form control name directive to that input without square brackets

01:21.580 --> 01:28.120
just binding to a string here and that should be the name you chose as a key name here in your form.

01:28.140 --> 01:35.890
So title description prize date from end date to these are the names I chose there and these are the

01:35.890 --> 01:37.530
names I now have to use here.

01:37.690 --> 01:45.370
So I'll find this title and this tells angular that in this form this input belongs to the title form

01:45.370 --> 01:46.270
control.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.020
Of course I'll do the same for it as text area here.

01:49.080 --> 01:55.600
They're all add form control name and set as equal to description which was the name I chose and TypeScript

01:56.050 --> 01:59.650
and for the prize here it's form control.

01:59.650 --> 02:05.200
Name price again using that name I set up there in typescript.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.870
Now for the dates it's no different.

02:06.940 --> 02:15.060
Here I add form control name date from and for the second day time I use form control.

02:15.090 --> 02:16.690
Name date 2.

02:16.830 --> 02:17.640
And that is it.

02:18.800 --> 02:26.540
Now we connected the form to the form and TypeScript and the result can already be seen if I now go

02:26.540 --> 02:35.180
to on create offer and there I don't cancel lock this text but instead I can console log this form here

02:36.500 --> 02:44.310
if we do that let's wait for that to reload and I click this checkmark we need see the form control

02:44.310 --> 02:50.040
of the form group excuse me and under the controls we see date from day to descriptions on and we also

02:50.040 --> 02:52.160
see that in the value object down there.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.350
Here we get these same fields.

02:54.350 --> 03:04.740
Now if it cleared a console and I enter a title and some description and a price that is 0 to start

03:04.740 --> 03:10.260
with and then I'd choose a date let's say here 1st January 2020.

03:10.260 --> 03:17.930
And it is available all the way to December thirty first two thousand twenty one.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.910
For now it does checkmark.

03:20.210 --> 03:27.860
We see that under value we can see these values we chose there all as how we get that date and we also

03:27.860 --> 03:35.150
see that the price is zero but that the overall form is not valid because of that price which is also

03:35.150 --> 03:36.430
marked as red.

03:36.440 --> 03:43.490
If I set this to 100 here now it does looks better and now if it cleared the output and submit this

03:43.490 --> 03:49.100
again we see that overall validity is true and we still see all the value is here.

03:49.130 --> 03:52.040
So that is how we can now work with this form.

03:52.040 --> 03:57.560
We don't need to pass it as an argument in our submit function because it already isn't a typescript

03:57.590 --> 03:57.980
code.
