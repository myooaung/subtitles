00:01.980 --> 00:03.820
So I'm back in the Recipe Book.

00:03.840 --> 00:09.150
As we left it at the end of the last course module at the end of the last section where we built this

00:09.150 --> 00:15.840
app and I want to start by creating the pages will need as already mentioned we're going to need two

00:15.840 --> 00:16.540
new pages.

00:16.540 --> 00:22.680
We're now let's generate them manually or with this slide generate page and I'll need a sign up page

00:22.740 --> 00:29.850
and a sign in page you could of course also try combining both into one page but to make the features

00:30.030 --> 00:35.790
really distinct and to really highlight what's happening on each page I'm going to generate two different

00:35.790 --> 00:36.600
pages.

00:36.900 --> 00:42.630
So does add add those new pages to my pages folder or here sign in and sign up and the next step of

00:42.630 --> 00:48.300
course is to fold them with some life and also to implement a side menu sort of we could actually reach

00:48.300 --> 00:56.490
them now for now since we haven't implemented any authentication logic I will make them always reachable.

00:56.490 --> 01:01.970
So even if we're already in the running recipe book application because right now we only got this as

01:01.980 --> 01:07.440
again we don't have a way of self-educating a user on one side menus so that we're always able to see

01:07.440 --> 01:13.700
those pages whilst we're building that then as a next step we're going to implement that authentication.

01:13.740 --> 01:19.410
Therefore since it would be nice to be able to go to those pages and see them in action I will start

01:19.410 --> 01:25.670
by building a site menu and I will start building it in the app age html file in the next video.

01:25.810 --> 01:31.320
Because if you remember this from the first app we built this is a great place to implement the side

01:31.320 --> 01:37.350
menu to tell it that we want to use this route navigation stack and replaced the route page of this

01:37.350 --> 01:40.380
deck depending on the menu item we chose.

01:40.380 --> 01:45.690
Now that would be a nice exercise and challenge for you to implement this side menu on your own.

01:45.690 --> 01:50.150
Feel free to go back to the first epi bolt where we implemented the side menu too.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.690
If you need some repetition and with that I can only wish you good luck.

01:53.760 --> 02:00.630
What we'll need is a side menu is a button to bring us back to our recipe book app to our main app to

02:00.630 --> 02:03.860
Lotus tap's page and then and forth.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.420
You sign up and sign in page.

02:05.430 --> 02:11.400
And lastly a button which allows us to log out all of you are free to search for some fitting icons

02:11.430 --> 02:17.340
in the icon repository and I will solve this together with you and implement the Cybermen with you in

02:17.340 --> 02:18.520
the next lecture.
