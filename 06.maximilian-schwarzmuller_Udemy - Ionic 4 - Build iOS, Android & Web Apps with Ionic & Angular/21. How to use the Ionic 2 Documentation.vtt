00:02.100 --> 00:07.770
We're nearing the end of dishcloths model and we already covered a lot we covered a lot of the basics.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.670
And of course there is more you can learn about navigating around.

00:11.670 --> 00:16.100
There is more you can learn about pages but hey this is what we're going to do in all the applications

00:16.110 --> 00:17.090
we're going to build.

00:17.190 --> 00:23.700
The basic chipset now though you should know what pages are how navigation generally works how you can

00:23.700 --> 00:30.030
load pages how you can pass data and how the lifecycle of pages works with dad got a solid foundation

00:30.240 --> 00:33.170
to start working on the real application.

00:33.180 --> 00:35.920
However there is something else I want to show you.

00:36.090 --> 00:42.210
If you go to the official ionic documentation which you can find it ironic framework dot com slash docs

00:43.050 --> 00:48.240
you can see that we have a couple of points here on the left and in general the ionic documentation

00:48.240 --> 00:49.950
is pretty good.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.960
The first thing I want to show you is here under API.

00:53.280 --> 00:58.150
This gives you an overview over all the classes ionic to ships with and no worries.

00:58.170 --> 01:00.170
I don't want to read through all of them.

01:00.180 --> 01:06.240
Actually we will see a lot of them throughout the course and learn more about them without well looking

01:06.240 --> 01:07.480
at the documentation here.

01:07.560 --> 01:13.200
But it is a great place to look at some things if you want to dive deeper especially interesting right

01:13.200 --> 01:19.230
now are all the NAF related comments here or parts for example nav controller.

01:19.530 --> 01:25.250
Here you can learn more about pushing and popping and our methods the control office.

01:25.500 --> 01:33.840
But just to wardan you we will cover a lot of those methods and ways to use that in the course in the

01:33.840 --> 01:35.110
apps we're going to build.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.230
So it's probably not the best idea to do dive super deep into this article.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.160
I just want you to be aware of it.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.730
If you need to look something up.

01:43.740 --> 01:50.820
The important thing I want to show you is the components section ionic to ships with a rich component

01:50.820 --> 01:51.590
library.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.990
And here you can see all the components it offers.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.820
Right now the cool thing about this documentation is you can click on one for example the buttons and

01:59.820 --> 02:01.360
then you get the slide preview.

02:01.350 --> 02:02.670
You're on the right.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.270
You can even switch between different operating systems to see how it works.

02:06.330 --> 02:07.890
And those previous are interactive.

02:07.890 --> 02:12.060
You can click the buttons and there are also some components which will then actually do something in

02:12.060 --> 02:12.870
the preview.

02:13.170 --> 02:18.150
You can learn more about the components here but I also don't want you to read through all the components

02:18.150 --> 02:19.070
right now.

02:19.170 --> 02:23.920
This is what we will start with in the next course section when we build our first app.

02:24.030 --> 02:26.310
We will use a lot of those components.

02:26.340 --> 02:32.010
But since it's impossible to cover all components and all possible configurations directives you can

02:32.010 --> 02:33.440
add and so on.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.790
It's definitely a good idea to go back to just documentation and look at the components you want to

02:38.790 --> 02:40.120
work with right now.

02:40.230 --> 02:43.870
If you want to see how you can configure it how you can use it.

02:43.890 --> 02:50.160
But again we will use a lot of those components throughout the course so no need to review all of them

02:50.160 --> 02:51.250
right now.

02:51.270 --> 02:55.020
The last thing I want to highlight here is the iron Aikins point.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.430
I don't two ships with a lot of built in.

02:57.450 --> 03:03.380
I can see you can use and those icons are pretty easy to use if you click on one of them.

03:03.450 --> 03:08.460
You'll see the code you need to use and ask what the components were going to use a lot of icons and

03:08.460 --> 03:09.780
all the apps we're building.

03:09.810 --> 03:16.230
So no need to dive super deep into this but I want you to be aware of this repository of icons and that

03:16.230 --> 03:16.850
you can find.

03:16.860 --> 03:17.610
I can see here.

03:17.850 --> 03:22.560
You can also search for icons here and the cool thing is if you search for a map you're not just seeing

03:22.560 --> 03:25.370
the map icon but also related icons.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.850
So this is a cool thing and something we will use a lot.

03:28.920 --> 03:34.720
This is the documentation where you can learn more about components icons and general API.

03:34.800 --> 03:40.970
Again a lot of that will be covered for the course but it's good to know where to find more information.
