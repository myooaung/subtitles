00:02.200 --> 00:09.410
With the map being there let's make sure the user can tap it to add new locations and Ford ad here.

00:09.430 --> 00:16.900
Let's add an event listener with ADD listener on the map so not on Google Maps events and we're not

00:16.900 --> 00:22.360
registering such a global event so to say but on the map which we created you can call add listener

00:22.900 --> 00:28.510
and add a click listener there and then this will give you an event object which you can use in that

00:28.510 --> 00:30.650
function that gets fired up on that click.

00:31.270 --> 00:35.920
So this is the function that will get executed on the click and we'll get an event object that holds

00:35.920 --> 00:38.900
useful information like the coordinates.

00:38.950 --> 00:47.320
So on that click all create a new coords or select that coords constant here which will be a javascript

00:47.380 --> 00:53.500
object and that object will have a latitude and you can name as however you want.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.840
By the way I'll stick lat and LNG here but this is now just data.

00:57.870 --> 00:58.960
I define not data.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.790
Google gives me so we can name is whoever you want.

01:02.110 --> 01:11.620
And on land here we can store event and then there is a lat lng so one word let LNG property which has

01:11.620 --> 01:16.380
a lat method that will give you the latitude coordinates off that event so off the Click event.

01:16.720 --> 01:21.990
And in case you're wondering how I know all of that well I mentioned that SDK dock documentation you

01:21.980 --> 01:22.530
are right.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.160
So that is the place where you can learn all of that.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.520
So that gives us the latitude.

01:27.550 --> 01:31.130
Now the long etude is received in the same way on the event.

01:31.150 --> 01:34.850
Let LNG thought LNG as a method.

01:35.020 --> 01:43.270
Now this gives us coordinates and now we can close the modal here with dismiss and pass on these selected

01:43.270 --> 01:48.640
coordinates as data let's say because in the end it is that coordinates set that we're interested in

01:48.640 --> 01:51.670
when the user taps the map.

01:51.700 --> 01:59.260
Let's now move back to the location picker where we open that modal and there I want to set up listener

02:00.400 --> 02:01.200
so on.

02:01.210 --> 02:07.470
Did this Miss which gives us a promise that will resolve as soon as the modal is dismissed.

02:07.690 --> 02:15.310
And there we get back the data would add modal so we get back some result or modal data whatever you

02:15.310 --> 02:23.050
want to call this and for now it's simply console log modal data and there will have a data field and

02:23.050 --> 02:28.260
that that is just how models work and what you already learned early and of course a modal can return

02:28.270 --> 02:33.370
data and a role it doesn't have to but it can and therefore we can access data and roll here.

02:33.370 --> 02:40.260
When we listen to the modal to be dismissed so this data thing here should be our coordinates.

02:40.630 --> 02:47.530
If we did select something so let's wait for this reload and let us select location and first of all

02:47.590 --> 02:53.410
I'll click cancel therefore I get undefined which makes sense and now let's pick a location and we can

02:53.410 --> 02:55.150
still interact with that by the way.

02:55.150 --> 03:01.990
Only if you single click somewhere so if you're not dragging then this will pick that it's another click

03:01.990 --> 03:04.540
here I get an error.

03:05.320 --> 03:13.840
Yeah this should be let LNG with a capital L at the start of LNG so that is something which is important.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.780
Case sensitivity matters.

03:15.850 --> 03:17.920
So with that change let's try it again.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.640
Let me simply pick this location.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.680
OK that looks good now.

03:20.710 --> 03:25.250
So we're getting that data now and this is how we can well get data back.

03:25.420 --> 03:32.800
Now the next step will be to convert these coordinates into an address and also into basically a screenshot

03:32.830 --> 03:37.330
of the map which you can show is a preview here instead of that select location button.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.130
After we selected a location.
