00:02.090 --> 00:07.460
So we want to navigate around between our components and for that, we can add links here.

00:07.460 --> 00:11.990
Let me add a horizontal line and above that, I'll add two anchor tags.

00:12.110 --> 00:21.130
The first one will lead to slash nothing, so to our person list and then just the pipe symbol in between

00:21.140 --> 00:22.620
for some spacing,

00:22.640 --> 00:28.090
the second one will lead to /input, like that

00:28.500 --> 00:31.190
and if we do that, we got two links here.

00:31.220 --> 00:35.690
If I click on person list, we are on this page and on input, we are on this page.

00:35.690 --> 00:41.240
The problem is however you can clearly see that the page still reloads because we use normal anchor

00:41.240 --> 00:49.040
tags here and that is bad because all our application state as you can see gets lost when we do that,

00:49.100 --> 00:50.590
Michael is not here.

00:51.510 --> 00:58.320
To circumvent this, we don't use anchor tags with the ref attribute but we use a directive offered by

00:58.320 --> 01:04.410
Angular, the router link directive.

01:04.470 --> 01:11.520
Now we bind to that and therefore we can use square brackets and pass a string here with the path we

01:11.520 --> 01:15.480
want to navigate to and that has to be wrapped in single quotes.

01:15.510 --> 01:22.020
Now there actually is a shortcut, if you're binding a string value to a property, you can omit the square

01:22.020 --> 01:25.790
brackets and then omit the extra pair of quotes,

01:25.800 --> 01:31.450
now this is no longer evaluated as a Typescript expression here but as a string.

01:31.560 --> 01:41.960
Now we do the same here for this input router link and what you will see now, with a t and what

01:41.960 --> 01:44.690
you will see now if you save that is that

01:44.690 --> 01:50.540
now if you switch between these routes, it happens faster and clearly, the page does not reload

01:50.840 --> 01:58.090
and if you add Michael here now and hit create and go back to person list, you see Michael up here here

01:58.330 --> 01:59.200
as well and

01:59.350 --> 02:01.110
that is of course awesome.
