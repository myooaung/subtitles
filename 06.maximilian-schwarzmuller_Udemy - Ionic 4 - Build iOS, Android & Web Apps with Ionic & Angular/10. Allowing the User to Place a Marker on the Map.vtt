00:01.840 --> 00:07.850
And The Last Lecture we made at work not want to implement a method to select a place to allow us to

00:07.850 --> 00:12.040
select the plaister to do so I'll go back to the template.

00:12.380 --> 00:20.040
And in this template I actually can add a new component inside of this SLBM Google Map component.

00:20.060 --> 00:29.180
So a nested component I'm passing a component in there and this component is the CBM Google Map marter

00:29.210 --> 00:29.890
component.

00:30.020 --> 00:33.220
So it's from the same package but a different component.

00:33.380 --> 00:36.920
And whereas the CBM Google Map component creates a full map.

00:36.980 --> 00:40.110
This will create a single marker on the map.

00:40.160 --> 00:48.680
Now this marker should of course only occur if we tapped the map so if we added a marker for this I'm

00:48.680 --> 00:57.110
going to add a vent to the rapping Sep Google Map component where I listened to an event exposed by

00:57.170 --> 01:00.060
this package by this component here.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.610
It's the map click event.

01:01.760 --> 01:07.940
And as a side note you can find out which properties and events are supported in the official documentation.

01:07.940 --> 01:13.120
I showed you a couple of lectures ago where we also navigated to this API key page.

01:13.580 --> 01:20.090
So this is the map click event exposed by this component and it is of course fired whenever we touch

01:20.090 --> 01:25.480
the map or whenever we click somewhere in the map and add a marker and there are other events exposed

01:25.490 --> 01:27.140
to on this event.

01:27.170 --> 01:33.320
I now want to execute the onset marker method which I have to create and important I-PASS dollar sign

01:33.320 --> 01:39.430
event because map click will emit an object which describes the place where I tapped on.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.020
And of course this is interesting to me.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.360
So I'm going to pass it on to this method I'm executing.

01:44.360 --> 01:49.020
So let's work on on set marker I'm going to implement this method on the page here.

01:49.250 --> 01:56.890
And again I know that I will receive an event here which I'll set off to type any and then Indes method

01:56.890 --> 02:02.760
body year I want to set the marker for days I will store the market in a new property here which subtype

02:02.770 --> 02:05.230
location and it's uninitialized at the beginning.

02:05.470 --> 02:13.000
But then here when we tap the map I will set the markers several set this marker equal to a new location

02:13.000 --> 02:19.180
object and in the constructor and it passed the latitude and longitude and we can prove crofter's from

02:19.180 --> 02:26.560
the event emitted from the from the maktab here and we can exit on the event there we will have a co-horts

02:26.560 --> 02:35.560
property and they're declared property and then the next step is to also signed along it used coords

02:35.740 --> 02:43.480
long at you'd like this if you want to know which hour feels this has a good trick is to simply lock

02:43.480 --> 02:48.400
the event to the console so that you can explore which data it exposes to you.

02:48.970 --> 02:54.380
So if that were setting the marker and that allows us to then display it on the map.

02:54.490 --> 03:00.940
So now let's go back to our map here and on the marker I will also bind some properties.

03:00.940 --> 03:07.360
Now the first property binding is de-leverage properties are the same as for the wrapping map where

03:07.360 --> 03:10.330
we were able to center the map on a certain position.

03:10.330 --> 03:15.850
Now I'm going to add a marker on this position or on the map on the position we tapped on to be precise.

03:15.850 --> 03:18.560
So here all choose Markert left.

03:18.880 --> 03:26.400
And of course are also at deep long it hewed property binding and use marker dot elenchi to bind to

03:26.410 --> 03:33.590
that to I only want to display this marker here if and therefore I will use NGF.

03:33.970 --> 03:40.210
Well if marker so that means if marker is not undefined this marker property which we only said when

03:40.210 --> 03:40.840
tabbing.

03:41.050 --> 03:46.540
So let's see if this works as expected when you saved us and let the application recompile.

03:46.540 --> 03:52.070
Let's go back to our application clicks plus click on select on map and now tab somewhere.

03:52.210 --> 03:55.270
And this does add a marker at the position we tapped on.

03:55.330 --> 04:00.880
And it can also see the object that gives us and it's a very simple optic only Hafs Dir has its courts

04:00.890 --> 04:02.680
Optik with lead you to Legget cute.

04:02.770 --> 04:06.010
So that was the event emitted and it contains all the data we need.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.360
We're now able to set a marker.

04:08.710 --> 04:09.450
Awesome.

04:09.610 --> 04:17.080
Next step is to add a button which allows us to discard or end or save this Modal year so that we can

04:17.080 --> 04:24.520
then transform the location of the marker back to our ad and you location place and also show the Google

04:24.520 --> 04:25.880
Map Axert there.
