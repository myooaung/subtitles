We could use auto log in and the app component of course that makes sense because when the app starts

00:08.810 --> 00:15.080
in initialize app or an engine in it then we certainly want to check whether the user is locked in.

00:15.080 --> 00:21.950
But an even better place might be our off guard because dad kicks it whenever we try to visit a protected

00:22.100 --> 00:23.430
place.

00:23.540 --> 00:33.610
So in the off guard here I will now still get access to use to user is authenticated but I want to change

00:33.610 --> 00:37.200
what I do when we're not authenticated instead of immediately redirecting.

00:37.420 --> 00:43.180
I want to check whether we're able to auto log in and therefore I'll not use tap here but switch map

00:43.210 --> 00:50.350
which therefore of course needs to be imported from our x j as operators and switch map now gets D is

00:50.450 --> 00:53.100
authenticated information.

00:53.890 --> 00:59.450
And if we're not authenticated here then I actually want to try to auto log in.

00:59.470 --> 01:08.420
So here it will return this off service order to log in and this should return and observable.

01:08.720 --> 01:14.080
So in order auto log in I am returning does observable chain and in the end This returns true or false.

01:14.090 --> 01:14.450
Right.

01:14.450 --> 01:21.180
That is what we just set up but it also tries logging us in automatically if we're not authenticate

01:21.180 --> 01:29.230
it then I'll return a new observable with off with the off creation operator imported from our exchange

01:29.230 --> 01:38.620
yes and there I will just forward the is authenticated information as a new observable because in that

01:38.620 --> 01:48.440
case all tap in get these authenticated information and then navigate by you are L and otherwise well

01:48.830 --> 01:51.700
just just let can load do its job.

01:51.890 --> 01:58.290
So now be off guard should take care about calling or to log in for us or not.

01:58.310 --> 01:59.630
Now let's give this a try.

01:59.630 --> 02:00.890
If I now save this

02:06.130 --> 02:12.320
and the app reloads I stay on this page because right now we have no data stored.

02:12.330 --> 02:13.830
Now let me log in here

02:16.520 --> 02:21.980
and I get an error can read property error undefined in the off page.

02:21.980 --> 02:30.580
We have this problem so it looks like we got an error but not from the server but from somewhere else.

02:30.620 --> 02:36.770
Let me console lock that error response temporarily to see what went wrong here when I tried to log

02:36.770 --> 02:46.640
in invalid time value add data to ISO string so in my off service in the place where I called store

02:46.730 --> 02:52.790
off data and a call to ISO state which string on the expiration time there we're having a problem.

02:52.790 --> 02:57.970
Probably because the generation of the expiration time fails.

02:58.020 --> 03:03.050
The problem here is I'm not getting the expires in key.

03:03.050 --> 03:09.200
You can see that if you check the network request that gets sent which is what I did to narrow down

03:09.200 --> 03:10.680
his issue here.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.530
We're missing that expires in KY.

03:12.530 --> 03:15.840
The reason for that is that I forgot something when I do log in.

03:16.070 --> 03:20.020
We're sending email and password and what else do we need to send.

03:20.030 --> 03:25.790
We have a look at the docs we should send return secure token which always should be true.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.530
Well didn't do that.

03:27.530 --> 03:33.260
So let's add returns and secure token here and set this to true on the log and request on the sign up

03:33.260 --> 03:39.080
request I did do it and now with this will get back expires in on the response and therefore we'll be

03:39.140 --> 03:42.200
able to set this expiration date.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.610
So now as this reloads here let's log in and now it is looks way better.

03:48.610 --> 03:52.220
Better we're allowed to visit this page now with a reload this page.

03:52.220 --> 03:58.130
I actually start here because now our auto logging works and you can see that stored data here in the

03:58.130 --> 04:00.140
browser if you click on application.

04:00.140 --> 04:06.050
Local storage because here on the Mac it is stored in local storage on the real device it won't there

04:06.050 --> 04:08.420
it will be stored in the native device storage.

04:08.420 --> 04:13.450
But here you can see your off data and that is your user I.D. and so on.
