WEBVTT

00:02.150 --> 00:05.870
Now that we spend so much time on going back and forth and loading data,

00:05.970 --> 00:11.990
let's move into the other big navigation concept we see in mobile but also in web apps

00:11.990 --> 00:18.260
and that would be a side drawer and Ionic ships with a built-in side drawer which you can easily add to

00:18.260 --> 00:19.110
your app.

00:19.170 --> 00:25.280
Now a side drawer of course is that thing you trigger typically with that hamburger icon in your pop navigation

00:25.280 --> 00:28.670
bar or your toolbar and then you tap that and

00:28.730 --> 00:30.370
the side drawer opens up,

00:30.370 --> 00:31.940
that is how that typically works

00:31.970 --> 00:39.260
and in that side drawer, you can have links to other pages, other areas in your application and you can

00:39.260 --> 00:45.470
also have other utility buttons, like for example logging the user out which might also navigate away

00:45.560 --> 00:48.470
but which mainly does something different.

00:48.470 --> 00:50.690
Let's see how we implement this in Ionic.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.670
Now I'm not getting tired of mentioning this,

00:53.780 --> 00:59.840
you can always dive into the official docs of course and there, you'll find this menu area which covers the

00:59.840 --> 01:05.180
ion menu which is how you set up such a side drawer and you find detailed instructions on how you

01:05.180 --> 01:09.340
may configure it there and how it works together with all these other components there

01:09.530 --> 01:11.780
but of course, let's now do that together.

01:11.810 --> 01:18.320
Now where do I want to have that hamburger icon? That's the first thing we have to ask ourselves and

01:18.320 --> 01:20.880
the answer is for me in this application,

01:20.880 --> 01:29.440
the hamburger icon should be found on that discover page here, it should also be found in the toolbar

01:29.530 --> 01:32.810
of the offers page here

01:33.010 --> 01:39.160
and I also then want to find it on that bookings page because the bookings page is actually the page

01:39.290 --> 01:42.880
we'll navigate to through the side menu.

01:42.880 --> 01:48.640
So basically put in other words, I'll add that hamburger menu in this app and basically all the places

01:48.640 --> 01:50.080
where I have no back button

01:50.080 --> 01:55.210
but of course that's just how it is in this app, might be totally different story for your application.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.980
Now how do we add that menu then

01:57.040 --> 02:04.520
because we first need the menu before we can add any form of button that opens it? You add that menu

02:04.520 --> 02:10.760
in your root component as a sibling to your root ion router outlet.

02:10.790 --> 02:17.240
Now actually, you can configure multiple menus in an Ionic app and you can even control into which

02:17.270 --> 02:17.970
content,

02:18.050 --> 02:22.080
so into which ion content object they should render.

02:22.250 --> 02:30.110
But typically, you use that main ion content or in the case of this iconic Angular app with the ion router

02:30.220 --> 02:36.410
outlet, you use that main outlet and that basically means whichever page is loaded through that outlet,

02:36.410 --> 02:43.850
the drawer, the side menu which opens up will be rendered as a animated overlay across that page on

02:43.850 --> 02:45.080
top of that page

02:45.140 --> 02:51.890
and this ensures that the side drawer doesn't get hidden behind some page or behind some toolbar or anything

02:51.890 --> 02:52.340
like that.

02:53.180 --> 02:59.120
So inside of ion app, next to ion router outlet, you therefore add ion menu, that is your wrapper

02:59.120 --> 03:01.760
around your entire side drawer.

03:01.970 --> 03:10.100
Now that ion menu now takes a side attribute and you can set this to start or you can set this to end

03:10.310 --> 03:12.740
to define from where this should slide in.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.880
Now it's not named left or right,

03:14.930 --> 03:21.110
just as you didn't name the buttons in the toolbar, the slot there left or right, because start typically

03:21.110 --> 03:26.660
is on the left but depending on the device we're talking about or the region in the world you're using

03:26.660 --> 03:32.570
this, start might actually be on the right of the screen and therefore start simply means what typically

03:32.570 --> 03:39.230
is treated as the start in your region and on your device and on most devices and regions, that would

03:39.230 --> 03:40.640
be on the left.

03:40.670 --> 03:47.150
Now you also should add the main attribute here, to the ion router outlet because Ionic will internally

03:47.150 --> 03:52.730
look for that main attribute when it tries to open that menu when you toggle it and I'll show you how

03:52.730 --> 03:54.060
to toggle it later.

03:54.110 --> 03:59.990
So main should be added here and then this menu will render itself into whichever page is loaded here

04:00.110 --> 04:05.230
and it will open from the left, thanks to side start or it will open from the start

04:05.300 --> 04:11.030
I should say. Now inside of that ion menu, you can have an ion header and it's the same ion header

04:11.030 --> 04:17.490
component you already know from your pages. So the ion header is not limited to those pages

04:17.610 --> 04:23.910
and the same is true for the ion toolbar which you can add in there, which could then in turn have an

04:23.910 --> 04:24.890
ion title and here

04:24.900 --> 04:31.800
I'll simply add the title of my application and I'll name it PairBnB because we have mostly places

04:31.800 --> 04:36.330
that are for couples, for pairing up with other people,

04:36.350 --> 04:38.010
I don't know, something like this.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.320
So PairBnB is what we have,

04:40.320 --> 04:46.500
that is the toolbar and now we also have ion content, so you can already see the content you have inside

04:46.650 --> 04:52.500
ion menu is basically the same content you would have in a page. You have the ion header and then you

04:52.500 --> 04:57.660
have the ion content, oh and the ion content should be outside of the ion header of course. So ion

04:57.660 --> 05:03.090
header and ion content are inside the ion menu and inside the ion content, you can now really render

05:03.090 --> 05:04.080
whatever you want,

05:04.080 --> 05:11.070
could be cards, could be a list, could be images, you can use any element in there. You can use paragraphs

05:11.070 --> 05:15.990
and divs in there, you can use whatever you want in here but of course typically, you want to render something

05:15.990 --> 05:17.330
that looks nice.

05:17.400 --> 05:23.940
So here I will render an ion list with a couple of list items. Now which list items would that be?

05:24.600 --> 05:34.030
Well the first item will get an icon here with a name of business maybe, I find that this is a nice icon for

05:34.030 --> 05:35.180
the purpose I have here

05:35.190 --> 05:40.560
but of course you can use any icon you want from ionicons.com and the slot will be start so

05:40.560 --> 05:46.230
that this is on the left of that ion item and in the ion label, so in the text for this item, I then

05:46.230 --> 05:53.880
want to have find or maybe discover places. That takes us to the discover places

05:53.890 --> 05:56.820
page, so to the places page with the tabs.

05:56.820 --> 05:59.320
We also want the second item and here

05:59.340 --> 06:12.020
I'll use a checkbox outline, also slot start which is for your bookings, so which leads you to your bookings

06:12.020 --> 06:16.350
and with that I of course mean the bookings you made, not the bookings for places you're offering.

06:16.730 --> 06:22.750
And last but not least, I'll add another ion item which will become important later and that will be for

06:22.870 --> 06:24.130
logging out,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.440
so the name here will be exit,

06:26.470 --> 06:28.920
slot is start

06:28.930 --> 06:34.110
and on the label, so for the text, I'll just have logout.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.970
So these are the three items I want to have in there.

06:36.970 --> 06:43.360
Now one thing you can do on the ion item, you can set lines to none so that there are no lines between the

06:43.360 --> 06:47.770
items which I personally find to be a bit nicer in the side drawer

06:47.790 --> 06:49.600
but that is up to you.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.800
This is the finished side drawer but of course we can't see it,

06:52.800 --> 06:58.260
so let me next show you how to open and close it, toggle it and how to navigate from inside of it.
