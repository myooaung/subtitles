00:00.610 --> 00:06.310
Now that we learned a lot about the binding and directives.

00:06.580 --> 00:12.710
I want to also highlight an important other feature of a large you or of Engler in general which you'll

00:12.730 --> 00:18.290
often use does is setting up your own property or even binding.

00:18.550 --> 00:24.010
So let's say we want to pass some data from our app component to the users and it would be nice if we

00:24.010 --> 00:31.450
could somehow say well users we input the users we're looping through.

00:31.450 --> 00:36.130
So this array here we don't set it up in our users component.

00:36.130 --> 00:43.150
Instead we set it up in the app component and then of course we want to pass this array of users so

00:43.180 --> 00:51.670
we could say users we want to bind to some users property which does not exist right now on our users

00:51.670 --> 00:58.710
component and we want to pass in our users here now renamed to avoid confusion.

00:58.870 --> 01:01.860
So let's say these were all our registered users.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.950
So this property shall now be passed onto the users component.

01:05.950 --> 01:08.980
And when we can do this by passing it like this.

01:08.980 --> 01:15.670
Now again this will not work because users to which we try to bind here is not a property we can bind

01:15.670 --> 01:17.690
to on our app users component.

01:17.770 --> 01:22.730
So this component but we can make it work in the users component.

01:22.990 --> 01:27.430
We're trying to loop through the users property anyways but we removed it.

01:27.610 --> 01:33.180
So let's add it again but let's simply not declare it define it.

01:33.220 --> 01:36.390
It's only declared it doesn't hold a value though.

01:36.700 --> 01:43.960
Now we get the value from outside but by default you can't bind two properties in your components.

01:43.960 --> 01:50.200
And this is good but you can explicitly state that you want this property to be bind the bill from outside

01:50.590 --> 01:53.230
by adding at input like this.

01:53.230 --> 01:55.410
Don't forget the parentheses.

01:55.900 --> 02:01.840
And you need to import input from angular core like this.

02:01.840 --> 02:08.960
Now with this we're telling Engler hey this property or maybe set from outside with property binding.

02:09.010 --> 02:11.380
Exactly what we're using here.

02:11.380 --> 02:17.530
Therefore if I now save this we should see the same map as before and we do all the names are output

02:17.530 --> 02:18.210
here.

02:18.580 --> 02:26.870
But now we're passing in this array of names from outside from our parent component from the app component.

02:27.370 --> 02:32.870
Now we also can exchange data or information the other way around.

02:33.130 --> 02:39.250
Let's say once we have an event you're in the users component we want to inform our parent component

02:39.250 --> 02:40.260
about this.

02:40.600 --> 02:48.230
So for example we not only have the show info button but we have to show a alert button.

02:48.520 --> 02:57.600
Now here I want to say where I want to execute the on show alert method which will add to this component.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.570
Therefore And of course could simply run.

03:00.580 --> 03:08.020
Alert hello or something like that but I want to execute this code in my parent component here.

03:08.080 --> 03:14.280
I want to have a method let's call it child on child alert.

03:14.440 --> 03:23.930
And here I want to say alert child was clicked something like that now this method is placed in the

03:23.930 --> 03:31.130
app component we can't execute methods in our components from while the user component for example.

03:31.340 --> 03:36.860
But what we can do is we can create a custom event this user component emits.

03:36.990 --> 03:44.240
So what being nice if in our app component template we could listen to let's say Alert fro on an event

03:44.270 --> 03:50.090
which clearly doesn't exist yet and execute on child alert.

03:50.090 --> 03:56.050
Now again alert rhÃ´ne is of course not an event which exists but we can't create it.

03:56.120 --> 04:03.650
We can go do the use component and at alert Fronteras was the name we used a second ago.

04:03.650 --> 04:10.130
Now alert frozen should then be a new event emitter and this is an important event emitter.

04:10.310 --> 04:13.560
You need to import event emitter from angular core.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.510
It's a tool.

04:14.510 --> 04:15.830
Angular gives you.

04:16.100 --> 04:22.990
And here you can simply guess what image and event event emitter is a generic which means it may hold

04:23.000 --> 04:25.250
it may pass any form of data.

04:25.400 --> 04:29.380
For example it could pass the message you want a place in the alert.

04:29.540 --> 04:35.860
So it will hold a string indicated by lower then and greater then sign and the type of data you'll be

04:35.860 --> 04:37.680
met in between.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.950
Now to make this any wind we still have to add something.

04:42.080 --> 04:49.430
In this case at output and I think that should be easy to remember an input means data is set from outside

04:49.730 --> 04:53.130
and output means the data is passed on to outside.

04:53.390 --> 04:57.490
You also need to import output from an angle or core.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.760
And with this you basically have your event set up.

05:02.780 --> 05:11.560
Now you can emitted in on show alert by running this alert phone emit and pass.

05:11.580 --> 05:15.040
This is my message for example.

05:15.330 --> 05:20.910
Now in your app component you're listening to alert phone now does the event exist since we created

05:20.910 --> 05:24.390
this event emitter and marked it with an output.

05:24.840 --> 05:30.210
And in our app component we might want to display the message we're passing right.

05:30.210 --> 05:31.910
This is my message.

05:32.010 --> 05:37.550
We can do this by first going to the template where we listen to the event and where we then execute

05:37.550 --> 05:45.060
a method in the component and we know we will get some data and this data always stored in a dollar

05:45.060 --> 05:46.950
sign event variable.

05:46.950 --> 05:54.730
This is a protected reserved word a reserved name so to say English to use is to hold your event data.

05:54.780 --> 06:02.340
So always use dollar sign event if you want to extract your own event data dollar assign event is now

06:02.340 --> 06:07.410
passed on to you on child alert and therefore here we know we will get divin data.

06:07.410 --> 06:11.780
We know this will be a string so this will be our message to be precise.

06:12.030 --> 06:14.550
So why don't we simply output message here.

06:14.750 --> 06:18.850
And with this if we save this we should have a new button show alert.

06:18.990 --> 06:21.980
And if we click it was opened on a different window.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.020
But you see this is my message.

06:24.090 --> 06:31.040
This is alert Frue and we threw it on the app component not the usual component.

06:31.050 --> 06:39.030
So is a number important feature being able to pass data into components and to receive output or to

06:39.150 --> 06:41.390
listen to custom events I should say.
