00:02.350 --> 00:10.080
Now did we learned that we can use tabs to split up the navigation stack to add or a stack of pages

00:10.080 --> 00:18.000
to manage two different stacks of pages let's add tabs and actually did tabs are added as a separate

00:18.000 --> 00:18.880
page.

00:18.900 --> 00:25.230
So let's quickly add a new page year I'll add a new direct directory because when I edit manually and

00:25.230 --> 00:31.100
in that page folder I'm going to name those tabs SANDS Well this page will only hold my tabs.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.580
I will soon explain how that works.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.660
Let me add a component there and I'll name it taps.

00:36.690 --> 00:39.170
Taps dot ts of course is the file name.

00:39.180 --> 00:43.160
And then there I want to export a class which will name tap's page.

00:43.230 --> 00:50.380
This page also receives the normal component decorator imported from angular of course.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.560
So let's quickly add to import at the top here.

00:53.640 --> 01:06.190
Import component from at angular core with this added Of course we want to initialize this year so I'm

01:06.190 --> 01:14.260
going to give to a selector of page tabs and I'll assign a template now this template here could go

01:14.260 --> 01:17.800
into an extra file as we used to do that.

01:17.890 --> 01:22.400
But since it's going to be a very short template I'm actually going to inline it.

01:22.630 --> 01:24.070
So back to x.

01:24.310 --> 01:28.560
I'm creating a string expression here and I can write a real multiple lines here.

01:28.900 --> 01:36.320
Now how does this template look like for the tabs page use salt yabber pages which always had I and

01:36.340 --> 01:37.090
header.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.520
And then I and content and so on.

01:39.520 --> 01:46.720
Now the tabs pages are different because tap's wilds placed in their own page and ionic to simply give

01:46.720 --> 01:50.460
us a frame to load over pages inside of them.

01:50.470 --> 01:56.070
Keep in mind the tabs are only at the bottom of the page so they don't actually make up the full page.

01:56.110 --> 01:57.750
Only a fraction of it.

01:57.910 --> 02:02.180
But then they will enclose the page which gets loaded Fruita tabs.

02:02.290 --> 02:07.600
The set up is necessary because if the taps page would be a totally separate page and would take up

02:07.600 --> 02:14.110
the full page Wilden clicking on a tab would remove that page and we would see the loaded page instead

02:14.440 --> 02:15.540
which we don't want to do.

02:15.550 --> 02:16.160
Right.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.110
So instead let's add the ion tabs component in there.

02:20.170 --> 02:28.530
I have a special component ionic to ships with which allows us to well set up some taps inside of taps.

02:28.530 --> 02:32.400
We will create individual I-and tab components.

02:32.440 --> 02:40.240
So singular for I and tab's therefore has the wrapper and inside of it we define which taps we actually

02:40.240 --> 02:41.740
want to have.

02:41.740 --> 02:45.350
Now I can tap on and need some configuration.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.810
It needs to have the root properties set fruit property binding.

02:49.990 --> 02:54.510
And here we have to reference a property only mode favorites page.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.160
This property doesn't exist yet.

02:56.170 --> 03:00.070
So let's create a here in the body of this tap's page.

03:00.070 --> 03:07.310
Favorite page and I'll assign a value and this value of course should be our favorites page so favorites

03:07.310 --> 03:09.270
page has the name here with ass.

03:09.550 --> 03:15.430
We also need to import the favorite's page up here of course which is we are telling to you when this

03:15.430 --> 03:17.080
tab here is clicked.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.060
Actually load the favorite's page in this empty space.

03:21.080 --> 03:28.420
This taps page gives us so you can think of D ion tap's component giving us not only the taps at the

03:28.420 --> 03:35.500
bottom but also a placeholder Virdi actually page or the actual loaded page depending on which tab we

03:35.500 --> 03:37.900
clicked on will be loaded in.

03:37.990 --> 03:43.930
And this is important if you keep the navigation concept in mind keep in mind that the top most pages

03:43.930 --> 03:45.240
the page you view.

03:45.250 --> 03:50.500
So again if clicking a tab would mean that we simply push a new page on that stack.

03:50.530 --> 03:54.110
It would also mean that we make the taps disappear.

03:54.130 --> 03:54.480
Right.

03:54.490 --> 03:58.730
Because the newly pushed page won't have the tabs at the bottom.

03:58.840 --> 04:04.090
Therefore we have this different set up where we instead split up the navigation stack and have a separate

04:04.090 --> 04:10.240
navigation stack rendered inside of this taps page kind of in this empty placeholder.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.720
Of course a tab without any I can all text is pretty boring though.

04:13.780 --> 04:20.980
So let's add a title to this tap with the tap title property here and here I want to set a title of

04:21.250 --> 04:23.640
favorites just like that.

04:24.010 --> 04:31.420
And we can also add another property if you also want to add I can though we can also just use a title.

04:31.450 --> 04:37.730
We can also just use I can here I want to mix it so I will also provide to tab I can property just a

04:37.730 --> 04:41.480
number property I untap component is able to handle.

04:41.510 --> 04:48.220
Now what do we have to enter here though we can find this out in the official ionic documentation.

04:48.610 --> 04:50.120
If we have a look at it.

04:50.350 --> 04:57.700
Ionic framework dot com slash docs we can click on I-and icons and I'd save for a favorite.

04:57.700 --> 05:01.960
We should pick a fitting icon so let's search for favorite here.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.770
And we actually see a couple of good icons.

05:04.810 --> 05:12.460
I really like to star most star the text you see here and that's true for any I can already is the name

05:12.460 --> 05:17.860
of Dyken so we can simply go back and enter star here just like this.

05:17.920 --> 05:25.060
And now we will have a tab with the star icon and the favorite's text below it or depending on which

05:25.060 --> 05:26.100
platform you are at.

05:26.140 --> 05:29.030
This will be placed automatically does this cool.

05:29.050 --> 05:35.650
Let's also add another tap and just tap your should actually hold our library.

05:35.860 --> 05:42.250
So here I'm going to assign the root property to tail Ionescu which page you should get rendered in

05:42.250 --> 05:46.190
this empty place in the pages and he taps page here.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.520
And here I want to load the library page.

05:49.690 --> 05:53.780
So let's also add this property your library page.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.550
It should reference of course the library page class.

05:57.550 --> 06:01.050
So make sure to add this import here at the top.

06:01.050 --> 06:08.280
Now with that added I want to set a tile here of course so I'll name a library and we all see the icon.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.170
Now let's search for a thing I can.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.220
Let's see if we find something fitting when searching for a library.

06:14.220 --> 06:22.050
Not really but a library also contains books so maybe a book is good or you could of course choose a

06:22.050 --> 06:23.580
bookmark whatever you like.

06:23.580 --> 06:29.110
I'm going to go with the book though so I will simply add book here.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.490
And with that did Hap's page is finished.

06:32.490 --> 06:39.060
This is our tap's page which will allow us to collect those taps and then load the different pages depending

06:39.060 --> 06:46.560
on which tab last clicked the last step of course is to use this page as our route page instead of the

06:46.560 --> 06:48.920
favorites page as we're currently doing.

06:48.990 --> 06:52.900
So let's go to our app component here and anywhere.

06:52.980 --> 06:57.700
I simply want to change route page to tap's page.

06:57.870 --> 07:01.760
So hit enter and also make sure to add this import.

07:01.830 --> 07:06.980
We can now get rid of the import of favorite's page though it's no longer needed because we changed

07:06.980 --> 07:09.870
the tabs page or we changed the route page I should say.

07:09.990 --> 07:17.160
So let safeties and recompile it and it would not work like that though because we did not add 2 AB

07:17.160 --> 07:20.140
module so make sure to add tabs page here too.

07:20.160 --> 07:26.750
It is a normal page and yes keep that in mind also at the import and also added to entry components.

07:26.790 --> 07:29.580
Now with Def Leppard recompile one more time.

07:29.730 --> 07:35.640
And now if we have a look at the running application here you see the two tabs at the bottom here and

07:35.640 --> 07:41.150
I can switch between them and by the title you can tell that it correctly switches to a page.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.270
And this is what I meant was mentioning the tabs page.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.800
Is this full page.

07:45.930 --> 07:52.560
But it basically only occupies this space here at the bottom and all that space at the top here is the

07:52.560 --> 07:53.740
free space.

07:53.740 --> 07:59.610
The kind of hook where you can load which ever page needs to be loaded depending on which I can you

07:59.610 --> 08:02.110
clicked it just as a side note.

08:02.130 --> 08:06.460
How does it know which page to load first when you reload this page here.

08:06.840 --> 08:12.720
Well it always automatically loads the page of the first tab it always automatically selects the first

08:12.720 --> 08:13.310
tab.

08:13.470 --> 08:19.180
Though you could change this by going to your tabs and only I entraps component itself.

08:19.320 --> 08:26.190
You can set a selected index property and if you change this to one the index starts at 0.

08:26.370 --> 08:32.460
You will see that it starts with the library page selected it see so this is how you could override

08:32.460 --> 08:33.360
this default.

08:33.360 --> 08:38.160
I'm going to reverse this because I like to have my first episode like that but if you need this changed

08:38.250 --> 08:39.840
you can change it like this.

08:40.110 --> 08:42.460
And as mentioned at the end of the last section.

08:42.510 --> 08:48.300
A good place to dive deeper into this if you need far more detailed configuration you can go to the

08:48.300 --> 08:52.590
API docs and simply look up the tabs here.

08:52.600 --> 08:58.160
There you will learn more about how to place it and how to style it how to configure it to really find

08:58.160 --> 08:59.770
to the to your needs.

08:59.820 --> 09:05.550
The general functionality was shown here though and this is how you will probably use it in the majority

09:05.550 --> 09:06.270
of your apps
