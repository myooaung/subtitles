With all the things we learned about buttons last grade and how we can use different gestures and our

00:09.240 --> 00:13.350
own components it's time for an Auburn assignment to practice those things.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.330
This is a little super super mini app.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.080
I want you to build.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.050
Now what does this app do.

00:20.430 --> 00:26.830
It does have a heading and a text which instructs us to tap twice and press four times down here are

00:26.850 --> 00:29.470
the tap and pressing areas.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.360
Now I also got a little list where is simply track how often we tap and press those areas and then I

00:36.360 --> 00:42.010
get a couple of buttons to even reset all or just the taps or chest presses.

00:42.120 --> 00:50.220
Now that allows me to tap tap and press and press down there and as soon as I fullfil or I get this

00:50.220 --> 00:55.750
code right so I tap twice and press four times this which is to you one.

00:55.770 --> 00:58.830
And of course we can then reset to start over.

00:58.830 --> 01:01.200
And if my entry is something wrong here.

01:01.310 --> 01:03.590
Then we don't get you one.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.700
So now we're there again.

01:05.700 --> 01:10.660
This is the little assignment but it uses a lot of the things where all of the things you saw before.

01:11.040 --> 01:15.730
I've structured this whole content in a grid year with rows and columns.

01:15.750 --> 01:21.570
I use a list with full list items though that's of course the very simplest I do is a couple of buttons

01:21.600 --> 01:25.770
which are a bit smaller than the normal buttons if I'm not mistaken.

01:26.070 --> 01:34.650
And I also have listeners for tapping and pressing here also I placed all those buttons in a separate

01:34.650 --> 01:42.090
component which I included which also emits an event to which I can listen so that I can handle the

01:42.090 --> 01:47.260
resetting of taps or presses in the main component in the page here.

01:47.460 --> 01:51.170
So one of the things you learn before are covered in this incitement.

01:51.390 --> 01:57.220
And additionally you will need to remember something you know from good old plain vanilla angler to

01:57.630 --> 02:04.410
how to get the event from a subcomponent D component holding the reset button is here to the parent

02:04.410 --> 02:07.110
component the page component here.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.950
There is no single way to solve this.

02:09.990 --> 02:16.200
I wish you good luck solving this in the next video you will see my approach to solving this.

02:16.260 --> 02:22.230
And of course that will then only be one alternative but hopefully one which shows you a solution which

02:22.230 --> 02:23.580
makes sense for you.

02:23.670 --> 02:24.860
So I'll see you there.
