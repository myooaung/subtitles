00:02.180 --> 00:05.900
Now we could use the template driven approach again to handle this forum.

00:05.900 --> 00:11.720
But I also want to show that reactive this approach which allows us to create our forum programmatically

00:11.720 --> 00:15.380
in typescript and then connect it to our template here.

00:15.380 --> 00:17.630
So for that I'll go to a line typescript file.

00:17.690 --> 00:25.010
But first of all we need to an able that reactive forms approach and hence we need to go to the module

00:25.700 --> 00:29.920
that includes our new offers page which is the new offers page module.

00:30.080 --> 00:37.640
And there we can remove the forms module from the Anglo forums and instead import D reactive forms module

00:37.850 --> 00:39.880
and add this to our imports here.

00:39.980 --> 00:47.660
And this unlocks all the features we need in the new offer page to use the reactive forms approach.

00:47.660 --> 00:55.040
Now in there we can create form property which will be of type form group and form group needs to be

00:55.040 --> 00:58.470
imported from at Anglo forms.

00:58.650 --> 01:03.860
Now this form here should be created in enjoin in it.

01:03.860 --> 01:07.430
So we'll set this form equal to new form group.

01:07.430 --> 01:14.330
That is how you create a new form programmatically in angular now form group takes a javascript object

01:14.510 --> 01:19.070
where we configure it and most importantly where we configure its controls.

01:19.070 --> 01:24.350
So here we assign simple key value pairs where the key is the name of a control and the value is the

01:24.350 --> 01:26.450
configuration of that control.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.430
And it will need a title control.

01:28.430 --> 01:30.350
We'll need a description control.

01:30.470 --> 01:32.230
We'll need a price control.

01:32.330 --> 01:36.470
We'll need a date from control and a date to control.

01:36.470 --> 01:42.830
Later we'll also add controls for a picked location and a picked image but we'll add these features

01:42.830 --> 01:43.220
later.

01:43.250 --> 01:46.780
So for now we'll stick to these simple fields.

01:46.910 --> 01:53.350
Now each of these fields needs a value of course and the value is a new form control.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.660
Now form control also needs to be imported from at Anglo forms.

01:57.800 --> 02:03.530
And in case you're already used to working with Angola forums and reactive forms approach of course

02:03.530 --> 02:06.120
you could use the form builder here as well.

02:06.200 --> 02:12.740
But I like this very clear approach so form control takes a default value which is null because I don't

02:12.740 --> 02:19.640
want to fill this title with any default value and then an object where we can configure it at this

02:19.670 --> 02:24.940
object here for example allows us to set when this form control should update.

02:25.070 --> 02:31.550
So should it update on change which is every keystroke or when the whole form is submitted or what I

02:31.550 --> 02:34.360
want to choose here when the form input blurs.

02:34.370 --> 02:42.140
So when it loses focus we can also set up validators here validators should be an array of validators.

02:42.290 --> 02:48.530
And there you can access validators which is an object imported from at Angola forums.

02:48.680 --> 02:54.480
And that's simply groups all the built in validators angular ships with and there for example I'll use

02:54.480 --> 02:56.620
these required validator.

02:56.630 --> 02:59.470
So now just make sure that the title will be required.

02:59.570 --> 03:03.490
You could of course also access validator as Min length or anything like that.

03:03.530 --> 03:07.370
And again the angler documentation is the place to go to learn all about that.

03:08.600 --> 03:14.180
So here for the description I'll also set up a form control with no default value here I also want to

03:14.180 --> 03:22.790
update on losing focus and I'll add my validators array where I access validators required and of course

03:22.790 --> 03:28.670
here you could also set a min length or what I'll do here at the max length validator.

03:28.730 --> 03:34.220
This now has to be executed like a function and there we pass in the maximum length we want to allow

03:34.470 --> 03:43.320
and I want to allow no more than let's say 180 characters now for the price here we create another new

03:43.320 --> 03:50.700
form control default value is no and in the object where we configure that control ise it update on

03:50.700 --> 03:58.710
to blur and I then add my validators where I want you have the required validator but I also want to

03:58.710 --> 04:05.400
make sure that we have to at least enter a price of one so that zero or anything below 1 or a negative

04:05.400 --> 04:07.200
price is not allowed.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.550
And that is possible with validators Min not Min length but just Min.

04:12.600 --> 04:19.560
And then you enter your minimal number like 1 and now if you would enter a zero or zero that 5 or minus

04:19.560 --> 04:27.620
1 or minus 1000 into this input field it would not be treated as valid now what about data from and

04:27.770 --> 04:28.700
to.

04:28.700 --> 04:34.880
Well these are all the new form controls which don't start with a default value.

04:34.880 --> 04:42.470
I want to update when we lose focus and here my validators they're all just required.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.060
So it must not be empty.

04:44.300 --> 04:50.660
And as I mentioned the good thing about ionic is that these days time controls are really just usable

04:50.690 --> 04:52.760
as regular form inputs.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.980
That is pretty nice and makes working with them particularly easy.

04:56.990 --> 05:05.420
So here I create another new form control starting value is now an update on blur and my validator is

05:05.420 --> 05:05.980
here.

05:06.110 --> 05:13.610
There I got validators required so that is the forum with which I want to work for now.

05:13.610 --> 05:18.530
The next step will be to synchronize this form object to our H2 Mal code.
