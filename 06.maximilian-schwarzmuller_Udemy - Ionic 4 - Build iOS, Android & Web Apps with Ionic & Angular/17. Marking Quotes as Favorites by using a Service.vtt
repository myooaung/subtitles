00:02.200 --> 00:07.200
And the last Would you we created our quotes service year.

00:07.250 --> 00:15.530
Now want to use this service to add quotes to our list of favorite quotes not to use the service.

00:15.530 --> 00:19.400
We first need to provided normal angler to approach right.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.890
Nothing ironic too specific.

00:20.900 --> 00:25.670
We need to provide a service we want to use now in order to provide it.

00:25.820 --> 00:29.180
We can go to the AB module to provide us an array.

00:29.240 --> 00:35.720
We already provide a default error handler on two ships with here I ought to also want to add my quota

00:35.720 --> 00:37.120
service like days.

00:37.130 --> 00:41.270
Make sure to order at the import at the top from your services folder.

00:43.230 --> 00:46.950
With this we're providing this quote service application wide.

00:47.010 --> 00:52.680
So wherever we injected we're using the same instance which of course is super important because we

00:52.680 --> 00:56.990
want to manage one and the same array of favorite quotes across our application.

00:57.330 --> 00:58.210
So any quotes.

00:58.220 --> 01:05.700
Yes file now here in the hÃ¤ndler when we actually click yes I want to add this quote I want to access

01:05.700 --> 01:09.340
my quote service and to do so only to check it.

01:09.540 --> 01:14.090
So let's inject the quotes service here.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.430
Quote service.

01:16.430 --> 01:21.280
Make sure to all to Adam Ward at the top here from your services folder.

01:21.530 --> 01:30.420
And then the handler here I can say this quote service at quote two favorites.

01:30.660 --> 01:38.190
And of course at the selective quote here so the quote for passing to the on to favorite method.

01:38.190 --> 01:46.050
Now to see if this works what I want to do is in the quote service here after adding it.

01:46.050 --> 01:52.690
I simply want to log my favorite quotes to see if it actually holds this quote We added.

01:53.010 --> 01:59.910
And so people also added Wessely in our application that we output a list of favorite quotes of course.

01:59.940 --> 02:03.870
So back in the application Let's go to library like click here.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.000
That's the favorite and yes go ahead.

02:06.270 --> 02:08.580
And we get an array of quotes.

02:08.580 --> 02:09.250
This looks good.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.910
Now let's also add another quote.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.480
The third quote here.

02:12.540 --> 02:13.740
Yes go ahead.

02:13.890 --> 02:20.020
Now we have two quotes in the array and you see the second code indeed is the one by Robert H.

02:20.040 --> 02:25.510
Schuller which has Well this great Will who has this great quote awesome.

02:25.650 --> 02:29.310
So with that we're using our state management we're using our service.

02:29.730 --> 02:32.970
I think this is a good way we're taking here.

02:32.970 --> 02:36.120
The next thing I want to have a look at is the Favorites tab.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.450
Here to actually display a list of our favorite quotes.
