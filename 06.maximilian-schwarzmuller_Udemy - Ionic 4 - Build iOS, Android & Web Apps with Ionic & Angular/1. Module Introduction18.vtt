00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.790
Thus far in this course we built a lot of awesome applications and we used a lot of I want to use features

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.800
but there's one important point we haven't looked at all and that is using native device features.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.890
Have in this chorus module we're going to build the app which uses those features extensively.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.240
We'll learn how to use those native features like for example the camera or fetching user or location

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.030
and also how to access the device storage both the file system the file storage system and also the

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.210
storage for storing data like in a database.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.880
You will learn how that works with I want to to what happens behind the scenes and therefore you will

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.220
gain the skills you need to add such features to your application because sometimes the non device native

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.500
features just don't do the trick.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.440
Sometimes you need that camera
