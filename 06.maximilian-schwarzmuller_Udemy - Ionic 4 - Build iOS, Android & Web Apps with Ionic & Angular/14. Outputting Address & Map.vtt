00:02.470 --> 00:09.210
Let's output some place data and let's do that in our discover area and the place detailed component

00:09.240 --> 00:16.080
which is that page here there were outputting the description and then we have the book button.

00:16.140 --> 00:23.680
Now wouldn't it be nice if we also saw a preview of the place here and the address so let's add a new

00:23.740 --> 00:31.210
ion row here with an eye and column and that column will receive the same sizing as my other columns

00:31.240 --> 00:40.090
do like this and I'll also add the padding attribute utility attribute here and now in that column I

00:40.090 --> 00:48.610
want to output my address for that I'll add a new paragraph in here and then I'll I'll put place location

00:48.780 --> 00:55.360
and now there we should have an address field because our if we check our location model our place location

00:55.360 --> 01:01.060
model has the address field and that just is the location we store in a place.

01:01.090 --> 01:08.080
Now let me copy that and let's add another ion row in there I want to output an eye an image and that

01:08.170 --> 01:13.330
I an image here of course will now be bound to place location.

01:13.330 --> 01:19.630
And then if we check our model again we have that static map image your l so it's that static map immaterial

01:19.660 --> 01:21.410
which I target here.

01:21.490 --> 01:25.120
So you yours output an image off that location.

01:25.120 --> 01:31.080
Now for the proper styling I'll give it a class of location image here.

01:31.390 --> 01:38.320
And therefore in the place detail page SC is as follows We can style location image and give this a

01:38.320 --> 01:49.060
width of 100 percent a height of let's say 25 REM and a max height of 30 v age and an object fit of

01:49.060 --> 01:55.510
covers so that this hopefully looks good let's save this and let's give it a try as does reloads

01:58.850 --> 02:07.410
yeah here's our address and here's our map preview now there is some room for improvement.

02:07.630 --> 02:13.790
First of all I want to center my address text let me add text center here and then there is a little

02:13.790 --> 02:15.420
bit too much padding.

02:15.500 --> 02:20.210
So on this page I'll actually target my paragraphs and I'll remove the margin.

02:20.210 --> 02:22.030
Sorry I mean margin not padding.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.820
So there is less space between these paragraphs.

02:25.070 --> 02:27.720
So now as this reloads does looks way better.

02:27.860 --> 02:33.230
And then there is our map which is of course nice but I actually don't want to have padding around that

02:33.230 --> 02:34.040
map.

02:34.040 --> 02:42.250
So here I'll remove the padding on that column that holds the image so that this takes a full with here.

02:42.500 --> 02:49.530
There still is some padding and that can be avoided by explicitly adding no padding here to remove that

02:49.530 --> 02:52.830
default padding that grid columns have otherwise.

02:53.070 --> 02:58.110
And now it just takes the full with which looks nicer in my opinion also doesn't look too bad here on

02:58.110 --> 03:03.120
a desktop device though of course you could consider adding some borders or drop shadows around the

03:03.120 --> 03:09.900
image and the map here but it'll do for now you're don't want to turn this into a C as course what they

03:09.900 --> 03:16.250
want to add though is that if we click that image here that we opened at mode again where we can't pick

03:16.250 --> 03:21.520
a new place of course but where we can scroll around to see what's around that area and so on.
