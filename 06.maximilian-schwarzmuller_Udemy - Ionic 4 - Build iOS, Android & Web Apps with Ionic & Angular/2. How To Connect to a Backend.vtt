00:02.390 --> 00:08.270
Of course we first of all need to understand how an eye on a gap connects to a back end so to a server

00:08.360 --> 00:11.090
running in the web where we want to store data.

00:11.090 --> 00:17.260
Now you could think that we use a database sequel or no sequel doesn't matter and we simply connect

00:17.270 --> 00:19.400
our eye on a gap to that to store data there.

00:19.400 --> 00:25.880
But this is not what we do because directly accessing the database would be a really insecure.

00:25.880 --> 00:31.900
For example we would have to store the credentials for accessing the database in our iconic app code.

00:31.940 --> 00:37.700
And since this in the end is all javascript people could get access to it and therefore we definitely

00:37.700 --> 00:40.550
don't want to directly connect to a database.

00:40.550 --> 00:44.450
Instead we connect to an API ex post on a server.

00:44.510 --> 00:47.350
This could be a REST API could be a graphical API.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.710
Could be web sockets.

00:48.710 --> 00:54.640
It is an API that accepts h to be requests that then handle stemmed and run some code which is defined

00:54.800 --> 00:56.500
on the server which we don't care about.

00:56.510 --> 01:00.500
If we haven't written that code at least and which we can communicate with.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.630
So what is server in the end or the logic written there interacts with the database that all the runs

01:05.870 --> 01:08.270
on the server that also runs in the cloud.

01:08.270 --> 01:14.660
So to say and we just interact with that API to send requests and receive responses these requests and

01:14.660 --> 01:18.290
responses will be exchanged and a Jason format.

01:18.290 --> 01:21.580
So we're not sending HD him alla round or anything like that.

01:21.590 --> 01:27.800
Instead we'll send Jason data because that is easy to read in code and easy to work with especially

01:27.800 --> 01:31.240
when building an app with JavaScript as we're doing it here.

01:31.310 --> 01:37.470
Now that server does API could of course be written by you it could be your own custom back backend

01:37.820 --> 01:44.420
or use a managed service like firebase or a W as mobile hub or anything like that.

01:44.530 --> 01:51.020
In this course will use Firebase and whilst firebase sounds like it is just a database firebase is really

01:51.020 --> 01:54.860
a managed service that gives you an API to communicate with.

01:54.860 --> 02:01.280
That gives you a database with to which this API will then communicate and way more and we'll use a

02:01.280 --> 02:06.290
couple of these features so that we don't have to worry about writing back in code in this course because

02:06.290 --> 02:09.990
this isn't really the focus of the course we want to focus on the front end.

02:10.010 --> 02:11.420
We want to focus on ionic.
