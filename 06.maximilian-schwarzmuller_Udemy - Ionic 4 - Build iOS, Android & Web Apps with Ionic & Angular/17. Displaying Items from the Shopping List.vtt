00:02.730 --> 00:07.890
In the last lectures we get our shopping list service and we make sure that we can now add items to

00:07.890 --> 00:09.060
the shopping list.

00:09.060 --> 00:10.970
That's great but we don't see them here.

00:10.980 --> 00:14.820
So let's now start working on our shopping list template again.

00:14.850 --> 00:19.800
And on our shopping list page in general so that we're able to output the items stored in the shopping

00:19.890 --> 00:22.160
service in the template.

00:22.440 --> 00:30.240
I want to add a section below does for him here where we can output a list of those items of the items

00:30.240 --> 00:31.250
in a shopping list.

00:31.440 --> 00:37.680
Challenge for you create that list here in the template should be a very simple list in the end where

00:37.710 --> 00:40.860
we kind of have the item name and item amount.

00:40.950 --> 00:48.090
Choose whichever styling you want and once you're done with dead you might even try getting those items

00:48.150 --> 00:52.980
in your shopping list component and making sure that you're actually loading the data there.

00:53.430 --> 00:56.760
Let's do this together starting in a few seconds.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.180
So were you successful.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.740
Let's start by setting up the template here.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.280
I will add an item list below my form here and there.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.230
I want to have a couple of iron items.

01:08.680 --> 01:14.860
And just an item as I just said will be repeated because we need more than one one for each list item.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.350
Each ingredient in the end.

01:16.570 --> 01:24.220
So here we will use energy for to loop through all our ingredients so we can say let ingredient or just

01:24.220 --> 01:25.780
item because it's a bit shorter.

01:25.930 --> 01:30.070
Let ingredient off and then simply say a list items.

01:30.070 --> 01:32.490
We don't have that list items property yet.

01:32.530 --> 01:34.420
I will treat it in a second.

01:34.630 --> 01:40.580
Inside of the eye Item I will use a free heading of course you may choose a different one.

01:40.580 --> 01:45.100
Whatever style you want you can also create a more complex list item here if you're feeling like it

01:45.850 --> 01:48.740
and then it will output the item name.

01:48.790 --> 01:53.680
I will know that we will have a m name on that item since we're using the ingredient class.

01:53.680 --> 02:01.030
We created a few lectures ago and I also want to output the amount right so let's use string interpellation

02:01.030 --> 02:04.460
there too and output the amount of that item.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.100
So with that the missing piece of chords is this list item here.

02:09.520 --> 02:14.740
So let's add it to this property to the component itself like this.

02:14.740 --> 02:17.780
The question is how do we fall that we have a life.

02:18.130 --> 02:21.510
Well of course we know that it will be of Taieb ingredient array.

02:21.550 --> 02:28.240
So make sure to import Ingredion from the models folder and then will assign the type here.

02:28.270 --> 02:31.580
The question still is how do we load those items.

02:31.780 --> 02:38.650
Well there are different ways of loading this of course and one way is to do it in the Island View will

02:38.680 --> 02:40.520
enter Meffert.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.790
So I will add this method.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.640
Your you will enter a not using did load because I want to make sure that I always load this list when

02:50.640 --> 02:57.120
this page is presented and don't accidentally not load it because it was cached because think about

02:57.150 --> 03:03.080
adding items from the recipes page and then we go back to this page and it somehow was cached and then

03:03.130 --> 03:05.850
WIPs we don't see our newly added items.

03:06.300 --> 03:15.480
So I will use this method and here I will simply reach out to my list items and assign them to Duvalier's

03:15.510 --> 03:21.540
I get from the service calling the get items method which will give me a copy of that area stored in

03:21.540 --> 03:22.550
the service.

03:22.860 --> 03:28.560
So this will now assign the list items whenever this page is loaded.

03:28.560 --> 03:35.390
Now what this also means is that when we add a new item we won't see it being added to our page right

03:35.400 --> 03:37.760
because we're all we are on the page.

03:37.770 --> 03:40.350
We're not reloading it but also.

03:40.540 --> 03:45.990
But we're only getting a list of items when we did load the page when we are about to enter it.

03:46.020 --> 03:49.880
So changing something once we're on the page won't be reflected on the page.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.900
Which of course is not an optimal result.

03:53.970 --> 03:57.180
Now to change this there are a couple of solutions you could think about.

03:57.190 --> 04:03.330
You could manually push this item to the list here since you only have a copy of the item list in the

04:03.330 --> 04:04.510
array anyways.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.460
But I like the other approach to following approach more.

04:07.650 --> 04:10.070
I will treat a new private method here.

04:10.750 --> 04:18.880
Load items to a helper method kind of and here I will do what I just did here and I and you will enter

04:19.090 --> 04:20.720
I'll copy the code in there.

04:20.860 --> 04:27.670
That of course means that you will enter I will simply call this load items and I'll do the same here

04:27.840 --> 04:29.310
in on an item.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.500
I added a new item to the list in the service.

04:32.530 --> 04:37.730
So it's now time to call load items to get the latest version of that list.

04:37.930 --> 04:45.180
And with this if we save this let's see if it works as expected when we go back to our application.

04:45.550 --> 04:50.160
And if we start adding items like bread looks good to me.

04:50.300 --> 04:56.350
Let's also add some milk and let's now navigate away and go back.

04:56.580 --> 04:57.540
Looks pretty good to me.

04:57.540 --> 04:58.760
Items are still there.

04:58.890 --> 05:00.430
Let me add another one.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.590
Works like a charm.

05:03.840 --> 05:08.280
So showing those items works nice on the list here.

05:08.310 --> 05:14.160
Now what would now be nice is to have the functionality to delete items from the list when we collect

05:14.160 --> 05:18.760
them so that we check them kind of so that they are removed.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.930
You may start implementing this on your own.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.310
We'll do it together in the next lecture.
