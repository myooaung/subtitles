00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.630
In this section we have a closer look at all those built in components you saw where you can learn more

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.800
about them but you also saw some of them in action.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.930
How to really adjust butlers to your needs how you may work with lists and also how the grid system

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.370
works.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.680
And very important which gestures you may use and how they differ from each other.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.440
So with that little deep dive into the components world we are now prepared to move on but not to the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.230
next application yet.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.510
Instead let's now do something we haven't done yet.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.180
Let's see this application run on a real device.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.340
We'll do that in the next course module
