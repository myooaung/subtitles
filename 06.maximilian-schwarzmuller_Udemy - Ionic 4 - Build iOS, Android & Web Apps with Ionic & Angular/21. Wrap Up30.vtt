We could spend hours and hours going through all the components here but I think that's not really the

00:08.680 --> 00:10.780
idea behind a course like this one.

00:10.780 --> 00:13.100
I don't want to read the docs to you,

00:13.120 --> 00:21.880
I want to use as many components as possibly fit into the app we're building without the app then becoming

00:22.000 --> 00:25.160
an unrealistic joke or anything like that.

00:25.240 --> 00:31.060
So we covered a lot of components and I mentioned a couple of times that the official docs are the way

00:31.060 --> 00:37.870
to go to learn all about both the components we covered and their many configuration options as

00:37.870 --> 00:43.510
well as components we haven't had a look yet because Ionic has so many components.

00:43.510 --> 00:47.560
But the idea is not to learn them by heart but really when you're building an app,

00:47.590 --> 00:49.540
think about what you want to add,

00:49.540 --> 00:50.600
do you need a button?

00:50.630 --> 00:51.520
Do you need a menu?

00:51.520 --> 00:51.970
Do you

00:52.060 --> 00:53.260
need a modal?

00:53.440 --> 00:59.560
And then have a look at the docs and see which components could help you and how you use them.

00:59.560 --> 01:07.400
With that I'm quite happy with the current state of our application here, of the app we have here.

01:07.420 --> 01:13.300
I'd say it's missing some styling and we can certainly change the default styling to not use the default

01:13.330 --> 01:19.240
blue and therefore in the next module, we will have a look at how we style our Ionic apps, how we

01:19.240 --> 01:27.340
can write our own CSS code, how we can overwrite Ionic defaults, how we can work with themes to set a general

01:27.340 --> 01:35.530
color for the app. So that will be what we'll dive in next to make sure that our application

01:35.530 --> 01:39.910
takes more and more shape before we of course will also add more logic to it.
