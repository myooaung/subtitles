As shown on the previous slides on did dismiss is a great method to execute to listen to the dismissal

00:09.120 --> 00:11.810
of The View Controller of the motile.

00:11.870 --> 00:18.780
Now maybe you also recognize or remember we'll leave files showed this on the slide before now will

00:18.780 --> 00:19.560
leave.

00:19.650 --> 00:26.720
Simply returns and observable so we can subscribe to it and then have our first Colback 40 subscribe

00:26.730 --> 00:31.040
Meffert which is executed whenever it does absorbable fires.

00:31.050 --> 00:37.350
Now we can view the difference between on the dismiss and on we'll leave here you could think that we

00:37.410 --> 00:40.970
also get Remove which is of type Boolean here.

00:41.310 --> 00:46.340
So let's simply console log remove to see if this is the case.

00:46.470 --> 00:50.660
And that's still the same here in on the dismissal on the console log.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.510
Remove here.

00:52.560 --> 00:58.590
Now let's see if both methods or if discernible and this callback are both fired or called.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.500
And if we get the same result.

01:00.840 --> 01:10.230
Let me quickly add a new quote here and then if I click on this and Ektachrome close you see null and

01:10.230 --> 01:15.980
false and you maybe also solve that they didn't appear simultaneously.

01:16.050 --> 01:18.860
Instead Knol appears first.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.090
So we'll leave.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.880
And on that Miss are kind of fired at the same point of time.

01:25.890 --> 01:32.730
But then again not at the same point of time and they don't pass the same data on that dismiss is the

01:32.730 --> 01:37.730
right method to use with the callback to be executed when it happens.

01:37.860 --> 01:46.140
If you're actually dismissing a view controller like the modal well leave on the other hand is executed

01:46.230 --> 01:50.880
right before it is removed and it's not caring about your view controller.

01:50.880 --> 01:58.620
It's caring about the full component so therefore deadly would be closer from a time perspective because

01:58.680 --> 02:02.730
like did this Mr. Snell's executed right after it was dismissed.

02:02.730 --> 02:06.990
You can see this if you now add a quote here.

02:07.050 --> 02:14.190
Now if you click on it and dismiss it it appears simul tenuously but the data still differs because

02:14.370 --> 02:21.390
deadly believe and all those observables will not transport any data you pass with the dismiss function

02:21.800 --> 02:27.030
because you're you're really dismissing the view controller and there is a kind of a differentiation

02:27.270 --> 02:34.500
between the View Controller on which you can listen for it dismiss and will dismiss and to component

02:34.500 --> 02:35.450
itself.

02:35.670 --> 02:42.750
So if you're only interested in whether the modal was closed you can absolutely use this subscriber

02:42.810 --> 02:44.490
this method here.

02:44.540 --> 02:50.180
It's observable but if you also want to get some data on that dismisses the right choice.

02:50.190 --> 02:57.380
Be aware that those who view control or Hooke's cannot only be used to modals any page is a view controller.

02:57.510 --> 03:03.560
So there might be Avri use cases where we'll leave is better suited than here.

03:03.990 --> 03:10.560
So enough of the talking we're getting back the information whether we want to delete this quote from

03:10.560 --> 03:11.830
our favorite quotes.

03:11.970 --> 03:21.230
So all we have to do here now is we have to call this quote service and there I simply want to say remove

03:21.230 --> 03:29.270
quote from favorites and then of course pass the quote we pass to the on view quote method here.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.390
Though of course I don't always want to call it.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.270
I only want to call it if remove is true.

03:36.290 --> 03:41.480
Otherwise I don't want to execute this method because well if it's false if I just want it to dismiss

03:41.480 --> 03:44.890
the modal d'accord should not be removed from my favorites.

03:44.960 --> 03:51.420
Right so with this in place let's see if this works as intended.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.990
Let's load the application.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.410
Let's add a quote.

03:56.420 --> 03:58.070
Maybe a different quote.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.450
Just one year.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.040
Open up click click and favorite.

04:02.470 --> 04:06.290
Well somehow it doesn't disappear right.

04:06.290 --> 04:10.680
It disappears if we don't switch to page but it doesn't just disappear.

04:10.700 --> 04:17.120
And when the modalists dismissed we have to switch to page back and forth to see that it actually is

04:17.120 --> 04:19.370
in what way that is no longer our favorite.

04:19.370 --> 04:20.480
Why is that.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.170
Let's solve it in the next lecture.
