00:01.970 --> 00:07.730
This with you I want to show you how you may configure some parts of your eye on a two application.

00:07.750 --> 00:13.120
Now I'm not talking about the configuration here in the conflict SML file where you would configure

00:13.120 --> 00:15.430
your application for being published.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.990
I'm talking about the configuration on how your application will behave.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.330
At runtime we can do this in the app module.

00:22.330 --> 00:29.390
Do you remember this ionic module here which we import and where we pass our root component in in the

00:29.470 --> 00:31.470
first modules of this course.

00:31.470 --> 00:32.990
I explained that here.

00:33.070 --> 00:39.040
It would kind of a wrap itself around our application our app component here initialize the app and

00:39.250 --> 00:40.830
set everything up for us.

00:40.840 --> 00:47.160
And this is true now since this is the place where the whole application has kind of set up and configured.

00:47.170 --> 00:50.640
It's also the place where we can override some of that configuration.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.180
And this is exactly what this video is about.

00:53.290 --> 00:59.170
We can pass a second argument here to for root and that argument would be a javascript object which

00:59.200 --> 01:04.170
allows us to well basically override some of the default configurations.

01:04.180 --> 01:07.480
Now there are a lot of things we can configure here.

01:07.520 --> 01:14.960
Therefore as always it's a good idea to go to the ionic documentation here to API and then to Conn think

01:15.130 --> 01:16.560
you can learn more about it here.

01:16.570 --> 01:17.970
But I will walk you through that.

01:18.130 --> 01:23.470
But if you scroll down a bit you can learn about all the different things you can override quite a bit.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.310
But let's go back one step.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.700
What does this actually do.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.830
What could we want to override here and how does it generally work.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.370
Well let's start simple.

01:33.370 --> 01:36.460
Do you remember this back button in your application.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.720
Well it always helps is normal back text now.

01:41.740 --> 01:47.100
You can't change the back button and I actually did showed us the previous tips and tricks video.

01:47.290 --> 01:54.110
But if you want to change the text route your application and don't want to override did for each page.

01:54.220 --> 01:57.940
You can simply set the back button text here.

01:58.120 --> 02:03.790
So if you add this property and you will find that this is one of the supported configurations you can

02:03.790 --> 02:07.280
override here and us mentioned article if you scroll down.

02:07.360 --> 02:13.730
So if you set this you can pass a string as a value where you assign the new back button to move bag

02:13.750 --> 02:15.610
by simply changing it like this.

02:15.610 --> 02:19.900
Now you don't need to set the default of course as it's done automatically so you only override what

02:19.900 --> 02:21.910
you will want to overwrite here.

02:22.120 --> 02:26.350
And again there are a lot of properties a lot of configuration items you can change here.

02:26.350 --> 02:28.980
Have a look at the documentation I'm just showing you now.

02:28.990 --> 02:32.470
Let's see there's an action here to show this in action.

02:32.470 --> 02:38.830
I'll quickly add a new page ionic and generate page users.

02:38.850 --> 02:40.820
Just an example page your.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.260
Now I want to go to users here in my home page.

02:43.290 --> 02:50.420
So in March I'll quickly add the users page to declarations and also do entry components.

02:50.550 --> 02:57.810
Make sure you also add the import and what that I'll get go to my home file here and I'll simply replace

02:57.810 --> 03:01.580
the content here with a new button which should allow us to get there.

03:01.580 --> 03:11.550
So with I a button on it go to users and ultimately use the NAF push directive pushing to the user's

03:11.550 --> 03:11.950
page.

03:11.970 --> 03:16.520
And this is a property we need to add in the home dot TS file of course.

03:16.620 --> 03:21.840
So this should simply hold user's page a reference to this page as a value.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.460
Again make sure to also add the import in the home file then.

03:25.560 --> 03:30.510
With that let simply run ionic surf to run this project and see it in the browser.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.270
And we should now see it changed home button.

03:33.630 --> 03:39.220
So here's the running application and if I go to users you indeed now see move back as a text here.

03:39.300 --> 03:46.420
So exactly the text I set up here in the object I passed two days for root method here.

03:46.480 --> 03:55.560
Now you could also override our features like t I can mode 2 for SD style even on Android devices so

03:55.560 --> 04:03.000
instead of using material and besides setting those general settings which will affect all platforms

04:03.390 --> 04:08.180
and all devices you can also set up platform specific settings.

04:08.430 --> 04:15.670
You simply do this by adding a new property here which is platforms just like the other conflict names

04:15.720 --> 04:17.220
but there is no platforms.

04:17.340 --> 04:20.040
And this takes again a javascript Optik as in value.

04:20.040 --> 04:26.400
Now in this value you can set up the same configuration items or properties you would have set up in

04:26.400 --> 04:29.670
this root object but now nested here in platforms.

04:29.790 --> 04:36.570
So a year lets add the iOS platform which also holds an object and you may now add your different configuration

04:36.570 --> 04:37.230
items.

04:37.230 --> 04:41.280
So let's set the back button text here Q Back again.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.290
So that we generally override to move back.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.080
But for us I want back.

04:46.170 --> 04:50.160
So we should only see move back on Android and Windows devices.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.000
Let me save this and see if it works as a spec as expected here.

04:54.240 --> 05:00.000
So if we let does every load and go to users we need Seabeck.

05:00.170 --> 05:06.620
But if we change our emulator here our test devised in Chrome to the Nexus 5 x let's say which of course

05:06.620 --> 05:08.260
is an Android device.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.030
We move back now.

05:10.160 --> 05:16.910
So this is how you may set up your platform specific styles or your plan for platform specific configurations

05:16.940 --> 05:23.900
here by using the special platforms property in this root object then defining the platform which could

05:23.900 --> 05:26.610
be Aiwass or Android.

05:26.870 --> 05:31.590
And then DB properties to configurations you want to set up for this platform.

05:31.730 --> 05:36.350
Again you can learn more about this in the article I was mentioning earlier.

05:36.440 --> 05:41.330
Here you can read about all the different ways of configuring this an average helpful methods you might

05:41.330 --> 05:46.390
need but this isn't easy and a great way of adjusting the application to your needs.
