00:02.270 --> 00:07.970
As with the last lets first view what we're actually going to build in this model so that you also have

00:07.970 --> 00:13.800
a chance of starting to build this or at least starting to build the first page first element you will

00:13.800 --> 00:16.980
need before we will then dive into this together.

00:17.020 --> 00:23.330
This is the little application I'm planning to build a little recipe book shopping list application.

00:23.330 --> 00:29.150
If you've taken my angler to coaster's might look familiar though it's not exactly the same.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.950
So what we have here we do have a shopping list page.

00:31.970 --> 00:36.590
And the recipes page right now I don't have any recipes so let's add one.

00:36.590 --> 00:38.230
We do this by clicking on the plus.

00:38.300 --> 00:42.610
And then we get our input field here where we can simply add a new recipe.

00:42.620 --> 00:50.720
For example we can add the spaghetti recipe your just spaghetti because spaghetti are just a delicious

00:51.320 --> 00:58.400
and well-done we simply cooked until girds And here we would write our little description on how to

00:58.580 --> 01:02.330
create that delicious meal here and then we can all choose a difficulty.

01:02.330 --> 01:06.960
This is a simple dropdown and you could say well that's pretty easy so let's Witchetty easy.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.540
And of course we also need some ingredients right.

01:09.650 --> 01:15.100
That's why I have to is managing Rhydian button here and there we can simply add a new ingredient.

01:15.110 --> 01:17.690
For example we definitely need spaghetti.

01:17.770 --> 01:18.980
Can atom.

01:19.190 --> 01:22.340
And with that added we can ever change it year.

01:22.340 --> 01:28.070
If we had some type of year or something we want to change or we can remove all ingredients from the

01:28.070 --> 01:31.550
recipe and also noticed these little toasts we're getting at the bottom.

01:31.610 --> 01:38.690
For now I'll simply Riette this and with that I can now click on new recipes to create as you can see

01:38.690 --> 01:43.910
it now appears here in my recipes page or on my recipes page.

01:43.910 --> 01:49.610
Now with that I can also go on that recipe you add in detail all the edit the recipe for one to make

01:49.610 --> 01:53.650
any changes or simply add the ingredients to my shopping list.

01:53.690 --> 01:59.410
If I then go to the shopping list you now see we have spaghetti there on the list and we can move hectors

01:59.420 --> 02:03.870
or click on it to remove it and we can also add items here manually.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.230
Like for example milk let's boil 10 more items.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.850
That is the little application we're building here.

02:10.850 --> 02:17.000
And the main focus of this app of course our Fordham's it is also nice practice when it comes to using

02:17.000 --> 02:19.220
the components and working with pagers.

02:19.310 --> 02:25.490
We also do have this tap's navigation again but you'd certainly notice that we get a lot of forums here

02:25.490 --> 02:34.830
for the recipe with a normal input field a text input field a dropdown then this action shiftier a dialogue

02:34.850 --> 02:41.120
where we can say enter something and then also this dynamically added form array here.

02:41.150 --> 02:42.680
This is the input field here.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.800
At the end right.

02:44.210 --> 02:47.360
And then also the shopping list which contains a form.

02:47.570 --> 02:51.680
Forms are of course something angle or two supports really well.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.200
And now we're going to see how they are implemented into ironic too.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.730
In our example application here
