00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.450
Just like in a normal English to web app you can of course also validate forms in an ironic to app you

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.830
can of course use the very same validation logic and concept you're used from your English to Wepa.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.490
So here's the challenge for you.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.360
Try implementing a very basic validation you're on your own.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.040
Try ensuring that both input fields here have to be non-empty So they are both required and that you

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.540
disable the item button if at least one of the two fields is actually MTSO is not valid.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.980
Also you use my approach of doing this in a couple of seconds so now's your chance to pause the video

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.870
where you're successful.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.400
Let's now implement this together and let's make sure that we actually ensure these fields to not be

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.350
empty because right now I can submit the form even if nothing is entered in the amount field.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.990
Keep in mind this placeholder is not the actual value.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.200
It's just an example.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.030
It's not actually filled into the input field.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.330
So to add this validation I go will all go back to the template here and I'll add a number attribute

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.330
are here to my ion input the required attribute.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.620
This is the normal age of 5 required validation attribute which tells HVM L and therefore angle or that

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.160
that I need this input field to be non empty that there has to be some value and I'll also do the same

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.170
for the amount input here.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.880
With this angle you will start at Stiefel validation logic and place the energy invalid and so on classes

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.720
on there's input if it is invalid and it also stores the validity of the.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.390
And the overall form I can use this on the button to add property binding here and bind the disabled

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.700
property.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:00.280
And I want to disable the button of the form is not valid so I can simply check if not form valid for

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.240
invalid is true if the form is valid.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.470
So if this is not the case I want to disable the button which I am doing here.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.130
Well I'm with this time change in place if I go back and let the app reload you'll see the button is

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.190
now disabled.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.170
It is still disabled if I enter something here.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.160
But if I enter something here too.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.200
And now both fields are populated.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.280
I can again submit the form.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.000
So now we get validation in place again just like it works in a normal English to EP.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.980
But now in our ironic to app
