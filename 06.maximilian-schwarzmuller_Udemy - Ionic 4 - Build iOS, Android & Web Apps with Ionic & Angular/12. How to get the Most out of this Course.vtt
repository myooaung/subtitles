My goal with every course is to get you to get the most out of the course.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.520
Now how do you do that.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.150
Well obviously you're going to watch all the videos and I strongly recommend to all code whilst watching

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.480
the video.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.600
So did you write the code on your own.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.190
But besides watching the videos I also recommend that you do the assignments I have in this course and

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.440
that for the apps you try to build parts of those apps on your own.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.300
I'm regularly going to challenge you in those apps to pause the video and go ahead on your own and implement

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.670
some feature we already implemented before.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.710
So definitely do this to get a feeling for where you're stuck and where you need to dive in deeper.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.510
Well and besides dead there of course the SECU and a section and definitely ask questions if you're

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670
a stack or if something is unclear.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.430
But besides asking questions I also strongly recommend answering questions really answering questions

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.860
is how you learn the most.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.140
Because asking is easy answering is difficult right.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.730
And you can't do anything wrong here.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.370
If the answer is not correct someone is going to come and correct you and then you'll learn again.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.150
This is the great thing about answering.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.220
You learn by thinking about it and by maybe getting corrected.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.680
So definitely go ahead.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.880
Browse to Q&A section and answer unanswered questions to benefit the most.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.540
And besides that I am regularly going to point you to the official documentation.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.880
Not because I'm lazy and don't want to show it in the video but because there's so much that diving

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.280
into that documentation which is really good 4-A on it too as a side note is a great way to learn about

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.740
all the features of a specific class or component offers to you.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.760
And as dumb as it might sound if you're stuck with some error message or something like this you can

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.620
of course go to the Q&A section and I'm happy to help but it might be faster to Google that because

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.450
chances are someone else also had this issue.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.280
This is how I think you're getting the most out of the course.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.260
And with that enough of the talking let's dive into the next section and let's start diving into ionic

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.610
