00:02.000 --> 00:07.040
So we want to use our own Eichen and splash screen and for that we go to the resources folder.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.380
This is where we can store our own files.

00:09.380 --> 00:13.880
And I wanted to give you some default files which are not the files we're seeing on the device right

00:13.880 --> 00:14.410
now.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.030
Why.

00:15.050 --> 00:19.290
Well when you install it when you create a project you can have a look at them by simply opening them.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.470
That would be the icon.

00:20.510 --> 00:27.530
And as you can see it has these dimensions and any icon Ukridge should have these dimensions to 1024

00:27.530 --> 00:29.520
times 1024 pixels.

00:29.810 --> 00:32.250
And it also gives you a default splash screen dish.

00:32.270 --> 00:40.600
This flashgun which is really huge and which is sayst like this way of 2208 times 2002 it had an 8 pixels.

00:40.610 --> 00:43.910
So make sure to keep those dimensions for your own assets.

00:44.030 --> 00:51.270
Now we can use DSL it's ironic to give us your or we can provide our own assets.

00:51.380 --> 00:58.640
You can also set up specific assets for Android and iOS by going into these specific folders and then

00:58.640 --> 01:00.920
putting your own icons in there.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.320
And as you can see you can then even be as specific as providing different splash screens for different

01:06.320 --> 01:11.850
device resolutions by using this naming convention drawable.

01:11.930 --> 01:17.800
And then here are UCD dimensions this part before the screen and the same forward.

01:17.910 --> 01:23.840
And so you can keep Diski my own two gifts you can by default to replace those image this year with

01:23.840 --> 01:24.580
your own image.

01:24.590 --> 01:32.720
Also note that the naming has for for iOS and Android but you can also replace those files on the root

01:32.720 --> 01:39.640
level here and then run a specific seal I command to let I yawning automatically create all those RiseUp

01:39.640 --> 01:44.990
files here for you of course then you will have to use one I can for all screen sizes and so on.

01:44.990 --> 01:49.680
So if you want to really differentiate that you will have to replace them on a per.

01:49.780 --> 01:55.520
I can base this year I'm going to use the approach where they provide a single I can split and splash

01:55.520 --> 02:02.510
screen for both devices for both platforms I should say and which I then automatically turn into multiple

02:02.570 --> 02:05.640
icons and splash screens with the ionic Seelye.

02:05.660 --> 02:09.950
Now we could simply use the default provided by onic here but I'm going to replace them with my own

02:10.040 --> 02:14.110
Aikins splash screen and you can find those esus attached to this lecture.

02:14.850 --> 02:23.190
So I copied in my own splash screen and I can here and important you can use Bianchi's SD or ISO Adobe

02:23.190 --> 02:24.590
Illustrator files for this.

02:24.600 --> 02:29.300
Again make sure to match those dimensions you see here on the right.

02:29.310 --> 02:35.790
So with that entered here we can now run a specific command to automatically create all those icons

02:35.790 --> 02:45.030
for us ionic resources and this will simply take Dyken and splash here and generate all the files we

02:45.030 --> 02:49.490
need 40 different platforms to have nice looking as it's there.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.460
It will only do this for the platforms we add the tear.

02:52.470 --> 02:57.630
I removed Android so it won't replace the files here in the end folder as you can see but it did do

02:57.630 --> 03:00.770
it for us since I have this added as a platform.

03:01.230 --> 03:04.110
And as you can see now it automatically gave me those files.

03:04.110 --> 03:08.880
And if you add a new platform just run this command again to also create the icons and splash screens

03:08.880 --> 03:09.880
for the platform.

03:09.960 --> 03:15.630
With this added and this command run now we can try pushing this app to our device again by executing

03:15.720 --> 03:18.350
ionic run iOS device.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.330
Or of course also for Android.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.410
And this should now built the.

03:22.590 --> 03:26.870
And since we ran the command all also take our own icons into account now.

03:27.240 --> 03:33.330
And when it pushes the up to our DeWyze we should find that it has this new icon and splash screen.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.470
Let's have a look.

03:34.650 --> 03:40.330
Well this looks much better this is now our own icon and if we tap on it we've seen we now have also

03:40.500 --> 03:42.050
our own splash screen.

03:42.120 --> 03:47.100
This is important preparation because you probably want to have your own styles there and not use de-clawed

03:47.110 --> 03:48.190
of the basics.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.670
So this is how you can add your own icon and splash screen super simple last saw.

03:52.830 --> 03:59.100
Let's next have a look at how we may configure our app for example how we can change the name we see

03:59.100 --> 04:01.410
here to have a better name.
