After adding maps in the last section of this course it's now time to tap into real native device features

00:10.580 --> 00:17.940
so certain features that might only be supported by mobile devices or that are baked into mobile devices.

00:17.990 --> 00:20.670
Things like accessing the camera.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.990
Therefore in this module we'll have a look at how capacitor works which is the tool we'll use for that.

00:26.990 --> 00:31.510
Now you might remember that I introduced capacitor earlier in this course already.

00:31.580 --> 00:34.320
So here we'll have a brief refresher on that.

00:34.460 --> 00:40.520
We'll then dive into using two specific capacitor API eyes and that would be the geo location which

00:40.520 --> 00:46.490
allows us to get a current location off the user so that this is an alternative to picking a spot on

00:46.490 --> 00:52.640
a map and we'll have a look at using the camera so we can use the device camera to take a picture.

00:52.790 --> 00:55.370
Well then of course also use that picture and upload it.
