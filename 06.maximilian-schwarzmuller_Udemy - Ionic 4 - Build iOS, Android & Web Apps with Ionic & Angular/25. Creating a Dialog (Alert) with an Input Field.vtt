00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.550
We created this exercise and The Last Lecture Let's now populate with some life.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.690
And I want to start with the handler for adding an ingredient where I want to show a dialogue where

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.490
I have an input field which allows the user to enter the name for this ingredient.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.290
Of course you can also use a different approach you could even load a new page or show a modal but I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.360
prefer to have this dialog which also shows a different way of using such dialogue.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.720
I haven't shown you before now.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.080
This dialogue needs to be created to be shown of course.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.760
So this will be an alert.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.040
This is what it's called like in ironic too.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.890
So we need to inject the alert controller.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.380
So let's quickly do this.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.750
Alert controller like this and then I need to create this alert.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.550
Now I will outsource this in a new method so that this method doesn't get as crowded because I would

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.430
have to trade it in here in the hÃ¤ndler or before this method but either way it would simply crowd and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.020
populate this method.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:12.810
So I will simply create a new private method which I'll name treat new ingredient alert and here I will

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.120
create my new ingredient alert like this where I will use the alert controller and then the trade method

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.090
to create that alert.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.200
Something you already alert now in there.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:35.630
I will set up a title of orders alert title and status title to add ingredient and also we'll set up

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.090
some inputs for this alert.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.110
Now this is new we already learned about patents but in part simply means well what it looks like input

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.580
something where the user is able to type.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.270
I only want to have one input here though you could add more than one.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.160
And this will have a name of name does it.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.570
By what.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.580
By which value I can extract de-value later.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.540
And a placeholder of name to give the user a clue of what I want him to enter and then I'll simply add

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.680
buttons here.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:15.620
The first button all at javascript object is the cancel button which has a row of cancel and which will

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.080
simply close it close the dialog de-lurked the second button is more interesting here.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.860
I will have ADD as a text and this will have a handler where I will get some data.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.960
The data the user submitted.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.930
So this will be stored in this data object and I can then simply use that data to retrieve to name and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.370
use that name.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.770
And here first of all I want to do some validation and check if the name does refers to the name I set

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.600
up there.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.190
So the name of there is input and of course this can be any string you want but it has to be the same

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.970
string down here then.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.180
So this will be the name of the ingredient in the end which a check.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.450
It should not be empty so I'm checking if it is empty.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.750
An empty string or if it is now.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.190
And here I should even say

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.630
trim to make sure that I also catch strings which are simply a couple of whitespace this.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.170
So if there's some place I check if it's ever empty an empty string or not populated at all in which

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:42.040
case I want to show a toast a message at the bottom where I tell the user to please enter a valid name

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.300
a valid name for this ingredient.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.800
So that will be another new elemental introduce in a second.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.580
Now I will work on this check here and on showing this error message later.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.630
For now I want to work on populating my array.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.580
My array my form array with new controls added dynamically.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.380
Now I will do this in the next lecture when I will start setting up the form to have this array of controls

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.570
.
