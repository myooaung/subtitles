00:02.340 --> 00:04.520
So we're making good progress here.

00:04.620 --> 00:09.900
Now let's just make sure that we can submit this form and that validation works correctly especially

00:09.900 --> 00:14.850
when we're thinking about these states now for the forum submission.

00:14.850 --> 00:19.340
I got this button here with type submit and they offer on the wrapping form element.

00:19.350 --> 00:26.870
We can add energy submit and then reference a method that should be executed when the form is submitted.

00:26.900 --> 00:31.530
And here this will be my on book place method since I'm using the template driven approach.

00:31.540 --> 00:34.450
I want to forward a reference to my form.

00:34.570 --> 00:42.370
So again at that local reference here f and I could now use this energy form assignment again and pass

00:42.370 --> 00:45.840
it here as an argument but I'll actually not do that.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.890
I will still assign energy for meter because I absolutely need access to Dad form object angular created

00:51.910 --> 00:58.060
behind the scenes but I'll access it differently in the typescript file because I will actually not

00:58.060 --> 01:04.930
just need access to that form here in on book place but also in another function which I'll add which

01:04.930 --> 01:11.560
is there to validate my controls because right now when I want to disable my button here when the form

01:11.560 --> 01:18.490
is invalid I can of course do this as before by checking if not f is valid and F instead local reference

01:18.490 --> 01:20.730
I just added No I can't do that.

01:20.740 --> 01:24.010
But the problem we face is dead.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.840
If there's reloads here let me show what the problem is.

01:27.970 --> 01:33.130
No matter which date mode I enter can enter something here that looks good.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.560
It's like free guests or 2 or 1 doesn't matter.

01:35.560 --> 01:42.610
And now let's select a date and now let me pick the last date first but say we have February the first

01:42.610 --> 01:50.120
year and then I pick a from date that is actually March 1st and that works due to how my pickers work.

01:50.230 --> 01:55.840
And yes you could try to add more complex logic to see which picture was changed to then update the

01:55.840 --> 01:58.870
other picture but I don't have that logic here.

01:58.870 --> 02:02.200
So now I effectively have a combination that's not possible.

02:02.200 --> 02:09.250
The from date is after the to date and yet this is enabled and I constantly checked as with my normal

02:09.250 --> 02:11.110
validation directives.

02:11.110 --> 02:18.100
So I will write my own helper function here in a typescript code where I want to compare dates manually

02:18.490 --> 02:23.170
and pass back the information whenever that date selections valid or not.

02:23.170 --> 02:29.740
And for this I need to be able to read the date values which I can do by getting access to the forum

02:30.370 --> 02:37.780
and you can get access to any element in your template with the ET view child decorator and that is

02:37.780 --> 02:43.450
a normal angular feature not related to ionic you need to be imported from ET Angela core.

02:43.660 --> 02:50.740
And this allows you to define selector up here not as C as s selector though but for example the name

02:51.100 --> 02:53.020
of one of your local references.

02:53.050 --> 02:59.830
So f in my case if I would have named this differently here in the template up there if it would have

02:59.830 --> 03:03.890
named a differently here than I would have to use that name here.

03:03.910 --> 03:10.360
Now this is my form and it is of type energy form which you need to import from at angular forms.

03:10.780 --> 03:16.870
And now I have access to the form here in my entire typescript file and therefore I can now add a little

03:16.870 --> 03:19.180
helper utility method in here.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.140
Which all name dates valid

03:24.830 --> 03:32.650
where I will get my start date that was selected by using this form value and then I'm looking for dates

03:32.660 --> 03:37.550
dash from and here you should choose the name which you chose in your template.

03:37.550 --> 03:42.410
So I simply chose date from end date to here.

03:42.410 --> 03:48.290
So these are the names I'll use down there and that is a string I need a date object here.

03:48.290 --> 03:54.170
So let's wrap this into a new date call and then I want to get my end date in the same way.

03:54.710 --> 03:58.850
So a new date for this form value date 2.

03:59.510 --> 04:05.000
And here I now just return the result for comparison I compare if and date is greater then start date

04:05.090 --> 04:07.790
and only if that is the case this is valid.

04:07.910 --> 04:14.720
And now if dates valid added here back in the form I can use this validation on the button to sew the

04:14.720 --> 04:15.800
button is disabled.

04:15.800 --> 04:25.740
If the form is not valid or if not dates valid now with that let's see if it works by going back and

04:25.800 --> 04:28.320
checking that logic again here.

04:28.320 --> 04:35.880
Select the dates fill valid values into all the other inputs and then a year for two all select February

04:35.940 --> 04:38.840
the 1st and then I'll pick a starting date.

04:38.850 --> 04:45.440
That is after February and indeed now it is disabled until I pick a valid end date again.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.340
So this looks better.

04:47.340 --> 04:54.270
Now we can also use the booked button of course that works it triggers the already existing on book

04:54.270 --> 04:55.050
place method.

04:55.080 --> 05:01.170
But now let's also make sure we extract the data here and pass it back to the component that actually

05:01.170 --> 05:04.710
opened this modal in on book plays.

05:04.710 --> 05:10.830
I first of all want to add validation again and I want to check if not form is valid.

05:10.830 --> 05:19.080
This form is valid or if not dates which this dates valid.

05:19.170 --> 05:24.420
So if either of the two is not valid I'll return because maybe you manually enabled the button any developer

05:24.420 --> 05:26.410
tools and submitted the form through that.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.620
Well I'm not playing that the game.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.020
I'm not giving you access.

05:30.720 --> 05:37.830
So if you made a positive check the inputs are valid and then I want to pass that data back to whoever

05:37.830 --> 05:41.460
opened that modal previously I passed this dummy message.

05:41.460 --> 05:48.960
Now we can pass back more useful things we can pass back our booking data here and you can named as

05:48.960 --> 05:53.850
key whoever you want and that will be an object where I want to have the key value pairs containing

05:53.850 --> 06:00.930
the values entered by the user like the first name which is this forum value and then we access the

06:01.350 --> 06:09.120
first name input or a control and I mentioned this before but it is important that keys you're targeting

06:09.120 --> 06:14.640
here of course have to match the names you chose in your template.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.540
So here I choose first name written like this as a name.

06:17.550 --> 06:19.080
Hence this is my key here.

06:19.170 --> 06:23.130
And because of the Dash I have to use the square brackets notation.

06:23.130 --> 06:25.860
I also have my last name here.

06:26.310 --> 06:30.500
So this form value last name.

06:30.690 --> 06:36.020
Then we have the guest number here which is this form value.

06:36.090 --> 06:37.680
Let's see what did I choose stare.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.690
I chose guest number as a name so we should use that here as well.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.670
Guest number and then we have our dates.

06:45.810 --> 06:52.440
And there we have to start date which is this forum value date from.

06:52.440 --> 07:05.160
And then we have the end date which of course is this forum value swaps form value value date to that

07:05.160 --> 07:06.630
is the date I want to pass back.

07:06.660 --> 07:12.540
Now in the place where I opened at modal so in the place detail page there I present the model and I

07:12.540 --> 07:14.460
do already locked the date I get back.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.740
So we should see that data once I now submit a valid model.

07:18.840 --> 07:25.290
So let's go with the random date so that I don't have to fill this out manually and I'll enter my name

07:25.290 --> 07:26.430
here.

07:26.730 --> 07:32.070
I'm coming with my partner and I booked this and here is our booking data.

07:33.020 --> 07:38.960
And this looks good I'd say looks good to me should be the data I entered.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.980
So this is now the last form I want to work on in this module.
