High this course is about ironic to which users angle are you.

00:07.080 --> 00:13.330
And therefore I regularly say angler too to now angle of four was released what does this mean for US

00:13.330 --> 00:14.580
courts.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.560
It's important to me.

00:15.570 --> 00:21.800
Discours still is 100 percent up to date and still teaches absolutely valid code.

00:21.930 --> 00:28.950
ENGLER four is simply called angle or for because Angle or two was renamed to Angel or which must have

00:29.130 --> 00:33.910
angular as a framework now an annual or four simply is the latest to worsen.

00:33.930 --> 00:35.820
But and that's important to me.

00:35.910 --> 00:41.540
It only changes some behind the scenes things therefore And that really is how it is.

00:41.580 --> 00:46.950
Everything you learn this course is still valid is still up to date and will still work and whenever

00:46.950 --> 00:49.160
that changes I will let you know.

00:49.170 --> 00:51.470
But for angler for Thats not the case.

00:51.570 --> 00:57.800
So you may just go ahead and whenever I say angler to just replace it with Angola 4 in your head.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.220
So enjoy the course.
