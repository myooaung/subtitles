We had a look at the variables SPSS fall where you can setup your colors or general application wide

00:09.740 --> 00:11.370
variables.

00:11.390 --> 00:13.240
This should only be used for variables.

00:13.280 --> 00:19.070
So if you've got average global stylings you want to set up you should do that here in the global SPSS

00:19.070 --> 00:19.710
fall.

00:19.790 --> 00:26.480
So if you want to set something like body margin one hundred pixels do it here.

00:26.510 --> 00:33.110
Only set up variables in that variables and SPSS file any average styling where you want to assign to

00:33.110 --> 00:39.860
a concrete C as as property instead of a c as this variable should go into the global SPSS file if it

00:39.860 --> 00:43.870
is a global styling or if it is a component specific styling.

00:43.940 --> 00:47.270
Of course in the SPSS file off that component.

00:47.270 --> 00:53.150
Now as you can see here in the global SPSS file we are importing a bunch of as as files out of the box

00:53.480 --> 00:55.650
and you should leave these imports there.

00:55.670 --> 01:03.050
They set up a general look and feel for the ionic application but below these imports you can add any

01:03.050 --> 01:09.740
global styling for any element or any rule you want to add you can there use these variables if you

01:09.740 --> 01:15.830
want but you can also of course just hard code any values whatever your goal is in your application.
