00:02.480 --> 00:13.370
Now I want to use that image URL to change my display mode here to not show this button but instead

00:13.490 --> 00:23.810
to show that the image as a preview for this in that div here let's add I an image and set the source

00:23.870 --> 00:31.240
equal to a property which we still have to add which will be the selected location image.

00:31.250 --> 00:41.380
Now I'll add NGL theater because this should only be added to the DOM if selected location image actually

00:41.380 --> 00:41.910
exists.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.060
Otherwise we can't display it.

00:43.060 --> 00:45.460
So if this here is not undefined.

00:45.730 --> 00:51.460
And with that we should be able to see that image as soon as we picked it and assigned it to this property

00:51.460 --> 00:53.410
which we haven't done yet.

00:53.410 --> 01:03.010
I will also give this a class of location image so that we can style this appropriately because we will

01:03.010 --> 01:07.250
need to add some styles to the location image here.

01:07.360 --> 01:14.650
We should give it the width of 1 percent and the height of 100 percent and set object fit to cover so

01:14.650 --> 01:17.980
that this fits nicely into the surrounding def.

01:17.980 --> 01:24.340
For dad however we should ensure that the surrounding div all there's proper styling for Dad.

01:24.350 --> 01:33.320
I'll give this a class of picture and style that picture here as well in the location picker SC as as

01:33.320 --> 01:41.740
file because here I want I have a width of let's say 30 RAM but a max with of 80 percent on smaller

01:41.740 --> 01:45.100
devices a height of 20 Ram.

01:45.280 --> 01:53.740
And I'll add a max height of let's say 30 VH to take up a maximum of 30 percent of the viewport height

01:55.000 --> 02:00.790
I'll add a border here of 1 pixel solid and then I'll use the VAR keyword to fetch my eye and color

02:00.790 --> 02:03.650
primary color here.

02:03.870 --> 02:11.940
I'll give this a margin of auto to center it horizontally and I'll add display flex here to justify

02:11.940 --> 02:18.360
everything in the center and align all items in the center here so that we have a nice picture where

02:18.360 --> 02:22.520
all the elements inside of it are centered.

02:22.630 --> 02:28.790
Now let's set selected location image here to display that image once we picked an element.

02:28.900 --> 02:35.740
So in a location picker typescript file here where we subscribe then where we finally got everything

02:35.740 --> 02:38.610
we need we want to set that property.

02:38.620 --> 02:44.020
So let's first of all added here as a property to this class and that will be a string and initially

02:44.020 --> 02:52.630
it's undefined but once we picked a location here we can set this selected location image equal to the

02:52.630 --> 02:55.350
static map image you're all we got here.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.960
Now let's see that in action let's see if that works the way it should here

03:04.320 --> 03:11.530
the press select location near here is the image and the buttons that's next to it so it gets displayed.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.810
But of course it has to share the place with the button.

03:14.810 --> 03:21.920
Now to work around that let's get rid of the button whenever we have a preview by adding energy if on

03:21.920 --> 03:28.360
the button here and Jeff and only displayed as if we don't have a selected location image.

03:32.010 --> 03:39.420
So with that if we go back and I press here now we just see that now there is a little bit of a delay

03:39.420 --> 03:45.180
between us selecting a location and that image being displayed because all these API calls have to finish

03:45.180 --> 03:49.940
first and therefore some loading spinner would be nice.

03:49.950 --> 04:00.000
So in that location picker I'll add ion spinner here the color of primary and that should be displayed

04:00.480 --> 04:04.230
if is loading is true.

04:04.230 --> 04:09.090
And we'll have to add that property of course the image here should only be displayed if we have an

04:09.090 --> 04:14.610
image and we're not loading the button here should be displayed if we don't have an image and we're

04:14.700 --> 04:17.170
not loading.

04:17.180 --> 04:24.620
So now let's add that is loading property to the location picker a component is loading.

04:24.620 --> 04:32.870
And initially that is false and I want to set this to true as soon as we are hearing we're getting an

04:32.870 --> 04:33.470
address.

04:33.470 --> 04:34.430
So this

04:37.120 --> 04:39.820
is loading is true here.

04:39.820 --> 04:41.110
And of course it's false.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.220
Once we got everything.

04:42.230 --> 04:49.410
So this is loading is false here.

04:49.440 --> 04:56.480
Now let's wait for that to reload and let's see how that now looks like by now it's like the location

04:56.480 --> 04:58.350
with the spinner and then there is the image.

04:58.460 --> 05:03.980
Of course it's still super fast but if it should take longer then we have a nice spinner in between

05:04.670 --> 05:09.710
now that doesn't look too bad but what if we now want to change our selection.
