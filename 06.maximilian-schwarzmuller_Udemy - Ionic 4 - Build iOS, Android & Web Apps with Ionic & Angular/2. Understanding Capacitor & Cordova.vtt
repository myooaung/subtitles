00:02.340 --> 00:05.420
So what does capacitor or Cordova.

00:05.490 --> 00:10.770
I really want to mentioned this in this course we use capacitor because that is a tool developed and

00:10.770 --> 00:16.620
maintained by the ionic team and therefore we can pretty much rely on this being up to date and only

00:16.620 --> 00:21.580
growing in popularity and feature richness over time.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.110
Cordova nonetheless is an alternative to capacitor and historically ionic did use Cordova.

00:27.180 --> 00:31.980
You could still use Cordova with a sonic four and the official docks of course are the way to go if

00:31.980 --> 00:32.860
you want to.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.930
But here we'll focus on capacitor.

00:35.010 --> 00:37.740
But nonetheless what are these two tools.

00:37.740 --> 00:41.470
Well remember that we're building an app here with ionic and angular.

00:41.560 --> 00:47.280
And what we're building is a web app that is why we're previewing it in the browser all the time though

00:47.280 --> 00:50.770
of course I did show you how you can run it on the real device too.

00:50.940 --> 00:57.180
But if you do run it on a real device you absolutely have to remember that your web app is basically

00:57.180 --> 01:02.450
wrapped in a native app and that native app renders a web view with your app in it.

01:02.580 --> 01:09.450
And this native web the order's app and the web view in it is basically what's provided by capacitor

01:09.600 --> 01:10.550
or Cordova.

01:10.830 --> 01:17.760
So these tools basically give you a native app shell take your web app wrap it into that and then build

01:17.810 --> 01:22.320
a real native app out of this shell plus web app thing.

01:22.320 --> 01:27.580
Now in this course as I mentioned we'll use capacitor and not Cordova but they both have to a philosophy

01:27.600 --> 01:31.980
or idea but of course just wrapping a web app on its own.

01:31.980 --> 01:39.240
Isn't that helpful because when you're building a mobile app you obviously have a bunch of native platform

01:39.300 --> 01:46.830
API is so basically API as you could normally use when you're building an ISIS or an Android app with

01:46.830 --> 01:49.050
the native languages for these platforms.

01:49.050 --> 01:53.880
So with objective c or swift for ISIS or with Java for Android.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.830
D native platform API I'm talking about are things like using the camera or using mobile payment or

02:01.830 --> 02:03.260
anything like that.

02:03.300 --> 02:07.550
Now of course we want to utilize these API is from our ionic app as well.

02:07.710 --> 02:13.650
But keep in mind it is just a web app wrapped into a native app and therefore a capacitor and Cordova

02:13.870 --> 02:20.490
all to provide a bridge to these native platform API as they give us javascript methods we can call

02:20.700 --> 02:27.270
which under the hood will basically translate to native API calls that allow us to tap into that camera

02:27.360 --> 02:36.910
and so on and capacitor does all of that by giving us a rich set of built in API we can tap into you

02:37.020 --> 02:42.960
and we can also add plug ins as a community and therefore we'll see more and more features being provided

02:42.960 --> 02:50.130
over time and it gives us access to all these APIs through one single javascript API we use from our

02:50.130 --> 02:56.040
Web app and from that single API where we call the same effort no matter where our app runs.

02:56.070 --> 03:04.140
If that is in the web we're on IAW or on Android we can reach out to the IRS Android and possibly web

03:04.170 --> 03:08.080
API that are provided and that is all important.

03:08.100 --> 03:15.420
Even if your app runs really just on the web so not wrapped into it is native app on ISIS or Android

03:15.450 --> 03:23.520
but in a browser on your Mac book or your PC it even then modern browsers give you a lot of nice features

03:23.520 --> 03:31.230
like access to the camera or auto location with geo location package and capacitor basically gives you

03:31.230 --> 03:36.130
access to all these features no matter on which platform you are and if something should go wrong so

03:36.140 --> 03:42.360
if you are trying to use a certain feature that is not supported on the platform your app runs it will

03:42.360 --> 03:43.680
fail gracefully.

03:43.770 --> 03:50.160
So that means you basically get a chance to recover to provide an alternative to provide a fallback

03:50.490 --> 03:53.030
and that is also what we'll do in this course.

03:53.100 --> 03:58.950
And one other important note if you already have an existing app and you want to rebuild it with a Onegin

03:59.010 --> 04:03.870
capacitor and in that existing app you will use the bunch of cord of a plugins.

04:03.930 --> 04:09.510
These are still supported by capacitor and the official box of capacitor are the place where you can

04:09.510 --> 04:10.620
learn more about that.
