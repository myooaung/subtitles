00:02.280 --> 00:11.220
So now that we explored ion-label and ion-item, let's dive a bit deeper into ion-item and let's actually

00:11.490 --> 00:17.840
go into our bookings page where we don't have any bookings yet, we'll change that

00:18.030 --> 00:24.390
and our offers page where we do have offers which right now are simply all the places we also have on

00:24.390 --> 00:25.500
this page

00:25.500 --> 00:28.570
and I want to make sure that we can actually slide these items,

00:28.680 --> 00:35.430
so not just tap them as we currently can do it but slide them from right to left for example, so that

00:35.430 --> 00:46.590
we can edit one of these offers or in the case of the bookings, actually cancel a booking. Now for that,

00:46.590 --> 00:52.830
let's start with the offers since we already have these in place and therefore the place to go obviously

00:52.890 --> 01:01.530
is our offers page and there, I am going through all the places as I mentioned at the moment, we'll later

01:01.530 --> 01:05.520
change that to differentiate a bit between offers and places 

01:05.610 --> 01:08.530
but for now, it's simply just the places being output there

01:08.550 --> 01:15.930
but on the offers page, I want to make sure we can swipe these items to delete them. To achieve this, Ionic

01:15.930 --> 01:24.090
gives us certain components we can use inside of a list and especially in combination with an ion-item

01:24.090 --> 01:29.990
and as you know, the official component docs are always a great place and there under item, indeed

01:30.000 --> 01:37.320
you don't only find ion-item, you also find ion-item-group, divider and ion-item-sliding, options,

01:37.350 --> 01:45.810
option. These three here, sliding, options and option are related to making these items swipeable so that

01:45.810 --> 01:53.700
we can expose extra options to use or we can choose from, like editing or deleting. Divider and group

01:53.970 --> 02:01.140
just as you also have ion-list-header here are components you can use to split your list into multiple

02:01.140 --> 02:06.630
sections. I'll not use this feature here but explore that feature in the official docs if you need that,

02:06.840 --> 02:13.320
for example if you are having a list of persons and you want to group them by starting character of

02:13.320 --> 02:21.270
their surname, well then you can use ion-item-group, back to the sliding thing which I want to use. For

02:21.270 --> 02:29.640
that, you can wrap your ion-item here with ion-item-sliding and therefore you see inside of ion-list,

02:29.700 --> 02:35.730
I'm now actually not using an ion-item but ion-item-sliding but technically, that is related to the

02:35.730 --> 02:43.860
ion-item because this ion-item-sliding component now wraps your ion-item component, so you just copy

02:43.860 --> 02:50.910
that into ion-item-sliding. This extra wrapper makes this item slideable but you also need to configure

02:50.910 --> 03:00.120
which options should be exposed when these slides open and for this, you add next to the ion-item, not inside

03:00.120 --> 03:09.510
of it but inside of the ion-item-sliding, you add ion-item-options, like this. In there, you then add

03:09.510 --> 03:17.900
ion-item-option elements, so inside ion-item-options, you have ion-item-option and these are just the

03:17.900 --> 03:23.970
components you also find here in the official docs and there, you now configure the different options

03:23.970 --> 03:30.750
you want to show. Now on such an option, you can for example set a color which will be the background

03:30.750 --> 03:38.160
color of that button which gets exposed, for example secondary. You can then also register a click listener

03:38.220 --> 03:44.550
to define what should happen when this button gets pressed, for example here since I want to allow editing

03:44.550 --> 03:52.630
and offer, I'll trigger onEdit and I will forward my ID of that offer we're currently looking at,

03:52.740 --> 04:01.890
so here I'll forward offer.id. Inside of ion-item-option, you then can specify some text, for example

04:02.010 --> 04:13.600
edit. Now let me also add the onEdit method here, onEdit and here I get my offerId which will

04:13.600 --> 04:21.410
be a string and for now, I'll just console log editing item and I also want to output that offerId

04:21.410 --> 04:22.860
I'm logging here.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.910
So with all that, we can save that and

04:24.910 --> 04:35.170
let's go back to our application and now under discover places offers here, we can swipe that and you

04:35.170 --> 04:40.270
see, this is the secondary color we configured in this application.

04:40.330 --> 04:45.790
Now what you'll also see is that only the first item is swipeable though, no other item,

04:45.790 --> 04:53.120
so what's wrong here? Well the problem is that ngFor is placed on the ion-item which is wrapped

04:53.120 --> 04:58.840
by the ion-item-sliding, so in the end we repeat ion-item in this one sliding wrapper.

04:58.940 --> 05:04.820
We should instead repeat that ion-item-sliding element which wraps a single ion-item,

05:04.820 --> 05:12.650
so that we create multiple slideable items for all the offers we have. With this change, you'll now see

05:12.650 --> 05:21.640
that once this reloads, we can swipe all these items and then we also see that added text there. So that

05:21.640 --> 05:27.580
is nice and if I now click edit, you see now I don't go to that place but instead now in the console

05:27.580 --> 05:33.400
of the developer tools, you'll see editing item and then the ID of that item you edited,

05:33.400 --> 05:38.380
so here we go. You can also show an icon

05:38.400 --> 05:41.230
and for this you can add ion-icon

05:41.280 --> 05:48.720
here, then choose a name like for example create gives us a nice pen icon and you can define a

05:48.720 --> 05:55.480
slot here, for example top should actually render this icon here on top of the text.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.480
Now I will set it at the point of time where I record this, this is a bit broken and therefore it actually

06:00.480 --> 06:03.780
shows next to this instead of on top of this

06:03.960 --> 06:06.390
but eventually, this should get fixed

06:06.390 --> 06:11.700
and here in this application it's not a huge issue because I don't want to show a text anyways and I

06:11.700 --> 06:13.700
can then simply change the slot here to

06:13.710 --> 06:22.940
icon only and now in that ion-item here, we should only have this pen icon now,

06:22.970 --> 06:23.690
here it is.

06:24.470 --> 06:31.310
So now we can choose that and we can of course not just console log something here but we can now forward

06:31.340 --> 06:37.180
the user to our edit offer page and for that, we could add a router link on this page

06:37.190 --> 06:45.440
but there is a little behavior which at least at the moment requires us to use a click listener where

06:45.440 --> 06:49.280
we can execute more than just the navigation option.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.150
Now why is that?

06:50.720 --> 06:58.040
Well let's remove that click listener temporarily and let's instead use a router link bound to a dynamic

06:58.040 --> 07:12.540
value here where we go to slash and then it's places tabs offers and then we need edit

07:12.630 --> 07:13.650
and then the ID

07:13.710 --> 07:15.090
and why do we need this?

07:15.090 --> 07:18.680
Because if we have a look at place routing, we see we got tabs,

07:18.810 --> 07:23.960
then the offers area and then edit slash the ID and that is the place where I want to go.

07:23.970 --> 07:28.100
So the ID here will be offer.id. 

07:28.470 --> 07:35.220
Now with that, we have a valid router link and we should actually be able to go to that offer edit page.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.150
So if I just swipe this, now

07:38.160 --> 07:41.910
first of all you see that here is a bit buggy,

07:42.030 --> 07:45.770
it now renders an anchor tag and that destroys

07:45.900 --> 07:52.350
the look here, the CSS code. Now this will probably get fixed but if you go there and you go back, you also

07:52.350 --> 07:53.610
see this is still open,

07:53.610 --> 07:57.410
it doesn't close automatically. If all of that works just fine for you,

07:57.480 --> 08:01.620
you can of course use that. If it doesn't as it does for me,

08:01.620 --> 08:08.430
the solution is to stay at this click listener and all we now need to do is we need to pass a reference

08:08.430 --> 08:10.750
to our ion-item-sliding

08:11.010 --> 08:15.150
and for this, you can add a local reference with a hashtag here,

08:15.150 --> 08:16.970
this is an Angular feature,

08:17.130 --> 08:22.710
give this any name you want, for example sliding item but the name is totally up to you and then you pass

08:22.770 --> 08:30.710
sliding item here as a second argument to onEdit, just like this without the hashtag. And in your offers

08:30.750 --> 08:38.170
page where you have the onEdit method, you then get this sliding item here as a second argument,

08:38.220 --> 08:46.950
it is of type ion-item-sliding and this ion-item-sliding type needs to be imported from

08:46.980 --> 08:47.640
@ionic/angular,

08:47.640 --> 08:55.930
so this import here needs to be added in the offers.page.ts file and you can then execute on

08:55.930 --> 08:59.580
sliding item, so on this second argument you're getting, the close method

08:59.590 --> 09:05.620
and this will close it right before you then navigate and navigation can now be done programmatically.

09:05.700 --> 09:10.510
Therefore a button will get rendered and not an anchor tag and therefore, the styling will be fixed

09:10.660 --> 09:16.390
and thanks to sliding item close, it will also close so that when we navigate back, it is closed.

09:16.450 --> 09:22.510
So let's now inject the Angular router here with the addition to the constructor and then the addition

09:22.510 --> 09:25.540
of the import here at the top of the file

09:25.540 --> 09:33.010
and then here, we can simply say this router navigate and of course here, I want to go to /places,

09:33.010 --> 09:38.200
tabs, offers, edit

09:38.320 --> 09:41.380
and then here, my offerId.

09:42.450 --> 09:48.180
And with all of that, if we save this again, now we'll have a list

09:48.260 --> 09:54.830
where this is swipeable, where it looks good and where when I tap this, I get forwarded and that

09:54.830 --> 10:01.400
sliding item closes so that when I go back, it is closed and it stays closed and that of course is behavior

10:01.460 --> 10:02.290
I want here.

10:02.300 --> 10:05.360
So this is how you can add slideable items, as always

10:05.360 --> 10:08.220
don't hesitate to dive into the official docs,

10:08.300 --> 10:11.820
there you can learn more about these components as always

10:11.890 --> 10:16.180
and for example, you can learn how to change the direction from where you can swipe.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.580
The default is from right to left,

10:18.680 --> 10:23.360
now you can always go to your, as can see here also,

10:23.360 --> 10:30.440
you can always go to your ion-item-options surrounding block here and then change the side. And the side

10:30.440 --> 10:31.650
by default is end,

10:31.670 --> 10:38.660
if you set it to start, you can swipe from left to right, like this.

10:38.660 --> 10:44.150
Now by the way, you can also have multiple ion-item-options per sliding item,

10:44.150 --> 10:50.570
so next to this set of ion-item-options, we could add another set of ion-item-options which would then

10:50.570 --> 10:56.420
have to go onto the other side so that we can actually swipe in both directions and expose different

10:56.450 --> 10:57.260
options.

10:57.380 --> 11:03.140
So that is all supported, setting this to side end is optional because it is the default and the official

11:03.140 --> 11:06.120
docs allow you to dive way deeper into all of that.
