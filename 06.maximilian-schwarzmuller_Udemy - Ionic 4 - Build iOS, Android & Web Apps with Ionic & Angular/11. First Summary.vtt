In last lectures you learn a lot of new things you'll learn how ironic to get started.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.900
And Ted we have this concept of paychecks.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.310
It should now be clearer what pages are pages are normal components.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:23.390
They are simply called pages because they hold the content for a full page in our application and they

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:32.810
are loaded through ironic to use navigation stack we push and pop those components called pagers onto

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.750
the stack so we can still use normal components and you will see this later in the course.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.680
You can still create a component holding two buttons and a death for example which you didn't embed

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.800
into the template of your page.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.030
This is perfectly possible and indeed we are already doing this because I and head are ion content I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.040
nav bar.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.950
These are normal components components.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.720
I own two ships with.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.030
So you still can use components which are not pages inside of your pages.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.790
We are just calling it pages because those components the home and user component here are used to render

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.440
to full screen to fill the full screen and they are loaded through ironic to his navigation stack
