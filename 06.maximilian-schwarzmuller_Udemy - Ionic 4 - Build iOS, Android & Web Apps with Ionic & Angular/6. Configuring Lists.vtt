00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.530
You can not only change the content in your lists and so on.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.070
You can also change the way the list looks like.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.230
And now here is where I list becomes more important.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.170
For example if you want to remove those lines in between the items here you can add no lines as a directive

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.390
to your or as an attribute to your iron list here.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.280
And if you do this you will see the items or the lines of the I'd would say are now gone.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.260
The average behavior looks the same but all the lines are gone and you wouldn't be able to remove the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.660
item lines easily at least without kind of hacky overwriting of styles without wrapping ironed list

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.130
element.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.120
You can also use inset to add some extra margin to the list and have it being pushed a bit more to the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.810
right.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.180
So that's another alternative you have here.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.030
So these are attributes can add to the list to make sure that the list really looks the way you want

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.920
it to look.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.890
Now I'm going to change this back today.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.090
Look we had before but important to understand that with the wrapping I'll list.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.760
You got those elements where you got those attributes can add those features to make it look the way

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.060
you wanted to look.
