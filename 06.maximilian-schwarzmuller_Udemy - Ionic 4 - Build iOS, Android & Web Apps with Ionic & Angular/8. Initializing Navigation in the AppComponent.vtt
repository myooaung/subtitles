00:02.170 --> 00:09.010
Now with the additional knowledge about how navigation were extended has is a stack of pages at its

00:09.010 --> 00:09.690
core.

00:09.700 --> 00:14.460
It makes much more sense to see the content of our app age HTML file.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.130
Did you wonder why we only have to is strange I a naff component in there.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.160
Well I N.F. is a built in component.

00:22.170 --> 00:28.230
I want two ships with and that is true for any components starting with I-N dash.

00:28.240 --> 00:38.710
So what I N.F. does is it initialize a stack of pages initialises is ironic too to NAF controller a

00:38.710 --> 00:43.960
class eye on two ships with which is responsible for managing our stack of pages.

00:43.990 --> 00:51.430
This is why an app module were bootstrapping ionic app and not our own root component and why we instead

00:51.430 --> 00:59.650
pass our own root component to ionic module because ionic AB ironic too in the background needs to set

00:59.650 --> 01:06.820
up days stack of pages needs to initialize this app and adust is in its own code in its own module in

01:06.820 --> 01:11.380
its own component and our component is only passed in and it.

01:11.500 --> 01:19.120
Well police initialized navigation and very importantly initialize it with this route page were binding

01:19.120 --> 01:25.210
the root property on the i n f component and repassing in a property which holds the page which should

01:25.240 --> 01:31.560
be the root page of our application because if you have a stack of pages which decides which page you

01:31.560 --> 01:32.720
are currently viewing.

01:32.860 --> 01:38.680
Well you obviously need to have a bottom page one page at least which is the page you are viewing at

01:38.680 --> 01:39.360
the start.

01:39.430 --> 01:42.070
And this is the so-called root page.

01:42.070 --> 01:47.380
Now this property is set up and the app component and you can see it points to the home page.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.580
The only page we have is the default setup.

01:50.590 --> 01:54.070
And this is how the navigation stack is set up at the beginning.

01:54.190 --> 02:01.510
And how ironic to knows which page to display at the point of time we start Yep well with that knowledge

02:01.810 --> 02:07.280
it will be of course more interesting to add more pages to the app and see how we can navigate around.

02:07.330 --> 02:09.100
Lets do this in the next Electra's
