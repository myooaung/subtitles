00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.570
So we know what I want it to is what is angular to you.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.010
Honestly I do expect you to know the answer to this question.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.360
I do have a recap section at the end of this course so please jump ahead to the sector right now.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.900
If you're not sure what angle or to is if you've got some very very basics and you want to build up

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.650
on them and kind of refresh your knowledge angler's you of course use those components directives data

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.520
binding and all the features like services Dependency Injection forms and age to Depay.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.900
And we're going to use and see all those features for this course.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.310
So you definitely need to be aware of how you use them and what they do.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.080
Again there is this refresher at the end of discourse which you should have a look at if you kind of

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.710
need to refresh your knowledge.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.740
If all of this is brand new to you though what you can try with the refresher.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.410
But then I also strongly recommend picking up a dedicated angle to chords to well have as backup was

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.890
following for discourse.
