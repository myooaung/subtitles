00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.900
So we want to publish all location.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.510
But if we have a look at it on our local device it's not looking that Bridie default.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.200
I can use the default cordovan I can.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.780
The title is kind of a working title not really and highly want to have a four hour apt to sit on user's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.890
home screens.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.010
And if we open his application we see the Stiefel splash screen as loading screen which is also not

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.030
that beautiful.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.950
So overall not really how we want to publish it.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.670
There are some things we should tweak first tweak some settings and also change the icon and splash

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.570
screen we're using.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.370
So in the next lectures we're going to have a look at how we can use our own icons and splash screens

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.450
before we then dive into changing the settings before we then dive into the actual publishing process

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.660
