00:02.040 --> 00:04.980
The Last Lecture we add functionality to add a marker.

00:05.070 --> 00:10.590
Let's now add a functionality to close to modal so that we can get the state back to the place page

00:11.180 --> 00:11.940
for days.

00:11.940 --> 00:19.080
I'll add a new row below our map Axert and row here with a column and I will actually add 2 columns

00:19.080 --> 00:27.180
there in the first column or add a button which will receive the button directive as always which will

00:27.180 --> 00:33.820
be a block column button I should say where I will add a color off secondary to make it green.

00:34.260 --> 00:37.980
And here I simply want to say confirm.

00:37.980 --> 00:42.660
So this should submit the data close to modal and submit the data.

00:42.660 --> 00:48.150
I will also add a click listener for this and hearable say on confirms or in this method we somehow

00:48.240 --> 00:50.880
need to close the mole and pass the data.

00:51.150 --> 00:56.440
And I want to disable the button if the marker is not set.

00:56.450 --> 01:02.300
So if we don't have a marker remember marker is undefined at the beginning and if we don't have a marker

01:02.540 --> 01:05.600
then indeed I don't want to make this modal.

01:05.870 --> 01:11.150
Well confirmable so that you can try to submit some data which is invalid.

01:11.180 --> 01:15.650
I'll add another column next to it where the number button inside of it.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.970
And this will also be a button of course.

01:18.970 --> 01:21.610
This button will also be a block button.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.850
The color will be dangerous so it should be red.

01:25.070 --> 01:27.340
And here I simply want to abort.

01:27.350 --> 01:31.740
So we'll say a board to close to Moeder without saving the selection.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.430
And I'll add a click listener here to where I execute the on a board method.

01:36.560 --> 01:41.950
So now I got two new methods in place or two new buttons triggering methods on confirm an on board.

01:42.200 --> 01:49.940
Let's not add those two methods on confirm and on a board add them in the page and the component in

01:49.940 --> 01:53.610
the typescript file here on a board to super simple.

01:53.630 --> 01:58.310
Here I just want to close to modal and this is a little challenge for you.

01:58.310 --> 02:00.100
You'll learn how to close such a modal.

02:00.110 --> 02:03.280
You also learn how to close it well while passing data.

02:03.380 --> 02:04.400
So try both.

02:04.460 --> 02:09.940
Try to just close it on a board and close it and pass that on confirm in a few seconds.

02:09.950 --> 02:14.150
We'll do this to Gebre.

02:14.170 --> 02:15.920
So where are you successful.

02:16.060 --> 02:17.690
Let's now do it together.

02:18.010 --> 02:21.130
I need to inject The View Controller to do this.

02:21.130 --> 02:27.670
Did you remember to step the control of that stored in the property named View Controller and injected

02:27.790 --> 02:29.600
the type view controller here.

02:31.010 --> 02:33.730
Was at the comma here.

02:34.070 --> 02:40.460
Make sure to import view control or form ionic angler and then an on a board I can simply access my

02:40.700 --> 02:47.930
controller referring to dispute to the motel and call the Smiths to dismiss this view and an on confirm

02:48.050 --> 02:55.190
I want to do the same also dismiss it but I will also pass some data here and the data I pass is the

02:55.250 --> 02:56.210
location.

02:56.360 --> 03:01.940
But this will actually be my marker location not the location we had here because this location comes

03:01.940 --> 03:07.060
from the AT place location and an old only determines where the map is centered on at the beginning.

03:07.220 --> 03:12.890
I'm interested in the location to use or chose though and that is stored in the marker not in the location

03:12.920 --> 03:16.420
which again is only needed for the centering of the map.

03:16.640 --> 03:22.350
So if that I'm passing the chosen location back to the page the next step of course is to extract it.

03:22.350 --> 03:29.820
On this page and then Semois also show a little preview of the place that shows on the place page.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.260
Now we will basically reuse the tools.

03:32.270 --> 03:38.000
We saw a couple of Electress ago and regarding the fetch data from modal piece a couple of sections

03:38.000 --> 03:41.470
that go in the course so few free trying this on your own.

03:41.540 --> 03:46.940
Fetching the data from the motile and then showing such a map excerpt in the next lecture we will do

03:46.940 --> 03:47.630
the two Gebre
