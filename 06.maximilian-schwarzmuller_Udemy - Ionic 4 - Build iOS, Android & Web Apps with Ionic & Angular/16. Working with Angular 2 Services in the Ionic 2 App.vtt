00:02.730 --> 00:08.990
And The Last Lecture we added this alert to check if the user really wants to add a quote now We need

00:08.990 --> 00:15.500
a place to manage the state of our app kind of word to manage the state of our codes to see which quotes

00:15.560 --> 00:17.850
are favorites and which quotes aren't.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.520
Now state management and angle are too.

00:20.540 --> 00:23.570
There are a couple of ways to do that but both in one.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.940
The one angle to read is great.

00:25.970 --> 00:28.610
Out of the box is to use a service.

00:28.880 --> 00:35.270
Now I will add such a service and I will edit the source folder in a newly created subfolder named folder

00:35.270 --> 00:41.850
services and this is kind of a good folder structure to have your pages in a separate folder services

00:41.870 --> 00:47.330
in a separate folder and if you were to add other components something will do later in of course you

00:47.330 --> 00:50.020
could create a separate subfolder for components too.

00:50.180 --> 00:55.700
As a side note if your app becomes more complex you you're of course free to change the structure and

00:55.790 --> 01:00.210
structure by feature instead of structure by function as we are currently doing it.

01:00.530 --> 01:07.830
So any services folder I want to create a news service and I'll name the file quote not yet quote stopped.

01:07.860 --> 01:11.850
Yes I could also name it quotes DOD service or TS.

01:12.050 --> 01:17.280
But since I store it in the services folder it's pretty clear that it is a service right.

01:17.480 --> 01:27.710
So in there I'm going to export a class which will name quote's service and disk class year should have

01:27.710 --> 01:32.370
an array which holds all the quotes I marked as favorites.

01:32.390 --> 01:40.220
So here are simply say private favorite quotes and this should be an empty array.

01:40.220 --> 01:43.850
Now we can also define the type because that type of course is of type.

01:43.850 --> 01:45.370
Quote array.

01:45.440 --> 01:50.920
So make sure to import code from your own interface from the interface we stored in the data folder.

01:51.050 --> 01:56.510
And here with this we're assigning what telling typescript that we will actually store all our favorite

01:56.510 --> 01:57.950
quotes in history.

01:58.370 --> 02:00.260
We need a couple of methods in the service.

02:00.260 --> 02:05.100
I'd say we need a method which allows us to add a new favorite quote.

02:05.330 --> 02:12.310
So I'll name it add quote to favorites of course you may choose another name and this is of type.

02:12.520 --> 02:19.520
This gets a quote which of course is of type quote and then there I simply want to take my favorite

02:19.520 --> 02:23.400
quotes array and push this new quote on it.

02:24.670 --> 02:27.940
I also want to be able to remove a quote right.

02:28.240 --> 02:35.620
So we have removed quote from favorites and we haven't implemented a button to do so yet but will do

02:35.620 --> 02:36.820
so in the future.

02:37.010 --> 02:43.090
And I also expect to get the quote which should get removed and keep in mind each quote has a unique

02:43.090 --> 02:43.950
ID.

02:43.960 --> 02:47.610
This will become important when identifying quotes later on.

02:47.620 --> 02:52.530
So with this we have to remove quotes function here.

02:52.540 --> 02:58.330
I want to access my favorite quotes and use the splice method to get rid of one.

02:58.570 --> 03:02.530
I need the position of the quote first and I can get this like this.

03:02.530 --> 03:10.630
Store it in a new constant and then simply search my favorite quotes.

03:10.680 --> 03:16.970
Use defined index method which will give me the position of a quote fulfilling a certain criteria.

03:17.040 --> 03:24.860
Find index is a boat in Meffert uses or expect to get a function as an argument.

03:24.900 --> 03:32.560
This function will be executed by javascript so to say automatically it will give us the current DD

03:32.560 --> 03:37.470
quote It currently has a look at so it scans through all the quotes or for all the elements which we

03:37.470 --> 03:42.510
know are quotes and will pass them into this function one by one so that we can check them.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.350
So this is of type.

03:43.360 --> 03:50.100
Quote Of course since our area since our array only holds codes and then has a function we have to specify

03:50.100 --> 03:54.010
our own logic which decides if this is the quote were looking for or not.

03:54.180 --> 03:57.830
So we have to return true or false if this is the quote you are looking for.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.130
And it is to quote you were looking for IV.

04:01.410 --> 04:04.860
And here it should say quote elements and some already using the named quote.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.710
Here in the argument list.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.790
So this is to quote We're looking for.

04:08.790 --> 04:14.570
If the element of this quote We're looking at in his favorite quotes array.

04:14.580 --> 04:20.400
If the idea of this quote matches the idea of the quote We're passing as an argument to this remove

04:20.400 --> 04:24.810
function This will then return true equal time with two.

04:24.870 --> 04:26.790
Or check with two equal signs of course.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.340
If those IDs match so we then have the position and then I want to splice exactly one element.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.250
This is how a mover element from my array.

04:38.490 --> 04:46.050
The last method we need is d get favorite quotes method which will simply give us back the array and

04:46.050 --> 04:48.330
I could simply return the whole array.

04:48.570 --> 04:55.080
But I will use slice with no arguments to basically create a copy of that array.

04:55.110 --> 05:01.140
You know normally in the script we pass arrays and objects by reference and not copies of them.

05:01.290 --> 05:10.970
Here I want to really pass a copy to not be able to directly edit this array from outside so dead.

05:11.100 --> 05:16.220
This really is a private array and not kind of editable from outside.

05:16.560 --> 05:22.110
So if this week will the quote service we're now able to store in quotes remove them and get them the

05:22.110 --> 05:29.340
next step of course is to hook up our library page here or our quotes page to be precise to be able

05:29.340 --> 05:32.640
to add a quote to our favorites list.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.130
Let's do this in the next video
