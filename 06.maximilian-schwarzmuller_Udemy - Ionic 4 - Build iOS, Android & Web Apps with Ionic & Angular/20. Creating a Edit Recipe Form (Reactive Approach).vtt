00:02.020 --> 00:07.250
In the last lecture we added this plus button to be able to go to the edit recipe page.

00:07.500 --> 00:14.190
Time to now work on this page and at this forum which allows us to edit a recipe we're going to spend

00:14.190 --> 00:20.060
a lot of time in discompose And on this page now because a lot of things are happening on this page.

00:20.070 --> 00:22.440
We do have more than just a couple of inputs.

00:22.440 --> 00:28.680
We all need a way to add ingredients or remove them later to edit them to switch between the two different

00:28.680 --> 00:32.880
modes new recipes or added recipes and so on.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.700
What I want to start with is is actually retrieving data we're passing.

00:37.710 --> 00:45.070
So this mode I will do this in the body of this type of class here of the edit recipe page.

00:45.240 --> 00:51.160
And again I will start from scratch because I really like to have clean classes here to start with.

00:51.450 --> 00:59.380
And I will start by retrieving the parents so I will inject the naff paradigms class your instance after

00:59.490 --> 01:03.980
class and bind it to a property named Neph parents.

01:04.170 --> 01:09.980
And now to retrieve what I could do this in the constructor but I can also do it in the engine in a

01:10.010 --> 01:10.650
method.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.350
I won't use this approach.

01:14.790 --> 01:20.520
Just because I want to show an alternative and it's generally a good idea to do initialization tasks

01:20.580 --> 01:25.430
in ngi on end though such a trivial one could also be done in the constructor.

01:25.650 --> 01:31.470
So let's add the engine and add method here and then I will store demoed in a property here.

01:31.590 --> 01:39.210
So MoJ should be a property and I will assign a default value of new so that if somehow we were not

01:39.240 --> 01:43.670
to pass a value we would always start in a new recipe mode.

01:43.950 --> 01:49.150
Nonetheless what I will do is I will assign the value I can retrieve from their parents.

01:49.290 --> 01:55.740
And here I know I can use to get method and get my mode property because this is what I'm setting here.

01:55.800 --> 02:02.050
When accessing this page and pushing it on the stage of paid on the stack of pages.

02:02.130 --> 02:09.240
So if this I'm getting the mode in which I am and this is all I need for now I will revisit this engine

02:09.240 --> 02:14.940
and that method later when we work on the edit mode because then of course we also somehow need to load

02:15.240 --> 02:18.290
the recipe we're editing and so on.

02:18.300 --> 02:26.340
So with all this let's now work on the template let's add the template for our form or get rid of the

02:26.340 --> 02:30.930
component and the edit recipe method here or edit recipe page.

02:31.380 --> 02:38.310
And then I will simply say recipe you're in the title and also output the mode there the mode by default

02:38.310 --> 02:39.050
is new.

02:39.090 --> 02:42.930
That's why I chose a capital and at the beginning or we'll have new recipe.

02:43.050 --> 02:49.380
And if we have the edit mode we will show edit recipe because modes simply store as a string.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.810
With that we get them the right header.

02:51.810 --> 02:57.850
Now let's add a forum here again remove the action because we will handle it through Angler or two instead.

02:58.140 --> 03:01.730
And then it will add an item list to store my different inputs.

03:01.770 --> 03:06.150
And again I will simply output them in a list like way.

03:06.150 --> 03:10.240
Now we need a couple of items here or a couple of inputs.

03:10.380 --> 03:18.360
The first item will hold a normal and label as you saw it before which says tidal and hearable used

03:18.360 --> 03:25.250
a floating style to have this label load up when we actually touched his input and start entering.

03:25.440 --> 03:32.650
I will add up all normal ion input to this item and this will be of type text since it is for the well.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.440
Hi Loftus Rosby.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.790
So this is normal text and that's all for now.

03:37.860 --> 03:41.060
I will revisit all those inputs later.

03:41.070 --> 03:46.620
Now the second item in the list will all receive a label because I want to describe what should be entered

03:46.620 --> 03:47.590
here.

03:47.610 --> 03:52.200
This will be Diest description and I will use floating here too.

03:52.380 --> 03:58.820
However now I'm not using an input but a new input element I end text area.

03:58.830 --> 04:04.530
Now this is a wrapper to the normal text area element and it simply allows us to create multi-line text

04:04.570 --> 04:10.210
no longer text ion text area doesn't need any additional configuration.

04:10.230 --> 04:15.540
You could of course all the set up placeholder an important entry some default value here but I'll leave

04:15.540 --> 04:19.230
it empty for now and I'll move on to the next input.

04:19.230 --> 04:26.970
Again stored in an I an item to have it look nice in this list and there al-Bared and label which says

04:27.050 --> 04:28.640
difficulty here.

04:28.650 --> 04:33.220
I want to have a dropdown where you can select the difficulty of your recipe.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.630
And again I will use float in here so that those labels all look nice.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.760
Now how do we create such a dropdown.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.820
Let's have a look at the official documentation.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.480
Again there are a lot of components you can use now.

04:47.490 --> 04:52.580
The dropdown is simply a select item here.

04:52.620 --> 04:58.790
This is select as in a normal HVM l select element just with Iran in front of it.

04:59.060 --> 05:05.050
And this will also work like a normal select element of normal H-G all code in the end.

05:05.060 --> 05:08.780
Here you can see an example we will implement it together in a second.

05:09.110 --> 05:15.350
Of course you could also look around if you find a different inport you prefer or you would like to

05:15.350 --> 05:18.730
use but select really fits this purpose really well.

05:19.040 --> 05:26.860
So here I will at and select component now to initialize such a dropdown like this.

05:27.140 --> 05:30.470
And on the Select item I will do nothing for now.

05:30.470 --> 05:36.710
Instead I will simply add an option and this is the option I want to present or I will have multiple

05:36.710 --> 05:37.310
options.

05:37.340 --> 05:45.860
Actually I could code by hand and have easy medium and difficult or hard difficulty here but I can also

05:45.860 --> 05:53.660
store them in a property in these types of file here to have my select Options property let's say which

05:53.660 --> 06:01.010
is an array where I have a couple of strings easy medium and hard like this.

06:01.010 --> 06:08.630
And with these created here I can go to D I an option back to the template and I will use energy for

06:08.720 --> 06:12.430
to dynamically create those options for the dropdown.

06:12.440 --> 06:18.260
This I an option elements here and simply loop through all my select options.

06:18.260 --> 06:24.000
This property I just created and stored the individual option in this option variable here.

06:24.350 --> 06:31.730
And with that ends you for loop placed on the I an item I can now blind to the value property of that

06:32.300 --> 06:39.230
an option element that I can I an option element and I do bind the option or extract from the array.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.950
Keep in mind it's an array of strings.

06:40.970 --> 06:47.060
So it's perfectly fine to find to bind to devalue property and it is the normal value property you would

06:47.080 --> 06:54.620
also bind on a normal option element in vanilla aged Yamal and this is important for the background

06:54.620 --> 07:01.660
so that each Jamail and therefore then you a Chalis cripplingly to knows which values stored here.

07:01.940 --> 07:07.220
But I also want to output something for the user and that will output the very same since it already

07:07.220 --> 07:12.920
is a very user friendly formatted string here you could of course all have two separate values.

07:12.950 --> 07:20.210
Store a number here and store the user friendly string here and I'll put it here whatever you like with

07:20.210 --> 07:20.560
this.

07:20.560 --> 07:27.210
I'm initialising days dropped down with a couple of options and I think we can already have a look at

07:27.210 --> 07:28.550
how this looks like.

07:28.770 --> 07:35.340
So if we save this and let it recompile and we then go back to a running application let's visit this

07:35.340 --> 07:41.420
page here's to dropdown and if I click on it this looks pretty good to me.

07:41.430 --> 07:44.260
Now here we got a couple of difficulties to choose one.

07:44.490 --> 07:50.100
As a side note if this is looking a bit blurry this is simply due to this emulator running on a low

07:50.100 --> 07:51.440
screen resolution.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.120
But here we get a couple of options and we can select options here.

07:55.140 --> 07:55.770
OK.

07:55.770 --> 07:58.260
And as you can see they are now stored here.

07:58.470 --> 08:00.430
So that looks pretty fine.

08:00.450 --> 08:05.900
However of course if we first visit this page you are seeing that this is empty no default value is

08:05.910 --> 08:06.540
selected.

08:06.660 --> 08:12.250
But that's something we'll work on when we start creating the forum using the reactive approach.

08:12.330 --> 08:18.570
For now we created the basic part of these input your office template.

08:18.570 --> 08:21.510
However a lot of things are still missing.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.580
A way to add ingredients.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.660
And of course a way to hook up this form.

08:26.880 --> 08:30.270
Let's work on this step by step starting and the next lecture.
