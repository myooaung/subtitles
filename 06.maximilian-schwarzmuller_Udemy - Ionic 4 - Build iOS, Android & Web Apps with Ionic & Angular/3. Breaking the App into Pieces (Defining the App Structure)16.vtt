00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:09.000
I again want to start by structuring this app we're thinking about which items which pages which essence

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.300
we're going to need.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.150
We have a look at the flow Office app we had as a starting page where we have two tabs at the bottom

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.250
and we start at the shopping list for example.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.960
Though of course you could switch to the order that we can go to the recipes and you would get those

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.860
plus button which allows us to go to the new recipe page.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.980
There we get a couple of input fields and we also got these dropdown here which is a normal input field

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.050
as you will learn.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.820
And we also get this managing Creedon button which shows us is actually at the bottom which allows us

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.770
to do something on our recipe here or on our recipe form.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.680
We can there add a new ingredient which will open up this dialogue which has a input field and if we

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.160
click the new recipe button here we actually create the recipe added to our list of recipes we can then

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.460
view it and also add ingredients to our shopping list.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.970
And we all could do that manually there.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.220
The challenge for you now is create the pages we need here and all to feel free to create the tap's

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.830
navigational ready.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.360
I will then also show you how I do this but I think you get the tools to do this and therefore it's

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.470
a great challenge and exercise to bolters this on your own.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.470
You should see which pages we need from this structure here like a shopping list the recipes new recipe

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.020
and so on.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.240
So feel free to create those pages and then you can compare it with my solution and I'll show how I

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.820
go about setting up this app and setting up the taps and negation and so on starting in the next lecture
