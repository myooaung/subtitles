00:02.180 --> 00:06.380
Let's dive deeper into how navigation works and what we can do with it.

00:06.380 --> 00:11.250
Do you remember that I told you that there is an alternative to automatically generating pages.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.600
Well there is and we will do this now.

00:13.670 --> 00:16.300
It's manually generating pages.

00:16.580 --> 00:20.880
Let's say for our users we also want to have a user page.

00:20.900 --> 00:26.520
So a single user or a page because remember we do have two buttons to load single users here.

00:26.780 --> 00:33.230
Now of course you could use the Selye to generate a new folder a new user folder and user page but you

00:33.230 --> 00:39.890
can also do this manually and you could either do it nested inside Users folder though that's not possible

00:39.890 --> 00:46.820
for DCL as of now or you'd do it in the pages folder for bigger apps you probably want to nest your

00:46.820 --> 00:53.510
pages because otherwise your page is full is going to get pretty big and it's hard to see which pages

00:53.510 --> 00:54.690
are connected.

00:54.890 --> 00:57.580
So I'll do it nested inside user's folder.

00:57.710 --> 01:04.850
I'll add a user folder in there and in there I will create and you file a user dot TS file notice a

01:04.850 --> 01:05.900
different naming.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.050
It's not user dot component or user dot page you could name it like this.

01:11.150 --> 01:17.250
But typically in ionic two application you don't do it since it's stored in the pages folder anyways.

01:17.270 --> 01:19.940
It's pretty clear that it is a page.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.780
And again keep in mind a page is a component.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.500
We're just using it as a page.

01:24.530 --> 01:27.440
Rudy iconic to navigation stack.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.450
So in there I will export a class named user page.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.690
Here again you do name it page.

01:33.710 --> 01:38.940
You follow this convention so that when you imported an average file it's pretty clear that this is

01:38.940 --> 01:41.180
a component used as a page.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.500
And then we add d at component decorator.

01:44.690 --> 01:49.660
And again this needs to be imported from angular core not from Ionic.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.190
Here you can define a selector and you typically prefix it with page.

01:55.190 --> 02:02.370
So Page user for example and then a template and you could use an inline template for example with back

02:02.370 --> 02:09.890
text to write multiline strings or you point to an external file user on aged email which I still need

02:09.890 --> 02:11.240
to create.

02:11.390 --> 02:13.470
So I will create this file here now.

02:13.640 --> 02:24.960
User and in there we have two important pieces Ironhead header and of course the ion content.

02:24.990 --> 02:29.490
By the way D plug in I'm using here to just type in content.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.140
And then all that completed is called Amut.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.010
It's available for editors too.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.610
You can simply search for it now in the header.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.750
We typically have a nav bar.

02:39.750 --> 02:47.420
This is where this back button will be added and then APH bar we typically have a title for this page.

02:47.430 --> 02:50.870
We simply could say user for now.

02:50.910 --> 02:54.820
Now in the content you can place any content you like.

02:55.020 --> 03:04.140
I will add padding to get as well nice padding on the edges and you can of course also middes now which

03:04.140 --> 03:06.310
content do we want to render here.

03:06.720 --> 03:13.770
Well I'd say it would be great to connect the content we show here to the button that we clicked on

03:13.770 --> 03:15.040
the user's template.

03:15.090 --> 03:20.600
So if I click the max button I want to say hi IMX for example and if I click the button I want to say

03:20.600 --> 03:25.710
hey hi I'm Anna but I don't want to create two separate pages of course I want to you reuse the same

03:25.710 --> 03:26.370
one.

03:26.430 --> 03:28.110
So here I want to say hi.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.020
I'm and then kind of yeah kind of like the name right.

03:33.040 --> 03:37.880
So would be great to have a name property which we can output with string and Appalachian and here and

03:37.990 --> 03:47.170
title we could maybe also say name to really have days be tailored to the user we are loading.

03:47.170 --> 03:50.770
Now clearly we don't have a name property so let's change it.

03:50.770 --> 03:54.330
It should be of type string but of course it's not initialized.

03:54.340 --> 04:00.110
How do we get the data from the user's page tudy use page.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.660
I will show you how to do this in the next video.

04:02.740 --> 04:06.840
Before doing this let's do something else though so that we don't forget it.

04:06.970 --> 04:12.060
Let's register to use our page here in the app module user page.

04:12.070 --> 04:17.740
Make sure to add to the import and make sure to also added to the entry components for the same reason

04:17.740 --> 04:19.090
as before.

04:19.210 --> 04:25.210
With this I will save this and I will see you in the next lecture when we will pass data from the users

04:25.540 --> 04:26.950
to the user component
