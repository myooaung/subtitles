Nowadays we covered a lot of the basics and both our first application let's do something we haven't

00:07.340 --> 00:08.050
done yet.

00:08.150 --> 00:15.410
Let's run it on a real device because whilst testing an application the browser is nice it's not sufficient

00:16.130 --> 00:18.530
for one it will never see the same.

00:18.530 --> 00:23.820
The real user will see in the end there might be some clutches or issues you just don't see in the browser.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.290
There might be performance issues you don't recognize in the browser.

00:27.290 --> 00:32.450
Additionally you of course can use native device features you just can't use the camera and the browser

00:32.450 --> 00:33.000
right.

00:33.020 --> 00:38.020
Therefore it is important to also test your application on real devices.

00:38.180 --> 00:44.690
So in this core section we'll have a look on how to do this on iOS and Android devices and also on their

00:44.690 --> 00:45.590
simulators.

00:45.590 --> 00:50.900
If you just don't happen to have such a device at hand or you want to simply tested on different devices

00:50.900 --> 00:56.570
and you might not own every single Android phone so let's have a look at how this works.
