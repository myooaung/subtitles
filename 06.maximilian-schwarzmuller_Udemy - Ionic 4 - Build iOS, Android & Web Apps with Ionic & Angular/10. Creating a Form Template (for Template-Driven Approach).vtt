00:01.890 --> 00:08.730
I would start creating my own input my own user interface here on the shopping lists page any shopping

00:08.730 --> 00:13.100
list aged hemol file of course since this holds our page template.

00:13.260 --> 00:19.690
Now there I deleted the comment and my first step is to change the style here to shopping list like

00:19.690 --> 00:22.190
it is to have it look a bit nicer.

00:22.440 --> 00:30.730
Now in the iron content here I'm going to set up my form a normal HVM old form element here.

00:30.780 --> 00:35.430
Now I will remove the action because we're not submitting the form like this will let English to handle

00:35.430 --> 00:37.500
this but I'll come back to this later.

00:37.710 --> 00:43.770
Inside of this form I want to set up a list which will hold my individual I and or my input I should

00:43.770 --> 00:47.240
say which will be stored in I-N items.

00:47.610 --> 00:54.660
I will use this I and list an item set up here because this is kind of the ironic way of creating input's

00:54.660 --> 01:01.850
forms as this allows you to style your inputs really nicely of course you don't have to use this pattern.

01:01.860 --> 01:05.920
You could also use a grid and organize your inputs in that grid.

01:05.970 --> 01:12.510
That would be fine to just play around with it and find a style you prefer using the grid and columns

01:12.510 --> 01:17.820
next to each other where one Grid column stores the label on the hour one store is the actual input

01:17.820 --> 01:19.550
field might be fine too.

01:19.560 --> 01:25.980
Again I'm going to use this pattern here where in my eye an item identifier i n label which will be

01:25.980 --> 01:31.530
the text displayed next to the input field though we will also learn about alternative placements in

01:31.530 --> 01:32.520
a second.

01:32.760 --> 01:38.100
And I want to give this first input field and creating a label of name because this will be the name

01:38.100 --> 01:41.160
of the ingredient we're going to add to the shopping list.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.920
Now I and label here can be configured in different ways.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.760
And again a great place to learn more about is this the official documentation here.

01:49.950 --> 01:55.350
If you have a look at inputs and this can be confusing we have to go to inputs not labels.

01:55.350 --> 02:01.600
There is no label element but inputs you find different ways of configuring your labels to position

02:01.650 --> 02:02.340
it differently.

02:02.340 --> 02:08.700
For example a fixed will position them left 2D element or to your input and make sure that the inputs

02:08.760 --> 02:14.860
start on the same point you could then say so that the inputs are directly beneath each other.

02:14.970 --> 02:19.950
Can an older set up floating labels which allows you to click on the input and then the label will float

02:19.980 --> 02:27.630
up inline labels which are part of your input then or where you have a Where will the actual input is

02:27.630 --> 02:29.540
closer to the label then.

02:29.670 --> 02:30.250
And so on.

02:30.240 --> 02:37.130
So definitely play around with those adjustments with those settings here inline actually the default

02:37.140 --> 02:38.590
if you don't add anything.

02:38.670 --> 02:47.130
I'm going to go with fixed though to have all my labels fixed beneath each other on the left and then

02:47.370 --> 02:49.590
I will add an actual input field.

02:49.590 --> 02:53.440
Now there are a couple of different types of inputs and ionic two.

02:53.520 --> 03:00.120
I will start with the very basic Well input itself ion input where again you can learn more about in

03:00.120 --> 03:08.400
the input component documentation article you already opened probably and this ion input here then is

03:08.400 --> 03:11.850
configured like a normal h m l input element.

03:11.900 --> 03:17.070
So we can set up a type and the type here Shelby Tex because I'm going to enter the name here which

03:17.070 --> 03:18.880
of course is normal text.

03:18.900 --> 03:24.060
You can also assign a name to this input and you have to do this when using the template driven approach

03:24.070 --> 03:25.170
an angler or.

03:25.440 --> 03:33.350
So I'm going to give this a name of well let's say ingredient name here because it will guess what stored

03:33.410 --> 03:35.430
the name of the ingredient we're adding.

03:35.430 --> 03:38.040
You can also add a placeholder.

03:38.040 --> 03:45.630
So again attributes as on a normal aged female input element dis ion input component actually is a wrapper

03:45.720 --> 03:52.200
to that normal input element place holder could be Moq so that you have an example of what you could

03:52.200 --> 03:56.820
enter in the empty input field and that's it for now.

03:56.820 --> 04:03.870
We'll revisit this later though this creates my first input element with lay all next to it and if we

04:03.870 --> 04:08.430
save this we should already be able to view it as an hour running application.

04:08.430 --> 04:13.870
Here you see name and milk next to each other and this is my input field where I can enter.

04:13.890 --> 04:19.720
Side note if you open this on a real device of course your keyboard will scroll up from the bottom.

04:19.770 --> 04:24.470
So it's just not doing this here in the browser because keep in mind we're still on the browser.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.500
We're going to view this app in a real device or on the emulator later though.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.680
Now with this we finished or we added our first input.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.730
Now let's also add the second one.

04:34.740 --> 04:38.220
This show should allow us to enter the amount of items we want to add.

04:38.220 --> 04:43.740
So name it or give it a label of amount and the type shall be number here because I only want to allow

04:43.740 --> 04:45.770
the inputs of numbers.

04:45.780 --> 04:51.000
The great thing about this type is if you set this to number the keyboard which will scroll up on a

04:51.000 --> 04:56.670
real device it will all be this numbered keyboard which doesn't include normal characters but only numbers

04:57.460 --> 04:58.110
that name.

04:58.110 --> 05:05.550
I'll change this to a mount and placeholder this to to give an example for a valid amount now to finish

05:05.550 --> 05:12.190
these basic form I also need to include a button and I will include this but outside of my eye and last

05:12.190 --> 05:18.630
year I will simply add a button here add iron button to give it this typical style will have set the

05:18.630 --> 05:19.890
type to submit.

05:19.940 --> 05:21.090
It's a normal button element.

05:21.090 --> 05:28.040
Always keep this in mind and it will set it to block to have it span over the full available with.

05:28.620 --> 05:34.230
And I'll also distribute there were multiple lines so that it's a bit easier to read and I will say

05:34.390 --> 05:35.060
at.

05:35.250 --> 05:42.060
So this allows us to add the item or we could also say an item I guess this is now the button for this

05:42.060 --> 05:44.290
form lasting us of this attribute.

05:44.310 --> 05:49.680
All the properties here of my inputs to since we're going to add something there later.

05:49.740 --> 05:55.110
And with this the basic four is finished let's now it looks good to me now.

05:55.140 --> 06:02.910
The next step is to hook it up to where two angles you were to use anger or two template driven approach

06:03.060 --> 06:05.070
to also extract some values.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.840
When we do submit this form currently nothing happens when we do this
