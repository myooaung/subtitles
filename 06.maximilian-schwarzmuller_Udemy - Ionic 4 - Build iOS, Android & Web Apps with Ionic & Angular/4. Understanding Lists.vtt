00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.350
In the last lecture we had a look at buttons now want to have a closer look at ion lists or add lists

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.560
and list idence I should say for one you can of course dive into the official documentation to learn

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.420
more about all different ways of configuring it and how you might structure more complex lists with

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.120
more complex items.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.560
In this lecture and the next lectures I want to dive into some of the basics of using lists and list

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.520
items.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.680
Why would you use lists and list items in the first place.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.310
Well in a lot of applications you have data or buttons or forms which you want to present in a from

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.840
top to bottom way because that's typically how you present data on a mobile phone.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.310
Right.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.910
And lists are great for it is they allow you to output data in a structured in a list like way.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.940
Now a list is typically created by using the iron list component here like a wrapper around Ayane items

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.240
or as you always also saw it around buttons with an item on it.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.580
Actually you may use any element not just button but buttons will do something special if you place

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.500
an item on them.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.270
Here we have a normal item and you could say it's a button and right now if we save this let's have

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.760
a look at this list in our running application.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.560
It's the same application as before.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.680
So you're going to see the buttons above.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.440
This is the list and I think you were able to see the difference between an item and a button with an

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.670
item on it.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.640
Generally both items look the same.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.710
But since we used an item on a button for the second element we also get this arrow here.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.080
You'll also see a difference if we tab on it.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.130
Here we get a visual effects and visual feedback.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.640
That's not the case for the first element here I can tab as much as I want and click events would indeed

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.500
be fired.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.620
That still works but we don't get a visual feedback.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.050
Sometimes you don't need that and that's OK.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.010
But if you want to have that feedback and want to have the arrow here to really indicate hey you can

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.960
tap me.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.510
Then you might want to use a button with an item on it.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.030
So that's the first important takeaway here.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.530
And number important take away is you don't have to use list.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.670
You can remove I list just use an item like this and the button like this and you will see the styling

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.290
is generally the same.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.640
This still works but we you we removed the separate set to start and end of the list and a list also

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.230
gives us some other features.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.990
I will explain later.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.550
So typically you will use ion lists around your items.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.210
However if you don't need those separators and don't need those extra features I'll come back to.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.830
Then there's no need to use I unlaced does a key take away.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.410
You don't need to use it to use an item
