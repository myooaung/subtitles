00:02.250 --> 00:08.640
To fix that here in this filter I need to again use my off service.

00:08.640 --> 00:15.330
Reach out to the user I.D. which is an observable and subscribe to it and I'll get my user I.D. as a

00:15.330 --> 00:16.650
result.

00:16.650 --> 00:23.250
Then we can move this entire check here into that subscription simply and here user I.D. will now be

00:23.250 --> 00:24.030
a whale.

00:24.030 --> 00:29.880
So now here where I use this off service user I.D. I just use user I.D. which is the result of my subscription

00:30.330 --> 00:32.850
and that should already be all.

00:32.860 --> 00:36.960
Now we also have a problem in the place detail page there.

00:37.030 --> 00:42.010
We also used to user I.D. here and we have another problem down there.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.550
Now here first of all I have a number.

00:45.620 --> 00:49.320
Observable chain where I get my place and I subscribe.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.880
Now that means we'll have to or we probably want to change the two.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.930
Observable change together.

00:56.940 --> 01:03.870
First of all though I'll reach out to be of service to the user I.D. and they're all now not subscribe

01:03.960 --> 01:09.660
but I'll use the pipe method here instead so that I can add a switch map.

01:09.990 --> 01:14.970
And that's which map of course is important from our exchange as operators

01:18.050 --> 01:29.550
and now in switch map I get that user I.D. if we have no user I.D. here then I will again fro And you

01:29.700 --> 01:34.060
error found no user or anything like that.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.140
Otherwise we'll continue.

01:36.270 --> 01:42.780
And then I will continue with this place as service get place which I will return here because that

01:42.780 --> 01:51.380
yields and no observable like that and what I had here this subscribed call now simply happens on both

01:51.380 --> 01:54.050
combined observable chains.

01:54.050 --> 01:59.420
Now the important thing is that the user I.D. is available here in the switch map but I need it down

01:59.420 --> 02:07.520
there now for the ad we can add a number variable fetched user I.D. which is a string and then here

02:07.550 --> 02:17.240
once I have a user I.D. I'll set fetched user I.D. equal to user I.D. and there where I need it I can

02:17.240 --> 02:23.420
now simply use that fetched user ideal just like that.

02:23.510 --> 02:32.370
Now if we scroll down to the second problem here I have no subscribe method on ADD booking her dad.

02:32.370 --> 02:34.530
Let me quickly go to the booking service

02:39.320 --> 02:40.990
Yeah indeed.

02:41.120 --> 02:46.820
I need to return this entire chain of course so that in the end we do return and observable here in

02:46.820 --> 02:47.560
AD booking.

02:47.630 --> 02:53.440
So that I can subscribe in the place detail page now in the place.

02:53.500 --> 03:00.430
Service I have no problem there I also want to get that user I.D. notice solution is the same as before

03:01.120 --> 03:04.420
we reach out to this of service user I.D..

03:04.990 --> 03:09.430
And now we could subscribe here but we'll send a HBP request later.

03:09.610 --> 03:12.370
So the solution is the same as in a booking service.

03:12.370 --> 03:19.030
I use the pipe method and then we use Switch map here where we get that user I.D..

03:19.540 --> 03:25.340
If we don't have an user user I.D. then I'll throw a new error.

03:25.360 --> 03:29.050
No user found otherwise.

03:29.060 --> 03:35.930
If we have a user well then we can create our new place which will actually which will actually create

03:35.930 --> 03:40.000
as a variable up there like this.

03:40.110 --> 03:45.870
And now I'll not create a constant here but just use that variable and set it to a value to the new

03:45.870 --> 03:52.040
place object and I'll grab this to gather with my HBP request down there.

03:52.200 --> 03:59.580
Move that often does if check here and there we now have access to the user I.D. which I get as an argument

03:59.580 --> 04:03.450
and switch map because it is the result of a subscription to user deep.

04:03.450 --> 04:11.070
Important thing though I only want to get one user idea and not set up an ongoing subscription just

04:11.070 --> 04:12.660
as I did it in the booking service.

04:12.660 --> 04:18.060
There are all to take one and therefore I do the same here in the place service.

04:18.150 --> 04:25.080
Now we're creating a new place where sending this HDP request hence instead of adding a new pipe method

04:25.080 --> 04:32.910
call we can pipe diver operators on the same observable chain or in the same pipe method call and in

04:32.910 --> 04:41.340
the end of course I want to return this entire observable chain here in app place as well.

04:42.390 --> 04:48.840
And with all that out of the way it now recompile and I and I should have fixed all the errors we had

04:48.840 --> 04:53.440
before because now we're using our user I.D. correctly.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.070
Now let's see what else we can do.
