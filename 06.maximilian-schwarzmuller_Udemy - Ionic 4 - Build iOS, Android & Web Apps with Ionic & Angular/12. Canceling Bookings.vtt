00:02.440 --> 00:04.770
So canceling bookings would be a thing.

00:04.900 --> 00:10.650
So that if I click the trash bin here we actually get rid of that if we have a look at the bookings

00:10.650 --> 00:11.740
page here.

00:11.950 --> 00:18.510
Dead button here for that option trigger his on canceled booking and it gives us the idea of the booking.

00:18.510 --> 00:27.690
I want to cancel so we already got a lot we need now we need to basically pass that I.D. which of course

00:27.690 --> 00:33.540
should be named booking a year to our booking service to that canceled booking method we already set

00:33.540 --> 00:34.420
up there.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.870
We are injecting the booking service.

00:36.870 --> 00:43.410
So let's simply call this booking service cancel booking and forward that booking idea here.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.350
That's all we need to do here in the booking service.

00:46.350 --> 00:50.220
We got no logic in place for a client for canceling a booking though.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.290
But that should be fairly easy to add.

00:52.500 --> 00:58.740
We'll again have to manipulate our list of bookings and in this case will not change an existing one

00:58.830 --> 01:03.400
like we did with updating a place but we'll delete a booking instead.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.780
But this is still fairly simple.

01:05.850 --> 01:13.320
I will copy the code from there where I get all my bookings and then I take just the latest snapshot.

01:13.320 --> 01:19.350
I add a delay here to simulate a network request and then I get my bookings but of course I'll now not

01:19.350 --> 01:21.060
com cat a new booking.

01:21.180 --> 01:28.290
Instead we can use the filter method here to filter our array of bookings down to a smaller array of

01:28.290 --> 01:34.650
bookings and we'll have a look at all my bookings in here and you can named as argument however you

01:34.650 --> 01:35.600
want of course.

01:35.820 --> 01:41.250
And I will compare the idea of the booking I'm currently looking at in this array of bookings and if

01:41.250 --> 01:44.910
it's not equal to the booking idea I'm getting as an argument.

01:44.910 --> 01:48.920
So to this booking idea then I will return true here.

01:48.930 --> 01:53.940
This is why I'm checking for not equality because then this is a booking I want to keep because it's

01:53.940 --> 01:57.390
not the booking for which we pass the I.D. to cancel it.

01:57.390 --> 02:01.310
If the idea of the booking I'm looking at for the items in the bookings array here.

02:01.440 --> 02:06.540
If that is equal to the booking idea I'm getting here though then this is the booking I want to cancel

02:06.770 --> 02:09.410
and they offer this will return false here.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.360
It will not be included in the new bookings array right.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.900
It's filtered out.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.400
This should be all we need to do.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.910
This should allow us to cancel our bookings.

02:19.150 --> 02:21.730
So let's save that and let's wait for the app to reload.

02:21.730 --> 02:27.880
And of course I have no bookings so we should probably also display a little text here.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.620
We can do that.

02:28.630 --> 02:38.320
But first of all let's quickly book and you place your with some data click book and let's go to our

02:38.320 --> 02:39.400
bookings.

02:39.400 --> 02:45.000
Let's click cancel and nothing happens.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.190
Did this where it could probably didn't double otherwise it should update here.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.750
Because in the bookings page we do have a subscription right.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.140
So we should get updated bookings for sure.

02:55.150 --> 02:57.970
Well we never subscribe to our observable.

02:57.970 --> 03:02.730
We call cancel booking but cancel booking returns does observable change here.

03:02.770 --> 03:05.690
So of course we should subscribe.

03:05.690 --> 03:11.680
So let's add subscribe here and now just by adding this it would work because an observable to which

03:11.680 --> 03:13.960
you don't subscribe will never execute.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.350
Hence if I am just subscribed like this it should work.

03:17.350 --> 03:24.020
Let me quickly demonstrate this by booking that place again here with some dummy data.

03:24.030 --> 03:24.790
Here we go.

03:26.090 --> 03:33.510
Let's go back here to all the bookings and now you will see this works and it disappears after a second.

03:33.640 --> 03:38.770
But again it would be nice to show a little spinner of course and we can use the same approach we used

03:38.770 --> 03:44.180
before the loading controller

03:47.460 --> 03:50.850
injected from ionic angular into the bookings page.

03:51.090 --> 03:55.840
And then here in on canceled booking I will call this loading controller.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.980
Create with a message of canceling

04:02.530 --> 04:04.020
and then block here.

04:04.210 --> 04:12.580
I get my loading element as an argument I can then call loading element present here to show it.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.630
Then I start to cancel process and then the function passed to subscribe which is executed once this

04:18.630 --> 04:19.140
is done.

04:19.140 --> 04:26.420
So once this delay of one second passed I can call loading element dismiss and now we should have a

04:26.420 --> 04:27.730
nicer flow here.

04:27.920 --> 04:37.900
If we wait for that to reload and I just cover my place says I booked that place with some data that

04:39.150 --> 04:41.090
now let's go to our bookings.

04:41.370 --> 04:45.700
And if I now delete this we got our canceled button meter as well and now it's gone.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.750
So this is a nicer flow and this is now to flow for canceling bookings.

04:49.770 --> 04:51.900
Now let's do some cleanup and optimization work.
