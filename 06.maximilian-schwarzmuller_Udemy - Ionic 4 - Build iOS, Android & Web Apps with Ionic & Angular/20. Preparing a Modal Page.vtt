00:02.560 --> 00:09.170
An item and we made a word for a step but I actually want to display a modal which allows us to view

00:09.170 --> 00:16.520
the full quote and which also gives us the option to unfavorite this quote If we want to we already

00:16.520 --> 00:23.570
created a page which we use as such a model a modal is an overlay over dickered page and it actually

00:23.570 --> 00:27.140
uses a normal ionic to page for this.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.960
But it's not placing it on the stack of pages.

00:30.980 --> 00:33.420
We're not loading a modem for the nav controller.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.850
We're not pushing it on the stack of pages.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.900
Instead again it's just the overlay.

00:38.090 --> 00:44.660
And as always you can learn more about modals by going to the official component documentation here

00:44.930 --> 00:47.100
and scrolling down to modals.

00:47.150 --> 00:48.580
Here you can learn more about it.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.900
But let's start together in this application and create a nice model for this.

00:53.900 --> 00:59.150
As mentioned we first need to work on the code file on the code page though because this will serve

00:59.160 --> 00:59.990
as our model.

00:59.990 --> 01:02.570
So let's do that in there.

01:02.570 --> 01:11.150
First of all in my quote aged him a file in the template I want to display the offered name as a title

01:11.150 --> 01:11.740
here.

01:12.020 --> 01:18.690
So I'll leave it empty for now until we learn how we can pass data to a model in the content of the.

01:18.770 --> 01:26.820
I want to display a ion card to have this box with the shadow maybe also add some padding to this card.

01:27.470 --> 01:33.210
And then we could add and card content to that.

01:33.260 --> 01:38.990
That of course also removes the need to add a padding though because it adds padding on its own in there.

01:38.990 --> 01:41.450
We can have the text.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.890
So some string jubilation outputting the text of the code.

01:45.080 --> 01:48.150
I got rid of this too because we don't pass any data yet.

01:48.320 --> 01:48.990
So here.

01:48.990 --> 01:55.460
Later on place a place will just for now will display the text below the content.

01:55.520 --> 02:05.240
I'll again add iron row and iron coal to have a full width column where I want to have a button and

02:05.300 --> 02:09.790
this button of course needs the iron button directive.

02:10.100 --> 02:16.820
I want to have it small and I'll use the outline directive to have a button with borders but with the

02:16.820 --> 02:20.010
background are also a sign.

02:20.020 --> 02:23.990
Another color you can do this with the color attribute.

02:23.990 --> 02:29.560
And this is a whaleboat on any element including built in HCM elements.

02:29.720 --> 02:37.820
It allows you to easily assign one of the colors defined here in the theme variable's file one of those

02:37.820 --> 02:42.870
colors of primary secondary danger light and dark at your disposal.

02:43.010 --> 02:48.000
And at the end of the section we're going to work with this file and even add our own colors.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.200
For now I want to go with the danger color though.

02:51.200 --> 02:58.320
So back in the quote HDMI file I'll simply pass danger as de-value for this color attribute.

02:58.320 --> 03:04.560
Again you may use color on any HDMI element to change its color.

03:05.090 --> 03:12.990
So with this I'm setting the color to danger and I'll say on favorite as the caption for this button.

03:13.030 --> 03:16.430
But the Zabol were multiple lines to make it a bit easier to read.

03:17.180 --> 03:21.080
So we get the unfavorite button below the card.

03:21.080 --> 03:27.170
I also want to have another button where I can say or where I always add in button.

03:27.170 --> 03:34.730
First of all where a denken say close to dismiss the mole and I'll also add the danger color to this

03:34.730 --> 03:40.730
or set to color danger but I'll leave it at the default button style which is this.

03:40.850 --> 03:49.410
Well normal but with background and border all the way to center all of this so add text center to iron

03:49.430 --> 03:54.450
content to have a centered card and a centered button below the card.

03:54.530 --> 04:00.340
Of course we'll also need to add some klick listeners here so let's do that next.

04:00.350 --> 04:05.500
But before doing this let's actually display the modal and see how this works.
