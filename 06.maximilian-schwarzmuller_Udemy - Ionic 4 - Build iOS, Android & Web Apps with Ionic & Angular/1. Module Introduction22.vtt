I come to this course module This module is not about I on it too it is about angle or two.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.360
It's there to refresh your angler to knowledge and you don't need that if you already finished this

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.340
course.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.300
It's only there if you're about to start the course but you.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.960
Yeah you get some basic angler to knowledge but you want to refresh this knowledge then go through this

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.470
section here so that you feel more confident using English too.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.770
And you know the core concepts of English too.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.810
Now I strongly recommend picking up a dedicated Angler or two course if you've got no angle or to knowledge

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.070
at all because then even this section might not be enough.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.490
But with that let's get started and see what English too really is all about.
