00:02.130 --> 00:07.320
Let's start by structuring the app there's a super important of course because we get to know what we're

00:07.320 --> 00:08.710
going to build.

00:08.760 --> 00:15.630
So let's break up the app into different pieces and see what we need to build in this section.

00:15.630 --> 00:18.330
The advantage we have is that we know it is finished.

00:18.360 --> 00:24.510
But you could also think of this as being drawn on a piece of paper when we first think about Yep we

00:24.510 --> 00:30.270
definitely want to have a section or a page where we do have different categories of quotes we can pick

00:30.270 --> 00:36.960
from then if we click on one of the categories we probably want to go to the detail page there which

00:36.960 --> 00:39.950
allows us to click favorite on some quote.

00:40.050 --> 00:45.360
We get this alert asking us if we really want to favorite this and if we pick yes year and then go back

00:45.360 --> 00:50.810
to the Favorites we will see that the code was actually added to our favorites page.

00:50.940 --> 00:57.300
There we also want to be able to click on a quote and display this modal and we also need to be possible

00:57.480 --> 01:04.200
to open up this side menu where we can go to the settings and there if we switch to background it will

01:04.200 --> 01:08.710
change the background of the quote in the favorite quotes list.

01:08.730 --> 01:14.930
This is the idea behind this app this is your structure you saw in the previous lecture.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.930
Now let's create all those things.

01:17.940 --> 01:24.400
The idea is that we start step by step and the first step probably is to create all those pages we need.

01:24.450 --> 01:29.310
Now in this section we're going to cover a lot of things you don't know yet but creating pages is something

01:29.310 --> 01:30.360
you already learned.

01:30.420 --> 01:36.300
So it might be a nice challenge and exercise to work on this right now and to create the pages on your

01:36.300 --> 01:36.830
own.

01:36.870 --> 01:37.380
No worries.

01:37.410 --> 01:40.110
I will do that together with you in the next lecture.

01:40.410 --> 01:41.980
Which page will we need.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.570
Well you can see them on this slide here.

01:44.790 --> 01:50.880
We need a library page which lists the categories of quotes and then we need kind of a quotes page which

01:50.880 --> 01:53.740
lists the quotes for a chosen category.

01:53.970 --> 02:01.380
Then we all need a page for the Favorites tab here where we display all quotes we marked as favorites

02:01.740 --> 02:05.610
and if we click on a single quote there we also displayed us motile.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.590
That's a separate page to thread.

02:07.620 --> 02:12.480
Now we were at four pages but then we also have the settings page here at the bottom if you click the

02:12.470 --> 02:14.270
Settings tab in the menu.

02:14.580 --> 02:19.210
So these are the pages we need feel free to create them on your own.

02:19.260 --> 02:24.300
As I said in the next lecture we will do this together and thereafter we will start hooking them up

02:24.330 --> 02:26.670
and filling them with live Step-By-Step
