00:02.300 --> 00:07.460
One cleanup work and want to do is that when we have no bookings we should probably show a short message

00:07.460 --> 00:08.300
here.

00:08.300 --> 00:15.890
So in our bookings page we are relying on loaded bookings being an array with the elements in there.

00:15.890 --> 00:24.640
Well since this all is in one iron column I can simply add a NGL check on that column here loaded bookings

00:24.640 --> 00:25.670
is a thing.

00:25.780 --> 00:33.400
So if it is not undefined and then loaded bookings length is greater than zero then I want to show this

00:33.400 --> 00:34.540
list.

00:34.540 --> 00:42.280
Otherwise I'll add a new ion column here which with my same size and offset and then hero the NGL check

00:42.280 --> 00:48.100
world we will be if loaded bookings is not a thing if it is undefined or if loaded.

00:48.100 --> 00:54.340
Bookings length for smaller or equal to zero then it will show this column and its content and the content

00:54.340 --> 01:04.470
here will be a paragraph where I say no bookings found like this the left me all the ad tech center

01:04.470 --> 01:11.680
here to Center that text and if it is now reloads we should see no bookings found here.

01:11.830 --> 01:17.310
As soon as I do add a booking however I would simply give this a try here real quick.

01:19.630 --> 01:24.010
If I go back to bookings now we see that now this is nice.

01:24.010 --> 01:26.290
If I remove it we should see the text again.

01:26.290 --> 01:27.390
We do.

01:27.430 --> 01:33.730
But the other problem I had was that we can actually book places here which are just all place but not

01:33.730 --> 01:36.180
booking all because we have no bankable places here.

01:36.250 --> 01:42.050
So I can certainly inspect these places but the book button shouldn't be there for these places.

01:42.310 --> 01:48.720
Now that of course can all be fixed in a way that is similar to how we fixed it for our filter here.

01:48.790 --> 01:55.520
So let's go to the place detail page and in there we're fetching our place right.

01:55.540 --> 02:02.120
We're fetching our place data here and we're updating this whenever we get a new parameter and you place

02:02.120 --> 02:08.360
I.D. and our You are all parameters and then we're loading our place here because this also gets updated

02:08.360 --> 02:13.270
whenever our places would change and then we're loading our place here.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.810
Now what we can do here.

02:14.810 --> 02:21.980
Again utilizing some UI state again we can add a new property is booking all and by default that say

02:21.980 --> 02:27.050
that is false but it is up to you what you set as a default.

02:27.050 --> 02:30.500
And then we inject our offer service into this page here.

02:30.500 --> 02:36.360
So off service is injected.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.980
Make sure to adjust your import path here

02:42.760 --> 02:45.220
with the off service injected here.

02:45.220 --> 02:52.630
Now when we fetch a place and we set this place we said this is book will equal to a check where we

02:52.630 --> 02:55.090
have a look at that place's user I.D..

02:55.540 --> 03:03.750
And if that is not equal to this offer service user I.D. then this will return true and therefore his

03:03.760 --> 03:05.830
booking bill will be true which it should be.

03:05.860 --> 03:12.120
If I.D. don't match but if I.D. do match then we are the creator of that place and therefore is booking

03:12.120 --> 03:16.310
all will be false because I'm checking for the opposite here.

03:16.360 --> 03:22.450
So this booking bill will be false if we will must not book it and hence now here in the template off

03:22.450 --> 03:27.550
the place detail page where I rendered that button we can add a NGL if statement on that entire row

03:27.550 --> 03:32.010
here and say that this should only be booking Bill if we.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.240
Well if is book Double is true basically.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.390
So is bankable is that new property added.

03:37.390 --> 03:40.550
And only if that is true This button should be shown.

03:40.890 --> 03:44.150
And therefore now as does reloads they go to this place.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.240
I don't see that button.

03:46.240 --> 03:51.340
Now let me simulate that I'm a different user by quickly going to the offer service and changing my

03:51.340 --> 03:57.220
I.D. to X Y set instead of ABC which is the idea added to all the dummy places.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.900
Now it is reloads and I see them here under all places and all is under booking all places.

04:01.960 --> 04:10.780
And therefore if a visit such a place I see that book button again and I can again enter my value your

04:13.080 --> 04:17.800
let me prolong my stay here a little bit.

04:17.820 --> 04:23.130
So now this looks better and now I see my bookings here and I can cancel them of course.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.710
So this is now much much better.

04:26.220 --> 04:31.920
What's missing of course is our persistence state management where we all stored us on a server.

04:31.950 --> 04:34.560
That is what we'll focus on in the next module.
