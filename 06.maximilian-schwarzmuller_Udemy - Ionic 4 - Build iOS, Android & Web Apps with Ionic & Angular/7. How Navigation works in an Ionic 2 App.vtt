Until now we learn how and ironic to upstarts and works.

00:06.660 --> 00:15.330
But I'm sure it's a bit confusing to understand what pages are and how exactly they get rendered to

00:15.360 --> 00:16.950
understand how they get rendered.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.790
We need to understand how navigation works.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.070
The important thing here is ironic too it does not use the angler to router.

00:24.150 --> 00:33.290
Instead it has its own navigation concept which is a stack of pages and remember pages are normal components.

00:33.300 --> 00:39.270
It's just that well they render our full screen so they contain everything we want to see on the screen.

00:39.690 --> 00:46.310
And then I want it to manage as a stack of such pages of such components in the background.

00:46.500 --> 00:52.890
This is why it needs to be started with its own root app which then wraps our route app because this

00:53.100 --> 00:59.160
navigation stack your stack of pages needs to be initialized and this is what I onic to dust behind

00:59.160 --> 01:00.270
the scenes.

01:00.510 --> 01:08.490
We are then able to push new pages on the stack and the important thing about the stack is we always

01:08.610 --> 01:10.600
view the top most page.

01:10.620 --> 01:16.500
This is the page which is currently displayed on the screen so there might be multiple pages on the

01:16.560 --> 01:23.480
stack but we only view the top most in this case the page which was recently pushed on the stack.

01:23.850 --> 01:30.570
Well of course we can also go back by popping off a page which means now the stack only has two pages

01:30.870 --> 01:33.280
and we're viewing this well second page.

01:33.310 --> 01:37.590
Again the top most one this is how I want it to works.

01:37.590 --> 01:45.180
It has a stack kind of like an array of pages where you can push and pop elements add and delete them

01:45.720 --> 01:47.850
and view the top most one.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.340
Well let's see this in action to fully understand how this works and what pages are
