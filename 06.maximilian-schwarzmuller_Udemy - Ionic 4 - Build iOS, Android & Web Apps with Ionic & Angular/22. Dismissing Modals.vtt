In the last lecture we added this Modal which we can't get rid of right now.

00:08.080 --> 00:14.710
So let's change this so that we can actually delete that in the code page which is the page we serve

00:14.800 --> 00:16.110
as a model.

00:16.270 --> 00:20.650
I can first of all get rid of all that stuff which I don't need so that we have the empty component

00:21.280 --> 00:21.710
here.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.620
I want to implement some logic which allows me to dismiss the modal and go back template for that.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.570
And here we have to close button.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.200
I'll add a click listener to that.

00:31.210 --> 00:36.520
And here I simply want to call the on close Mefford which of course I also need to add in my typescript

00:36.520 --> 00:45.790
class on clothes and you somehow need to be able to well get rid of ourselves speaking from this page

00:45.960 --> 00:46.950
perspective.

00:47.230 --> 00:51.870
So we're on this page and now we want to tell ourselves well I need to disappear.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.630
How can we do this.

00:53.710 --> 01:00.720
Thus far we always used the NAF controller to push and pop pages but here that's not managed foody nav

01:00.730 --> 01:01.350
controller.

01:01.360 --> 01:08.800
It's not part of our navigation Stec it simply is overly Ionescu has another helpful controller for

01:08.810 --> 01:12.010
this and we need to inject it in order to be able to use it.

01:12.280 --> 01:17.090
It's called View Controller so I'll store it in a property named View Controller.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.650
And of course the type here is the controller.

01:19.750 --> 01:23.360
It needs to be imported from ionic angular just like this.

01:23.370 --> 01:30.590
This is the import and the view controller controls the currently active view.

01:30.820 --> 01:38.050
So where are the neph controller controls are a stack of pages the view controller controls currently

01:38.050 --> 01:40.680
visible currently active page.

01:40.690 --> 01:45.150
So in this case this page here to quote page and this is always the case.

01:45.220 --> 01:51.250
If you inject the control into a page and you were accessing it it's accessing or it allows you to access

01:51.250 --> 01:55.120
your currently active page D'Qwell page here in this case.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.700
Therefore in on close we can access to view controller.

01:58.780 --> 02:05.020
And here we get a couple of useful methods and one very useful method is the dismiss method.

02:05.050 --> 02:08.000
Now as you might be able to guess dismissed.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.610
One important thing.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.800
It simply deletes the page.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.290
It gets rid of it.

02:13.570 --> 02:21.390
So you should of course make sure that when you use dismiss you actually have something to display instead.

02:21.400 --> 02:27.730
So if you were on the normal stack of pages and for some reason you don't want to use pop but you want

02:27.730 --> 02:34.050
to dismiss yourself you could also call this mis on yourself with the view controller.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.530
But if you then don't have a page below yourself.

02:37.630 --> 02:43.230
So if you're calling this on the root page it's probably not behavior you want.

02:43.240 --> 02:49.330
Here on the mall let's of course fine because the modem is an overlay anyways so if we dismiss it well

02:49.330 --> 02:50.840
we simply get rid of the overlay.

02:51.010 --> 02:51.760
That's great.

02:51.760 --> 02:57.180
We then viewed the topmost page of the navigation stack and again that is exactly what we want.

02:57.460 --> 03:02.430
So if this were able to dismiss ourselves we're able to get rid of D-Mo..

03:02.800 --> 03:10.350
And if I saved this remember I hooked up the button here also with on close if he dismissed this and

03:10.350 --> 03:11.900
go back to the application.

03:11.970 --> 03:16.790
Let's again favorite quote your click on it you viewed the modem and clicked close.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.200
Now back we're in the page.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.810
So this allows us to view the model and dismiss it and notice that I like to automatically give sesterces

03:24.810 --> 03:28.230
dismiss slighting animation out of the box.

03:28.260 --> 03:33.450
So if that were able to dismiss the model the next step is to pass some data to the model before we

03:33.450 --> 03:36.880
then also start working hooking up this unfavorite button here.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.120
Let's work on passing that data next
