00:02.230 --> 00:04.840
Now we had a look at global thieving.

00:04.840 --> 00:07.270
What if you don't want to use the same theme.

00:07.270 --> 00:12.400
Were maybe just on one component not the same styles on both platforms.

00:12.400 --> 00:18.250
The good thing about the I guess it by default adjusts the stylus based on the platform it's running

00:18.250 --> 00:24.150
on the taps behave differently for example there is no ripple effect when we're running on the iPhone.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.630
Then when we're running on the pixel here you always need to reload after switching that twice.

00:28.630 --> 00:31.150
By the way here we got that ripple effect.

00:31.150 --> 00:36.490
We got a different spinner we got different tasks with a ripple effect and for example the hamburger

00:36.490 --> 00:40.810
I can hear all is not colored because that doesn't fit the Material Design Guide.

00:40.900 --> 00:48.130
So we got this platform adaptive styles out of the box which is a big selling point of ionic because

00:48.130 --> 00:54.640
it makes it easy for us to build cross platform applications with one code base that still look and

00:54.640 --> 01:00.460
feel native like that but sometimes you just want to override something where you want to have your

01:00.460 --> 01:06.070
own main color a set or a different primary color for a different platform.

01:06.070 --> 01:11.440
Well then you can take advantage of something you can see when you go into the elements tab and your

01:11.440 --> 01:18.250
developer tools on the route H2 male element you will see that there are a couple of classes are applied

01:18.730 --> 01:25.270
and there also is a mode now that is all set automatically by ionic based on the mode or the platform

01:25.270 --> 01:26.750
it detects.

01:26.830 --> 01:31.720
Now it does detect this simply by the headers sent for example.

01:31.750 --> 01:38.200
So if you're reviewing this here in Android phone indeed the mode is set to M.D. for material design

01:38.410 --> 01:40.660
and you also have the M.D. class here.

01:40.840 --> 01:47.290
And if you're switching to an iPhone and you're reloading then it is actually set to ISIS as you can

01:47.290 --> 01:48.190
tell.

01:48.190 --> 01:54.370
Now if you're viewing this on a desktop so without being in this preview of a mobile device then you'll

01:54.370 --> 01:59.000
see it's actually using Material Design as a default.

01:59.110 --> 02:02.400
Now this is nice but how does this help us.

02:02.410 --> 02:09.010
Well since we got a class here M.D. or IAW we can of course take that into account when setting up our

02:09.010 --> 02:15.880
styles and that does not only include styles anywhere in our components or our custom see as its rules

02:16.240 --> 02:19.300
but I'm also talking about this general setup.

02:19.630 --> 02:25.840
This route selector here is a pseudo selector that simply selects the root element in your application.

02:25.840 --> 02:31.710
Typically the H Tim Al element and then the variables here therefore apply to the entire application

02:32.380 --> 02:40.060
but you can also of course add a class selector for ISIS if you want to set up ISIS specific styles

02:40.360 --> 02:41.770
or markdown.

02:41.770 --> 02:46.350
Now what I mentioned earlier is that oh you of course could say for ISIS I am button.

02:46.360 --> 02:53.890
So for all buttons that are running in the ISIS mode or for all divs that running in the ISIS mode or

02:53.890 --> 03:01.180
for all items with my own class my own class in Iowa's mode you can set up your own rules.

03:01.390 --> 03:07.690
But of course you can also just select ISIS and then just we do it here set up some general styles.

03:07.690 --> 03:15.310
So for example here just to demonstrate this if I set up my primary color to be totally different let's

03:15.310 --> 03:22.990
say green just as a demo not because it's so beautiful for ISIS then you will see that asked Is reloads

03:25.100 --> 03:25.910
on the desktop.

03:25.910 --> 03:27.500
We still have the red color.

03:27.740 --> 03:36.680
If I go into the mobile view though and I'm on iPhone here and I reload I have that green primary color.

03:36.750 --> 03:44.410
So this allows you to adjust styles on any level be that the global level here or on a component or

03:44.410 --> 03:51.180
a custom see is as rule level based on the platform with the help of the Iaw class anti material design

03:51.210 --> 03:56.640
class selectors added automatically or the classes are added automatically by ionic.
