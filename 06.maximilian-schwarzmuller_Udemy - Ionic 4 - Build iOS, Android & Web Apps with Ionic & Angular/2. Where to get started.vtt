00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.020
So let's see our quotes ever run on the real device.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.910
Now to get started I strongly recommend going to the ionic documentation.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.660
I will also walk you through the process and the next videos.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.330
No worries.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.240
But this is a great place to look up how it works if you're stuck somewhere there under set up.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.240
You have to use full resources.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.910
The most useful is here under deploying it will describe how to get the app to your device for both

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.750
Android.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.240
It all the list requirements.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.070
I come back to this in the Android video and iOS and again I will walk you through that in the two videos

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.550
which follow this video.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.390
But again it's a great place to look something up and to understand how this works.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.050
The other great resource someone to point your direction to is entered the installation documentation

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.400
at the very end.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.430
You'll find links to declarative or documentation for iOS and Android again.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.620
And those guys are really great to dive into the prerequisites and some things which might go wrong

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.390
while setting up those prerequisites.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.720
And then also about how to debug your application.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.410
So these are really in-depth documentations on this topic and I definitely recommend going into them

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.800
when running your app on your devices or on the simulator which just describe peer to enough of the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.690
talking.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.870
Let's see it in action.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.710
I will start with iOS in the next video.
