End the last section we built another application a cool application doing a lot of user input fetching

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.020
and working with that input.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.290
It has one issue though.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.480
We're not saving that anywhere.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.510
If we close the app it's gone.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.680
All our recipes and our shopping list items are just gone.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.060
That is not optimal.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.260
So let's change it in this section where we're going to take the application from the last module and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.310
enhance it and this application we're going to add authentication to allow a user to create a new account

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.560
and then sign in and with that signed in mode with that authenticated user we can now send HTP request

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.250
to the server to store recipes for that user on some server.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.820
And of course also to get those recipes and work with them and the responses we get back from well reaching

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.090
out to the server.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.940
This is what this section is about.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.720
We will use firebase as a dummy back end but the techniques you'll learn in this section will work with

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.080
any back end you choose to use.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.890
And of course there's another key feature on your road to building real big applications which probably

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.660
need features like these.
