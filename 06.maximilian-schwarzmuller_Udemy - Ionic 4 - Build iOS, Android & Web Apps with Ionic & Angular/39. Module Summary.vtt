00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.920
In this course section we took our ionic to basics and apply them to a real application.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.490
We use a lot of the built in components and you hopefully now feel confident using them on your own

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.990
and you know where to look if you need some specific configuration.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.280
You also learned how to apply your own styling how to implement different approaches of navigating around

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.140
like taps or a side menu.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.780
So a lot of useful features you'll probably need in your next project.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.240
If you think that something is still unclear I strongly recommend really going back and practicing that

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.360
again trying to build it on your own before we then continue on to the next module where we will have

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.240
a closer look at some of those built in components and how those work
