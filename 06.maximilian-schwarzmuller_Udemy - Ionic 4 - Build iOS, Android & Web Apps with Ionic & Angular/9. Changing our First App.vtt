WEBVTT

00:01.980 --> 00:07.840
In the last lecture we installed the ionic toolset and created our first application this application

00:08.050 --> 00:14.650
which has free tabs where we can see different pages and well it's just the default app angler too or

00:14.770 --> 00:17.870
I ironic to I should say creates for us out of the box.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.200
Please note that I still have the bulk processor running in the terminal window here.

00:22.330 --> 00:28.510
So whenever I change a file in this project folder it will automatically recompile and even reload the

00:28.510 --> 00:30.170
page in the browser.

00:30.220 --> 00:33.770
Now to change something I loaded this application in web store.

00:33.810 --> 00:36.340
The ID I will use for this course.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.040
Now web Strohm is a great idea but it's not free.

00:39.040 --> 00:44.980
There are alternatives though you could use Microsoft which studio code which is also another idea but

00:45.040 --> 00:46.640
this one is freely available.

00:46.780 --> 00:50.120
Or a text editor like sublime or Adam.

00:50.230 --> 00:55.400
Now in this project folder you see a lot of Suppe folders and files were created.

00:55.420 --> 00:58.830
I will come back to what those folders do later in the course.

00:58.840 --> 01:03.010
For now I want to focus on the core folder we work with the source folder.

01:03.010 --> 01:08.830
This is where we create our Eyler to application and where we therefore work 99 percent of the time

01:09.580 --> 01:10.450
in this folder.

01:10.450 --> 01:15.880
You might not instantly recognize saying no to application but that should change if you open the app

01:15.880 --> 01:16.500
folder.

01:16.660 --> 01:23.960
Here is the app component app module and the main RTX file which bootstraps the module and in the end

01:23.960 --> 01:28.590
does this the normal behavior you know with that root component being set up and so on.

01:28.600 --> 01:34.150
Now the content that you see in those files like your app component and especially in the app Marchal

01:34.360 --> 01:38.650
might differ from your default angler to AB and it will come back to you.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.160
Especially this file here.

01:40.160 --> 01:45.060
The module file and explain how this works and how the ionic to help get started.

01:45.060 --> 01:49.180
In the end in the next course section which you will read shortly.

01:49.180 --> 01:53.750
Now I want to focus on something different though I want to change the app now.

01:53.800 --> 01:59.660
Somehow we don't really see the content we see here in the template of our app component.

01:59.710 --> 02:07.130
So that is probably not the place to where it gets changed and indeed it is not the place that I want

02:07.140 --> 02:13.280
it to work with so-called pages and pages are simply the web pages you see here.

02:13.300 --> 02:17.930
So we get three pages which we can see when we click on the tabs.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.740
Therefore the pages folder looks promising.

02:20.740 --> 02:27.930
And indeed if we open that folder you'll see well for subfolder about contact and home which makes sense.

02:27.930 --> 02:35.080
These are free pages we saw and then also a separate page for the tabs so you can kind of think of the

02:35.080 --> 02:41.080
tabs and bottom haven't they having their own page which has then a huge empty space which gets populated

02:41.080 --> 02:44.490
with well the fitting page for the tab.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.620
We clicked on.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.740
So a good place to change something therefore isn't the pages fullers.

02:49.900 --> 02:55.300
And there you will see that a page and the end is just an angler to component with the component decorator

02:55.590 --> 02:58.060
and therefore of course it also has a template.

02:58.150 --> 03:03.940
So if you wanted to change something on one of the pages lets say about page we would go to the about

03:04.000 --> 03:08.640
HVM file and then we could simply enter something you like.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.600
This is the about page.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.020
Now if we save this.

03:14.200 --> 03:19.570
As I explained to you if you have the boot process still running it will automatically recompile and

03:19.570 --> 03:24.550
reload your page and therefore if you now click on About you'll see dishonesty of our page.

03:24.550 --> 03:27.160
Our first little change.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.670
Pretty good but of course not all you can learn about ironic too.

03:31.810 --> 03:37.300
So I'd say let's finish the Getting Started section and dive deeply into ionic to beginning with the

03:37.300 --> 03:38.560
next course section
