00:02.140 --> 00:06.610
So regarding that new project, I will actually continue with the one I have here

00:06.640 --> 00:10.270
but you can of course create a new one with the Ionic start command.

00:10.270 --> 00:15.620
What I'll do here is I'll simply get rid of my recipes folder here,

00:15.790 --> 00:17.110
don't need that anymore

00:17.110 --> 00:23.600
and then I'll generate new pages and of course I have to adjust my routing here and so on.

00:23.620 --> 00:29.680
So let's start with generating new pages and we can do that with the Ionic generate page command.

00:29.990 --> 00:32.060
Now which pages do we need?

00:32.110 --> 00:36.280
We need a bunch of pages obviously, we'll certainly need an auth page

00:36.310 --> 00:37.590
and I'll just name it auth.

00:37.600 --> 00:43.360
That will be our auth screen which we see when we start the app for the first time when we haven't logged

00:43.360 --> 00:44.370
in yet.

00:44.380 --> 00:51.850
So let me run ionic generate page auth here and this will now give us a new auth folder and we'll add

00:51.880 --> 00:55.200
that auth route to our app routing module.

00:55.250 --> 01:01.500
Speaking of that, I can of course already delete that whole recipes routing stuff here. So that's the

01:01.590 --> 01:09.020
auth route, the auth page, we're not done with that of course. We will also have a places area in this

01:09.100 --> 01:14.220
app and you can name it whatever you want but with that, I mean the area where we can view all the places

01:14.220 --> 01:22.050
we can book as well as offer new places and therefore what I want to have here is definitely some places

01:22.050 --> 01:28.880
page which will actually later hold our tabs and inside of that places folder and therefore I'll repeat

01:28.880 --> 01:29.350
the command

01:29.360 --> 01:32.700
but now add a slash and then a sub-folder, a sub-component

01:32.700 --> 01:40.610
I want to create so to say, I want to have let's say a search or a find or whatever you want to call it,

01:40.640 --> 01:43.300
I'll name it search page

01:43.310 --> 01:47.750
and that is basically the page which allows us to search or find new pages.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.870
Well actually we'll not add a search bar,

01:49.940 --> 01:53.820
so let's maybe call it discover,

01:53.840 --> 01:54.950
that sounds good.

01:55.100 --> 02:01.400
So we'll have our discover area here where we can discover places we can book and in order to be able

02:01.400 --> 02:07.430
to discover something, people need to be able to offer places and therefore still in that places feature

02:07.430 --> 02:08.660
area of our app,

02:08.810 --> 02:15.680
I'll add my offers sub-folder and component and page and that will basically the other tab where we can

02:15.680 --> 02:24.050
create a new page and see our offers. Speaking of that, well in our offers area, as I mentioned we have

02:24.050 --> 02:31.930
to be able to create a new offer. So as another sub-folder here in the places/offers area, I'll

02:31.940 --> 02:39.680
add new-offer as a new page which will now be generated inside of places/offers

02:39.710 --> 02:46.280
and here it is, the new offer and that is basically where we will be able to enter the data for a new

02:46.280 --> 02:47.590
place we want to offer.

02:47.600 --> 02:55.010
There we'll also later include the capabilities to interact with the device camera and so on. Offering new

02:55.010 --> 02:55.940
places is nice,

02:55.940 --> 03:04.220
we also want to be able to edit our offerings, so I'll add a edit offer place too next to new offers.

03:04.250 --> 03:09.500
So as a sibling to new offer, we now have the edit offer folder there and that will be our page for

03:09.560 --> 03:11.900
well editing offers.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.850
Now we're getting there,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.430
we're done with the offers for now but in our places, we have that discover area, right?

03:19.430 --> 03:23.510
So we created that discover sub-folder already.

03:23.510 --> 03:27.760
Now that would be the page where we can see all the places we can book.

03:27.890 --> 03:31.550
Now when we tap on one of these places, we want to see the details,

03:31.580 --> 03:39.200
so here I'll add a place-detail component or page nested in my discover folder

03:39.200 --> 03:44.730
and as you can already see, I am basically replicating the structure as we will have it in our URL

03:44.760 --> 03:50.570
you could say, in that folder here too, in that project folder and that is a pattern you commonly

03:50.570 --> 03:59.540
use and see when building Angular projects, no matter with or without Ionic. So that sounds pretty good,

03:59.540 --> 04:03.130
we're able to find places, offer places,

04:03.140 --> 04:04.460
what's missing?

04:04.460 --> 04:06.840
Well we also want to be able to see bookings.

04:06.980 --> 04:13.180
With that, I mean both bookings for places we offered as well as our own bookings. Now for places we offered,

04:13.190 --> 04:19.080
I'll go back to places/offers and in there, next to edit offer and new offer,

04:19.280 --> 04:26.690
I want to have my place bookings component let's say and you can name or let's name it offer bookings

04:26.690 --> 04:32.510
to be in line, offer bookings, you can name this whatever you want of course.

04:32.530 --> 04:38.770
So offer bookings will be a page we can go to from our offers page but we also have the bookings we

04:38.770 --> 04:40.420
made ourselves

04:40.420 --> 04:46.240
and that will now actually be a sibling to places because it's not nested in there, it's not in the same

04:46.240 --> 04:47.560
tab navigation,

04:47.560 --> 04:51.220
instead we'll be able to reach that via our side drawer later.

04:51.580 --> 04:56.360
So here, I'll just add my bookings page which I then want to be able to

04:56.380 --> 05:02.350
load and view and that's it for now. If we need more pages later, we can add them, we already added

05:02.350 --> 05:08.230
a bunch of places. Feel free to pause the video and go through the folder structure and compare it with

05:08.230 --> 05:15.550
the slides I attached to this module where I lay out the project structure, so that you get a feeling

05:15.550 --> 05:22.120
for which folder which page belongs to which item on the slides and once you're done with that, let's continue,

05:22.120 --> 05:28.240
let's update our routing configuration here which is not in the format I want it to be and let's of

05:28.240 --> 05:33.400
course make sure that we also display things like tabs since on.
