00:02.120 --> 00:06.710
So after adding the sign up page and The Last Lecture Let's now at the sign in page.

00:06.830 --> 00:10.190
Now the sign in page is really simple to add.

00:10.400 --> 00:16.930
I will basically copy the content from the sign up HVM else file and added in the template of the signed

00:16.940 --> 00:24.230
in file of design page and that is why I was mentioning that you could of course also tried to combine

00:24.230 --> 00:25.970
it both into one page.

00:25.970 --> 00:30.730
But again I decided to separate it because we will have some tiny differences.

00:30.830 --> 00:34.500
And I really want to make clear that we have two distinct pages here.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.330
So with this I'll leave the menu.

00:37.490 --> 00:40.430
I will change it to sign in here of course.

00:40.730 --> 00:47.780
And then the form is generally all right I'll change this method name to on sign in or change the button

00:47.780 --> 00:54.380
down there to say sign and I'll remove demen length validator you could leave it on the password but

00:54.500 --> 00:59.720
for signing in I don't care about this because I will check if the password is the same as stored on

00:59.720 --> 01:03.250
the server anyways so it doesn't matter if it's too short.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.920
If it's not the same one I'm not getting access any ways.

01:07.190 --> 01:11.970
So with this this form looks all right to me should be usable.

01:12.080 --> 01:17.780
Let's now go to the component here to the components of two types of file get rid of all the unnecessary

01:17.780 --> 01:20.580
boilerplate and that the on sign and method.

01:20.660 --> 01:28.980
Again where I know I'll get an entry form at import at a lower forms and then again log for that value.

01:29.270 --> 01:31.120
So it was super simple I guess.

01:31.220 --> 01:36.620
Let's now try this out and run and or see this in our running application.

01:36.680 --> 01:41.560
If I load the sign in page year add any data.

01:41.570 --> 01:45.210
Of course it won't work because we haven't added any back end logic yet.

01:45.350 --> 01:47.860
Click sign in resubmitting just you.

01:47.960 --> 01:54.680
So with that we added both components we now have everything we need to start working on the actual

01:54.800 --> 02:00.590
Sign-Up logic and on our back and I'll start with all of that in the next lecture.
