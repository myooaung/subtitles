00:01.970 --> 00:06.620
So in the last lecture I challenge you to retrieve the data from the model and show a little preview

00:06.620 --> 00:09.720
of the data in our place component.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.830
Let's now do it together in the emblazed typescript file.

00:13.850 --> 00:16.730
I'm interested in the data we get back from the modal.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.690
We do open the model here in on open map.

00:20.780 --> 00:27.170
So here I want to listen or I want to add you on that dismiss method and add a function which should

00:27.170 --> 00:30.070
get executed once the model gets dismissed.

00:30.200 --> 00:37.490
Here I will receive some data and this data will actually be an object holding my location so I can

00:37.490 --> 00:42.360
simply check if we did get some data because we won't get any if we just click abort and close the mode

00:42.370 --> 00:43.810
without passing data.

00:44.060 --> 00:50.030
But if we did receive data if we do have an object we know that it will hold our location therefore

00:50.030 --> 00:56.270
we can then set the location stored in the at place component dislocation which I said to the Stiefel

00:56.270 --> 00:57.780
location at the beginning.

00:57.950 --> 01:06.110
We can now set it to our real location with data location because again keep in mind in the motile when

01:06.110 --> 01:12.470
clicking to confirm button we pass back an object which has its location property which stores the location

01:12.470 --> 01:13.770
chosen by the user.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.890
And this is exactly what I'm extracting here.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.610
Does location property.

01:17.870 --> 01:21.050
So I'm storing where I'm retrieving my location.

01:21.380 --> 01:28.790
And with that I now want to display a snippet preview of the location which was chosen I could check

01:28.820 --> 01:31.850
if location is set but it's set for right from the beginning.

01:31.850 --> 01:36.410
And maybe you want to show this preview but maybe you don't want to do this.

01:36.440 --> 01:43.190
So here at number property location is said to indicate that the user actually chose a location now.

01:43.190 --> 01:47.610
We're not just using the default location and not set this to fall initially.

01:47.930 --> 01:50.700
Well now we know it wasn't chosen by the user.

01:50.720 --> 01:55.150
So now I can say that location is set to true.

01:55.580 --> 02:03.120
And with this we're now able to switch between the user did something and we're just doing the default.

02:03.170 --> 02:09.200
Now we know wants to use or did indeed choose a location so we can now go back to the place age html

02:09.200 --> 02:15.470
file to the template and output the location here and select the place placeholder and then to get rid

02:15.470 --> 02:20.590
of this paragraph and now instead I'll add the Google Map package.

02:20.590 --> 02:28.220
Again this component and here I want to bind the properties you already know how to bind them deep latitude

02:28.490 --> 02:42.090
to bind to location let d long it's used to bind this to location long and also does some factor I like

02:42.090 --> 02:43.810
16 so I'll stick to this.

02:44.190 --> 02:51.150
And on this map I also want to show a marker on the position to use Riccio's So Google Map marker l

02:51.150 --> 02:56.470
at this component here to and ask for on this component.

02:56.470 --> 03:01.570
I'm going to buy 90 latitude and this will also be bound to location latitude because I want to add

03:01.570 --> 03:07.580
the marker in the center of the map because this is what the user chose right location long itude here.

03:08.370 --> 03:09.930
And with that that's all fine.

03:09.930 --> 03:14.860
Now I also need to implement some logic to only show this row containing this map.

03:15.090 --> 03:22.980
If we actually did select location so I'll add Engy if and use my location is a set property which initially

03:23.060 --> 03:26.840
falls to only shouldest preview if the user actually chose 1.

03:26.850 --> 03:32.510
And if we're not just showing the default which was set up at right at the beginning.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.050
So if Dad were almost there.

03:35.070 --> 03:38.250
However I also have to set the height of this map.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.340
This is something you can easily forget.

03:40.350 --> 03:47.040
So here again we need to add as selector of this component and set the height to stick to 250 pixels.

03:47.070 --> 03:52.990
Of course you can change this to your needs Let's go back to the G-mail file.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.720
We are now displaying the map only if we're well if we chose a location.

03:58.170 --> 04:04.680
And since we have this extra information if the user chose a location I can now go down to my submit

04:04.680 --> 04:08.560
button and right now I'm disabling it if the form is invalid.

04:08.790 --> 04:13.000
However I also want to disable it if no location has been chosen.

04:13.230 --> 04:18.570
So the check will be expanded to check not only if the page was valid but it could also be disabled

04:18.690 --> 04:20.730
if no location was chosen.

04:20.730 --> 04:25.170
So if location is set is false therefore I'm disabling it.

04:25.330 --> 04:31.500
Even if the form isn't valid or if the location was not chosen with all that in place let's save it

04:31.500 --> 04:33.540
and see if this works as expected.

04:33.750 --> 04:37.950
Let's add a new place you're selected on the map you see.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.720
Cf. aboutness disable a lot.

04:39.720 --> 04:44.280
Now let's pick a place now it's enabled and does looks pretty good.

04:44.280 --> 04:51.220
Now the overall at this place pertness does able because I haven't added the title so well what's nearby

04:51.240 --> 04:52.460
there guess.

04:52.590 --> 04:56.940
D g portal Mexican Grill.

04:56.940 --> 05:03.510
Yes there is a typo chipotle and I guess it's tasty.

05:03.550 --> 05:08.740
Now with this added we could submit this place nothing happened Stehr of course notice displays of is

05:08.750 --> 05:14.170
of course not part of this object of the Form object and it does need to be because we're storing it

05:14.170 --> 05:20.980
in this extra location property in our at place types could fault anyways so that we're able to choose

05:20.980 --> 05:28.650
a location from the map and showed us in our form once we did so a huge important step as a next step.

05:28.840 --> 05:36.250
I want to start adding our first real native device feature the feature to get our current location.

05:36.550 --> 05:39.200
Let's have a look at this in the next lecture.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.090
With that we achieved a lot but there is one missing piece.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.880
If we have a look at our app you'll see I now chose some location.

05:46.150 --> 05:51.830
But if I now click on select a map I'm back to the default location.

05:52.050 --> 05:55.800
So I might be centered on the location I chose here.

05:55.980 --> 06:00.240
If I confirmed this it is adjusted to year and it's centering on it.

06:00.240 --> 06:06.640
Here again we can try this one more time so it will center on this but it won't display a marker.

06:06.660 --> 06:11.700
It would be nice to display a marker so that we can get confirmed without having to pick a new one.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.680
Maybe we just wanted to see it on this map here again.

06:14.820 --> 06:20.970
So that's something I want to improve on this app to also show a location in times where we already

06:20.970 --> 06:22.350
chose one before.

06:22.350 --> 06:27.510
So for not opening this for the first time I should say so in order to show our marker.

06:27.510 --> 06:34.710
If you already have one I will start in the place page which is where we opened this map and here is

06:34.710 --> 06:37.290
where I passed some data to the modal.

06:37.290 --> 06:48.110
I will simply not only pay past his location but instead I will also pass is set and pass the value

06:48.110 --> 06:50.110
of location is set.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.080
So let me just put this in the new lines.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.300
It's easier to read so no when opening the modal and not only passing the location I want to center

06:56.300 --> 06:56.990
the map on.

06:57.140 --> 07:01.470
But all of the information if the user did already choose his own location.

07:01.790 --> 07:08.510
Well then with this I can go to the modal and here I basically want to set this marker.

07:08.510 --> 07:14.450
If we already did choose a location because remember in the template offset location I'm checking if

07:14.450 --> 07:17.020
the marker is set to determine if I want to show it.

07:17.330 --> 07:20.100
Well so in order to show it I need to set it.

07:20.330 --> 07:26.490
So here I will simply set this marker equal to this location.

07:26.540 --> 07:29.630
But of course only if the location was set.

07:29.630 --> 07:33.980
So here I will check if this naff parens get is set.

07:33.980 --> 07:37.840
If this is true which is passed on from at place.

07:37.850 --> 07:42.850
So if this is true if the user did choose a location any point of time then I will initialize the marker

07:42.860 --> 07:45.020
to with this change in place.

07:45.020 --> 07:48.120
Let's save this and see if it now works as expected.

07:48.860 --> 07:51.050
Let's go back to our applet at reload.

07:51.350 --> 07:52.460
Let's select that on the map.

07:52.460 --> 07:56.110
We don't see a marker now which is good because we have never chosen one.

07:56.360 --> 08:00.750
Let's not place it here and click confirm we see it here.

08:00.770 --> 08:06.110
Now let's click select on map and now we start with a marker and we can confirm without having to click

08:06.140 --> 08:08.930
anywhere because again we did already choose one.

08:08.930 --> 08:13.110
Why would we need to choose an aberrated location just because we opened the page.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.350
So this is now working as expected.

08:15.350 --> 08:20.060
That is how we can manage select the place how we can do that using a third party package.

08:20.060 --> 08:25.550
But now I want to dive into the real native device features and will start with geolocation which allows

08:25.550 --> 08:30.260
us to automatically pick the location based on our current location.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.720
So let's start with that in the next lecture.
