WEBVTT

00:02.290 --> 00:02.830
Perfect.

00:02.860 --> 00:05.740
We spend quite some time on making that picture work.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.180
And I'd say it works quite well.

00:07.180 --> 00:10.510
Now of course the next step is to integrate this into our form here.

00:10.540 --> 00:15.730
So that we actually do stored it data somewhere and somewhere it should be on our back end.

00:16.030 --> 00:24.160
And then we then also can output the address or that snapshot here in the different parts of our application.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.280
So let's start with the form integration.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.840
For that let's go to the new offer page which is where we have that forum.

00:30.850 --> 00:34.680
We worked on all the time and there where we initialize the form group.

00:34.840 --> 00:41.050
We can add a new control with any name of your choice of course and all name ID location and that will

00:41.050 --> 00:46.860
be a new form control just as we added for text input starting value is null.

00:47.110 --> 00:54.650
And I will add a validator here and that will be the required validator.

00:54.660 --> 00:58.260
So basically as I did it for Arrow controls as well.

00:58.260 --> 01:01.960
The differences is now of course how I set my value here.

01:02.070 --> 01:04.410
I will do that manually.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
Now how could this work.

01:05.640 --> 01:11.940
Let's say on our application picker here I want to have an event that is submitted that could be named

01:11.940 --> 01:14.010
location pick for example.

01:14.010 --> 01:21.240
And when does happened all trigger on location pick method on location picked method here in my new

01:21.240 --> 01:25.560
offer page and there I forward the event data I get.

01:25.560 --> 01:31.080
And there should be some event data because I need to get Dad location object with the coordinates at

01:31.080 --> 01:34.290
the address and that image you are L.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.580
So both is missing the location Pick event and our handler.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.730
Let's start with emitting that event.

01:40.740 --> 01:44.600
And for that we have to go back to the location picker component

01:47.200 --> 01:48.280
in there.

01:48.490 --> 01:56.310
We should add a new property which is named location pick or whatever you named your event.

01:56.330 --> 01:58.060
So hero named location pick.

01:58.100 --> 02:04.190
So that property should all be named location pick and that will be a new event emitter and event emitter

02:04.190 --> 02:06.290
is not imported from protractor.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.530
But from at Angola core.

02:08.770 --> 02:16.610
And whilst we're there we can also already import output because we need to add that output decorator

02:16.600 --> 02:21.930
a year to make this a listenable event which we can listen to from outside.

02:21.950 --> 02:28.910
Now event emitter is a generic type and it will eventually emit our place location data.

02:28.940 --> 02:34.850
So it will emit an object that has the format or the structure of place location.

02:34.850 --> 02:44.130
Now we just have to emit this so if we go down to the place where we set is loading it's ons or in our

02:44.130 --> 02:53.690
subscription there we can now access this Web location pick and emit our picked location object there.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.020
So that's step number one.

02:55.020 --> 02:59.670
And with that let's go back to the new offer page here.

02:59.760 --> 03:08.280
We now need to add that all location picked method so let's add that here and we get some data there.

03:08.470 --> 03:16.060
And the date of course is our place location object because that is what we emit in the location picker.

03:16.060 --> 03:22.780
So let's make sure to add that place location important up there pointing at our location model and

03:22.780 --> 03:24.220
in all location picked.

03:24.220 --> 03:31.520
We now have to update our form to hold that pick location in that location form control here.

03:31.570 --> 03:40.050
This can be done by accessing the form and there we simply choose this patch value and we want to patch

03:40.060 --> 03:45.030
one controls we pass an object and we want to patch the location control.

03:45.040 --> 03:50.350
So if you named dislocation here it has to be location there if you named it different the up there.

03:50.380 --> 03:56.050
You have to name it different down there and the value will be the location argument we're getting here.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.840
So location here is what I pass as a value.

03:59.470 --> 04:06.910
So this foreign patch value is what we call here to update our internal form object to hold that location

04:07.480 --> 04:10.070
and that is already all for now.

04:10.180 --> 04:16.780
The next step is a an on create offer I do of course check my validity which will now automatically

04:16.780 --> 04:22.090
include the location because we do require it and that will only be true if some data is set to that

04:22.270 --> 04:25.050
control which is the case after picking one.

04:25.240 --> 04:31.300
And therefore we should now be able to submit this as soon as a location was picked with that set what

04:31.300 --> 04:37.630
we still have to do is we have to go to our place service and make sure that this data now gets stored

04:37.630 --> 04:39.960
on our server as well.

04:39.970 --> 04:44.550
Now here we have at place and right now we're not expecting a location either.

04:44.650 --> 04:45.540
So that should change.

04:45.550 --> 04:51.940
We should expect our place location data in there and of course for that we need to import place location

04:52.360 --> 04:53.470
at the top.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.670
So let's do that.

04:54.670 --> 05:04.400
Let's import Lay's location from And now let's go to our location model here.

05:04.410 --> 05:10.680
So with place location imported we can expect data of that type here and of course we should include

05:10.710 --> 05:14.690
that in our place number that the place model needs to be updated though.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.600
Because right now it does not expect any location.

05:17.910 --> 05:26.710
So let's add a new public property location which should be of type place location with that attitude

05:26.720 --> 05:34.290
to place model here where we use it let's forward to location we're getting as an argument to add it

05:34.320 --> 05:35.710
to this model.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.930
And of course we broke some other places too.

05:38.070 --> 05:45.870
Like for example here where we get a single place we of course now should use place data location here

05:45.900 --> 05:51.720
as well and that therefore we should update our definition up here.

05:51.730 --> 05:57.490
What we get back from Firebase and we should expect location in there which in turn should be of type

05:57.880 --> 06:07.210
place locations are using our own place location model and here as well we should have rest data.

06:08.350 --> 06:14.500
Key location and update all these places and of course the data we currently stored in firebase doesn't

06:14.500 --> 06:15.410
have that.

06:15.430 --> 06:19.590
So we'll basically have to delete that and start from scratch.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.280
So here for update place

06:24.140 --> 06:28.550
let's use old place location OK.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.210
So now this should work.

06:31.250 --> 06:40.740
Let's now see I have an error in the new offer Page Yeah of course when I add my place I do expect to

06:40.740 --> 06:41.650
get the location.

06:41.700 --> 06:48.020
Maybe I should also forward it then and this can be retrieved from this forum and there from value.

06:48.090 --> 06:55.500
Location is our name off that field that we added When we initialize the forum.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.280
Let's give it a try.

06:56.290 --> 07:07.420
This page reloads and if I now enter test dust is work and I enter price and I enter dates here the

07:07.420 --> 07:14.030
forms would actually not be submitted till end it isn't is it still great out because I haven't picked

07:14.030 --> 07:15.220
a location yet.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.200
So let's pick one and let's maybe pick one in Sydney

07:21.910 --> 07:30.040
so something like a here and now does this sub mutable but press this doesn't look too bad.

07:30.310 --> 07:38.400
Now let's check firebase here to see if that data was saved on firebase correctly so they're under a

07:38.400 --> 07:42.210
database.

07:42.410 --> 07:49.550
We have our offered places and of course the first place has no location a second one also has no location

07:49.550 --> 07:55.380
but third place has a location key and that doesn't look too bad.

07:55.380 --> 07:58.400
That should be the location I picked.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.450
Awesome.

07:59.450 --> 08:05.360
So with that let's now make sure we also use all that location data in the places where we can see our

08:05.480 --> 08:11.600
location like for example here when we view the details here why don't we show our map and the address

08:11.600 --> 08:11.870
there.
