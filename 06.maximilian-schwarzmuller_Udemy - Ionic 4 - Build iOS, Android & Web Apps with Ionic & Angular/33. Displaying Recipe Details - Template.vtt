00:01.950 --> 00:06.870
The next goal is to be able to go to the detail page when we click on one of those items.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.580
And that's again something you can try solving on your own.

00:10.590 --> 00:12.740
We learn all the things you need for this.

00:12.750 --> 00:16.300
You can also decide how the detail page should look for you.

00:16.500 --> 00:22.120
It would make sense to put the title the description the difficulty and then we also need to edit the

00:22.120 --> 00:24.240
recipe delete the recipe.

00:24.470 --> 00:31.410
And well depending on how you Lotus also close to modal if you want to present it as a model or whatever

00:31.500 --> 00:35.160
your goal is now whatever your goal is.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.040
I will show you my solution in a couple of seconds.

00:40.220 --> 00:42.160
So were you successful.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.000
Let's see one possible approach.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.340
I'll go to the recipe H.T. mail file to this template.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.010
And here I will.

00:49.010 --> 00:51.760
First of all adjust my header.

00:51.770 --> 00:57.690
My title to say recipe and here I think it would make sense to not only say recipe but I'll put the

00:57.690 --> 01:03.140
title of the recipe so I will assume that we will have a recipe property so we don't have it yet but

01:03.140 --> 01:08.960
we will add it which then of course also has a title since the Sabella property off a recipe.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.270
And then we can outpoured all the details here in the content.

01:13.310 --> 01:15.290
I won't use D-grade for this.

01:15.290 --> 01:18.050
Of course you can also use a list or whatever you like.

01:18.260 --> 01:24.860
And in this grid I want to have a row with a column where I want to output the recipe title again.

01:24.860 --> 01:28.940
You don't need to do this since it is in the title of the whole document in the nav bar.

01:28.940 --> 01:32.270
But I like to have it clearly visible in the page body too.

01:32.810 --> 01:42.350
And below this I will add a div where I output the recipe difficulty and I will change the style of

01:42.350 --> 01:43.790
this in a second.

01:44.520 --> 01:52.340
Know Below this I want to add another row where will output the description in a paragraph of course.

01:52.350 --> 01:57.440
So here on the recipe again this property doesn't exist yet but it will do so soon.

01:57.720 --> 02:04.650
I will output the description of that recipe and then I will actually add a list of ingredients.

02:04.830 --> 02:11.100
So I will add another eye and roll with I and color them and in their iron list really nesting those

02:11.100 --> 02:11.870
elements.

02:11.970 --> 02:14.040
And in this I am placed.

02:14.100 --> 02:19.470
I now want to have iron items for all the ingredients so they are read only they won't be clickable

02:19.470 --> 02:20.580
or editable.

02:20.610 --> 02:22.500
I just want to display them.

02:22.770 --> 02:29.820
So here I will loop through my ingredients let's store them in a variable named ingredient maybe of

02:29.820 --> 02:35.240
my recipe ingredients property which is an array of ingredients if you recall this.

02:35.490 --> 02:43.080
And then here are simply output ingredient name ingredient of course referring to the individual ingredient

02:43.090 --> 02:44.070
of the array.

02:44.250 --> 02:49.290
And again our ingredient model defines that each ingredient has a name property.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.140
So I can access this here.

02:51.270 --> 02:56.730
So if I'm outputting the ingredients and below this role I will then add another row where I want to

02:56.730 --> 03:01.050
have a button which allows me to add the ingredients to the shopping list.

03:01.170 --> 03:07.230
So I have a number I'm Cullin here and in this call and let's add a button which of course receives

03:07.230 --> 03:09.110
the iron button directive.

03:09.240 --> 03:14.700
And then I want to have this clear style with no borders no background of course you may change this

03:14.790 --> 03:20.260
and click Lisner where we say on add ingredients because this is what this button should do.

03:20.760 --> 03:28.960
And as a caption I will say add ingredients to shopping list of course you may choose another text but

03:28.990 --> 03:33.420
that just restyle this to make it easier to read that I've got this button.

03:33.420 --> 03:40.790
However I only want to show this whole row with that button if and therefore I use NGF.

03:41.070 --> 03:45.470
If we actually do have any ingredients Otherwise there is no need to show this button because there

03:45.470 --> 03:46.310
is nothing to add.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.350
Right.

03:47.370 --> 03:55.310
Therefore I will check if recipe ingredients length is greater than zero if it is not greater than zero.

03:55.350 --> 04:01.560
That means we don't have any ingredients so no need to show does add ingredients to shopping list button.

04:02.010 --> 04:07.980
Well and then I will add another row and here will actually add two columns.

04:07.980 --> 04:15.810
The first column will hold a button with I and bottom of course and here will use the outline style

04:16.320 --> 04:20.310
which will be responsible for editing the recipe.

04:20.310 --> 04:29.440
So you're able to call on edit recipe and also give us a caption of added recipe and then I'll add another

04:29.550 --> 04:32.750
column where I also add a button.

04:33.180 --> 04:40.890
Oh also let me restructure this and at deep block elements to the button block directive.

04:40.890 --> 04:44.310
And on the second button here I will do pretty much the same.

04:44.340 --> 04:50.520
So all the restructure does already give it this outline look make it a block button.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.390
But desperateness then responsible for deleting the recipe.

04:54.390 --> 05:01.410
So here on the lead recipe should be called and it will say delete recipe here.

05:01.680 --> 05:08.130
And I think it makes sense to give this color danger because it is dangerous to click there.

05:08.130 --> 05:11.420
It will actually remove the recipe right.

05:11.460 --> 05:12.960
So these are the two buttons.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.650
This is everything I need here.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.640
Next I want to style this death here.

05:17.670 --> 05:24.270
Give it a nice little custom style before I then continue hooking this up and loading the recipe in

05:24.270 --> 05:25.260
the first place.
