WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.790
And The Last Lecture we finished our ecard.

00:04.820 --> 00:10.450
Now if you have a look at our blueprint you may ignore the yellow styling here.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.030
I'll come back to this later.

00:12.050 --> 00:18.950
You see that once I click on favorite here we actually should display an alert or we don't have to but

00:18.950 --> 00:25.550
it's a nice exercise to learn about this ionic to feature and it prevents Jews from accidentally clicking

00:25.550 --> 00:28.580
on favorite and favorite quotes which he doesn't like.

00:28.580 --> 00:29.130
Right.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.090
So how do we add such an alert.

00:32.330 --> 00:35.910
Let's dive into this and this lecture on the app.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.750
We finished the template.

00:37.910 --> 00:42.000
Now it's time to handle the case that we actually clicked his favorite button.

00:42.230 --> 00:48.280
We already have to click Lisner here and we execute on at two favorite and we passed a quote as an argument.

00:48.440 --> 00:56.640
So if the code starts TS file I can add on a favorite we receive a quote and I'll name it selected quote

00:56.660 --> 01:02.810
to avoid any naming confusion selective quote which of course is of type quote our interface we're importing

01:02.810 --> 01:07.520
here at the top and Indee on add two favorite method.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.110
I now want to show such an alert as always.

01:11.240 --> 01:18.050
You can learn more about this in your physical component documentation here under alerts and you can

01:18.050 --> 01:22.240
read frood had to read through all kinds of alerts you can create.

01:22.340 --> 01:28.040
And as always you will learn more about this this course where we reduce this feature in a couple of

01:28.040 --> 01:28.770
apps.

01:29.040 --> 01:35.240
So let me start implementing my basic alert here to implement an alert.

01:35.270 --> 01:40.880
We first need to inject something we need to inject the alert controller.

01:41.060 --> 01:48.200
So all binded to appropriately named alert controller like this and this allows me to inject the other

01:48.260 --> 01:49.030
controller.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.710
You also need to add the import switches.

01:51.770 --> 01:55.170
Alert controller from ionic angular.

01:55.400 --> 02:03.080
So make sure to add this import here at the top and then with that and check it in the on two favorite

02:03.110 --> 02:12.750
Meffert I can simply say this alert controller create and this allows me to create a new alert.

02:12.820 --> 02:18.520
Now this alert has to be stored in some variable or constant so that we can actually use it.

02:18.520 --> 02:25.330
I'll do that here assign it to this alert constant and to create Meffert takes of javascript object

02:25.360 --> 02:26.150
as an argument.

02:26.170 --> 02:29.050
And in his Optik we're able to configure this alert.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.560
Now as mentioned you can dive into the official docs to learn about all the possibilities though.

02:33.610 --> 02:38.230
I'm going to show them throughout the course to the following properties are the ones you're probably

02:38.230 --> 02:39.130
going to use most.

02:39.160 --> 02:46.990
Though we need a title for the alert so we can say add code because the action we're actually doing

02:47.860 --> 02:55.290
we can add a subtitle to our alert and say Are you sure to kind of indicate why we're showing this alert.

02:55.390 --> 02:58.590
And of course you're free to choose any text you want there.

02:58.810 --> 03:05.710
After the subtitle we can add a message and here we could say Are you sure you want

03:08.370 --> 03:10.610
to add the quote.

03:11.010 --> 03:14.820
And of course this is kind of double checking here with all the titles and subtitles.

03:14.820 --> 03:23.730
And as a side note subtitle has is capital-T so make sure to take care about this subtitle with capital-T

03:24.120 --> 03:29.460
so that might be overcoached you can leave out the subtitle for example you could place that message

03:29.460 --> 03:31.710
in a subtitle and then leave out the message.

03:31.770 --> 03:37.720
You don't have to use the subtitle and massive propertied every You can use one of them or none of them.

03:37.740 --> 03:38.570
You don't need it.

03:38.790 --> 03:40.610
And with that we get a basic alert.

03:40.610 --> 03:45.780
Now I'm going to change this soon I want to show you how it looks like this though and we can display

03:45.780 --> 03:51.120
the alert by using our treated alert and then calling present like this.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.750
This will Precentor alert to the user.

03:53.910 --> 03:57.450
And let's see how it actually looks in action.

03:57.450 --> 04:04.400
If we go to our application here and we click on favorite YOU SEE THE here.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.420
You don't see any button though we can dismiss it by clicking anywhere else but it would certainly be

04:09.420 --> 04:12.420
better to have at least on one button wouldn't it.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.470
So let's add a button.

04:14.710 --> 04:19.640
You can add a basic button by adding the buttons property to that.

04:19.640 --> 04:24.760
Alert object we're creating here and this is an array of buttons you can have multiple buttons and you

04:24.760 --> 04:28.780
can simply say OK this will add a button with the caption OK.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.760
And this button will automatically dismissed the alert.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.690
So let's see this in action.

04:34.990 --> 04:38.230
Once our app reloads here click there click a favorite.

04:38.230 --> 04:40.420
Now you see the OK button here.

04:40.510 --> 04:41.620
So better.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.580
But we certainly need a choice in our case.

04:43.580 --> 04:47.140
You're right we're questioned if we want to add the code.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.280
So be nice if you could say more than just.

04:49.350 --> 04:52.350
OK maybe we all want to say no right.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.450
That's why you can create more complex buttons.

04:55.510 --> 04:58.040
You don't have to pass a string in disarray.

04:58.270 --> 05:03.490
You can also pass whole javascript object and set such a button object.

05:03.490 --> 05:09.510
Remember where the buttons are array now takes a text which has the text displayed on the button where

05:09.580 --> 05:12.120
we can say yes go ahead.

05:12.550 --> 05:15.210
And we also can define a handler.

05:15.280 --> 05:20.890
Which means well what does which cloture that get executed if the spotless clicked.

05:21.070 --> 05:25.700
And here you simply add or pass a function as a value.

05:25.720 --> 05:30.730
So this is your 6 arrow function which gets executed when you click this button and I'm going to say

05:30.730 --> 05:32.150
console log.

05:32.410 --> 05:39.010
OK here sort of can see that this button was depressed anti-Second badness and never javascript object.

05:39.010 --> 05:43.490
Here I want to have a text of no change.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.500
Changed my mind like this.

05:46.750 --> 05:50.660
And then I want to give does a handler of.

05:50.920 --> 05:59.640
Well this function here where I say can sort of see that this button was pressed and important in general.

05:59.680 --> 06:06.340
All those property names titles subtable message buttons and insert the buttons text handler of course

06:06.340 --> 06:07.700
are reserved to.

06:07.750 --> 06:11.600
Kind of ironic to expect exactly those property names.

06:11.770 --> 06:16.650
That's why I also pointed to the documentation where you can read about all support property names.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.630
You can't kind of come up with your own names.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.490
How would I onic to know what to do with them right.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.600
So this let's save this.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.090
And now we should see two buttons at least.

06:27.100 --> 06:33.010
Let's see this in the running application once it rebuilds we see yes go ahead.

06:33.010 --> 06:35.110
No I changed my mind.

06:35.110 --> 06:38.830
Now you can actually also assign roles to buttons.

06:38.830 --> 06:44.790
You do this by adding a roll here and a roll is a string cancel for example.

06:44.890 --> 06:50.890
Again if you want to learn more about this dive into the official documentation and here you can learn

06:50.890 --> 06:54.560
more about which properties are supported.

06:54.670 --> 07:02.170
You can even create radio buttons inside of an alert and how you can well use those buttons and how

07:02.170 --> 07:03.770
you can use those alerts.

07:03.790 --> 07:10.030
Also have a look at the API docs which are a bit more specific about all supported options on alerts.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.970
So it is the place to really dive deeper into this.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.680
What role does is it simply tells you or tells Ionescu that this button is there.

07:20.710 --> 07:23.640
You dismissed the alert and to not do anything else.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.640
And you could even have no roll or the cancel role.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.880
This simply means well dismiss it.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.230
That's why the over button does have no role.

07:32.230 --> 07:36.590
Because here we actually want to do more than just dismiss it.

07:36.670 --> 07:41.200
So enough the talking let's see it in action again with this change in place.

07:41.530 --> 07:47.050
If I now click on No I changed my mind you'll still see me execute cancelled in the background.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.610
Now I want to know is that this is actually the cancel button.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.830
But of course you could also leave this out.

07:53.830 --> 07:56.560
You don't have to specify the role here.

07:56.570 --> 07:59.370
Why would you add to roll then.

07:59.500 --> 08:06.760
Well if you add to cancelable to the Spartan it simply tells you that it will always execute this handler

08:06.820 --> 08:09.640
when ever this oller just dismissed.

08:09.640 --> 08:13.760
So not just if you click that button which would have executed the handler before anyways.

08:13.870 --> 08:18.610
But also if you clicked the backdrop as you can see see it added canceled here.

08:18.670 --> 08:21.770
So this is what role does it say on to.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.730
If de-lurked is dismissed execute as handler.

08:24.730 --> 08:28.240
If you don't have role the handler will only get executed if you hit the button.

08:28.300 --> 08:35.860
But not if you tap the backed background or the backdrop which kind of overlays your background.

08:35.860 --> 08:37.450
So does it still hurt.

08:37.450 --> 08:42.820
This is how you can display the alert how you can change the text to get a handle in place now.

08:42.850 --> 08:43.290
Indeed.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.520
Yes go ahead.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.920
Handler here.

08:45.940 --> 08:52.950
We obviously somehow one to store our code or market as favorite.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.720
Now how do we do this.

08:54.730 --> 08:57.220
It is of course related to state management.

08:57.250 --> 09:03.460
We somehow need someplace in our app to manage the state of our quotes to determine if a quote is a

09:03.460 --> 09:04.850
favorite or not.
