00:02.100 --> 00:05.430
To add this element, we need to do a couple of things.

00:05.490 --> 00:10.110
First of all, we need to register whenever the user clicks this button and

00:10.140 --> 00:11.990
for this, we need to add a click listener.

00:12.110 --> 00:15.060
Now Angular gives us a convenient way of doing that,

00:15.090 --> 00:17.820
it has a special data binding syntax,

00:17.820 --> 00:23.380
we saw property binding with square brackets, string interpolation with double curly braces.

00:23.430 --> 00:31.650
We can use single parentheses here, normal parentheses and then name the event in between them, like click

00:31.770 --> 00:36.980
which is a native event available in HTML in the browser,

00:37.020 --> 00:42.810
there also is something like mousedown, mouseenter and so on but we need click here and then on the right

00:42.810 --> 00:47.480
side between quotation marks, you write the code that should run

00:47.490 --> 00:50.240
when this happens or when this click event occurs

00:50.340 --> 00:56.990
but here you can only write very simple code, very short one line expressions. To write more complex code,

00:57.000 --> 01:03.750
you typically point at a method of your component that should execute when this click occurs and typically

01:03.750 --> 01:11.230
you name this method on and then some meaningful name, like onCreateUser or onCreatePerson.

01:11.250 --> 01:17.190
You can add parentheses here and now let's copy that name and add it in our Typescript code,

01:17.220 --> 01:20.880
so in the class body. Here we can add this,

01:20.920 --> 01:26.400
this is how we add a method in Typescript, we simply add the name,

01:26.700 --> 01:32.580
parentheses and then curly braces and in between, we write the code that should run when this method

01:32.610 --> 01:40.440
executes. Now to start simple, we can console log created a person here, though we're not really doing that

01:40.440 --> 01:49.530
right now but we can log it at least and if we do that, then you will see that once we go back and I

01:49.530 --> 01:56.220
open the console in my developer tools in the browser, if I click the create button, you see created a

01:56.220 --> 01:57.180
person.

01:57.240 --> 01:57.990
So this works,

01:57.990 --> 02:00.810
we hooked up our event handler.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.970
Now that's of course a nice first step but that's not all we want to do, right?

02:05.970 --> 02:09.240
We also want to get the input of the user,

02:09.240 --> 02:10.950
now how can we get that?
