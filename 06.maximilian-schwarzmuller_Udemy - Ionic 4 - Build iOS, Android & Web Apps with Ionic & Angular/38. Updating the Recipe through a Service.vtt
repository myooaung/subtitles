00:01.980 --> 00:05.880
Viewing our recipes and editing them in theory works fine.

00:05.940 --> 00:07.860
But we can save our changes.

00:07.890 --> 00:13.550
It will instead create a new recipe because we haven't changed or adjusted the on submit method yet.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.870
However adjusting it is super easy.

00:16.020 --> 00:17.390
Let's do this now.

00:17.620 --> 00:20.220
In the edit recipe typescript file.

00:20.220 --> 00:28.410
So this component does page here in on submit we somehow also need to check which mode we're using to

00:28.830 --> 00:35.220
D to decide if we want to call add recipe or update recipe in our service.

00:35.220 --> 00:44.130
So here I will simply check if the mode equals added and if it is the edit mode then I want to call

00:44.130 --> 00:51.120
my recipe service update recipe method and we do have the index of the recipes stored in this index

00:51.120 --> 00:54.650
property we're retrieving it here an entry on it.

00:54.810 --> 01:03.930
So therefore I can pass this to this update method the index and there after I can simply pass those

01:03.930 --> 01:05.340
values here.

01:05.760 --> 01:14.510
So value title value description value difficulty and my ingredients array.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.290
So that's all the same.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.390
As for the new mode.

01:18.390 --> 01:24.010
But now all the passing on the index and calling a different method.

01:24.330 --> 01:27.780
And I also added the else block for the average case.

01:27.810 --> 01:31.050
The new recipe case and that's all.

01:31.170 --> 01:33.250
With that that should really work fine.

01:33.270 --> 01:39.060
And we should now be able to successfully edit our recipes instead of adding them Yulee over and over

01:39.060 --> 01:39.800
again.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.750
So let's play around with that a bit.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.580
Now back to the application.

01:45.690 --> 01:51.140
I'll add a schnitzel which is very tasty to mix things up.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.910
Click on easy and add a new ingredient.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.400
The french fries.

01:56.410 --> 02:01.750
Let's add it here and let's add the meat to like this.

02:01.750 --> 02:09.360
And then I will add another new ingredient does spaghetti You're which are super tasty as we learned

02:09.360 --> 02:16.200
before which are extremely hard to make and where we only need spaghetti.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.800
Now let's add this to.

02:18.030 --> 02:24.960
Now I want to add to schnitzels Let's go there let's edit the recipe and I will clear my ingredients

02:25.050 --> 02:25.870
and click on edit.

02:25.870 --> 02:31.150
Now let's beautician It's like added edited ingredients are gone.

02:31.320 --> 02:40.450
Let's change it to medium and click on Add ingredient meat and added this well.

02:40.470 --> 02:41.910
This looks pretty good to me.

02:41.910 --> 02:43.020
Here is meat.

02:43.230 --> 02:47.830
Now this looks really how it should work working correctly.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.190
Always taking the adjustments we make.

02:50.190 --> 02:56.500
So this is our recipe our added recipe page working as it should.

02:56.580 --> 03:03.720
Now allowing us to believe create new recipes or editing existing ones missing pieces of course are

03:03.870 --> 03:09.230
to make these add ingredients a shopping list but no work and just delete recipe button.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.790
That should all the do something when we click it.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.070
So let's work on this in the next lectures.
