00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.150
understanding of Google Analytics and also on other practical steps to use it as a powerful tool to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.490
grow a business.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.690
By the end of this training you specifically know why you should be using Google Analytics how Google

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.500
to use how to set up Google Analytics goals how to navigate Google Analytics and use the main tools

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.340
for analyze key reports set up dashboards track marketing campaigns and link analytics with
7

8
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.610
Google ads which was formerly known as Google Adword.
8

9
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.240
So we've got a ton of great stuff to get through.
9

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.750
Let's dive straight into it.
10

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.810
So why should you be using Google Analytics.
11

12
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.670
Well if you are a marketer business owner or entrepreneur then Google Analytics is probably the most
12

13
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.740
important too.
13

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.080
You can learn how to use and that is because successful businesses are not built on guesswork.
14

15
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.990
They thrive on your ability to make data driven decisions.
15

16
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.770
And Google Analytics really gives you the metrics to see what's working and what's not working so that
16

17
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380
you can do more watts work.
17

18
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.610
And with that analytics in place you're really flying blind.
18

19
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.320
And the famous management consultant Peter Drucker said it best.
19

20
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.600
He said if you can't measure is you can't improve it.
20

21
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.790
I think that really just sums up the importance of Google Analytics to business.
21

22
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.700
Google Analytics is also the industry standard for web analytics and it's really a requirement to apply
22

23
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.260
for any digital marketing or advertising position.
23

24
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.110
So that really sums up the benefits of good Google Analytics for business and also for a career in digital
24

25
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.970
marketing advertising So how does Google Analytics actually work.
25

26
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.840
Well to collect data a small piece of tracking code is added to each page on a website and the tracking
26

27
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.830
code will collect anonymous information about how a visitor interacts with the site.
27

28
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.540
For example it will know where else the page is visited.
28

29
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.070
And with this information Google Analytics can calculate which pages are most popular.
29

30
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.530
We're determine if users reach the purchase confirmation page and thus record that a purchase was made.
30

31
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.810
Now Google Analytics will also collect information like the language that the browser was set to that
31

32
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.780
type of browsers such as chrome or Safari the device operating system located age and gender of the
32

33
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.490
user and it can even collect the traffic source which brought the user to the site in the first place.
33

34
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.150
And this might be the search engine an advertisement that clicked on or an e-mail marketing campaign
34

35
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.270
a google on X uses a browser cookie which is a small piece of text that they store in your browser to
35

36
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.780
generate a brand name I.D. to distinguish between new and returning visitors and really to tie all the
36

37
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.350
activity of a visitor up into one single visit.
37

38
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.180
And each period of activity is called the session.
38

39
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.710
And Google Analytics ends a session by default after 30 minutes of inactivity or when the user closes
39

40
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.430
the browser window.
40

41
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.750
And finally all of this information is sent to Google on links and populated to use reports for you.
41

42
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.540
Let's go through the steps there to set up Google Analytics.
42

43
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.330
And it's a fairly simple process.
43

44
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.510
The first step is to create or sign into your Google Analytics account and to that just go to Google
44

45
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.860
dot com forward slash analytics.
45

46
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.510
Second step then is to set up a property and a property represents your Web site Arap and it's the collection
46

47
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.710
points in the legs for your data.
47

48
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.000
So you just need to fill out the property name and some information that matters.
48

49
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.940
Third step then is to add the tracking code to your Web site.
49

50
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.500
And this is how you send information from your web site back to Google Analytics.
50

51
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.210
So you need to go to the admin section and then come up and get the tracking code which is here and
51

52
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.030
copy and paste this tracking code onto each page that you want to track after the opening had tag.
52

53
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.580
So you'll need to edit the code of your web site and that could be a pretty scary thing to do if you've
53

54
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.870
never coded before.
54

55
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.230
But the great news is that a lot of platforms like Wordpress or Shopify who just allowed you to copy
55

56
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.440
and paste this tracking code into one little section on you will be tracking google analytics across
56

57
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.040
all the pages of your web site.
57

58
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.860
The final step then to set up is just to verify that the tracking code is working and to do that and
58

59
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.910
you can open up your Web site in a separate tab.
59

60
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.290
Google Analytics open in another tab and you want to come into the real time reports and just look that
60

61
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.270
your visit is being registered.
61

62
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.790
So if it's working you'll see one visit there and that's because you have your own site open in another
62

63
00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.060
tab that's go through the steps there to create additional reporting views on a reporting view is the
63

64
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.490
level in a non-Linux a case where you can access reports and analysis tools.
64

65
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.730
And this is what the structure looks like at the top you've got your accounts inside your accounts you've
65

66
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.100
got your property and you can out of the 50 properties to each You can't.
66

67
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.290
And then inside your property you have your view where your reporting views.
67

68
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.150
And this is just a defined review of your data and you can out 25 views to property.
68

69
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.960
So why would you want to create these additional reporting views.
69

70
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.940
Well when you add your property to an account analytics creates a reporting view for that proper property
70

71
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.090
automatically and it's best practice to leave this original view unchanged.
71

72
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.850
So you always have a backup of your raw data.
72

73
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.450
So the main reason you want to create another view is that you can leave that original view untouched
73

74
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.660
and you always back of your data.
74

75
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.450
But there are other reasons to create fuse and apply filters to them and really to see specific subsets
75

76
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.060
of data and you want to do this for a couple of reasons.
76

77
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.490
One is for convenience if you consistently need to look at a particular subset of the data.
77

78
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.940
For example just visits from the U.S. and it's much easier to have a view that's dedicated to that data.
78

79
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.640
So you would create a view and then filter to include only visits from the U.S. and that can be very
79

80
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.470
convenient for you or for a team that is based there.
80

81
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.570
You can also create additional views for data security reasons and you might want to give the editorial
81

82
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.750
team access to the analytics reports for the company blog but you want to restrict access to sensitive
82

83
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.780
data like e-commerce data.
83

84
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.700
So we created additional view and then filter out the e-commerce data.
84

85
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.360
You might also want to create an additional view for data accuracy reasons and this is probably the
85

86
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.780
main reason that people create additional views so you can filter I dated like spam traffic and internal
86

87
00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:00.520
traffic and really have more accurate reports and only record the visits of your actual customers and
87

88
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.570
not information like your own visits or spam traffic visits.
88

89
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.790
So Google Analytics recommends you set up at least three views.
89

90
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:16.340
The raw data view the test for you in the master view and the raw data view this is really your original
90

91
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.260
view and it should be left unfiltered and untouched.
91

92
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.200
And in this way you can always go back to all the data that has been collected if you need and you're
92

93
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.810
not risking anything getting lost.
93

94
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.090
Now the second view is your test view and this is the place for testing new filters to see how your
94

95
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.660
traffic gets affected before you add them to your main view.
95

96
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.660
And by testing first you can make sure you are not filtering any visitors that you write otherwise would
96

97
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.100
expect to show up.
97

98
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.290
And this really leaves you more reliable data.
98

99
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.330
And finally you have your master view and this is your main view on this one.
99

100
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:57.580
You should use to read your day to day today and you can add your already tested filters here.
100

101
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.370
So how do you actually create additional views.
101

102
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.940
Well it's very simple.
102

103
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.510
You just want to go to the admin section once again going to the top right hand corner and click Create
103

104
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:13.880
view and then you want to add the view name and time zone so you can just fill in some details there.
104

105
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.480
And then click Create view.
105

106
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:23.210
Now a couple of limits and caveats is you should be aware of the default unfiltered view created by
106

107
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.340
Google Analytics.
107

108
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.730
When you set up your account will be called all web site data.
108

109
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:34.670
So you might want to rename that to be your raw data view and to set up those other views to match the
109

110
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.340
names that Google recommends.
110

111
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.300
Also want a new view is created on the Web site data from the data view was created will be included.
111

112
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.870
So that's why it's really best practice to set up these three views recommended by Google.
112

113
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:56.300
As soon as you set up your at all also just finally it's good to know that if you delete a view you've
113

114
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.550
only 35 days to restore it.
114

115
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.180
So there is a limit on that as well.
115

116
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:06.710
So those are the steps to add additional reporting views to Google Analytics and the reasons that you
116

117
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.220
would really want to do that.
117

118
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.720
Let's go through the steps to add filters to the additional views that you have created and filters
118

119
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:21.530
to include exclude or modify the data that you collect in a view on some of the most common filters
119

120
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.300
that you'll see use are.
120

121
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:29.170
For example the filter to exclude internal traffic and you don't really want to skew your data with
121

122
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:35.150
the internal traffic and that's visits from say you personally or people in your office so you can create
122

123
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:41.060
a filter that excludes that traffic and you can identify that traffic with your own IP address or maybe
123

124
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.040
an IP address range for your office.
124

125
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.720
You can also filter domain referrals.
125

126
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.620
And this is great to reduce spam traffic from your analytics data.
126

127
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.820
So you just need to create a filter and then input these selected domains that are sending spam traffic
127

128
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.120
and filter those out.
128

129
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.260
You can also filter on geography and this is maybe one of the reasons food for convenience.
129

130
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:12.580
You can consolidate countries into sales regions such as a pack of meat or North America.
130

131
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.960
Google Analytics won't have done this by default.
131

132
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.400
They just show countries.
132

133
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.320
So in this way you can track data from a region that's spread across multiple countries and you could
133

134
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:28.610
just see say the North American data consolidated into region and you just create a view and really
134

135
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.090
filter to that data.
135

136
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:36.990
There are also search and replace filters which can be very useful to replace codes or long or else
136

137
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.690
with simpler more intuitive versions.
137

138
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:45.090
So for example you could replace a big product ID like one two three four five six with the product
138

139
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.750
name.
139

140
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.970
And therefore when you look at your Google Analytics reports it's a lot more intuitive and easier for
140

141
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.160
you to read.
141

142
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.540
So how do you set up filters.
142

143
00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:00.060
Well firstly just go to the admin section once again and then come up and click on filters create a
143

144
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.440
new filter and just know that you will need added access to add filters to view.
144

145
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.870
So if you're looking at the Google Analytics demo Cain't you won't see this option because you just
145

146
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.570
have read and analyze access.
146

147
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:20.100
Step two then is to define the filter and the filter name and select the filter type that you want and
147

148
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.780
then specify the information that you want to include or exclude.
148

149
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:30.240
So in this example here I've just said that I want to really filter my internal traffic and I put in
149

150
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.260
my IP address and in that way any visits from this device won't appear in my Google Analytics reports
150

151
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:43.050
and I'll just be seeing the visits from my actual potential customers.
151

152
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:49.770
Now couple of limits and caveats so you should be aware of about filters that they require up to 24
152

153
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.490
hours before they are applied to your data and filter order also does matter.
153

154
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:59.170
So Google Analytics filters are applied in the order in which they're set up in your view.
154

155
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:04.950
And if there's a chance that one filter influences the other you can assign the filter order and you
155

156
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:10.440
see the button to the next to the area where you've set up your filters you can just move them around
156

157
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.780
and change the filter order.
157

158
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.830
And the important thing to know about filters is that they are destructive.
158

159
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:24.990
So if a filter excludes data from a view that data can never be recovered again and therefore does to
159

160
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.580
reiterate.
160

161
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:31.650
That's why you should always maintain an unfiltered view of your data so you can have access to the
161

162
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:38.490
full data set and you can always make a copy of that original unfiltered view and start again and apply
162

163
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.380
filters to it if you need to.
163

164
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.640
So also filters cannot be applied retrospectively.
164

165
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.670
So one state has been processed in the in the report that cannot be filtered out.
165

166
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.810
And that's one of the reasons that you want to set these filters up straight away.
166

167
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.610
Once you set up your Google Analytics accounts.
167

168
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.800
So those are the steps to set up filters.
168

169
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:06.090
Some example filters and some caveats and limits that you should be aware of before setting them up.
169

170
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.710
Let's go through now how it set up Google Analytics goals and goes measure how well your site or app
170

171
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.340
fulfills your target objectives.
171

172
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:20.380
And really this is a key part of setting up google analytics because goals enable you to measure how
172

173
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:27.070
often users complete an activity called a conversion that contributes to the success of your business
173

174
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.050
and you're not just looking at numbers of page views or visitors in your reports.
174

175
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:38.200
So by setting up goals you're putting a whole new lens on the data in your Google Analytics reports
175

176
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:46.900
and really seeing that what are the traffic sources or users subsets or any devices that are delivering
176

177
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.500
the conversions not just the page views of visitors.
177

178
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.650
So also by setting up goals you can see data in your goal reports and any other report that provide
178

179
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:02.020
data and goals and goal conversions you can identify the traffic source that delivers the most conversions
179

180
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.050
not just visitors you can identify the subset of users.
180

181
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:11.170
As I said you can track the exact pathways even the users take before completing goals so what are the
181

182
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.910
three pages that they visited before they converted.
182

183
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:19.130
And in that way you can really understand what influences their decision to convert.
183

184
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.000
You can also track the number of completions for an individual marketing campaign.
184

185
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.610
So really track not just how many web site visitors that marketing campaigns deliver but how many of
185

186
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:35.290
those resulted in a conversion something that was important to our business.
186

187
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.270
So let's get into the examples to make this really clear.
187

188
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.930
A newsletter sign up complete an online payments and completion of a game level contact information
188

189
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:51.740
form submitted free trial account creation white paper ebook downloaded point and created.
189

190
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.820
These are all examples of goals that you would want to try.
190

191
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:02.040
Because they really do help grow your business much more than just visitors to the Web site.
191

192
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.250
So how do you set up goals.
192

193
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.920
First you just need to go to the admin section once again click on the code section and add a new goal
193

194
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.270
and just send out once again you will need added access to create goals.
194

195
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.980
So you might see the option to add a new goal in the demo account.
195

196
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.150
Step two then is to complete the goal.
196

197
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.380
The strict description so enter the gold name and choose the gold type for example.
197

198
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.720
Newsletter sign up.
198

199
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:31.120
So in this example here I'm just setting up a goal to track how many newsletter sign ups I've got.
199

200
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:37.720
I'm picking the destination goals really at measuring how many people arrive at a certain destination
200

201
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.580
on my site like a thank you page and there are other types of goals like adjuration.
201

202
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:48.910
If they've been inside for five minutes pages per session events and smart goals and really for Google
202

203
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:55.870
Analytics the destination and event goals and the main goal types that you'll be setting up now then
203

204
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:01.750
you want to enter the goal details a step three song and enter the moral of the page that is shown when
204

205
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.080
a user converts or completes the conversion process.
205

206
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.090
In this case for my e-mail newsletter sign up when they pop in their email.
206

207
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.080
The next page they see is the thankyou page and in that way I know that every person who lands on the
207

208
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.270
thank you page must have signed up to the email address or email newsletter and that's how we really
208

209
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.350
can't have any sun.
209

210
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:25.050
I've got now at the bottom even click verify which I've done here.
210

211
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:31.600
Tonsure it's working and I can see that three point two percent of my visitors over the last 7 days
211

212
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.110
sign up to my email lists.
212

213
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:40.000
That's a great metric for me to focus on and improve now there are a couple of additional and optional
213

214
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.430
steps you can do when setting up goals of article value and if each newsletter sign up was worth one
214

215
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.840
dollar to your business you could set a goal value equal to one.
215

216
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.630
And just know if you want to track actual revenue made from purchases you would need to turn on e-commerce
216

217
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.950
tracking and talk about that in a seconds.
217

218
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.630
You can also add the gold funnel here just by clicking on the button.
218

219
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.500
I measured the drop off at each stage of the code completion process and once again this is really best
219

220
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.700
suited to e-commerce because for newsletter sign up there is just one step in the process.
220

221
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.010
Go to the Thank-You page.
221

222
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.340
That's not as relevant there.
222

223
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:24.100
Let's look now at the steps to set up e-commerce tracking and to measure transactions and revenue.
223

224
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:30.820
You firstly need to go to the admin section then come to e-commerce settings and enable the e-commerce
224

225
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.580
and even enhanced e-commerce reports here.
225

226
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.120
Now there is a second step you need to implement additional e-commerce tracking so that's additional
226

227
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.210
code that you need to put on your Web site.
227

228
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.200
And that is a little bit complicated.
228

229
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.240
I've included all the details to there so you can click through.
229

230
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.650
You might need a developer to help you with that.
230

231
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.960
But the great news is that sites like Shopify presta shop they've already set up all that stuff for
231

232
00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.180
you automatically Cetus need to enable those reports and you're going to see all the e-commerce revenue
232

233
00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.500
and data reports there.
233

234
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:10.600
Now a couple of key key goal reports is the goals you are l where you can see the pages the goals were
234

235
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.970
completed on the reverse goal path that shows you the three steps that users took prior to completing
235

236
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.990
the Selecta goal as well as the page in which they completed the goals.
236

237
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.310
So again you can see what influenced them and look at those steps.
237

238
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:30.610
There's the funnel visualization report and this report takes the reverse go path a step further and
238

239
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:36.090
shows the the drop off on success rates of each step leading up to the conversion.
239

240
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.250
And you also have the gold flow report and this report was designed to be an improved version of the
240

241
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.240
funnel visualization report.
241

242
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:50.080
It's a bit more flexible you can add segments into it and it's better able to show converters who skipped
242

243
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.820
stages in that conversion for funnel.
243

244
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.910
So you might be able to even figure out hey people are skipping that step.
244

245
00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.630
Maybe I don't need it in order for them to convert.
245

246
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:08.140
So a couple of limited caveats to me whereby my goals are limited to 20 per reporting view and goals
246

247
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.810
actually can be deleted but they can be edited.
247

248
00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:15.400
So if you're not using them you can add them or you can just create a new reporting view and you get
248

249
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.120
20 more goals.
249

250
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:24.010
Goals also can be applied retrospectively to data for it's best practice to set them up as soon as you
250

251
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.120
set up your property.
251

252
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:32.230
You can really track how many visitors are completing those important actions and it's important to
252

253
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.910
be aware how they're measured as well.
253

254
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.020
So a conversion is counted once per session per configured goal.
254

255
00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:44.780
So if you've defined a goal then loading a PTF and the user downloads a PDA five times in the same session.
255

256
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:51.220
This will only count as one conversion event cause as you've seen as one of the options there if you
256

257
00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:57.670
wanted for example to click or to measure how many people clicked a video or clicked call click to call
257

258
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.950
on a mobile site.
258

259
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.030
Well that would require you set up event tracking and we'll be looking at that in the Advanced Google
259

260
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.260
Analytics course.
260

261
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.940
And finally you all have seen the option there for smart goals is one of the gold types you can pick
261

262
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.810
and just you should be aware that this is specifically designed to help Google Ads advertisers who may
262

263
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:23.500
not have enough convergence to use these Google special optimization tools so it sounds like something
263

264
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.160
that you would want to use but just be aware it's just for Google advertisers.
264

265
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:33.400
So those are how you set up goals some of the example goes you can track some of the limits and caveats
265

266
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:40.720
to be aware of let's go through how to navigate Google Analytics and it's really important that you
266

267
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.270
understand the Google Analytics lead and navigation so that you can quickly find the reports tools and
267

268
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.300
features that you need.
268

269
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:54.190
So there are a couple of key controls here that you really need to be aware of and to really go through
269

270
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.630
them.
270

271
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.680
I'm going to jump into the Google Analytics demo and show you firsthand.
271

272
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:06.280
So up here in the top left we have the cam property view switcher and if you multiple a cancer properties
272

273
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.860
or views set up you can easily switch between them using this control and then below this we have the
273

274
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.830
search feature.
274

275
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:21.010
So you can access key reports quickly with a needing to kick click down through all the navigation here.
275

276
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:27.850
So for example you can start typing in the name of report and it'll pop right up and you can click through.
276

277
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:33.790
Now below this we have the home page and this is really a summary of your side's vital signs and you
277

278
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.190
can use it as a quick check to see that everything is behaving as expected.
278

279
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:43.950
Already as a starting point for deeper analysis you can see links to the full reports that you'll find
279

280
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.270
in the turn navigation here.
280

281
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.820
Now below this we have customization and this section allows you to create custom dashboards reports
281

282
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:58.150
save reports and create custom alerts that are specific to your business so incredibly useful section
282

283
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:05.260
of Google Analytics and down below this we really have the main section where all your reports are categorized.
283

284
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.770
There are about 100 pre-configured reports in Google Analytics.
284

285
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:15.490
Broken down into five sections real time audience acquisition behavior and conversions there below that
285

286
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:21.370
we have the admin section and this contains all your Google Analytics settings such as user permissions
286

287
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:28.150
tracking code view settings filters where your set up goals and so that's an important place especially
287

288
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.010
for the Google Analytics set up.
288

289
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.930
Now coming back to the home page is a couple of other navigation controls and features that are very
289

290
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:44.250
helpful and one is the analytics intelligence and this is a set of features that uses machine learning
290

291
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:50.550
to help you better understand and act on your data so you can type B in real human questions here and
291

292
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.250
you can get answers to them.
292

293
00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:58.350
And this too will also surface some insights for you and really bring up important information about
293

294
00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.000
your data.
294

295
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.310
For example here YouTube's performing worse than other referral traffic.
295

296
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.340
So that's something we might want to look at and maybe not do so much on that marketing channel and
296

297
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.650
focus on another one.
297

298
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.150
So it's an incredibly useful set of features.
298

299
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.980
It's essentially like having your own personal Google Analytics assistance.
299

300
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:24.300
Now we also have a peer the alerts section which will may include data like something like your site
300

301
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:29.300
is not set up properly or collecting data properly or a setting that needs to be optimized.
301

302
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.610
That's important to keep an eye on as well.
302

303
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:38.490
And one of the most useful features in the Google Analytics lead is the help and this allows you to
303

304
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.770
access the help center inside Google Analytics itself so you don't even have to leave an open it or
304

305
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.270
search in Google.
305

306
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:51.120
So for example if there's any reports or metrics that you don't understand you can just type demen get
306

307
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.350
a quick look at it here and go back to analyzing your reports.
307

308
00:23:55.350 --> 00:24:00.270
So that is the Google Analytics lead and some of the key navigation controls.
308

309
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.250
So you can really find the key tools features and reports that you need for your business.
309

310
00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:12.390
Let's go through the main tools for analysis and you can use these tools and controls across any Google
310

311
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.000
Analytics report to analyze your data.
311

312
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.090
So I think it makes sense for you to get familiar with them upfront now before we start analyzing all
312

313
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.220
the different reports.
313

314
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:27.090
So there are a number different reporting to tools and throws for analysis.
314

315
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:32.540
And once again to bring these to life I'm going to jump into the Google Analytics demo cans and come
315

316
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.200
down and start with the analytics overview report.
316

317
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.880
So up in the top right here we have the date range selector and here you can set the time period in
317

318
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.280
which you want to analyze your reports so you can set this as custom and really extended it to a big
318

319
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.740
timeframe like six months or a year.
319

320
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:55.290
Now will give you a completely different timeframe to analyze your data or you can do it for last week
320

321
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.860
today where even the last 30 days.
321

322
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.950
Just be aware that by default today is not included because today's not over yet.
322

323
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.080
So just include that if you want to see data from today.
323

324
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:13.140
I'm going to change this to the last seven days and then look at the second control for analysis which
324

325
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.750
is the date range comparison.
325

326
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.300
This allows you to compare data from two different date ranges and see how your business has changed
326

327
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:22.150
over time.
327

328
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:28.830
So I can just click over apply and then over the last compared to the last period I can see that for
328

329
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.260
some of my key metrics I'm down here.
329

330
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.780
So this is a great place to really start my analysis and to do that.
330

331
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.510
I can just take a quick reply and I'm back to the original view.
331

332
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.860
Now we're up at the top of all the reports is where you're going to see the options segments and you
332

333
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.140
can add segments to report to compare different subsets of data that we'll be looking at this in more
333

334
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.740
detail in the advanced Google Analytics course.
334

335
00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.510
But this is similar to the date range comparison where you're really comparing different segments of
335

336
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:05.130
users and drawing insights out of the differences between them.
336

337
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.900
Now below that we have the line graph and here you can see different metrics in line graph for the date
337

338
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.330
range you've selected.
338

339
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.960
You also have the metric selector.
339

340
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:20.190
So by default this will usually be users but you can select and change it to any different metric you
340

341
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:26.700
want from the drop down and see that displayed in a line graph and you also have for the line graph
341

342
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.900
the duration selector.
342

343
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.480
So changing this two months doesn't make sense obviously on a seven day range but this can be really
343

344
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.540
helpful if you're looking at a much longer time frame like six months or a year.
344

345
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:44.830
So you can really just get that big picture view now below the line graph there is the graph annotator.
345

346
00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:51.000
And this allows each to annotate the graph with helpful notes to our business context to your data.
346

347
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.060
So for example if you did a marketing campaign had a big spike in traffic you might just want to note
347

348
00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:01.350
that then because when you look back and reports in six months time or year some you might forget what
348

349
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.900
was the cause of that.
349

350
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.600
And this allows you just to build up a really good picture of your data and how will that business context
350

351
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.330
next to it.
351

352
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.490
Very helpful also if you're working with a team so you can share notes there.
352

353
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.530
Now an important control on these reports that you should be aware of is the sampling rate and it doesn't
353

354
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.660
really make a difference for these small reports like this where there's not a lot of data.
354

355
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.540
You can see that the report is based on 100 percent of the sessions.
355

356
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:34.000
But oftentimes Google Analytics because such huge amount of data we'll just take a small percentage
356

357
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.110
of those sessions or a sample of them and create a report based on that.
357

358
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:44.680
So just be aware that if you want to get faster response you can select that option and it will just
358

359
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:50.800
select a small sample of the data to speed up the report being generated.
359

360
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.640
Now up at the top here you have the option to really share or refer back to meaningful data that you
360

361
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.440
found.
361

362
00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:02.590
You can even share them by e-mail and that can be very helpful to share with colleagues or different
362

363
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:03.420
clients.
363

364
00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.920
So those are some of the main tools for analysis in an overview report.
364

365
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:14.710
Now I really want to dive into the geo location report and really show you one of the best tools for
365

366
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:21.610
analysis in Google Analytics that you're going to find in these full reports on it is the data table
366

367
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.180
that you can see here.
367

368
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:31.450
So the way that these data tables are laid out in all of these full reports is that Dan here in the
368

369
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:37.380
Rose you have what Google Analytics calls a dimension and this is really just described to your data
369

370
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:43.810
in this case the dimension is the country and across in the columns here you have the different metrics.
370

371
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:50.830
So we have metrics that relate to the acquisition to behavior such as time on sites or average session
371

372
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.680
duration.
372

373
00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:57.150
And we have metrics related to conversions like the number of transactions and the revenue.
373

374
00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:03.700
Now just remember that just to get these type of metrics in your reports you will have to set up goals
374

375
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.430
or enable e-commerce tracking.
375

376
00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:11.800
Now the great thing about these data tables is that you can really manipulate the data and that allows
376

377
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.620
you to really dig down deep into the data.
377

378
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:20.830
So right now you can see that I can see that US is the top country in terms of the number of users over
378

379
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.240
the last seven days.
379

380
00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:28.270
But if I were interested to look at the top countries in terms of revenue then I can change the metric
380

381
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:34.090
in this table and just notice here that India is the second most popular country in terms of number
381

382
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:34.910
of users.
382

383
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.530
But if I change to revenue you can see that it doesn't even appear in the top 10.
383

384
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:46.000
So having that conversion data is really helpful and you can manipulate it to change it to really any
384

385
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.390
different metric in the data table to change it back.
385

386
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:55.030
You can just click on it and you'll notice this little down arrow is how you'll know what metric the
386

387
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:59.350
table is organized by now as well as changing the metrics.
387

388
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.320
You can also change the primary dimension.
388

389
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:08.140
So if I want to see this table just by the city and see the top cities I can see that here and I can
389

390
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:14.350
also add a secondary dimension if I want Suffa go back to country as being the primary dimension.
390

391
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:23.230
I can add a secondary dimension of city and that in and now I can see the top city in the top country
391

392
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.350
and not Elize me.
392

393
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.270
As I said a lot more granular and dig in to the data.
393

394
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:38.200
Now as well as really changing the way the data table is displayed you can actually change the way it's
394

395
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.850
presented visually as well.
395

396
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:46.230
So by default it'll be on the data table option here but you can change it to display a pie chart.
396

397
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:51.310
So it shows the contribution to the total for the selected metric and you can change the metric there
397

398
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:52.330
again.
398

399
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:59.410
You also have the performance option which shows a horizontal byte bar chart showing the relative performance
399

400
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.070
of the Select metric and you can change that again next to the comparison view which displays a bar
400

401
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.270
chart plot and performances selected metric relative to the side average.
401

402
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:16.950
So we can see that this city is really performing twenty four thousand times above the site average.
402

403
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:22.360
So if we were really wanted to focus our marketing efforts this is where the city in the particular
403

404
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.940
country were were before we performing because we could expect to get results that are way above the
404

405
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.240
side average.
405

406
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:35.500
And finally have the pivot option here as well which can be great if you've added the secondary dimension
406

407
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.750
and we want to see everything laid out in a pivot table.
407

408
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:46.540
So those are some of the main tools for analysis for not only the overview reports but also the full
408

409
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.110
reports with the knowledge of how to use these tools.
409

410
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.830
You're now ready to start analyzing with Google Analytics.
410

411
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:58.010
Let's go through now how to analyze some of the key reports in Google Analytics.
411

412
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.820
And as I mentioned there are over 100 pre-configured reports in Google Analytics.
412

413
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.120
I was going to take us through the top 20.
413

414
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.990
So you really know the information to focus on and we're going to get started with the audience reports
414

415
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.390
and are provide insight into the characteristics of your users.
415

416
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.610
And here are some of the benefits of these audience reports.
416

417
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.900
Personally I find it much easier to understand why you can use them for.
417

418
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.740
And then you can dive into Google Analytics and have a look for the data.
418

419
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.300
So the first benefit is that you can build a buyer persona with these reports.
419

420
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:36.700
You can understand the age gender location and interests of your most valuable users and then target
420

421
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:43.510
them in future acquisition campaigns and tailor your site content and messaging to address their needs.
421

422
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:50.130
So this is really a huge benefit that really improves not only your marketing but your whole business.
422

423
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.190
You can also use the audience reports to expand into new markets.
423

424
00:32:54.190 --> 00:33:00.070
You could set up offices or better shipping options for countries where you're getting a lot of traffic
424

425
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.810
from.
425

426
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:07.660
You can also use the audience reports to fix technical issues blocking sales and you couldn't go into
426

427
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:13.710
the technical reports and look for high Banse rates and that really signal that maybe you weren't side
427

428
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:18.440
or app has an issue with a particular device or browser.
428

429
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:23.620
You could also use them to plan your development needs and if you wanted to build an app for example
429

430
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:30.220
you would know using the mobile report's if your visitors are more likely to visit on an art to use
430

431
00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.920
it on an Apple Android or Windows device.
431

432
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:39.100
And also in these audience reports pretty cool they have benchmarking reports and you can see higher
432

433
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:45.110
marketing channels and the location and devices of the users compared to the competition.
433

434
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.500
So here are some of the key audience reports.
434

435
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:53.730
Let's quickly jump into the Google Analytics demo cans and I'll show you where they are.
435

436
00:33:53.910 --> 00:34:01.500
So we have the demographics overview report and this will show the age and gender makeup of your audience.
436

437
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.870
We also have the interest reports here which actually can be pretty cool to understand the interests
437

438
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.090
of your audience.
438

439
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.780
And this allows you to maybe expand into different Kadlec product or content categories.
439

440
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.120
Now below that we have the technology reports and this is where you'll really see the browsers and operating
440

441
00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:26.970
systems that your users are using to access your site and you can filter this by the by and straight
441

442
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.740
metric to really identify where there might be issues.
442

443
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:37.740
If you see the bands rate is 100 percent or very high well maybe your site isn't accessible from that
443

444
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.550
device.
444

445
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:44.310
And just to remind you the balance rate is really the percentage of single page sessions so it's people
445

446
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:48.230
looking to your device and they only looked at one page.
446

447
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:53.570
If you see that that's almost 100 percent well then that's an indication that it's not working at all.
447

448
00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.540
Now for tiny numbers you probably won't need to bother fixing that.
448

449
00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:01.710
But for where there's significant numbers you really want to make sure your site is working on those
449

450
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.790
devices.
450

451
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:09.570
Now you also have the mobile reports which shows it to break then and the device is used to access your
451

452
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:10.310
Web site.
452

453
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:16.500
And also the benchmarking reports which compare your property's performance that that of your industry
453

454
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.150
peers.
454

455
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:22.770
So for example in the channel's report you may need to select some of these options here and select
455

456
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.500
your industry vertical country and size.
456

457
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:32.980
But I can see that compared to some of my competitors I have 72 percent more referral traffic and a
457

458
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.080
better lower Banse rate as well.
458

459
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:41.780
So these are some good indicators and insights into how I'm doing compared to the competition.
459

460
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.490
Now just a quick note for the demographics and interest reports.
460

461
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:51.440
If you want to get the age and gender of your visitors you must first go to your property settings and
461

462
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:57.800
then enable advertising features to collect this data and once you've been able that you are required
462

463
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:02.270
to notify visitors by disclosing in your private policy.
463

464
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:07.230
And I've linked off to here to where Google really gives you more information about that.
464

465
00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.800
But it's just more information.
465

466
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:14.560
And for privacy reasons you're required to put it into your privacy policy.
466

467
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:20.600
And that really wraps up hides to analyze your audience reports that is continued to look at how to
467

468
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.110
analyze the key Google Analytics reports.
468

469
00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:29.780
And now we're moving on to the acquisition reports which show how the Web site acquires users.
469

470
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:34.970
And there are many benefits to the acquisition of sports but the main one really is that allows you
470

471
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:40.820
to optimize your marketing and compare the performance of different marketing channels and allocate
471

472
00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:47.000
resources to what's working Seacom really maximize results and some of the specifics are like seeing
472

473
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.150
which Hywel channel drives conversions identify traffic sources you could potentially grow you want
473

474
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:59.480
to look for ones with high conversion with low to medium demands traffic you can identify budget gaps
474

475
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:05.540
and maybe invest more in traffic sources that are delivering or outperforming in terms of traffic and
475

476
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.420
sales.
476

477
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.260
You can track the return on Social Media traffic.
477

478
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:15.590
Identify the best performing social media sites and identify web site owners who are referring traffic
478

479
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:21.020
to your site and he can build the relationships with them and seek out similar sites to growing traffic.
479

480
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.880
So lots of ways you can use them.
480

481
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.100
The key really benefit is that they can help optimize your marketing.
481

482
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:33.650
So some of the key reports here we are going to go through and are to jump into the Google Analytics
482

483
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.920
demo can to bring you through them.
483

484
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:44.090
So were looking firstly at the channels report here and this shows you how well each channel drives
484

485
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:49.640
traffic and conversions so we can see the number of users here which is that the traffic we can see
485

486
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.280
the number of conversions as well.
486

487
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.830
And really there is a breakdown in terms of the channels here.
487

488
00:37:54.830 --> 00:38:01.040
So just briefly explain them organic search is visitors who are coming to your web sites after searching
488

489
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.890
Google Larcom or other search engines direct traffic is going to be visitors who come to your web site
489

490
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:13.430
with the added traceable referral source so that can include anything from technical errors to also
490

491
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:21.490
people who typed the year you whirl into their address bar directly or he use a bookmark browser referral
491

492
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:26.780
traffic is really visitors who come to your Web site from another web site by clicking on a link.
492

493
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:33.590
Social traffic is visitors come to your website from social network paid searches obviously paid search
493

494
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:39.950
advertisements like on Google Display advertising can be from Google as well across their network of
494

495
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:48.350
sites and affiliates can also just be affiliates that are referring traffic to your site as well.
495

496
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:55.730
So after that we're moving on to the source media report where you can also look to see how different
496

497
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.990
traffic sources and their mediums really compared to each other.
497

498
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:07.250
So the source is really the origin of your traffic so the traffic source the source it's the origin
498

499
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:13.010
of the Web site visitor and you can see here that there's lots of different potential sources like Facebook
499

500
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:20.740
dot com your newsletter name direct That's people are coming direct and then you can see YouTube dot
500

501
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.000
com different partner sites et cetera.
501

502
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:29.540
And then the medium which is the second part of this really explains how the visitor arrived from that
502

503
00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:35.390
source so we can see Google organic here meaning that they came from Google by clicking on organic search
503

504
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:36.040
results.
504

505
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.280
You can also see have a Google CPC.
505

506
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:45.310
So cost per click which really means that they came from paid search and you can see referral there.
506

507
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:49.640
So there's a number of different traffic and or source medium combinations.
507

508
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:55.130
So really by looking at this report you can get huge insight into what's working and what you should
508

509
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.510
really focus on.
509

510
00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:03.230
Just noticed that you can expand this data table from 10 rows to something much bigger if you really
510

511
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:08.660
want to look at a whole host of different source medium combinations.
511

512
00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:15.020
Now we're moving on to the referrers report and this leaves Zeid search engines and direct traffic and
512

513
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:20.760
only shows web site domains including social networks that have referred traffic to your Web site.
513

514
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.580
And this could be individual blogs or publications.
514

515
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:30.160
So previously I personally have seen a site here that was referring a lot of traffic to my site.
515

516
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.630
I had never had contact to them.
516

517
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.570
But I said well let me reach out to these guys.
517

518
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.730
Tell them a little bit more about what I'm doing.
518

519
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.480
And we were able to develop a relationship and they sent me a lot more traffic.
519

520
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:46.810
And then I went go for similar sites because I saw what was valuable to them for their audience for
520

521
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.370
pointing them towards my site.
521

522
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:54.250
So this is a great report to really build those relationships and find similar side Second help you
522

523
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.390
grow.
523

524
00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:04.270
Now the search Konsole report is a really sweet report that relates to organic search and in particular
524

525
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:10.270
here you can see for example the queries that people really typed into Google in order to click through
525

526
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.350
to your site.
526

527
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:15.150
You can see the landing pages that they're really coming to here.
527

528
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:22.300
And just note that you do need to set up the search console and link this to your Google Analytics account
528

529
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:29.110
in order to get this data into your account and I put a link to that in these slides now as well as
529

530
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:35.230
that we have the social reports here where you can see the number of conversions from social media sites
530

531
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:42.860
and the behavior of social media video visitors here in the network referrals from Porsche.
531

532
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.510
And you can even see all the landing pages the really the pages that people arrive on your site from
532

533
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.420
social media.
533

534
00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:58.930
So there are some fantastic reports all that you can use to really compare the forms of marketing channels
534

535
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.800
and grow the traffic and sales on your site.
535

536
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.730
Now couple of limits and caveats that you should be aware of if for technical reasons Google can't identify
536

537
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.040
the traffic source.
537

538
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.970
It'll be added to the direct channel.
538

539
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.690
As I said and appear in the source medium report as direct none because if they can't identify the traffic
539

540
00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.880
source then the medium they're just going to put ads on.
540

541
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:27.670
And for a lot of people this can be quite frustrating because a large portion of their traffic appears
541

542
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.500
is this.
542

543
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:35.320
And so to combat that one of the best things that you can do is use campaign tagging to reduce this
543

544
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.740
direct traffic from your own email campaigns and your marketing campaigns.
544

545
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:47.220
I'm going to talk about the process to really set up campaign tagging later on in this training.
545

546
00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.140
But a lot of people think Google or hiding traffic from them.
546

547
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.070
That's not the case.
547

548
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.820
They just can't identify it.
548

549
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:56.710
But others said campaign tagging really helps with that.
549

550
00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:02.710
So let's continue on now and look at how to analyze behavior reports and these really provide insight
550

551
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.720
into the behavior of users on your site.
551

552
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:12.460
And there's a couple of key reasons that you'd want to use these one is to find content ideas and you
552

553
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:18.010
can see the pages on your site that get the most traffic and the highest engagements and you can improve
553

554
00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:25.390
this top reforming content to climb the search results or use it as a guide to your future content decisions.
554

555
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:31.450
You can also use behavior points to make a better first impression and identify the first pages users
555

556
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:37.030
see in a session on your site and improve them to reduce those bands rates to make sure they continue
556

557
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.480
on through the site and to complete those conversions.
557

558
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.520
And especially if you drive paid traffic to your site you really want to make sure you're making that
558

559
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.420
first impression.
559

560
00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.110
Otherwise you're wasting a lot of money.
560

561
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:55.390
You can also use the behavior reports to stop users from leaving the site and identify the pagers where
561

562
00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.930
users are leaving your site.
562

563
00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:05.800
You can minimize these unwanted exits for example from the shopping cart check guide or people who aren't
563

564
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:11.980
converting before leaving your site so you can encourage them to maybe get a pop up to sign up to your
564

565
00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.720
e-mail that are on those exit pages.
565

566
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:20.890
Now also you can improve page load speed and this is something critical because site slowness is a top
566

567
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:24.470
reason why users banned and purchase on e-commerce sites.
567

568
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:30.550
And according to Google if pages have a loading time of more than one second it really damages the user
568

569
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:31.300
experience.
569

570
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:38.650
So those are some of the benefits of really digging in and analyzing these behavior reports as a couple
570

571
00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:39.810
of key reports.
571

572
00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:46.270
And once again I'm really going to dive into the Google Analytics demo can you show you quickly where
572

573
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:53.260
these are so coming down into the behavior section site content with the all pages reports where you
573

574
00:44:53.260 --> 00:45:00.250
can see the pages on your site that get the most traffic and the highest engagements you can use those
574

575
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.030
3D inform future content decisions.
575

576
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:08.440
Below that we've the landing pages report and these are the first pages viewed in a session and a high
576

577
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:15.850
bounce rate usually indicates that the page content is not relevant or engaging those users so these
577

578
00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:22.630
are pages you really might want to improve if they're getting a substantial amount of visits coming
578

579
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:29.500
now of the exit pages reports which show the last pages people visit on your site on your Web site before
579

580
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.230
exiting.
580

581
00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.260
So again you want to optimize those.
581

582
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:38.130
And he can even use good performing pages by using the site comparison feature here.
582

583
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:44.040
To really look at which which are the good performing pages of the XXX pages and take some of those
583

584
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.440
lessons and apply them to the poor performing pages.
584

585
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.630
Now below here we have these sites search reports as well.
585

586
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:57.600
And these let you understand the extent to which users take advantage of your search site's search function.
586

587
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:04.260
If you have one which search terms they entered and this can really help you understand why people can
587

588
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:09.760
find on your site and you can improve the user experience based on that.
588

589
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:18.210
So that really wraps up how to analyze the behavior reports and also analyze the key reports on Google
589

590
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.520
Analytics.
590

591
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.810
Let's go through the steps to set up Google Analytics dashboards and the benefit of doing so.
591

592
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:31.640
So dashboards are an easy way to see an overview of the reports and metrics that you care about most.
592

593
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.020
And there are a lot of benefits to dashboards.
593

594
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:40.180
The main one is that you can monitor many metrics at once so you can quickly check the health of your
594

595
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:46.440
accounts on a glance and by having a lot of different metrics together you can see correlations between
595

596
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:53.220
different reports that you wouldn't necessarily see by clicking into the individual reports separately.
596

597
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:58.620
You can create dashboards for different roles or metrics such as if you want to see all the metrics
597

598
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:04.860
for site performance for e-commerce or PPC one place you can do that with dashboards and they're very
598

599
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.080
easy to create and customize and share.
599

600
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:13.920
And the great thing is is that you can import dashboards from the Google Analytics Dema can yourself
600

601
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:20.490
to some great one set up there or you can go to the google analytics solutions gallery on loads of people
601

602
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:25.800
have shared different ones there so some really cool things that you can import directly into your account
602

603
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.190
in one click.
603

604
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:32.640
And here is one example dashboard that's actually in the Google Analytics demo and it's called side
604

605
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.950
performance.
605

606
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:40.890
And you might be able to see here so in the Mattrick site average page load time page loads be met on
606

607
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:47.700
mobile and some really important technical kind of metrics here together so someone who is maybe the
607

608
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.060
technical role in a company this would be their dashboard.
608

609
00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.410
They wouldn't really care about say the blog content cetera.
609

610
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.260
So how do you add dashboards.
610

611
00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:03.620
Well you just can import them as I said or to create your own go to customization DR-DOS dashboards
611

612
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:11.070
and then create create and then you need to add the widgets so these widgets provide snapshots of standard
612

613
00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:13.430
reports or customer reports.
613

614
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:20.470
Or you can create your own widgets by selecting the different metrics that you want to see there.
614

615
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:26.970
Now to share your Dazs boards with other users you can do that via the share many Once you set them
615

616
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:33.420
up and you can share them by email or export them to PDSA that can be handy for clients or colleagues
616

617
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.570
or bosses.
617

618
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:39.330
And you can also share them into the solutions gallery as well.
618

619
00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:44.070
And note that if you click the shared template link as you would do if you're sharing to the gallery
619

620
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.010
they're not going to be able to see your web site data.
620

621
00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:52.890
They will just see add the template for the widgets that you're set up.
621

622
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:58.360
So a couple of limits and caveats that you should be aware of about dashboards at each of the links
622

623
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:05.550
you can contain up to 20 dashboards per user and each dashboard can contain up to 12 widgets.
623

624
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:10.240
So that wraps up the steps to set up dashboards and the benefits of doing so.
624

625
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:16.020
Let's look at how you can better track the performance of your marketing campaigns in Google Analytics
625

626
00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:22.770
with campaign tagging and campaign tagging helps you really determine which marketing campaigns are
626

627
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:26.170
driving the most traffic or convergence.
627

628
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:31.500
And the reason that you would need these is because by default Google Analytics is actually not able
628

629
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:36.830
to identify the different digital marketing campaigns that send visitors to your Web site.
629

630
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:43.890
As we've seen they can identify the source and the medium such as Facebook or furl but it can't determine
630

631
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.080
which Facebook posts or even add the traffic came from.
631

632
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:55.470
And campaign tagging this process really lets you overcome this limitation and get that visibility into
632

633
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.410
which of your marketing campaigns are performing.
633

634
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:05.640
And if you're running email campaigns campaign tagging really rises from a good idea to critical and
634

635
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.390
this is because traffic from e-mail will be grossly under-report under reported.
635

636
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:16.260
Google Analytics can really identify where the traffic is coming from so it might just filers under
636

637
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.810
direct none in your acquisition reports.
637

638
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.610
So it's really important to do this.
638

639
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:23.470
If not you will be grossly under-reported.
639

640
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:29.370
If you don't type all links pointing back to your site from e-mail and if you're running paid search
640

641
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:37.110
outside of odd words or add words campaigns without order with or tagging disabled and these visits
641

642
00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:44.270
may show up as organic it so that's important to do for paid campaigns outside of bad words and also
642

643
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:50.600
campaign tagging consolidates all campaign data into a set of campaign reports found under acquisition
643

644
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.920
campaigns.
644

645
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.410
So how do you tag campaign links.
645

646
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:55.840
What's the process.
646

647
00:50:55.850 --> 00:51:00.370
First thing you want to do is open up the campaign world builder.
647

648
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.270
And this is briefly what it looks like here.
648

649
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:08.540
No they have to do is fill in these different fields and tag the things that you're going to be using
649

650
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:15.920
in your marketing campaigns that these campaign tags they're also known as UTM tags or parameters and
650

651
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.270
really just want to add these to the link that you'll be using in your campaigns.
651

652
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:26.890
And in that way that information can be captured by Google Analytics and added to those campaign reports.
652

653
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:33.580
So next thing you want to do is add the campaign tags and note that medium source and campaign are required
653

654
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:37.920
campaign tags and you can add content or turn.
654

655
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.830
So in the world builder here there is a bit of an explanation about what you need to be putting in in
655

656
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:43.920
each field.
656

657
00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:45.780
So that's maybe your blog posts.
657

658
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.860
It could be you're posting this to link to Facebook and it could be the spring sale.
658

659
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:57.830
So you just are all of those in need and these other ones in here as options as well.
659

660
00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:04.610
Now good tip is if you're not sure what sourcer medium to really include There you can look at the existing
660

661
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.880
categorisations in the source media and report on those in.
661

662
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:16.310
So once you have added in the different campaign tags you just want to copy copy and paste the campaign
662

663
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:24.170
your L and then paste the Tagalongs into your email or your Facebook posts or just like a normal link
663

664
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.470
you would.
664

665
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:28.730
So I've added here to this and fill this site in this example.
665

666
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:36.650
I've added in Facebook as my source medium as my so are social as my medium and I've just put the campaign
666

667
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:41.080
name a spring sale and that's going to appear then in my campaign reports.
667

668
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.380
So I just paste that in like a normal link.
668

669
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.300
The user when they click on it they won't even really see it.
669

670
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.680
So let it be collected by Google Analytics.
670

671
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:55.090
So for reference here is a look at some of the campaign tags and a bit more detail.
671

672
00:52:55.250 --> 00:53:00.650
So medium and source you should be familiar with already campaign is just the name of your campaign.
672

673
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:07.740
Back to School content will be different versions of a promotion like two ads you can version one $10
673

674
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:14.160
off version to no promo and then term is used to identify keywords for a paid search campaigns.
674

675
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:19.080
So you would only use this field if your money really tagging the paid search campaign.
675

676
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.970
Being on Yahoo.
676

677
00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:29.520
Now as I said the reporting you can view the campaign reports here and really to verify that the campaign
677

678
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.860
debt is collecting.
678

679
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.610
You can just come down there and check that out after 24 hours.
679

680
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:40.590
To make sure that that is appearing in here are a couple of tips for the campaign tagging that will
680

681
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:46.340
just make it a little bit easier for you if you are advertising with odd words you can actually enable
681

682
00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.860
what's known as auto tagging.
682

683
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:54.080
So you don't need to do this process if you've enabled auto tagging you just simply need to link your
683

684
00:53:54.110 --> 00:54:00.800
google analytics or advocates to Google Analytics and enable auto tagging and that will share all this
684

685
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.080
campaign data automatically.
685

686
00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.080
So that's a nice integration there between Google ads and Google Analytics.
686

687
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:13.610
Now also you can often enable audit tagging for e-mail and all the tagging can be set up for e-mail
687

688
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.320
providers like MailChimp I a link to the instructions there.
688

689
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:22.560
And similarly once that set up link clicks from e-mails will automatically be recorded in Google and
689

690
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:29.120
acts as the subject of the e-mail that doesn't require you to do this manual tagging process.
690

691
00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:35.680
Also people often ask is it required for Facebook ads to really do this manual tagging.
691

692
00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:40.850
Yes if the Facebook Ads manager will give you a lot of insights about the performance of your ads and
692

693
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:44.440
even track conversions if you've set up the Facebook pixel.
693

694
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:47.210
However by tagging your links you'll be able to see.
694

695
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.370
Watch your audience is interested in before and after those conversions.
695

696
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.240
Get more information.
696

697
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:59.260
And this can help you promote relevant items or make sure the conversion path is also optimized and
697

698
00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:03.550
see what your biggest biggest hits in terms of content are.
698

699
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.940
So those are a couple of bonus tips for campaign tagging to make it easier for you.
699

700
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:15.620
And that really wraps up the steps and the process to tag campaign links and really the benefit of doing
700

701
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.280
so.
701

702
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:23.510
Let's go through the steps and the benefits of linking Google ads with Google Analytics Google ads is
702

703
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:29.280
Google's advertising platform that helps advertisers reach new customers online.
703

704
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:33.130
And it used to be called Google outwards in the past.
704

705
00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.280
Now why would you want to link google ads with Google Analytics.
705

706
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:39.670
Well you can really see a ton of extra information.
706

707
00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:45.760
And for example you can now see the full customer cycles so from how customers interact with your marketing.
707

708
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:51.110
Like seeing ad impressions clicking ads too high or they finally complete the goals you set up for them
708

709
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:54.890
on your site like making a purchase or consuming content.
709

710
00:55:55.010 --> 00:56:00.970
And it's really this extra day that I can help you better analyze performance of your ad campaigns.
710

711
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:06.210
You can also enable auto tanking once you've linked to a cancer as well.
711

712
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:12.630
Or when you link your Google Analytics on Adwords accounts campaign that is shared between the two systems.
712

713
00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:16.100
But you still require that manual campaign tagging.
713

714
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:24.440
So really to automatically add a special tag called equal Kalid tier Google ads or els you can enable
714

715
00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:29.890
or tagging and really save yourself the work from manually tagging campaign links.
715

716
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.650
You can also set up free marketing campaigns.
716

717
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:39.530
Once you've linked your cance and build user audiences in Google Analytics and show targeted ads to
717

718
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:43.350
bring users back to web site and encourage a conversion.
718

719
00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:48.240
So those are some of the key benefits of linking alliance with Google Analytics.
719

720
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:52.930
So how do you actually link your Google ads and Google Analytics exchange.
720

721
00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:59.810
Well first you go to your Google Analytics property you're going to see the option there to do Google
721

722
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:06.890
ads linking and you can just add your new link group there and really link this property and this view
722

723
00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.560
to your outwards accounts.
723

724
00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:15.630
The second step then if you want to get the benefit of ordered tagging you go into your odd words it
724
