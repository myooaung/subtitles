00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.930
Welcome to advance Google Analytics in this training we will Kovar advanced configuration settings like

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.490
custom dimensions custom metrics event tracking and other useful configurations like cross-domain tracking

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.060
and user IDs.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.410
We'll then move on to look at some advanced analysis tools and techniques using segment's multi-channel

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.900
phone reports and custom reports.

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.110
And finally we'll finish up by looking at advanced marketing tools like remarketing and understand how

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.250
you can use the data in Google Analytics to enhance those advertising campaigns.

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.020
So this training is really going to take your Google Analytics knowledge to the next level.

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.000
So let's get straight into it.

10
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.940
Let's go through the steps and benefits of setting up custom dimensions custom dimensions are one of

11
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.000
the most powerful configuration settings you can use to collect data that's specific to your business.

12
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.010
And just to remind ourselves what dimensions actually are before we go look at custom dimensions dimensions

13
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.570
really describe data gender age country city device browser source medium.

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.930
These are all examples of dimensions that you'll find in standard Google Analytics reports and the metrics

15
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.870
then measure data and the metrics will invariably be a number percentage or ratio.

16
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.250
And most Google analysts reports they organize data in two dimensions in the rows and then the metrics

17
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340
in the columns.

18
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.500
Now the benefits of setting up costs dimensions is that they track dimensions not available in Google

19
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.840
Analytics and through custom dimensions you can import data.

20
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.560
Google Analytics does not automatically collect and combine it with Google Analytics data.

21
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.080
For example you could import data from your content management system like Wordpress or your CRM like

22
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.880
sales force.

23
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.790
Then once you have that data you can build reports using the custom dimensions and custom the mansion's

24
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.760
are available in custom reports and they are available for use with in advanced segments.

25
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.420
Cousin the mansion's can also be used as secondary dimensions in standard reports.

26
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.110
Then with those reports you will be able to analyze company specific data and get actionable insights

27
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.610
tailored to the needs of your business.

28
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.850
So lets look at an example.

29
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.800
If you run a multi author blog you could create a custom dimension to capture author data from your

30
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.970
web site and remember that by default Google Analytics will not collect the author say of an individual

31
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.810
blog post thats not data youd see and report.

32
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.750
So what you can do then is create a custom report with Aurthur as the primary dimension to measure differences

33
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.390
between authors and to grow your business.

34
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.100
All they have to do is simply ask the author the most page views to write more.

35
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.380
So here is an example of this custom mention authored that we've now captured an imported from our Web

36
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.390
site so we have a list of all of the authors here.

37
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.980
Then we've combined it with the metric here in Google Analytics that comes as standard which is page

38
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.410
use and by combining these in a custom report we can now see that this author gets the most page views

39
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.990
for all of their blog posts combined.

40
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.910
So to grow our business we just simply ask them to write more.

41
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.110
And this is a great insight that we do not get in standard Google Analytics reports.

42
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.720
So some other examples of custom dimensions that you could import are things like the different shipping

43
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.870
methods whether the users are logged in or not where different member types like free paid basic go

44
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.040
platinum and in the same way by really capturing these and measuring them we can understand the differences

45
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.820
between them and get great insights.

46
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.130
Just like weve done in this author or example here.

47
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.620
So how do you set up custom dimensions.

48
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.980
Well the first thing to do is to go into the admin section down into custom definitions and then click

49
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.160
on custom dimensions and just note that you do need added access to add custom dimensions so you won't

50
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.050
be able to do this.

51
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.110
For example in the Google Analytics demo account said Step 2 then is to enter the dimension name and

52
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.490
select the scope.

53
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.080
So you just pop in author.

54
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.080
If we were following the example and then you need to select the scope and a dimension can have one

55
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.850
of the following scopes hit session user or product and you probably won't have seen this before.

56
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.110
So we need to explain this a little bit.

57
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.750
Now for standard dimensions Google Analytics automatically categorize the scope so that's probably probably

58
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.230
why I've never seen it before.

59
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.600
But for custom dimensions you must select which scope to custom dimension value will be applied to each

60
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.040
custom dimension can have one of the four scopes we just listed at.

61
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.650
And I think perhaps the easiest way to understand this is to just look at some of the standard dimensions

62
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.500
in Google Analytics understand what scope they are applied to and then that will give you a great guideline

63
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.710
for your own custom dimensions.

64
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.710
So there are four options as we said.

65
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.270
One thing you should note is the product level only really applies to e-commerce and really requires

66
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.900
enhanced e-commerce.

67
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.140
So most cases your options are really going to be down to these three different ones.

68
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.560
Now if we look at user things like age gender city or country they really apply to the user scope.

69
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.700
And once they're applied to user they don't change based on the current sessions or future sessions

70
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.680
their gender is not going to change.

71
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.160
So it really applies to the scope level.

72
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.300
Next you could pick the session level and things like the landing page the first page that came into

73
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.900
the session on where the source medium really where the traffic came from or the campaign that came

74
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.660
from that is going to apply at the session level and really apply to all the hits in a single session

75
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.380
then you can have the hit level.

76
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.870
So each time a page is loaded the page or the page title that really will be recorded every single year.

77
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:23.400
So that's a guideline really for you to understand what the scope is and choose the right one when you're

78
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.070
setting up recursing dimensions.

79
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.830
So step three in the process then is to implement the tracking code.

80
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.760
So once you finish the process you will get some tracking code like this.

81
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.700
And what you want to do is copy and paste this into your platform to to collect custom data and notice

82
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.270
it's not just for your web site.

83
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.080
It could also be for an app is well and what you have to remember to do is to replace the dimension

84
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.900
value with your own.

85
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.580
So in here you can see it's a template essentially it says dimension value in our Zambal we'd want to

86
00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.920
replace that with author and then we'd want to code it in a way so we could pull the information from

87
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.140
our Web site.

88
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.070
Now different businesses will implement this tracking code in different ways depending on their collection

89
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.890
method and what data they wish to collect.

90
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.310
But Google type manager is a great option for managing and dimension tracking code more easily.

91
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:23.370
Now finally let's look at some limits and caveats of custom dimensions that you should be aware of custom

92
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:30.430
dimensions are not a must to implement but we should be aware of the benefits you can create up to cut

93
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.640
20 custom dimensions per property.

94
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:40.470
You can apply custom dimensions retroactively meaning you can only apply a custom dimension to data

95
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.710
that was collected after you created the dimension.

96
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:50.940
So going back to our Autor example we would first have to set up the custom dimension and then we could

97
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.630
measure the page views.

98
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.950
We couldn't retroactively apply that back to all the page views that have happened in the past.

99
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:05.250
You should not send personally identifiable identifiable information as values and this is against Google

100
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.720
and its terms of service.

101
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.020
So just remember that if you're importing data from say or C or M It shouldn't have say the person's

102
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.420
name attached to it or a phone number because this is really against Google Analytics terms of service

103
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:25.890
if you do want to import user IDs they have to be anonymous custom dimensions cannot be shared in the

104
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.970
solutions Goderich like Goles segments dashboards and custom reports.

105
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:36.120
And this is really because custom dimensions will be specific to business and they also have a unique

106
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.600
implementation process for each business.

107
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:46.750
And finally cosen dimensions cannot be deleted but you can disable them so that wraps up the steps on

108
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.990
the benefits of configuring custom dimensions in Google Analytics.

109
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.260
Lets go through these steps and benefits of setting up custom metrics and custom metrics lets you send

110
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.920
your own metrics to Google Analytics for analysis and the benefit of setting up customer metrics is

111
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.150
that you can track metrics that are not available in Google Analytics and through customer metrics you

112
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.300
import data.

113
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:16.890
Google Analytics does not collect and you combine it then with the Google Analytics data then you can

114
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:22.830
build reports with the customer tricks and theyre available in customer reports and also available for

115
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.110
use for advanced segments.

116
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:30.870
And with those reports then you can analyze company specific data and get actionable insights tailored

117
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.500
to the needs of your business.

118
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.140
So the benefits are very similar to custom dimensions.

119
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.290
So lets have a look at an example here.

120
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.880
And with custom metrics you can unlock some really great reports once again.

121
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:51.720
And in this example all of the metrics here highlighted all custom metrics you can see product revenue

122
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.590
which is a metric that you could find in a standard Google Analytics report if youd set up goes with

123
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.700
things like the original price that its blade price the product level disk and all this type of stuff

124
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.620
helps you to really calculate the impact of discounting and sales and promotions for any product brands.

125
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.650
So this is just an example from an e-commerce store but you can see that you can create new metrics

126
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.270
with your own data and that really helps you to get insights into your own business.

127
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.480
So how do you set up customer metrics.

128
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:31.630
Well once again you go to the admin section and custom definitions and custom metrics and just now once

129
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.330
again we will need that added access to our custom metrics.

130
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:42.730
Then you want to select the scope and on like dimensions custom metrics can only have a scope of haste

131
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:50.950
or product in most cases it's going to be hit because our product is just for e-commerce stores and

132
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.210
you select the formatting type.

133
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.890
Step number three and that's going to be a number currency or time.

134
00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:04.300
And then you just hit create and once again the final step is to implement the tracking code.

135
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.560
You want to copy and paste it into your platform.

136
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.440
Once again you'll need to replace the metric with your own value.

137
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.110
And in terms of implementation it's going to be done in different ways for different businesses depending

138
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.630
on the data collection method and what data you wish to collect.

139
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:27.890
But Google type manager is normally a great option for managing custom metric tracking code more easily.

140
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.290
Now a couple of limits and caveats once again they're not a must.

141
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:38.590
But they have some great benefits like we've just seen a you couldn't get up to 20 custom metrics per

142
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.660
property.

143
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.720
You can apply these custom metrics retroactively.

144
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:47.490
You can only apply because symmetric today that that was collected after you created the metric.

145
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.960
So if you do want to see reports like that example we've seen you want to set that up as soon as possible

146
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:59.380
so you can really collect that data and apply the symmetric custom metrics cannot be shared and solutions

147
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.160
Gallerie like those segments dashboards and custom reports.

148
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.790
And that is for similar reasons like the custom dimensions.

149
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:12.570
They are specific to the business and the implementation will be specific to each business as well.

150
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.510
And finally customer Antrix cannot be deleted but you can disable them.

151
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:24.620
And that wraps up the steps and the benefits of setting up custom metrics in Google Analytics Let's

152
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:31.160
go through the steps and benefits of setting up event tracking in Google Analytics and event tracking

153
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:38.970
allows you to capture user interactions on your site which Google Analytics does not automatically capture.

154
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:45.080
So the benefits of event tracking is that you can track interactions that even Google Analytics goals

155
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:52.970
can track because Google Analytics goals usually require a specific page being loaded to track the interaction

156
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.930
such as a thank you page.

157
00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:00.080
You can track how many people arrived at the thank you page and that's how we know for example that

158
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.560
people have sign up to our email list.

159
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:09.350
Now event tracking allows you to track interactions on a single page and that's really the advantage

160
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.990
and the difference between aventure event tracking and gold tracking.

161
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:20.030
With this additional tracking information you can better understand user behavior.

162
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.850
Understand if users are engaging mature content and performing intended actions that are important for

163
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:33.500
your business and site and you can also then view event tracking reports those are located in the event

164
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.590
tracking subsection which is found within the behavior reports section.

165
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:44.170
Now let's have a look at some example events that you would want to track with the event tracking a

166
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:51.650
click to call phone number and it clicked to an external link like a third party chat click on email

167
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:58.790
addresses video plays podcast plays whether someone selected the different colors or sizes on an e-commerce

168
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.620
site.

169
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.030
Abandonment of a form field.

170
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:09.120
Movements of mouse scrolling down the page and clicks on social profiles for most of these events.

171
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:16.520
It will be opening up in a third party app like into your phone for a phone number or to this live chat

172
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.640
or maybe you click on an e-mail address which will open up say Gmail.

173
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:27.710
And because you don't have Google and that is tracking code on those properties you can't really measure

174
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.380
whether people click through there.

175
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:36.700
So all of these are instances where event tracking will realize to track those interactions.

176
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.880
So how do you set up event tracking.

177
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.540
The first step is really to copy the tracking code template so to track an event a snippet of code is

178
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.050
added to the link on your site.

179
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:54.820
You want to track and when the link is clicked the interaction is tracked and displayed.

180
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.310
This is an event in Google Analytics.

181
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.460
So this is the tracking code.

182
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.720
This is the template.

183
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.540
And this is what you really add on to the link that you want to track.

184
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:12.580
So step number two is then to replace the template fields you want to replace the category action label

185
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.040
and value fields.

186
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:22.690
So all of these labels here we really need to replace and import our own to describe a user's interaction

187
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.770
on our Web site.

188
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.820
And these are all the fields that will show up within Google Analytics.

189
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:35.520
So category typically is the object or group of objects that was interacted with like a video or a PTF

190
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.060
or a live chat or whatever.

191
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.800
The action then is the type of interaction like play or download.

192
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.620
And both of these first are required.

193
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:52.000
And then we have label which is optional and this is useful for summarizing what event what the event

194
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.430
is about that could be the name of the video that was played the name of the PTF and that was clicked

195
00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.150
or downloaded.

196
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.930
And then finally we have value.

197
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.320
And this is optional once again.

198
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:10.750
And this could be a numeric value associated with the event something like 42 or $1 or $2 or whatever.

199
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.620
Step three in the process then is to implement the tracking code.

200
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:21.130
So what we need to do is manually that link plus that event tracking code tier Web site you can edit

201
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.120
that in the code.

202
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:28.990
Or you could use something like Google TYG manager to the tracking code quickly on the highlighted text

203
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:37.030
below here shows an example of event tracking code configured to record the download of a company brochure

204
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.720
PBF.

205
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.820
So if you were to look at the code of your web site before you out of the tracking code you're going

206
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.930
to see something like this a page ref which shows that it's a link.

207
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.290
This is really where the PTF is stored on your Web site.

208
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:58.000
And what we've done with the event tracking code is added there's an added in PTF download and the name

209
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.100
of the current code.

210
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.530
The company brochure.

211
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:07.330
We have an added in that value field and this is really then how we're going to be sending that extra

212
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.550
information to Google Analytics.

213
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:16.600
Now in terms of reporting you can find those reports in the behavior events section and look at the

214
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.500
events you've tracked and see how they are performing.

215
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.300
And that wraps up the steps and the benefits of setting up event tracking on your site.

216
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.670
Let's go through the benefits and the high level steps of setting up other useful configurations in

217
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:37.240
Google Analytics and the first configuration We'll look at is customer session settings and this allows

218
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.210
you to set how long sessions can last.

219
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:47.440
And by default sessions and in Google Analytics after 30 minutes of inactivity or when the user closes

220
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:53.500
the browser window and you can Lankton this session time if the average user spends a lot more time

221
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.310
on your site for example two hours to play again.

222
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:04.450
So if you want to lengthen the session time and capture all of their behavior under one session you

223
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:12.160
can go to the admin section and tracking info and session session settings and then change it from 30

224
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:19.250
minutes which you'll see by default to whatever period of time will really be appropriate for your users.

225
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.480
Now the second configuration is cross-domain tracking.

226
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.720
And this allows you to track users and sessions across multiple domains.

227
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:36.170
For example an e-commerce site that has a separate shopping cart site with across domain tracking the

228
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.250
shopping behavior.

229
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.410
And check out in this example won't get along together.

230
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.440
And Google Analytics won't be able to sociate these users and sessions with their respective domains.

231
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:55.520
And this is because Google Analytics cannot link the anonymous Id known as the client's Id signed by

232
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.040
one domain to another domain.

233
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.390
So to set up cross-domain tracking you can use Google tag manager or you can modify the tracking code

234
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:11.930
itself so that you can really have the information from both to mains feeding in to one Google Analytics

235
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.090
property.

236
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.210
Now the actual implementation of domain tracking is quite technical.

237
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:22.820
So I've included a link to it there but the key thing you should be taking away now is why you would

238
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.750
even need it.

239
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:30.200
And it's really you can track users and sessions across multiple domains like an e-commerce store and

240
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:37.230
a separate shopping cart or a main site that has a blog that's on a separate domain.

241
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.780
Now the next configuration is user ID.

242
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:46.140
And this allows you to track users across multiple devices and sessions by default.

243
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.970
Google Analytics will not be able to identify sessions from the same user.

244
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:57.010
When their session happens in different browsers on the same device or different browsers on different

245
00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.040
devices.

246
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:04.900
So even if I go to a Web site on my phone I go once through the Chrome browser I go a second time through

247
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.600
the Safari browser.

248
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:13.240
Google Analytics will not know that I am the same person and this is because the anonymous Id known

249
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:20.010
as the client id that's assigned by each domain is actually also stored in the browser itself.

250
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.910
So to really use use your I.D. you must have a sign in.

251
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:32.940
That generates your own ideas and be able to consistently associate them with the set of data.

252
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:38.340
And so this is the key thing if you want to track users across multiple devices in sessions.

253
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:44.050
You need to have your own log in where people log in with a username and password so that you can generate

254
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.280
your own IDs and attach them to their sessions.

255
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.820
And really to set this up you can go to tracking info once again.

256
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.930
User ID really follow the implementation instructions to set that up.

257
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.280
The next useful configuration is internal site search.

258
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:09.670
And this allows you to see how users search your site and if you have a search field that lets customers

259
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:16.200
search on your Web site you can set up site search to track what search terms users enter.

260
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:24.130
And this can help you identify missing or obscured content optimized navigation on site land and improve

261
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:29.470
search results and even generate ideas for new keywords for marketing campaigns.

262
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:35.890
So to set up sites search you want to go to the oddments section to view and then view settings he actually

263
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:42.450
set this up for an individual view and then enables site search tracking and enter the query parameter.

264
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.460
And this is really what you're seeing here they're putting keywords.

265
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:52.150
This is from the Google Analytics demo account and this is what your Web site uses in the world.

266
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.420
When users search on your site.

267
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.410
So if you went to the Google Analytics demo and you typed in a search in their search box you're going

268
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.710
to see that it has like questionmark keywords.

269
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.410
And then after that you'll see whatever search query you entered in.

270
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:10.690
And this is really the way that Google Analytics can link what people have typed in on your site and

271
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.180
pull them into the useful reports for you.

272
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:20.520
The next configuration is custom channel group and this allows you to customize how Google Analytics

273
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:27.870
groups channels in your reports by default Google Analytics groups your traffic sources using default

274
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.790
channels like organic social direct referral and display.

275
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:38.970
If you want to set up your own custom channel group you can go to the admin section and really come

276
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:45.240
down into channel settings here and make a copy of this default channel grouping and then you can edit

277
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.440
it and label your traffic in other ways for analysis that you want.

278
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.080
For example if you wanted to move a traffic source that was grouped by default in Google Analytics under

279
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.710
social You could move that to community.

280
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.100
Now the next configuration is data import.

281
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:09.090
And this allows you to upload data from external sources and combine that with data that you've collected

282
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:14.820
in Google Analytics data import provides an alternative to collecting data by the javascript tracking

283
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.460
code.

284
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:22.560
So just note if you were importing custom dimension and metric data you'll first need to create custom

285
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:29.490
dimensions and metrics prior to uploading the data with this data important method.

286
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:36.090
And so to use that data import you just want to come down into the admin section once again click on

287
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:42.990
data import and really you will be uploading a CSP file or an Excel straight into Google Analytics.

288
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:48.150
So in summary here are some of the other useful configurations that we've looked at.

289
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.850
Some of them the implementation is very technical.

290
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:56.400
So we've just looked at it at a high level but you should understand now what they are at a high level

291
00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:01.070
and the benefits of using all of these other configurations.

292
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.940
Now that we have finished looking at the advanced configuration settings in Google Analytics Let's move

293
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:11.800
on and look at the advanced analysis tools and techniques you can using Google Analytics.

294
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.570
Let's go through the benefits and these steps of using segments for analysis and Google Analytics segments

295
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:25.020
are one of the most powerful tools in Google Analytics for analysis and segments allow you to isolate

296
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:29.110
and compare various groups of users on your Web site.

297
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:35.850
And the benefits of segment's is that this segmentation allows you to really understand the differences

298
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:43.440
between various groups of your users and identify growth opportunities really based on those differences

299
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:50.580
and you can compare up to four segments side by side in a single report segments can be applied to any

300
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:58.110
report within Google Analytics segments can be applied to historical data and segments do not permanently

301
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:07.200
alter your data like filters do and segment's can also be used to build audiences for remarketing campaigns

302
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:13.350
and some examples segments here for example converters versus non converters.

303
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:20.400
You can compare the behavior of visitors who converted versus those who didn't convert and really look

304
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.620
at are there any differences in their age or their gender or their interests and you couldn't really

305
00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:33.120
pinpoint your most valuable visitors and really understand the factors that are helping to drive conversions.

306
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.530
And you could optimize your site or marketing to encourage more conversions.

307
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:44.760
You could also look at high volume customers and isolate those big spenders to understand Rudy who they

308
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.150
are how they behave and what makes them different and then target them in future acquisition campaigns

309
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:58.200
and optimize your site and retention campaigns to encourage average customers to start behaving like

310
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.650
those high Vadi customers.

311
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:06.520
You could also look at one time buyers versus multi buyers what really separates the ones on buyers

312
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.860
and multi buyers.

313
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:14.280
Do they have a tendency to buy products from specific categories make changes to really encourage them.

314
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.040
There's one time buyers to start behaving like multi buyer customers.

315
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.870
So this is just some of the examples of the segments that you could isolate and compare and really some

316
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.850
of the insights that you can get in order to grow your business.

317
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.270
So how do you use segments.

318
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.670
Well the first step is to add a segment.

319
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:40.000
So you just need to click on the ad segments tab at the top of any reporting Google Analytics and then

320
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.090
you have two types of segments you can add.

321
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.010
There are the default segments.

322
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.800
So you just want to click turn into system and really see the predefined segments that will be there

323
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:57.070
for you in Google Analytics and you can select the segment you want to compare and click apply.

324
00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.060
And the second type of segment is a custom text segment.

325
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.720
So to do that you'll just click on the custom segment tab and then click on Create new segments and

326
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.250
it'll open up into the segment builder just like this.

327
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.760
And really you can define the segment by selecting these different filters.

328
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:23.230
So for example you could isolate a group of users who are say women ages 25 to 34 and located in the

329
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:29.150
New York City area and you could really see here what percentage of those users are.

330
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.740
So you can really focus in on a particular subset.

331
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:38.740
You can also use custom dimensions in this segment builder if you really want to build the segment from

332
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:45.190
those custom dimensions and you can set that up in the conditions tab here.

333
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.540
Then you just need to apply the segments to your reports and you're going to see something similar to

334
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.370
this.

335
00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:57.160
So the segments will appear in every report until you change them or leave Google Analytics and he can

336
00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.350
select this and quit that segments and it'll go back to the original view.

337
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:07.920
So that wraps up the benefits and the steps to use segments for analysis in Google Analytics.

338
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:13.960
Let's go through the benefits and the steps to use multi-channel fun reports for analysis and Google

339
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:20.440
Analytics and the multi-channel phone reports show how different marketing channels work together to

340
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:26.890
create conversions and the benefits of these multi-channel phone reports is that they allow you to really

341
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.410
analyze channel contribution.

342
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:35.570
You see most reports in Google Analytics attributes all of the credits of a conversion to the last touch

343
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.480
point on the conversion path.

344
00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:43.720
And this is called The last click attribution model and the multi-channel phone reports gives you the

345
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:51.610
bigger picture and really enables you to see how often channels initiated assisted and or completed

346
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.290
conversions.

347
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:59.290
And then you can also use this information to analyze conversion parts and really understand what those

348
00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:06.390
top conversion parts are how many interactions and days it really took users to convert.

349
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:11.020
And then finally with this information you can really optimize your marketing and knowing how other

350
00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:17.680
channels initiated or assisted conversions helps you to find the right marketing mix and decide how

351
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.770
best to spend your budget.

352
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:27.310
So the multi-channel phone reports you can access them in the left hand navigation underneath conversions.

353
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.770
And let's jump into the Google Analytics demo.

354
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:35.240
Can't you just go through the five reports that you'll see here.

355
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.160
So first we have the overview report.

356
00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:44.710
And here you can see a snapshot of the total number of conversions as well as the total number of assisted

357
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.140
conversions.

358
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:52.690
Then below the graph here you can see the visualizer where you can see the percentage of total conversions

359
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:58.600
broken down with different channels and you can adjust this to really see where there is a big overlap

360
00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.680
visually.

361
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:05.620
Just note for these multi-channel phone reports for this over your port and the other reports you can

362
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:12.760
look at all of the conversions combine or select specific ones and you can also look at all of your

363
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:20.810
conversion data or just your Google ad campaign conversion data if you've linked to your Google accounts.

364
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:28.390
You can also extend the look back window from one day up to 90 days if you want to look at a longer

365
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:33.070
period and look at the conversion pads over say a 90 day period.

366
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:41.340
The second report is the assisted conversions report and this shows you really the total number and

367
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:47.940
the monetary value of assisted conversions broken out by channel on really the higher these numbers

368
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.800
are the more the channel helps really assists with conversions.

369
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:59.340
Next we have top versions path report which shows the different routes customer take before conversion

370
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:05.130
and you can really see the popular parts here through your marketing funnel and find out what's really

371
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.850
working next we have the time lag report.

372
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:15.160
And here you can see the band telling customers take from the first channel interaction to conversion.

373
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:21.460
Finally we have the path length report and this shows how many interactions visitors had with your site

374
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.880
before they converted.

375
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.420
And here's a quick summary of all of the multi-channel faunal reports.

376
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:34.620
There are couple of limits and caveats to be aware of in order to enable multi-channel phone reports.

377
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.790
You need to set of goals or e-commerce tracking.

378
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:44.050
And also remember that some set up is required in order to properly track the following channels.

379
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:50.800
Google ads you'll need to link google ads with analytics for paid search or non-Google search campaigns.

380
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.580
You will need to use campaign tagging and also for custom campaigns.

381
00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:01.780
You will need to use campaign tagging so that all of those channels are properly reported in the multi-channel

382
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.860
phone reports.

383
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:09.700
So that wraps up the benefits on the steps of using multi-channel phone reports for analysis in Google

384
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.790
Analytics.

385
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:17.860
Let's go through these steps and the benefits of using custom reports for analysis and Google Analytics

386
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:24.750
and custom reports Alade to go beyond standard Google Analytics reports and gain truly valuable insights

387
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.330
by creating reports for yourself.

388
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:32.710
So the benefits of course from reports is that you can really gain some very valuable insights and you

389
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:38.860
can build customer reports with standard dimensions and metrics that you don't see in reports and Google

390
00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:46.000
Analytics and really drill them into fine details and discover correlations you wouldnt otherwise see.

391
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.390
You can also build reports with custom dimensions and metrics which we've talked about and you can analyze

392
00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:57.040
and present nonstandard data within custom reports.

393
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.780
You can also create reports for different teams.

394
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:04.960
For example the marketing team will be interested in one set of metrics and the development team will

395
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:11.170
have their own agenda so you can really create custom reports just for them and leave out all other

396
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.700
information.

397
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:19.720
You can organize data for presentations with custom reports and just present exactly what is needed

398
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.610
with the extraneous and unnecessary information.

399
00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:31.000
And you can also export data into other software for analysis using custom reports and you can include

400
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.520
more than two dimensions per row.

401
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:41.410
So look let's look at an example custom dimension and this is the hours and days report and you can

402
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:45.310
actually get this in your own Google Analytics account here of linked to.

403
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:51.970
And with this custom report you can see what time of the day on which day of the week your website receives

404
00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.730
the most traffic.

405
00:33:53.740 --> 00:34:00.760
See good reply you your marketing campaigns to kick off on those busiest days of your site when you

406
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:06.580
know most of your users are on line so you can engage as many as possible or for the days where you

407
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:12.910
notice where you don't have a lot of traffic and at times in the middle of the night on Sunday you could

408
00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:16.280
plan all your maintenance then for your web site.

409
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:20.100
So you're disrupting the least amount of customers possible.

410
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:25.240
So this is just an example of one custom report where you can get some great insights that you don't

411
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:29.080
get in some in the standard Google Analytics reports.

412
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.010
So how do you create custom reports.

413
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.250
You just go to the customization section and the left turn navigation bar.

414
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:41.690
Click on custom reports new customer report and you can just pick the dimensions and metrics and higher

415
00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.330
they should be displayed in the custom report.

416
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:50.950
If you don't want to create your own Google and like custom reports you can go ahead and borrow some

417
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:58.750
from the Google solutions gallery which gives you access to custom reports and advance segments by others.

418
00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:06.280
So there's some great reports there that you can just import into your own google the Kanes in one click

419
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.740
and you can also share any of your custom reports there.

420
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.890
They'll just get a template they won't see any of your data so couple of.

421
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:17.240
Or just one real limitation that you should be aware of.

422
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:23.640
Customer reports is they will not let you pare metrics and dimensions of different scopes.

423
00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:29.590
So when you add dimensions in metrics just make sure they're of the same scope or no data will appear

424
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.900
in the report and read.

425
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:39.640
That means that the dimension and the metrics should both have the hit user session or product scope.

426
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.670
We discuss that in more detail.

427
00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:49.090
When we looked at custom dimensions so that wraps up the steps on the benefits of using custom reports

428
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:56.350
for analysis in Google Analytics now that we have looked at advanced analysis tools and techniques.

429
00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:04.440
Let's move on to the final section and really look at how Google Analytics can be used to enhance remarketing

430
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.690
campaigns.

431
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:14.150
So let's go through these steps and benefits of using your Google Analytics data to augment your marketing

432
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.290
campaigns.

433
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:21.890
So remarketing is a powerful marketing tool that allows you to show targeted ads to bring users back

434
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.280
to web site and encourage a conversion.

435
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:31.320
And here are some example remarketing ads you might visit a web site then you're on a different Web

436
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:37.370
site later on and you see the ads kind of popping back up maybe even offering you a coupon to come back

437
00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:40.590
and to make a purchase.

438
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:45.470
So the benefits of marketing are that generally they have higher conversion rates.

439
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:50.990
Somebody who's already educated themselves about your product or service is one step further into the

440
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:55.050
buying cycle than those who visit your site for the first time.

441
00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:01.700
And as a result they have higher conversion rates generally remarketing also has lower cost per clicks

442
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:08.780
because those higher conversions translate to a faster return on your investments and really lower the

443
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.090
cost for sale.

444
00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:17.120
And with three marketing campaigns as well you can also have really targeted ad copy and for someone

445
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:24.500
who's already visited your web site you can change the copy from say are you interested in widgets too.

446
00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.690
Are you still in need of widgets.

447
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.100
And check out some widgets you've missed.

448
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:35.420
Obviously that's just an example but it's much more targeted towards someone who's been to your site.

449
00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.690
So what are the benefits of remarketing in Google Analytics.

450
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:46.460
Well you can actually set up remarketing in Google ads but it's the integration with Google Analytics

451
00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.370
that offers some options to augment your Google Ads remarketing.

452
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:56.930
And the first main benefit is that you can create remarketing lists so the audiences that you'll be

453
00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:03.710
remarketing to you can create them straight from your analytics data and you can build audiences from

454
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:10.010
your analytics data and retarget them based on the pages that they've visited their site engagement

455
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:15.350
like the time on site their page views per session their site activity like whether they've completed

456
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.590
certain events or goals or e-commerce transactions.

457
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:24.780
And also based on their demographics like their interest or their age or their gender.

458
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:31.820
So you couldn't really get specific in and target people not only who have been to your site but also

459
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:39.110
who have completed voluble actions like goals and you can even use those segments as remarketing audience

460
00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.600
as well.

461
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.760
So there's also no need to modify your site code.

462
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:49.030
Remarketing in ad words does require you to add the remarketing tag to your Web site.

463
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:54.500
But you just need to enable remarketing one click in the oddments settings and then you're ready to

464
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.190
go for standard remarketing.

465
00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:02.530
Let's go through the steps to set up stand remarketing and the first step is to link your Google onsight

466
00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:07.970
can't and you can do that in the admin section of your Google Analytics you can't just click on the

467
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.910
add linking section.

468
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:17.300
Second step is to go into the admin section into tracking info come in and dead collection and just

469
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:23.450
make sure that you have enabled remarketing an advertising reporting features.

470
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.740
Step number three then is to add a new remarketing audience.

471
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.620
These are the people that you really be remarketing your ads to.

472
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:37.850
So to do that come down into the admin section under audience definitions you'll see the audience section

473
00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:41.600
there and just click on Add a new audience.

474
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.580
Step number four then is to define your remarketing audience and there are three options.

475
00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:53.330
First is that you can select from a list of pre-defined audiences that will be there in Google Analytics

476
00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:00.230
or you can create a new audience from scratch where you can import a segment and really to create a

477
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:01.310
new audience.

478
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.950
It's actually very similar to the segment builder that you're already familiar with.

479
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:10.070
And then the final step is to publish the audience to google ads.

480
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:16.250
You'll see an estimated audience size and then you can just click publish and that audience list will

481
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:24.410
populate into Google ads and then you can use that in Google ads to create a campaign and remarket to

482
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.040
those specific audiences.

483
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:32.810
So a couple of limits and caveats about remarketing that you should be aware of remarketing audience

484
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:37.160
must include a minimum of 100 unique users before it can be used.

485
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:47.240
The maximum duration a user can be included in a remarketing audience is 540 days since Web site remarketing

486
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.640
utilizes browser cookies.

487
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:56.130
If a user clears their browser cookies they will no longer be a part of the remarketing audience you've

488
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.270
created until they visit your site again.

489
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:06.350
And that really wraps up these steps on the benefits of using Google Analytics as part of your marketing

490
00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:13.340
campaigns and that really wraps up this training as well as a quick recap we have covered advanced configuration

491
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:19.130
settings like custom dimension's custom metrics event tracking and other useful configurations across

492
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.190
the main tracking and user IDs.

493
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.630
We also looked at advanced analysis tools and techniques like segment's multi-channel phone reports

494
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.070
and customer reports.

495
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:34.550
Finally we finished up there looking at how you can use Google Analytics to really and hands free marketing

496
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.540
campaigns.

497
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.370
So I hope this course is taken.
