If you are watching this video then congratulations because now you are ready to take the Google Analytics

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.740
certification exam.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.950
By now you've completed the training you've completed the practice test.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.510
You've got a complete overview of the exam and the only step left now is to actually go ahead and take

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.630
the exam.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.980
So as a reminder how to do that.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.780
Firstly log into your academy for ads it can't come into the browse section here in the sidebar come

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.000
down and click on Google Analytics.

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.600
Click on Google Analytics individual qualification and then you'll see the link there to go ahead and

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.110
take the exam.

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.350
Now a couple of reminders once again it is an open book exam.

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.310
So I would recommend you have that analytics help center open to help you at any hard questions.

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.480
And also your damn Google Analytics demo can do your own Google Analytics account and of course Google

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.340
can be helpful as well.

15
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.420
So remember that you can retake the exam for free as many times as you want.

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.980
If you don't pass but I think at this stage you're going to be feeling very confident and I have no

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.700
doubt that you're gonna pass with flying colors.

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.080
So best of luck in the exam and I'll see you in the next section.

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.650
I'm going to show you how to promote your Google Analytics certification on LinkedIn and network.
