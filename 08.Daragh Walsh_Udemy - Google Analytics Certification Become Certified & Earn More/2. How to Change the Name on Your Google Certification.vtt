If you would like to change the name on your marketing certification from Google the process is very

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.490
very simple.

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.440
You might have put in the nickname or just your initials and to make it really look official you want

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.610
your correct name so you can see here it says My name is David Walsh.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.770
Actually my name is Dara wells so I'll walk you through the steps to change it so you can see the full

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.930
process.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.280
So the first step to change your name on your marking certification from Google is to log into your

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.010
academy friends account.

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.460
Click on my profile.

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:41.170
Open the top right hand corner then click on edit profile and then click on change your name so in here

11
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.510
what we're doing is actually changing the name on your Google account so you can sign in or click on

12
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.150
personal information.

13
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.310
Click on name and then just edit your name to how you want it to be.

14
00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:04.580
Then you can click on done confirm and then which you want to do is come on back to your academy for

15
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.310
ads at Kent.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.720
So if we come back in here let's refresh the page and see if changed.

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.260
Not yet.

18
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:20.810
So what I recommend you do is you actually clear the history from your browser and it does not matter

19
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.470
what browser you're using just clear the history and the cache then come back in you're probably gonna

20
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.940
have to sign back into academies for ads again.

21
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.340
So just go ahead and do that.

22
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.890
And then once you sign back in you can see that the name has been changed.

23
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.760
If I come back and look at my profile and I look at the certification you can see now it shows my correct

24
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.470
name.

25
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.980
So that is the process to change the name on your marketing certification from Google.

26
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.510
It's very very simple.

27
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.120
So go ahead and do that if you need to do so.
