1
00:00:00,664 --> 00:00:03,664
So there's one last thing to do.

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:07,694
At the moment, the files we're using such as header.jsp,

3
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:11,694
errorpage.jsp, and index.jsp are publicly available.

4
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:14,709
This means that somebody within the browser could send

5
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,724
a request directly to those pages.

6
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:21,694
So they could do something like this,

7
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:23,674
and that doesn't work because we haven't set the name.

8
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:26,674
And to the set the name we have to go through the controller.

9
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:34,704
The same applies to errorpage.jsp.

10
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:36,654
And again, we end up with some,

11
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,714
we get output here because the exception object hasn't been set

12
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:42,664
and we're not using this as an error page.

13
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:47,634
The way we hide the pages is by moving them into the WEB-INF directory.

14
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:52,664
Anything in the WEB-INF directory is not publicly available.

15
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,724
So back in the app, if we take these three pages,

16
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:59,634
we pick them, we just move them into WEB-INF.

17
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:03,684
We need to check that in web.xml the error-page is

18
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:06,714
set to be at WEB- INF.errorpage, which it is.

19
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:10,634
We also need to make sure that in ControllerServlet,

20
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:19,724
we are now getting a RequestDispatcher for /WEB-INF/ index.jsp.

21
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:21,714
And then we can redeploy the application.

22
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,654
Once the app has been redeployed,

23
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:26,724
within the browser if I try and access errorpage.jsp,

24
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:37,714
it's no longer available and I can't get to WEB-INF/ errorpage.jsp.

25
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:41,654
If I go back to the servlet, the page is still available,

26
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:45,724
so we're still hitting index.jsp, but it's now in the WEB-INF directory.

27
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:50,664
And if I try and send a request to home,

28
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:54,674
and this was the request we used previously to fire off the error handler,

29
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:59,634
we again hit the error page, and the error message is displayed correctly.

30
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:03,411
And this is typically how you build an MVC application using the

31
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:05,654
foundations of servlets and JavaServer Pages,

32
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:16,000
by making sure the JavaServer Pages are only used as part of the view and only available indirectly through a servlet.
