00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,099
So, we've seen filters in the previous chapter.

2
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:09,059
Filters can also be asynchronous, but the mechanism is very similar to servlets.

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,109
So again, we mark the filters being asynchronous,

4
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:14,049
we grab the context from the request object,

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:16,979
and we do any work we need to asynchronously inside the servlet

6
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:20,139
before chaining the request further down the call.

7
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:27,099
So in summary, the Servlet 3 specification introduced asynchronous behavior.

8
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:32,129
We can write asynchronous servlets, we can write asynchronous filters.

9
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:38,059
However, be careful when you're using asynchronous calls inside of a container.

10
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,723
You may simply end up offloading the call from one

11
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:43,049
thread to another with no real benefit.

12
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:46,004
The servlet container may end up using another thread that

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,099
could simply be used for other requests.

14
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:52,458
You may be better creating a thread pool yourself and

15
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,109
handling the request off that thread pool.

16
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:00,000
That's the end of the class. Thank you for joining me, and I hope you've enjoyed it.
