(Music) Hi everyone.

2
00:00:05.597 --> 00:00:07.090
My name is Kevin Jones.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.060
Welcome to my course, Java Web Fundamentals.

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.060
I am a developer and owner at Rock Solid Knowledge,

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.080
a software development company based in the United Kingdom.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.010
Servlets and JavaServer Pages are the cornerstone of web development in Java,

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.708
and developing web applications in many frameworks requires

8
00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:30.000
an understanding of these technologies.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.010
This course is an in-depth look at the fundamentals of web development in Java.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.388
Some of the major topics we will cover include using

11
00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:41.030
servlets to build web applications in Java,

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.020
using JavaServer Pages to return HTML content,

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.276
using servlets and JavaServer Pages together to build

14
00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:53.020
well-structured web applications, using filters to compress data,

15
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.030
and using event handlers to respond to lifecycle events from the web container.

16
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.000
By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of servlets,

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.030
filters, events, and JavaServer Pages,

18
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.000
and how to bring them together to build web applications.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.070
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with programming in Java.

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.512
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn servlet-based

21
00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:26.000
programming with the Java Web Fundamentals course, at Pluralsight.
