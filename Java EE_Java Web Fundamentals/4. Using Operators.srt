1
00:00:01,443 --> 00:00:05,373
So while the expression language is not a full-blown language,

2
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,393
it does define a set of operators that you can use within the language.

3
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:10,393
So for example it has mathematical operators,

4
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:13,928
plus, minus, div, mod, etc., it has logical operators,

5
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:18,383
so and, not, or, and it has this thing called the empty operator,

6
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:21,433
and the empty operator can be used to check if the value of something is empty.

7
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:25,463
So an empty string, a null value, 0 maybe.

8
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:29,463
These are typically used in conjunction with tags.

9
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:33,453
When we talk about writing tags a little later, we'll see more examples of this.

10
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:36,393
We can see some simple examples now.

11
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:40,423
So the expression language operators are typically used with tag libraries.

12
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,393
When we talk about the standard tag library in the next module,

13
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,433
we'll see the use of operators there.

14
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:48,393
However, just to show how these things work,

15
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:55,413
within the page here, if we add an h2 element,

16
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:59,423
and then in here add an expression,

17
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:05,433
and say something like user.name is equal to Kevin.

18
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:09,453
So user.name comes in here, that has the value Kevin,

19
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:12,423
so this should print out the value true.

20
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:19,393
So if we go to the browser, sure enough, the value true appears.

21
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:21,423
We can do the same thing with some other expressions.

22
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:29,433
So we could print out for example, the value of 3+2, comes out to be 5.

23
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:35,433
We could compare 3 and 2, and that will come out as false,

24
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:38,423
and as we saw, there are other operators that we can use within the page.

25
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:40,463
Again, just to emphasize, these are simple operators,

26
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:48,000
doesn't make this a full-blown language, but it does make certain things easier within the page.
