1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:10,355
So now that we have multiple tags, we need to think about packaging.

2
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:17,325
Tag files, and indeed other tags, are packaged into things called tag libraries,

3
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:22,345
and tag libraries are JAR files, hence the need for a separate project.

4
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:29,335
So here, we have a taglib project, and that taglib project is set up in a Maven,

5
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:32,355
and indeed in IntelliJ, to build into a JAR file,

6
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:37,295
and that JAR file will then be included along with the web app itself.

7
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:40,524
This project is set up to have a source directory with a main and

8
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,335
inside here resources with a META-INF folder.

9
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:46,041
And we are doing that because if we want to include tag files

10
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:50,275
inside a JAR inside the library itself, inside tag library,

11
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:55,265
we need to put those type files into the META-INF folder.

12
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:57,305
So to do that, inside the META-INF folder,

13
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:03,305
we create a new directory and call this tags.

14
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:05,335
And into there, we can simply place one of our tags.

15
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:09,265
So we'll take the helloworld.tag that we created here,

16
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:15,335
so that was down inside main, webapp, WEB-INF tags,

17
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:21,285
so I can take my helloworld.tag, cut that out of there,

18
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:25,325
and place it into here.

19
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:30,355
And that tag is now part of this library.

20
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:35,265
Unfortunately, creating a tag library is not quite as simple as that.

21
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:38,335
We also need something called a tag library descriptor file.

22
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:42,168
And the tag library descriptor file tells the user of the tag

23
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:47,011
library how to use the tag library itself and what tags are

24
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:50,355
available within that tag library.

25
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:53,355
So the tag library descriptor file, or the TLD,

26
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:57,325
is an XML file that also lives in that META-INF folder.

27
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:08,345
So in here, we can do New, File, and we call this thing taglib.tld.

28
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:13,345
So the tld file has a taglib root element.

29
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:18,265
And then this contains some subelements to describe the tag file.

30
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:21,305
So these elements are the version of this library

31
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:24,295
the short name for the library, the URI,

32
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:26,355
and this is how the library is uniquely identified,

33
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:31,315
and then the JSP version of this library is 4.

34
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:35,285
And we can start that at 2.2, that's the latest version.

35
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:40,275
Within the tld, within the taglib element, we can describe two sorts of tags.

36
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:42,345
We can describe tag files, which we looked at already,

37
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,315
and we'll have one of those in a moment,

38
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,325
and we can describe tags that are written in Java,

39
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:49,315
which we'll do in a little while.

40
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:52,355
To describe a tag file as part of this library,

41
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:58,325
we use the tag-file element, which unfortunately shows up in red inside IntelliJ,

42
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:01,355
but it is a valid element.

43
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:11,355
Tag-file has a name, so we can say name, which can be helloworld for our tag.

44
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:16,325
And then the tag-file has a path,

45
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:19,345
and that's the path within this JAR where this tag file lives.

46
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:38,325
So that's going to be /META-INF/tags/ helloworld.tag.

47
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:43,295
So we use this tag library in the same way we use the core tag library.

48
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:49,265
So back in the JSP page where currently we have a reference to the core library,

49
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:55,265
I can copy and paste that, maybe change the prefix from c to let's say m,

50
00:03:55,265 --> 00:04:00,315
and then in here we can say http:// mantiso.com /simple.

51
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:02,988
So that'll give us access to the library.

52
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:12,285
This is showing red, so down here we can see where the helloworld tag is.

53
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,355
This is still referenced using the st prefix.

54
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:21,424
So if we change that to say m and change this here

55
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:27,285
to say m on the closing element, and then change the username to say Alice,

56
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:30,285
just to prove that we are now using a slightly different tag.

57
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:35,265
Now I do need to redeploy this as we've actually built the JAR file.

58
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,295
So, I need to redeploy and then we can go to the browser.

59
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,305
So let's redeploy first.

60
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:42,295
So I go to the browser and go to the Profile page.

61
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,275
And here it says hello Alice.

62
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:49,265
So, to prove that we are using this tag library,

63
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:52,034
if we go back to the application and go to the helloworld tag

64
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:57,275
and change this so it says Hello name..., say,

65
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:10,265
and then back on the JSP page, and then here say name=$ user.name,

66
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:14,265
redeploy, and then go back to the browser,

67
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:17,295
refresh, go to the Profile tab.

68
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,265
And sure enough, it says hello Kevin with dot dot dot,

69
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:27,000
so that dot dot dot is coming from the tag library itself. So we can clear the tag file actually inside our tag library.
