1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:08,131
For the IDEs for this class, I'll be using IntelliJ IDEA and also Eclipse.

2
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:11,943
To download these, you can get IntelliJ IDEA from jetbrains.com,

3
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:16,131
again simply follow the links there to the Download tab.

4
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:19,091
From here you can download one of two editions,

5
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:20,161
the Ultimate Edition, which is a paid-for,

6
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,171
and the Community Edition, which is free,

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,469
although the Ultimate Edition does give you a free 30-day trial,

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,141
so well worth trying that.

9
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:28,290
For Eclipse,

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,091
simply go to eclipse.org /downloads and you'll want to grab the EE Edition.

11
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:37,081
Again, make sure you grab the right one for your platform.

12
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,101
In this class you're running on Windows,

13
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,131
but there's Eclipse versions for Mac and for Linux.

14
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:45,091
As we are building Java web applications,

15
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:48,101
we'll need to run the applications on a web server.

16
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:52,171
The web server we'll be using for this class is Tomcat.

17
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,005
Tomcat used to be the reference implementation for the

18
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,141
Servlet and JavaServer Pages APIs.

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,111
It's no longer that.

20
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,171
It has been kicking around for a number of years and it's now at version 8.

21
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:06,121
For this class we'll be using version 7.

22
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:11,081
And again, you can grab that from tomcat.apache .org.

23
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:18,171
Go to the Download section for Tomcat 7 and just grab the zip file for this.

24
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:22,101
Unzip the zip file into the appropriate location.

25
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:26,131
Once you've done that, you again have to set a couple of environment variables.

26
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:31,081
Set CATALINA_HOME and point that at the location you've installed Tomcat,

27
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,925
and add CATALINA_HOME\bin to your path to make sure you

28
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:39,081
can run Tomcat from the command line.

29
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:43,970
Once you've done that, you can go to a command prompt and run catalina,

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,111
and it should just show that Tomcat is installed and able to run.

31
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:54,161
And to start Tomcat, you'll do catalina start.

32
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:59,111
And this will kick off an instance of Tomcat.

33
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:02,068
At this point, Tomcat should be running on port 8080,

34
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:17,000
so we can go to a browser and open an address on localhost:8080. And we should see the Tomcat home page.
