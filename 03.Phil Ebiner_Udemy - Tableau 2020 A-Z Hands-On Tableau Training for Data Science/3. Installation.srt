00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome back to the course and tableau.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,770
And in today's tutorial we're going to install tableau on our computer.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,230
So when do we need to install tableau.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,570
Well the only thing that it will need is a browser.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,760
So let's go ahead and bring it up and where you'll need to proceed to is w w w dot tableau dot com.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,550
Now you have two options here.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,050
You can install Tableau and get a demo version of tableau.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,190
That's of course if you don't have a full license of Tableau already.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,050
If you have a full license of tableau really then you can proceed with the first option and then use

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,100
your license.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,810
Otherwise if you don't have a full license you can either use a trial version of Tableau they provide

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:49,890
a 14 day trial or you can use Tableau Public which you can get at public dot tableau dot com.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,950
So we're going to start with option number one and then I'll explain a bit more about Tableau Public.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:05,470
Now what we need to click is the try and now button up at the top once we click that here we can download

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,560
our free trial.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,790
And in order to do that we're going to need to enter our e-mail and let's for argument's sake put an

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:21,830
email Test one two three at each email dot com and click download free trial and now as you can see

18
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,040
your tableau installation has started downloading.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,750
So I'm going to cancel this one because I really have tableau installed on my computer.

20
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,180
And also you will notice that there are a couple of versions so the version that's been downloaded is

21
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,510
the one that has been recognized for my computer that's a 64 bit Windows version if you need a 32 bit

22
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,000
version for Windows you can get it here or if you need the Mac version you can get it here as well.

23
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,870
But normally the website will recognize the correct version that you need and download that one right

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,920
away.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,440
So there you go and once you have downloaded the installation package just in so tableau select the

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,410
14 day free trial and proceed with the prompts.

27
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,720
After that you will get an icon on your desktop.

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,230
Now if you want to proceed with the Tableau Public version then you'll need to go to public dot tablet

29
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,640
dot com and tell the public is absolutely free.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,760
So it doesn't have any limitations in terms of the amount of days that you can use it for it's a completely

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
free software.

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,240
It does have a few slight restrictions for example you can cannot create extracts and you cannot save

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,400
files directly onto your computer you'll have to save them onto the public tab of public server.

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,180
But that is not a big hurdle in terms of completing this course you will be able to totally complete

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,660
this course.

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,810
I've done it myself.

37
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,590
I've created the most complex physicians in this course using Tableau Public.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,200
And you can totally do that as well.

39
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,390
The public is a very convenient tool it is free.

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,140
And it is often used by people like journalists and professions where they're not facing any sensitive

41
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,640
data where they just want to create some really interesting visualizations that they want to share of

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,330
the world.

43
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,160
So telling the public is a great option.

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,180
I often get asked What is the best way to take this course.

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,770
If the tableau trial has expired or if somebody decides that the trial is not long enough Tableau Public

46
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,340
is a great option to complete this course so select one of those to either select tableau I'll be using

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,680
Tableau the full version throughout this course or if you like to follow along exactly then select the

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,660
tableau full version if your trial has expired or you just want something that doesn't have a time limitation

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,330
golf table public and you'll be able to follow along with 99 percent of this course as well.

50
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,820
And once you've installed tableau you'll get a desktop I can just like this one so if you double click

51
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,150
it that'll bring up Tableau and this is what it looks like inside.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,320
And this is where we'll get to the fun stuff and we'll proceed with that in the further tutorials of

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,260
this course.

54
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,630
I can't wait to see you next time.

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,490
And until then happy analyzing.
