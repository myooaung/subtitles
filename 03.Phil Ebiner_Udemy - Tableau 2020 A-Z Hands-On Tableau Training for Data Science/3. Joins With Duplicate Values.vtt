00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.789
Hello and welcome back and in today's

2

00:00:07.789  -->  00:00:07.799

3

00:00:07.799  -->  00:00:09.110
tutorial we will be looking at

4

00:00:09.110  -->  00:00:09.120

5

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:11.180
duplicates and joints. And by that we

6

00:00:11.180  -->  00:00:11.190

7

00:00:11.190  -->  00:00:13.580
mean what happens when the column that

8

00:00:13.580  -->  00:00:13.590

9

00:00:13.590  -->  00:00:15.950
we're joining on has duplicate values in

10

00:00:15.950  -->  00:00:15.960

11

00:00:15.960  -->  00:00:18.800
one of the tables. In today's example

12

00:00:18.800  -->  00:00:18.810

13

00:00:18.810  -->  00:00:20.689
we'll be looking at two tables, table A

14

00:00:20.689  -->  00:00:20.699

15

00:00:20.699  -->  00:00:24.560
and table B. Table A lists orders that

16

00:00:24.560  -->  00:00:24.570

17

00:00:24.570  -->  00:00:26.570
were conducted for some shop.

18

00:00:26.570  -->  00:00:26.580

19

00:00:26.580  -->  00:00:28.519
It specifies the region and their status

20

00:00:28.519  -->  00:00:28.529

21

00:00:28.529  -->  00:00:30.410
so whether they were unpaid or whether

22

00:00:30.410  -->  00:00:30.420

23

00:00:30.420  -->  00:00:33.740
they were paid. Table B list the same

24

00:00:33.740  -->  00:00:33.750

25

00:00:33.750  -->  00:00:36.709
orders but an itemized description of

26

00:00:36.709  -->  00:00:36.719

27

00:00:36.719  -->  00:00:39.560
those orders so, it lists the order

28

00:00:39.560  -->  00:00:39.570

29

00:00:39.570  -->  00:00:41.600
number, the item that was sold within

30

00:00:41.600  -->  00:00:41.610

31

00:00:41.610  -->  00:00:43.819
that order and the sales that were

32

00:00:43.819  -->  00:00:43.829

33

00:00:43.829  -->  00:00:46.310
generated through the sale of that item

34

00:00:46.310  -->  00:00:46.320

35

00:00:46.320  -->  00:00:49.160
and as you can see orders in table B can

36

00:00:49.160  -->  00:00:49.170

37

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:51.229
be duplicated because some orders

38

00:00:51.229  -->  00:00:51.239

39

00:00:51.239  -->  00:00:53.720
consists of several items for example

40

00:00:53.720  -->  00:00:53.730

41

00:00:53.730  -->  00:00:56.360
order number one consists of a chair and

42

00:00:56.360  -->  00:00:56.370

43

00:00:56.370  -->  00:00:59.389
desk and so we're going to be looking at

44

00:00:59.389  -->  00:00:59.399

45

00:00:59.399  -->  00:01:01.970
an example of an inner joint between

46

00:01:01.970  -->  00:01:01.980

47

00:01:01.980  -->  00:01:03.650
these two tables. So basically we want to

48

00:01:03.650  -->  00:01:03.660

49

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:07.550
take the order number from table A and

50

00:01:07.550  -->  00:01:07.560

51

00:01:07.560  -->  00:01:11.240
use that to join table A to table B. Also

52

00:01:11.240  -->  00:01:11.250

53

00:01:11.250  -->  00:01:13.399
an order number so basically we want to

54

00:01:13.399  -->  00:01:13.409

55

00:01:13.409  -->  00:01:15.859
connect the status of the order weather

56

00:01:15.859  -->  00:01:15.869

57

00:01:15.869  -->  00:01:18.200
was paid or unpaid to the item and the

58

00:01:18.200  -->  00:01:18.210

59

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:20.719
sales of the order and currently this

60

00:01:20.719  -->  00:01:20.729

61

00:01:20.729  -->  00:01:22.429
information is contained within two

62

00:01:22.429  -->  00:01:22.439

63

00:01:22.439  -->  00:01:24.380
separate tables. We want to bring it

64

00:01:24.380  -->  00:01:24.390

65

00:01:24.390  -->  00:01:26.780
together. From this image, you can see

66

00:01:26.780  -->  00:01:26.790

67

00:01:26.790  -->  00:01:29.630
that when we join the two tables on the

68

00:01:29.630  -->  00:01:29.640

69

00:01:29.640  -->  00:01:32.149
order number, there will be two matches

70

00:01:32.149  -->  00:01:32.159

71

00:01:32.159  -->  00:01:34.670
in the second table to order number one.

72

00:01:34.670  -->  00:01:34.680

73

00:01:34.680  -->  00:01:36.980
There will be one match in the second

74

00:01:36.980  -->  00:01:36.990

75

00:01:36.990  -->  00:01:39.050
table to order number two. There will be

76

00:01:39.050  -->  00:01:39.060

77

00:01:39.060  -->  00:01:42.560
three matches to order number three in

78

00:01:42.560  -->  00:01:42.570

79

00:01:42.570  -->  00:01:44.480
the second table and there's no matches

80

00:01:44.480  -->  00:01:44.490

81

00:01:44.490  -->  00:01:46.429
for order number four so because this is

82

00:01:46.429  -->  00:01:46.439

83

00:01:46.439  -->  00:01:49.280
an inner join this row will be

84

00:01:49.280  -->  00:01:49.290

85

00:01:49.290  -->  00:01:52.670
discarded from the final result and what

86

00:01:52.670  -->  00:01:52.680

87

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:55.100
will happen now is as you can see

88

00:01:55.100  -->  00:01:55.110

89

00:01:55.110  -->  00:01:58.010
there's less rows in the table and left

90

00:01:58.010  -->  00:01:58.020

91

00:01:58.020  -->  00:02:00.440
then on the table the right. So every

92

00:02:00.440  -->  00:02:00.450

93

00:02:00.450  -->  00:02:02.990
time there's a multiple match, the tear

94

00:02:02.990  -->  00:02:03.000

95

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:05.690
the rows that have been matched multiple

96

00:02:05.690  -->  00:02:05.700

97

00:02:05.700  -->  00:02:08.359
times will be replicated. So duplicated or

98

00:02:08.359  -->  00:02:08.369

99

00:02:08.369  -->  00:02:10.910
triplicated and so on. So in this

100

00:02:10.910  -->  00:02:10.920

101

00:02:10.920  -->  00:02:12.860
particular case, the final table will

102

00:02:12.860  -->  00:02:12.870

103

00:02:12.870  -->  00:02:13.809
look like this.

104

00:02:13.809  -->  00:02:13.819

105

00:02:13.819  -->  00:02:17.020
And as you can see here some rows of the

106

00:02:17.020  -->  00:02:17.030

107

00:02:17.030  -->  00:02:19.059
table on the left have been duplicated

108

00:02:19.059  -->  00:02:19.069

109

00:02:19.069  -->  00:02:20.920
to match the number of rows in the table

110

00:02:20.920  -->  00:02:20.930

111

00:02:20.930  -->  00:02:22.509
on the right and that's completely

112

00:02:22.509  -->  00:02:22.519

113

00:02:22.519  -->  00:02:23.289
normal.

114

00:02:23.289  -->  00:02:23.299

115

00:02:23.299  -->  00:02:26.530
So this is the way the final table will

116

00:02:26.530  -->  00:02:26.540

117

00:02:26.540  -->  00:02:29.110
look in our output. So that's what

118

00:02:29.110  -->  00:02:29.120

119

00:02:29.120  -->  00:02:30.879
happens when there are duplicate values

120

00:02:30.879  -->  00:02:30.889

121

00:02:30.889  -->  00:02:33.039
in the column that we're joining on. I

122

00:02:33.039  -->  00:02:33.049

123

00:02:33.049  -->  00:02:34.569
hope you enjoy today's tutorial, and I

124

00:02:34.569  -->  00:02:34.579

125

00:02:34.579  -->  00:02:40.629
look forward to seeing you next time.
