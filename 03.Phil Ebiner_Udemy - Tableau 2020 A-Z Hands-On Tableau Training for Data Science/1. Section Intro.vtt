00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:05.940
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo and I'm sure that somewhere deep down at the bottom of

2

00:00:05.940  -->  00:00:09.930
your heart you knew that inevitably this section would come up.

3

00:00:10.020  -->  00:00:16.560
This section is on Dodik cleaning and data preparation and because we are working with daughter we're

4

00:00:16.560  -->  00:00:23.160
visualizing it and we're interrogating is we're performing dotter explorations and so on.

5

00:00:23.250  -->  00:00:29.080
Of course we have to prepare our daughter first before we do anything with it.

6

00:00:29.100  -->  00:00:35.220
And from my experience the work of a data scientist involves at least 70 percent 70 percent of the time

7

00:00:35.540  -->  00:00:40.880
you are preparing data you cleaning it you're getting rid of all the noise you're putting it together

8

00:00:40.890  -->  00:00:46.560
you're trying to understand it you're formatting in the right way for the right tools and so on.

9

00:00:46.560  -->  00:00:49.820
So that is pretty much 70 percent of our work.

10

00:00:49.830  -->  00:00:56.040
And of course this subject now came up in Tablo but I'm very excited for you that you are watching this

11

00:00:56.040  -->  00:01:01.990
section and not just skipping over it because it is a very important topic when working with Tablo.

12

00:01:02.220  -->  00:01:07.800
And moreover starting from Tableau version 9 a lot of new features were introduced that allow you to

13

00:01:07.950  -->  00:01:12.130
simplify the process of cleaning and preparing your daughter for analysis.

14

00:01:12.210  -->  00:01:18.090
And I want to make sure that you take advantage of these new features in your work.

15

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:24.360
So we'll be talking about tools like the daughter interpreter in Tablo we will be talking about pivoting

16

00:01:24.360  -->  00:01:31.320
our data splitting our daughter looking at the metadata grid and I also show you how to be prepared

17

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:37.740
for some errors that might come up when you're working with maps and geographical data and how to easily

18

00:01:38.160  -->  00:01:39.320
get rid of those errors.

19

00:01:39.480  -->  00:01:47.190
And as I find new things that I would like to convey to you through you know through in the coming months

20

00:01:47.400  -->  00:01:52.800
I will make sure to update this section so you're always prepared and you are at the top of your game

21

00:01:52.990  -->  00:01:58.920
with daughter preparation so that you can shave some time off of that data preparation and data cleaning

22

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:02.780
that you have to do before you can actually visualize and analyze your data.

23

00:02:02.970  -->  00:02:06.980
So it's going to be very powerful and useful section.

24

00:02:06.990  -->  00:02:08.930
And I look forward to seeing you throughout this tour.

25

00:02:09.060  -->  00:02:10.770
Until next time happy analyzing
