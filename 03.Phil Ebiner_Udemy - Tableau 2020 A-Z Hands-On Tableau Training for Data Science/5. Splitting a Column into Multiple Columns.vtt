Hello and welcome back to the course and tableaux in the British tutorial we learn how to pivot our

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.860
daughter.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.470
And today we will look at a feature which was introduced in Tableau 9 which is called split.

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.830
So this split feature allows you to split one column into multiple columns and to be frank it's not

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.690
very applicable in our specific case because our columns look as they should.

6
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.590
But I would just want to show you this feature because I think it can be very handy when you have certain

7
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.180
types of data.

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.400
For instance if you have customer data then you might have a column which has their full name but you

9
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.250
want to split it into first name and last name.

10
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.530
And so that can be easily done and we'll just have a look at an example with this column we'll be using

11
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.020
the regions column to perform this example even though we don't really we actually don't need to do

12
00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.370
this in the specific dataset but nevertheless just for argument's sake we'll pretend that this is a

13
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.260
name and surname and we will know what we want to split out the surname out of this data.

14
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.020
So let's assume that the last words.

15
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.980
So that comes after a space in this case America is the surname and everything before that is the first

16
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.360
name.

17
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.610
And you just want to split out the last the surname.

18
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.430
So in this case would be e in this case are Americans on.

19
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.190
So you can really easily do that.

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.240
All you have to do is once again click this dropdown select split and then say what who.

21
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.780
What's a word you want to split off.

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.100
So you want to split off the last one word into a column and use the separator which is in our case

23
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.500
is going to be a space click OK.

24
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.160
And there you go.

25
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.060
So you've got you've got the last word separated separated in song into its own column.

26
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.560
So here you've got a once again if there is only one where you'll take that word.

27
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.440
But in this case it's got America.

28
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.050
This case has got e and so on.

29
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.620
So let's do one on one more you can split

30
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.930
you can split what you can do is you can split all words but find all the words are separated by spaces

31
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.580
and we'll find all the words.

32
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.030
So here you go is put Europe new members into Europe new members Russia Turkey and other Europe Russia

33
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.080
Turkey and other Europe.

34
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.690
So as you can see that's a very powerful feature.

35
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.510
If your daughter is not prepared in the sense that it's got the name and surname for example in one

36
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.390
column and that can be very useful as well not only will excel files like Excel it's not that hard to

37
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.560
actually go into Excel and perform that split yourself here but sometimes you might be getting data

38
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.910
from a database or from other locations where you cannot make adjustments so before you if you do want

39
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.170
to make adjustments before you send it in to Tableau you would have to export it into Excel or some

40
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.620
other software make adjustments to their net taken and Tableau while you don't have to do that anymore.

41
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.280
Now you can just do all of this in tableau.

42
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.890
So there you go.

43
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.860
That's how to use the split function.

44
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.460
And next time we will look at metadata.

45
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.360
I look forward to seeing you on that tutorial and until then happy analyzing.
