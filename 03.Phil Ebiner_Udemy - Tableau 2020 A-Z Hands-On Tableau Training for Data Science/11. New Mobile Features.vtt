Hello and welcome back to the course and Tableau in a desert burial.

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.190
We're going to look at some new mobile features of Tableau what we actually can do is look at all of

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.450
this in practice.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.170
So let's bring up our dashboard that we've been creating.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.810
So there are some realisations right.

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.720
So let's say we want to create a dashboard.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.060
Let's put some of these visualizations into a dashboard while one of the ones that we had was powerful

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.680
is of course our cluster analysis of some trend lines.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.890
And also let's add that map that we created over here.

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.890
So let's say we have this dashboard and now we want to see what it would look like or optimize it for

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.450
different mobile devices.

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.270
How would we do it.

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.480
Well over here in the top left corner now you have a button device preview and you can just click that

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.550
and you can select from a desktop tablet phone so let's keep an eye on tablet for an hour and you can

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.960
actually select the specific different tablets that you or your managers or people in your company might

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.470
be using.

17
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.870
So for instance you can say generic tablet or iPad.

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.560
That's what it will look like on an iPad iPad mini.

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.020
Okay.

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.510
Same thing.

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
So Amazon Kindle Fire got more space.

22
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.030
Google Nexus 7 case it's more stretched out.

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.790
So it's giving you this box which you can adjust your dashboard to see you can recreate a dashboard

24
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.990
in a way that it will actually fit into this type of layout.

25
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.400
So there you can see though it's kind of like just showing you what it would look like.

26
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.220
You can also flip your flip the device what it would look like and also you can see if you have the

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.910
mobile app or not.

28
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.660
So let's say i pad less a and then we'll flip it and let's say unless there's some some galaxy tab and

29
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.610
then you either have the mobile app or not.

30
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.090
It's also different then you can change it to phone and you can like let's say iPhone 6 6 apps.

31
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.160
You can also adjust that if you like.

32
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.220
So it's a very very powerful feature.

33
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.960
And now if you also go into the size over here and sort of fixed size you can select automatic and then

34
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.590
it will fit your dashboard into the device so let's say for instance you don't need any of these because

35
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.420
they're not informative then and this is what it look like on an iPhone 6 as if you select automatic.

36
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.770
And then let's see if you go back to tablets.

37
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.740
This is all a look I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab or HTC nexus so you can see that if you leave an automatic

38
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.400
then and adjust to the to the layout and that is also a powerful feature just to kind of show you what

39
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.520
that would look like.

40
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.920
But at the same time you can always modify your dashboard and make it look fantastic on the device that

41
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.930
you're targeting.

42
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.120
Or make it so versatile that regardless of the device.

43
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.310
So for instance if you don't select automatic you say it's a fixed size or for instance you could even

44
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.230
do range right.

45
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.690
So you could do range and you could set some different sizes were in between which the dashboard would

46
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.220
adjust.

47
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.260
But that's kind of like more of an advance feature.

48
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.940
So to start off with you would probably play around with the fixed size select a look and feel for a

49
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.890
dashboard such that it would look good on different types of devices that potentially can be used in

50
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.910
your organization.

51
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.690
So that would definitely be helpful in terms of just understanding what exactly to expect from the different

52
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.940
devices because a lot of the time you might know that some devices use but you don't have it handy you

53
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.530
don't have it right in front of you to test these things out and this feature this new feature actually

54
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.230
allows you to very quickly assess what exactly is going to happen if your dashboard is open on this

55
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.430
device or on another device.

56
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.790
So hopefully you'll find this feature useful and I'll look forward to you next time.

57
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.370
Until then happy analyzing.
