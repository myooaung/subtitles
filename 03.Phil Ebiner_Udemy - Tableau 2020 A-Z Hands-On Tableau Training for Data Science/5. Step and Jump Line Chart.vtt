00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.850
Hello and welcome back to our course on Tableau.

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.430
In today's editorial we will look at our brand new business challenge as well as learn how to create

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.890
step and jump longshots.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.710
First let's start off by having a look at our business challenge.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.010
So we are looking at the New York state salary analysis.

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.330
Now you are required to build a visualization within tableau doing a million analysis of average salary

7
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.360
across industries for the state of New York.

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.200
The analysis needs to have the following firstly an average annual salary by county which needs to be

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.780
displayed on a map.

10
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.510
We need to show the top five highest earning industries by county and lastly include a time series analysis

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.200
of the average annual salary per county.

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.210
Now the client had some specific requirements and they do not they've mentioned that they do not want

13
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.770
to see separate graphs on different sheets and also don't want to work with the dashboard.

14
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250
So some limitations there.

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.060
Now they mentioned that they would like all information contained within a single sheet with pop up

16
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.230
charts while the map is being explored.

17
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.040
So we'll have to be innovative yet.

18
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.690
Let's have a look at the data that we are working with.

19
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.360
So if we have a look we can see that and the following school the Quarterly Census of Employment and

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.030
Wages annual data beginning 2000.

21
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.790
And this is a C is fall.

22
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.050
If we have a look at it into in excel we can see that it's got quite a number of rows.

23
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.290
If we scroll down and we have information relating to on different grade level levels of granularity

24
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.550
we are obviously only in interested in the average annual salary.

25
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.370
So we'll be ignoring the at the establishments the average employment and total wage we've got.

26
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.820
Yeah.

27
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.820
That it's for us so that will help us to build our time series analysis and then we have in two fields

28
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.940
equaled the ICAC in his title.

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.430
Now those are the North American Industry Classification System titles.

30
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.100
So what that means is that it has different levels so for one characters your highest level two characters

31
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.640
like a 1 and a 1 would be the second level 3 Go to your third level and so forth.

32
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.930
So something that has three characters and starting with one one would be related to agriculture these

33
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.410
are crop production these four or five would be related to that.

34
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.540
So we need to factor this into account when we work with our data to ensure that we work with the right

35
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.770
level.

36
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.990
Another complexity with this data is we've got different area types so we've got state.

37
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.540
We know we're looking for county we found county and there's a whole bunch of different levels again

38
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.260
of granularity that we work with so we've got our area type.

39
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.950
And then the area that that relates to.

40
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.710
So we'll have to do a bit of data cleaning.

41
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.430
Once we import this into tableau.

42
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470
So talking about that let's open tableau.

43
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.270
We will connect to this quite easily luckily this time by just using the text file because we know it's

44
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.890
a CSB and we will just open it.

45
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.170
We can see it reading properly.

46
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.370
There is nothing strange happening in this fall but now the clean up needs to happen.

47
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.600
Now we know the area type we're looking for is only county so we can just add a data source format by

48
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.140
looking at the area type and saying we only want County to be included in there.

49
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.740
All right.

50
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.900
And we can just change our area now big to be called County.

51
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.060
And we also know that this is a geographic roll so we can just change it right now and change it to

52
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.080
a county not a country but a county.

53
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.700
All right then let's look at the in C S codes or the industry.

54
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.810
So I'll just rename the industry because that's what we'll want in the end of the preparation of our

55
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.480
data but we will need to make sure to exclude everything on specific levels.

56
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.560
And for this specific one level two will be more than sufficient.

57
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.480
So that will be everything with two numbers there.

58
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.040
And actually this change this to the string because we'd it's not really a number we want to use this

59
00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.670
as a number.

60
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.610
So when there is a 2 characters in the string we would like to see that level that's agriculture for

61
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.610
instance and utilities and construction.

62
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.390
We don't really care about the low levels and we don't want to go up one level but how do we tell to

63
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.970
blow to only look at this level 2 so we can easily do that by creating a calculated field and then we'll

64
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.620
just call this level and then we'll use the line function.

65
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.020
So the lend function is for string functions and that's also why we change that to a string.

66
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.140
And if we just look at what Lane does it returns the number of characters in the given string.

67
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.090
So it just basically counts the number that's there.

68
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.060
So for instance that is level 2 because it's two characters less stable three because of the three characters.

69
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.410
And that's exactly what we wanted to add another yet another data source filter on level where we just

70
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.180
want to see Level 2 so we can exclude one when we can exclude three.

71
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.360
So just two and that reduces our information significantly in terms of the number of records.

72
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.890
And we did mention we don't really want these fields we won't really work with them.

73
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.190
So we can just hide them.

74
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.380
And that is what we'll work with.

75
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.500
So we've got our area top which we know is County.

76
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.180
We've got the county name.

77
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.270
Then also the actual level of the code which we are not going to use in the visualization but is needed

78
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.420
for the data cleanup.

79
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.570
And then also the industry the.

80
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.740
And the average annual salary.

81
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.070
Now let's actually create our first shot as well.

82
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.440
Without further ado.

83
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.870
So if we go into our first sheet we'll be looking at firstly creating the time series analysis.

84
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.150
So for that we know we need to put a year into columns because that we want our time series to run from

85
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.260
left to right.

86
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:48.060
And we know we want to have the average annual salary we can put that into rose but not aggregated to

87
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.880
some but aggregate it to average.

88
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.550
And we know that we can now see that what the average is over all counties and we'll break this down

89
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.650
later on into each specific county.

90
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.750
But for now this is our shot.

91
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.400
But what what do we know that declined once a specific detail on.

92
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.690
Is this trend every year and is not true.

93
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.110
It's nice to see the overall trend but it's not easy to distinguish you know what exactly the jump has

94
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.220
been or the the amount of increase or decrease has been or even any decrease as well.

95
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.210
You know there's one over there.

96
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.930
So in that case we could obviously go into our both and change the line to and this is where we found

97
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.260
our step and our jump charts.

98
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.800
So if we look at State for instance you can see it literally creates a resemblance of steps of a building.

99
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.020
So where it's easy then to see that where there was an increase in both these years there was a bigger

100
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.790
increase in 2003 than there was in 2000.

101
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.590
So those works really really well for discrete measures where you want to see the impact and even then

102
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.900
look out interesting that is there was a decline and we would not have seen that.

103
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.980
If I just undo that to our previous job that almost looks like a straight line doesn't look like it

104
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.690
decreased.

105
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.570
And the same we can do obviously with the jump lines but in this case I think this will look better

106
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:13.260
for visualization and then we can just call this our step line chart as simple as that and in the next

107
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.410
tutorial we will be building the rest of the visualizations and combining these and see how we can use

108
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.710
tool tips to our advantage in answering this brief.

109
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.570
I look forward to seeing you next time.

110
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.400
Until then happy analyzing.
