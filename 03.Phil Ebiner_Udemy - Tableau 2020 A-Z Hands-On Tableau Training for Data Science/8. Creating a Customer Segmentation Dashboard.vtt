00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.590
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau and in the previous tutorials we prepared all the worksheets

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.430
for our segmentation dashboard.

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.690
So we've got a map.

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.430
We've got gender split in a pie chart.

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.490
We've got two distributions one by age and one by balance.

6
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.120
And we've got a tree map of job classifications.

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.410
And today we're going to put all of this into one dashboard one powerful awesome looking dashboard.

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.830
And now that we've got them all prepared it's going to be quite quick and easy to put them all together

9
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.630
into one dashboard.

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.040
So let's go ahead and get started on it.

11
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.350
We're going to click this button here.

12
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.150
A new dashboard which brings up a new blank dashboard for us to work with.

13
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.220
Now if we wanted to we could change the size because it is a bit big and we could change to a different

14
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.830
size over here or select our own size.

15
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.530
But instead what I'm going to do is I'm just going to expand this window and now we will work with this

16
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.250
full space and fill it up of colors.

17
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.200
All right so we'll start by dragging our worksheets into this blank space so we'll take the map.

18
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.290
We'll drag it in here and then we'll take distribution by let's take balance and put it in here dispersion

19
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.860
by age or put in here as well.

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.400
Now as you can see some things are appearing on the right here some controls.

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.720
Obviously we don't need this one as we discussed we're not going to visually compare the different shades

22
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.800
of green.

23
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.370
Same thing for the blue.

24
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.030
The parameters appeared for us here as well.

25
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.420
Now we're going to take the gender will drag it in underneath this box over here.

26
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.550
Once again we don't need male female because it is very intuitive.

27
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.410
We made it intuitive blues male.

28
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.930
Pink is female and we'll get rid of the number of records as color or size legend completely not adding

29
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.290
any value here.

30
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.230
And we'll take job classification will drag it underneath here as well.

31
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.640
Job classification we don't need this legend because it is spelt out in our tree map.

32
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.330
Okay.

33
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.390
So that's our raw information in our dashboard which we can start working with now.

34
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.500
We're going to quickly make it look much better.

35
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.120
So it's format that a little bit.

36
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.030
Let's give these guys some more room maybe up to here.

37
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.620
Give the map a bit more room.

38
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.130
OK.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.760
What else.

40
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.250
So the tree map is a bit big.

41
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.490
The pie charts a bit small so if something's a bit small it's easy to fix it up here and then you just

42
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.360
go for pie charts specifically here you just go to the pie chart and you change the size.

43
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.770
So it just fits in your box.

44
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.160
Now we'll go to the tree map job classification and we will make this one smaller so we can work with

45
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.350
it further in dashboard.

46
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.310
So you're just generally always make something smaller first and then you make it bigger.

47
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.900
OK.

48
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.140
So there we go.

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.290
So sometimes you will get these elements that you can't reduce.

50
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.140
You can just go past it which you need to do is nudge this chart down with the chart above.

51
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.970
For instance like this or I just kind of reset everything to fit your needs at the bottom over here

52
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:32.140
so also what we need to do before we format this part of the chart is change the formatting here because

53
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.570
you can see it's not in line with everything else it's smaller.

54
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.880
So we're going to format legends and the title we're going to make it twelve and bold and perhaps the

55
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.660
font of the legend doesn't really have to be twelve but at least 10 and also bold.

56
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.840
And now if we do that there we go and you can see these parameters they collapse into this new format

57
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.380
which is good we're either either way works for us.

58
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:09.370
So basically if we have the space if we can move our chart a bit down I'd say our pie chart.

59
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.470
There we go.

60
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.330
Now we probably need to make the size a little bit smaller so that then the percentages are over the

61
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.950
chart itself.

62
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:27.010
And now perhaps we can make this one a bit bigger if there is a bit of like tedious clicking around.

63
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.010
But eventually you will get there.

64
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.660
There we go.

65
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.070
So that could work probably in this case we need to make these charts a bit smaller again.

66
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:49.440
Or the other option is to fix this up like this as it was just now so there we go probably that's that's

67
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.180
the better option because we don't need that much space for our parameter controls.

68
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.140
So that's how our dashboard looks at the moment.

69
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.030
We just have to look around and see if there is any anything that we would like to change perhaps maybe

70
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.580
rotate these labels.

71
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.030
And also you can see that the parameters do control your charts.

72
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.070
And at the same time the chart shrinks to fit inside the dashboard which is good.

73
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.590
One more thing is that if your parameter for some reason hasn't been added to the dashboard or you deleted

74
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.420
it it's very easy to bring it back.

75
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:33.150
So just cancel that and just as you would do if a filter you go not quick filters but go parameters

76
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.070
and you add the parameter back in.

77
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:43.560
So there we go and your parameters here so balance groups is above because suspicion by balances at

78
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.630
the top edge groups is at the bottom.

79
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.580
So we'll put that at the bottom.

80
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.350
That's pretty much it for the first part of the dashboard process in the next tutorial.

81
00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.450
We will make this dashboard interactive and adjust the colors a little bit for the dashboard to look

82
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.420
awesome.

83
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.620
I look forward to seeing you then.

84
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.470
And until next time I'll be analyzing.
