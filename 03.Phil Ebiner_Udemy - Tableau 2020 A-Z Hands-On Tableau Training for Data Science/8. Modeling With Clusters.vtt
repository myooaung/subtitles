00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.400
Hello and welcome back to the course and tablet in the previous tutorial.

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.740
We combined two data sets using a cross database join the first on us and came from an Excel file the

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.880
second one came from a CSB file and now we've got a new dataset with for the population column available

4
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.660
to us.

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.230
So let's go ahead and proceed back to our cluster analysis and refine it and see if this population

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.180
column can make a difference.

7
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.330
So there we go that's our cluster analysis I.

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.230
Duplicate this sheet.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.730
And now we're going to see how we can refine this analysis.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.490
Now all we need to do is we need to right click on clusters and select edit clusters so we don't even

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.240
have to add this new column population in charge of isolation we don't need to actually see it for it

12
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.680
to be included in the cluster analysis or into do is drag population into the list of variables for

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.890
our clusters click in here.

14
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.770
And as you can see right away now we have a different picture now based on these three variables.

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.630
If you think of it's like a three dimensional modelling exercise that's happening in the background

16
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
where Tableau is taking these three variables marketing spend revenue and population and it's looking

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.770
at those three variables it's understanding how to best group these observations into clusters based

18
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.300
on their proximity and then is just translating the result into colors on our two dimensional chart.

19
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.020
So basically we could keep putting in more variables in here.

20
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.380
Same would happen tableau would group them in a multidimensional space it'll be a five dimensional 10

21
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.490
dimensional space.

22
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.110
So it's just basically performing some mathematical calculations to understand what's the best way to

23
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.550
create groups of proximity of these observations and then is painting them for us here in colors on

24
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.070
our two dimensional dashboard resolution.

25
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.450
So it's just easier for us to assess.

26
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.220
So that's what's happening in the background.

27
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.900
And now let's have a look at the analytics that now we can perform as you can see a very different picture.

28
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.950
Before we had two groups and these elements were part of this bottom group over here now there's bottom

29
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.310
group is on its own.

30
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.880
And then you've got this yellow group which kind of overlaps the blue so even though for us they overlap

31
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.120
these two groups they overlap some of the orange yellow dots are above the blue and some of the blue

32
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.650
are below the yellow.

33
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.740
In reality this is because we don't see that third variable the population and we'll have a look at

34
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.120
a couple of examples just now of that.

35
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.110
So before we do that what are we to change is the actual representation of those visualization so let's

36
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.900
go to shape and change this from a circle to a field a circle and let's increase the size maybe something

37
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.910
like that.

38
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040
And now when colorless said some transparency.

39
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.970
So somewhere like that.

40
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.720
So we can actually better see what's going on.

41
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.110
And now let's take population and we'll just put it into detail so that it can cut it comes up when

42
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.820
we look at the pop up.

43
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.170
So let's start off this bottom set of observations.

44
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.900
So here you'll see that population is about one hundred thousand one hundred two hundred seven thousand

45
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.390
hundred eight hundred six hundred three thousand hundred five hundred nine hundred nine thousand so

46
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.180
around those numbers.

47
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.830
Now let's have a look at these here.

48
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.540
Population one hundred twenty six thousand are at thirty two hundred forty seven hundred twenty eight

49
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.290
hundred and forty.

50
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.080
And so on.

51
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.110
So in these orange dots a population is higher.

52
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.320
Now let's look at the blue dots.

53
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.830
Blue dots population is 200 171 here 197 200 here 213.

54
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.830
So as you can see the population in the blue dots is even higher than orange.

55
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.400
And that is how they're distinct.

56
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.170
So even though they're close here the the picture there are quite proximity is high.

57
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.480
So they're close to each other but at the same time they differ in a variable that we don't see on this

58
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.360
observation which is population and that is how tableau has assessed that there is actually three groups

59
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.810
here.

60
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.080
So the blue the yellow and the red and that is a great great step for us.

61
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.410
So first of all this the fact that this group is separate kind of confirms are thinking that population

62
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.360
does affect revenue so all of these cities they have a population of about 100.

63
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.480
So under one hundred and ten thousand people and therefore maybe the marketing efforts are not yielding

64
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.460
any additional results whereas these cities they have greater populations and therefore the marketing

65
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.990
efforts are actually maybe there is a correlation that why the marketing efforts are giving us results.

66
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.320
So now that we have these separate groups how do we enhance our analysis.

67
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.870
So yes that's a that's a great start but apart from us visually seeing that the groups are different

68
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.430
what are the differences in the trends and in order to look at the trends we good to go to the analytic

69
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.580
spend again and again we haven't spoken about trend lines in this chorus.

70
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.080
This is a more advanced topic it's something for loved ones of course and tableaux and if you want to

71
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.190
learn more about trend lines you're definitely welcome to check out my advanced course.

72
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.430
But we'll have a quick sneak peek into trend lines right now.

73
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.180
So all we need to do is take the trend line and just drag it onto the chart.

74
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.990
We're going to take it.

75
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.540
We're going to linear trend lines so we can just drag on to chart.

76
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.870
It will still create a linear trend line for us and what we can see here are the three trend lines for

77
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.950
these three clusters.

78
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.310
So what you can see for the red line for instance if you hover over it you'll see that the revenue.

79
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.760
So the formulas at the very top.

80
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.820
It says that the revenue is zero point ninety four times marketing spend plus sixteen thousand forty

81
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.080
three.

82
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.240
So basically what we're interested in here is this first bit.

83
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.650
So the slope.

84
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.240
And here it's ninety four point eighty four.

85
00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.680
So what that means is that for every dollar of marketing spend the revenue goes up by 94 cents.

86
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.380
So that's even less than by one dollar.

87
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.450
So basically you're losing money.

88
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.060
This is a dollar.

89
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.300
Let's not forget that this is revenue.

90
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.440
This is not profit.

91
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.490
So basically a marketing spend is going to come out as an expense from revenue if we talk about financial

92
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.150
terms.

93
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.470
But the main point here is that this coefficient is less than 1 meaning that for every dollar that you

94
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:25.310
invest into marketing in this cluster you're only according to this model you're only getting back was

95
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.170
90.

96
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.320
What does it ninety four cents of revenue whereas for the Orange cluster you're getting back seven dollars

97
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:40.520
32 cents for every dollar invested into marketing the revenue predicted revenue input or increase in

98
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.370
revenue is seven dollars 32 for the blue cluster.

99
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.070
Every dollar spent on marketing increases our revenue by three dollars and 17 cents.

100
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.100
So that is a very very powerful insight.

101
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.070
And I'll explain exactly why right now.

102
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:06.440
So this insight is so useful to us because let's have a look at these expansions that have been created.

103
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.900
So if I select new here.

104
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.920
First of all you can see that so many lines are being drawn right now and that is simply because Tableau

105
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.000
is recreating these trend lines for the highlighted features.

106
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.890
So it's as we shut off we'll just click on one of these trend lines are will click edit trend lines

107
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.540
and at the bottom we'll just uncheck Sheree calico line for highlighted or selected data points to click

108
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.880
Okay.

109
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.630
And now it won't recreate the trend lines for the highlighted data points.

110
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.020
So now from the dropdown just select new and there you can see our point.

111
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:44.330
So you can see that we have one of the new stores was opened and it is in terms of proximity and similarity

112
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.300
it is very similar to all these red ones that we already have.

113
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.000
So it has been operating for a bit weary you know what's the marketing spend is what revenue it generates.

114
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.010
And we can see that and based also on population it kind of falls in this category.

115
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:03.500
So from that we can drive that there's a high likelihood that if we keep investing into marketing if

116
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:09.020
we add another thousand dollars or another thousand dollars then not much is going to change because

117
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:15.410
this trend line is predicting that per every dollar that you add into marketing for this cluster you're

118
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:23.750
only getting 94 sense of revenue and increase in revenue at the same time we've got five stores or five

119
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:29.180
cities were opened that are very similar to the blue closer and four that are similar to the yellow

120
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.720
cluster.

121
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:37.550
And so the question is out of these 10 which ones would you recommend the CEO to invest money in marketing.

122
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.040
So that's that's the question to you.

123
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.770
Maybe pause this video and think about it.

124
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.710
Based on the analysis that we've performed which ones would you choose.

125
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.910
Obviously it's not the red one.

126
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.890
It's not the red one because it's in the very bad situation would you choose the blue ones or would

127
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.870
you choose the yellow ones let's say for example you can only choose three cities which three cities

128
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.160
would you choose would be orange ones would they be blue ones.

129
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.330
And that's a wonderful Australian on the power of clustering and trend lines when you put them together.

130
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.960
So if we just forget about the clusters or even forget about just the trend lines.

131
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.040
Right so if you forget about the clusters to start with.

132
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:19.260
So let's say this for instance this remove the trend line and so our unclear trend line and then Leslie

133
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.010
will remove the cluster.

134
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:26.900
So just from here you would perhaps pick one two three there top three or eight because they're generating

135
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.270
the most revenue these stores or you might say these three because they're generating a lot of revenue

136
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.540
but at the same time they're marking spend isn't that high.

137
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.250
No if you return the clusters you would probably look at these and you'd say All right.

138
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.060
So the blue cluster is obviously higher.

139
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:47.150
So I would still pick stories from more cities from the blue cluster.

140
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:53.360
But then if you return the trend lines now you can see that even though these are great cities great

141
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.050
locations.

142
00:09:54.050 --> 00:10:00.290
So if I select this again you'll see that these are great locations they're generating a lot of revenue

143
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:06.560
at the same time the trend line is for costing that per every dollar that you add into marketing you're

144
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.370
only getting three dollars of revenue increase.

145
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.550
Whereas if the orange ones even though they're right now they're a bit lower than the blue ones.

146
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.910
They're kind of a lower revenue generating area at the same time.

147
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.280
The trend line what is it.

148
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.500
Is forecasting is that for every single dollar that you invest in marketing you're getting back seven

149
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.050
dollars and 32 cents of revenue.

150
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:38.300
So obviously from this analysis it is pretty evident that the best stores are the cities out of these

151
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.480
highlighted wants to look at other orange ones.

152
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.460
So if you had to pick three stores or you had to prioritize them in a way that you invest your funds

153
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.300
into them then you would put the orange ones in the first place.

154
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.320
Of course there's four orange ones if you have to pick three then you have to do some additional analysis

155
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.210
or the CEO might have some additional knowledge about it but basically all of these orange ones and

156
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.730
they're in a great position in terms of what the clusters are telling us.

157
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.630
And in terms of what the trend lines are telling us.

158
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.520
So there we go.

159
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.640
This is a very powerful analysis that we can perform as you can see we refined our clusters using an

160
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.250
