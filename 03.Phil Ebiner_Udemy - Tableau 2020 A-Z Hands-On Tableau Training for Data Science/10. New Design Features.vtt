00:00:01.670  -->  00:00:06.610
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:06.610  -->  00:00:06.620

3

00:00:06.620  -->  00:00:08.379
Tableau. In today's tutorial we're going

4

00:00:08.379  -->  00:00:08.389

5

00:00:08.389  -->  00:00:11.200
to quickly look at some of the new

6

00:00:11.200  -->  00:00:11.210

7

00:00:11.210  -->  00:00:14.049
additional new features in Tableau 10.

8

00:00:14.049  -->  00:00:14.059

9

00:00:14.059  -->  00:00:15.940
So in this whole section we've already talked about

10

00:00:15.940  -->  00:00:15.950

11

00:00:15.950  -->  00:00:18.400
some really cool updates and upgrades

12

00:00:18.400  -->  00:00:18.410

13

00:00:18.410  -->  00:00:20.859
that Tableau has experienced and now

14

00:00:20.859  -->  00:00:20.869

15

00:00:20.869  -->  00:00:22.540
let's just have a look at some of the

16

00:00:22.540  -->  00:00:22.550

17

00:00:22.550  -->  00:00:24.970
other ones. So to start off with

18

00:00:24.970  -->  00:00:24.980

19

00:00:24.980  -->  00:00:26.590
here's an article about how the Tableau

20

00:00:26.590  -->  00:00:26.600

21

00:00:26.600  -->  00:00:28.900
team came up with the new color palettes?

22

00:00:28.900  -->  00:00:28.910

23

00:00:28.910  -->  00:00:32.499
As you have noticed, if you've worked in

24

00:00:32.499  -->  00:00:32.509

25

00:00:32.509  -->  00:00:35.559
Tableau 9 before, the previously the

26

00:00:35.559  -->  00:00:35.569

27

00:00:35.569  -->  00:00:38.079
color palette looked like this, so there's a

28

00:00:38.079  -->  00:00:38.089

29

00:00:38.089  -->  00:00:40.689
more Crayola type of colors and now

30

00:00:40.689  -->  00:00:40.699

31

00:00:40.699  -->  00:00:43.959
they're much more subtle and much a

32

00:00:43.959  -->  00:00:43.969

33

00:00:43.969  -->  00:00:46.299
softer I would say and there's a whole

34

00:00:46.299  -->  00:00:46.309

35

00:00:46.309  -->  00:00:48.279
article on how they picked out these

36

00:00:48.279  -->  00:00:48.289

37

00:00:48.289  -->  00:00:50.500
colors. You'll notice some really cool

38

00:00:50.500  -->  00:00:50.510

39

00:00:50.510  -->  00:00:52.809
visualisations here and you'll notice

40

00:00:52.809  -->  00:00:52.819

41

00:00:52.819  -->  00:00:55.180
that they explain how they created this

42

00:00:55.180  -->  00:00:55.190

43

00:00:55.190  -->  00:00:57.789
tool to look through the dimensionality

44

00:00:57.789  -->  00:00:57.799

45

00:00:57.799  -->  00:01:00.910
of the colors and specifically they talk

46

00:01:00.910  -->  00:01:00.920

47

00:01:00.920  -->  00:01:03.250
about. So it's just an interesting read

48

00:01:03.250  -->  00:01:03.260

49

00:01:03.260  -->  00:01:05.500
specifically talked about how colors are

50

00:01:05.500  -->  00:01:05.510

51

00:01:05.510  -->  00:01:08.920
positioned on this XY axis and also the

52

00:01:08.920  -->  00:01:08.930

53

00:01:08.930  -->  00:01:11.889
distance to the center of axes matters.

54

00:01:11.889  -->  00:01:11.899

55

00:01:11.899  -->  00:01:14.109
So here you've got some examples for

56

00:01:14.109  -->  00:01:14.119

57

00:01:14.119  -->  00:01:16.959
instance, this is the Tableau 10 color

58

00:01:16.959  -->  00:01:16.969

59

00:01:16.969  -->  00:01:18.639
palette and this is a Tableau 20 color

60

00:01:18.639  -->  00:01:18.649

61

00:01:18.649  -->  00:01:20.800
palette, on the right you've got the old

62

00:01:20.800  -->  00:01:20.810

63

00:01:20.810  -->  00:01:22.450
ones, the ones that you had in Tableau

64

00:01:22.450  -->  00:01:22.460

65

00:01:22.460  -->  00:01:24.160
9, on the left you've got the new ones.

66

00:01:24.160  -->  00:01:24.170

67

00:01:24.170  -->  00:01:26.469
If you read through this in a bit more

68

00:01:26.469  -->  00:01:26.479

69

00:01:26.479  -->  00:01:28.840
detail you'll see how exactly they come

70

00:01:28.840  -->  00:01:28.850

71

00:01:28.850  -->  00:01:30.669
up with this color palette and why it's

72

00:01:30.669  -->  00:01:30.679

73

00:01:30.679  -->  00:01:33.730
a bit different to the previous one

74

00:01:33.730  -->  00:01:33.740

75

00:01:33.740  -->  00:01:36.489
how what the advantages are and how

76

00:01:36.489  -->  00:01:36.499

77

00:01:36.499  -->  00:01:38.709
these colors make for a better

78

00:01:38.709  -->  00:01:38.719

79

00:01:38.719  -->  00:01:40.959
experience when users are looking at

80

00:01:40.959  -->  00:01:40.969

81

00:01:40.969  -->  00:01:43.690
them. So a bit more on all of this here

82

00:01:43.690  -->  00:01:43.700

83

00:01:43.700  -->  00:01:45.910
and personal when I read about when I

84

00:01:45.910  -->  00:01:45.920

85

00:01:45.920  -->  00:01:48.039
before I read about this I thought I

86

00:01:48.039  -->  00:01:48.049

87

00:01:48.049  -->  00:01:50.020
can't, changing colors in that much of a

88

00:01:50.020  -->  00:01:50.030

89

00:01:50.030  -->  00:01:52.840
big deal but in reality putting a lot of

90

00:01:52.840  -->  00:01:52.850

91

00:01:52.850  -->  00:01:54.940
effort and it's very very thought

92

00:01:54.940  -->  00:01:54.950

93

00:01:54.950  -->  00:01:57.639
through and even the color palette, it is

94

00:01:57.639  -->  00:01:57.649

95

00:01:57.649  -->  00:02:02.200
now more adjusted to people with some

96

00:02:02.200  -->  00:02:02.210

97

00:02:02.210  -->  00:02:05.919
sort of color sight deficiencies. So you

98

00:02:05.919  -->  00:02:05.929

99

00:02:05.929  -->  00:02:08.980
might be presenting to somebody who is

100

00:02:08.980  -->  00:02:08.990

101

00:02:08.990  -->  00:02:11.830
not, cannot see the different colors as

102

00:02:11.830  -->  00:02:11.840

103

00:02:11.840  -->  00:02:13.930
well as you can and therefore just

104

00:02:13.930  -->  00:02:13.940

105

00:02:13.940  -->  00:02:14.270
having

106

00:02:14.270  -->  00:02:14.280

107

00:02:14.280  -->  00:02:16.100
this default color palette account for

108

00:02:16.100  -->  00:02:16.110

109

00:02:16.110  -->  00:02:18.530
that is already a great advantage, so

110

00:02:18.530  -->  00:02:18.540

111

00:02:18.540  -->  00:02:20.960
definitely if you're really

112

00:02:20.960  -->  00:02:20.970

113

00:02:20.970  -->  00:02:24.620
visualizations and wants to make the most out

114

00:02:24.620  -->  00:02:24.630

115

00:02:24.630  -->  00:02:26.120
of your visualizations through colors,

116

00:02:26.120  -->  00:02:26.130

117

00:02:26.130  -->  00:02:29.059
this is a definitely a good read

118

00:02:29.059  -->  00:02:29.069

119

00:02:29.069  -->  00:02:31.520
just have a look at it if you just maybe

120

00:02:31.520  -->  00:02:31.530

121

00:02:31.530  -->  00:02:33.290
google the title, how we design the new

122

00:02:33.290  -->  00:02:33.300

123

00:02:33.300  -->  00:02:36.050
color palette in Tableau 10 you can get

124

00:02:36.050  -->  00:02:36.060

125

00:02:36.060  -->  00:02:37.729
some valuable insights from here that

126

00:02:37.729  -->  00:02:37.739

127

00:02:37.739  -->  00:02:39.590
might help you build your visualizations

128

00:02:39.590  -->  00:02:39.600

129

00:02:39.600  -->  00:02:42.199
in a bit of a better way and also

130

00:02:42.199  -->  00:02:42.209

131

00:02:42.209  -->  00:02:45.650
another new feature that I really like

132

00:02:45.650  -->  00:02:45.660

133

00:02:45.660  -->  00:02:49.190
is the new font. So Tableau developed a,

134

00:02:49.190  -->  00:02:49.200

135

00:02:49.200  -->  00:02:52.460
well they call it, typeface and they design it for

136

00:02:52.460  -->  00:02:52.470

137

00:02:52.470  -->  00:02:54.560
data and here you can also read

138

00:02:54.560  -->  00:02:54.570

139

00:02:54.570  -->  00:02:56.180
about who they partnered with to create

140

00:02:56.180  -->  00:02:56.190

141

00:02:56.190  -->  00:03:00.350
it and how it is different to the other

142

00:03:00.350  -->  00:03:00.360

143

00:03:00.360  -->  00:03:02.390
fonts so previously they used what did

144

00:03:02.390  -->  00:03:02.400

145

00:03:02.400  -->  00:03:04.430
they use before? It was Verdana or

146

00:03:04.430  -->  00:03:04.440

147

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:06.770
something, I don't know, Helvetica. They used

148

00:03:06.770  -->  00:03:06.780

149

00:03:06.780  -->  00:03:09.170
Helvetica before but now they've created

150

00:03:09.170  -->  00:03:09.180

151

00:03:09.180  -->  00:03:11.960
their own font and that's a huge step

152

00:03:11.960  -->  00:03:11.970

153

00:03:11.970  -->  00:03:14.240
ahead as well and also they explained how

154

00:03:14.240  -->  00:03:14.250

155

00:03:14.250  -->  00:03:18.530
its adjusted to different types of data

156

00:03:18.530  -->  00:03:18.540

157

00:03:18.540  -->  00:03:21.560
sets and also doesn't have just bold and

158

00:03:21.560  -->  00:03:21.570

159

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:23.990
normal and actually has six types of

160

00:03:23.990  -->  00:03:24.000

161

00:03:24.000  -->  00:03:27.620
weight. This font and talks also about

162

00:03:27.620  -->  00:03:27.630

163

00:03:27.630  -->  00:03:31.520
some powerful basics of some of the

164

00:03:31.520  -->  00:03:31.530

165

00:03:31.530  -->  00:03:34.250
powerful advantages of having this font

166

00:03:34.250  -->  00:03:34.260

167

00:03:34.260  -->  00:03:37.069
over using some other fonts and when you do

168

00:03:37.069  -->  00:03:37.079

169

00:03:37.079  -->  00:03:38.840
create workbooks now you can kind of see

170

00:03:38.840  -->  00:03:38.850

171

00:03:38.850  -->  00:03:42.380
that you don't have that problem of when

172

00:03:42.380  -->  00:03:42.390

173

00:03:42.390  -->  00:03:43.819
something is very small you can't really

174

00:03:43.819  -->  00:03:43.829

175

00:03:43.829  -->  00:03:46.520
see it or the letters start to blur or

176

00:03:46.520  -->  00:03:46.530

177

00:03:46.530  -->  00:03:48.380
over a lot when they all overlap each

178

00:03:48.380  -->  00:03:48.390

179

00:03:48.390  -->  00:03:51.050
other it's, it's very hard to read. This

180

00:03:51.050  -->  00:03:51.060

181

00:03:51.060  -->  00:03:53.539
font personally I find it much better

182

00:03:53.539  -->  00:03:53.549

183

00:03:53.549  -->  00:03:55.670
than the previous one. So if you want

184

00:03:55.670  -->  00:03:55.680

185

00:03:55.680  -->  00:03:57.710
some more insight into that then just

186

00:03:57.710  -->  00:03:57.720

187

00:03:57.720  -->  00:03:59.120
check out this article. Tableau 10

188

00:03:59.120  -->  00:03:59.130

189

00:03:59.130  -->  00:04:01.789
includes a new typeface designed for

190

00:04:01.789  -->  00:04:01.799

191

00:04:01.799  -->  00:04:04.039
data. So there we go so just some

192

00:04:04.039  -->  00:04:04.049

193

00:04:04.049  -->  00:04:08.330
quick overviews of some design related

194

00:04:08.330  -->  00:04:08.340

195

00:04:08.340  -->  00:04:13.130
updates in a Tableau colors and the font.

196
