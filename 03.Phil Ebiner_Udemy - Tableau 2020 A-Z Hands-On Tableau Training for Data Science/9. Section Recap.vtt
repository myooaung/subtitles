00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:00.500

2

00:00:05.500  -->  00:00:06.599
Hello and welcome back to the course on

3

00:00:07.099  -->  00:00:07.109

4

00:00:07.109  -->  00:00:09.259
Tableau and today's tutorial marks the

5

00:00:09.259  -->  00:00:09.269

6

00:00:09.269  -->  00:00:11.240
completion of the section on joining and

7

00:00:11.240  -->  00:00:11.250

8

00:00:11.250  -->  00:00:13.310
blending data. It was quite a tough

9

00:00:13.310  -->  00:00:13.320

10

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:15.140
section and we definitely learned a lot

11

00:00:15.140  -->  00:00:15.150

12

00:00:15.150  -->  00:00:16.400
and that's why I feel that it's

13

00:00:16.400  -->  00:00:16.410

14

00:00:16.410  -->  00:00:18.080
important for us to have this recap

15

00:00:18.080  -->  00:00:18.090

16

00:00:18.090  -->  00:00:20.210
tutorial where we can just revise

17

00:00:20.210  -->  00:00:20.220

18

00:00:20.220  -->  00:00:21.800
quickly what we learned and make sure

19

00:00:21.800  -->  00:00:21.810

20

00:00:21.810  -->  00:00:24.290
that we've got everything covered.

21

00:00:24.290  -->  00:00:24.300

22

00:00:24.300  -->  00:00:25.880
But before we do revise I wanted to ask you

23

00:00:25.880  -->  00:00:25.890

24

00:00:25.890  -->  00:00:27.769
for a quick favor, could you please leave

25

00:00:27.769  -->  00:00:27.779

26

00:00:27.779  -->  00:00:29.689
a review for this course and the reason

27

00:00:29.689  -->  00:00:29.699

28

00:00:29.699  -->  00:00:31.250
why I'm asking you now is that even

29

00:00:31.250  -->  00:00:31.260

30

00:00:31.260  -->  00:00:32.330
though that you haven't completed the

31

00:00:32.330  -->  00:00:32.340

32

00:00:32.340  -->  00:00:34.160
course yet a lot of students for some

33

00:00:34.160  -->  00:00:34.170

34

00:00:34.170  -->  00:00:35.479
reason don't get to the very end of the

35

00:00:35.479  -->  00:00:35.489

36

00:00:35.489  -->  00:00:36.979
course and therefore forget to leave a

37

00:00:36.979  -->  00:00:36.989

38

00:00:36.989  -->  00:00:38.810
review. So i would really appreciate if

39

00:00:38.810  -->  00:00:38.820

40

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:40.310
you could click this button at the top

41

00:00:40.310  -->  00:00:40.320

42

00:00:40.320  -->  00:00:42.260
of the course and just the leave a rating,

43

00:00:42.260  -->  00:00:42.270

44

00:00:42.270  -->  00:00:43.880
all you have to do is to select the

45

00:00:43.880  -->  00:00:43.890

46

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:45.229
number of stars you think this course

47

00:00:45.229  -->  00:00:45.239

48

00:00:45.239  -->  00:00:47.060
deserves and if you want to you can

49

00:00:47.060  -->  00:00:47.070

50

00:00:47.070  -->  00:00:50.240
enter a short message if you don't,

51

00:00:50.240  -->  00:00:50.250

52

00:00:50.250  -->  00:00:51.470
just select the number of stars and

53

00:00:51.470  -->  00:00:51.480

54

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:53.330
click add review. It would really help me

55

00:00:53.330  -->  00:00:53.340

56

00:00:53.340  -->  00:00:54.979
out because it would help me understand

57

00:00:54.979  -->  00:00:54.989

58

00:00:54.989  -->  00:00:57.529
how the course is going and how well

59

00:00:57.529  -->  00:00:57.539

60

00:00:57.539  -->  00:00:59.360
I've done in this course and also you

61

00:00:59.360  -->  00:00:59.370

62

00:00:59.370  -->  00:01:01.670
would assist other students who are you

63

00:01:01.670  -->  00:01:01.680

64

00:01:01.680  -->  00:01:02.930
haven't taken this course yet and are

65

00:01:02.930  -->  00:01:02.940

66

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:05.119
making the decision whether this course

67

00:01:05.119  -->  00:01:05.129

68

00:01:05.129  -->  00:01:07.700
is worth their while or not, thanks a lot! I

69

00:01:07.700  -->  00:01:07.710

70

00:01:07.710  -->  00:01:09.020
would really appreciate if you could do

71

00:01:09.020  -->  00:01:09.030

72

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:11.780
that and let's get back to the show. So

73

00:01:11.780  -->  00:01:11.790

74

00:01:11.790  -->  00:01:14.210
joining data, what did we learn in this

75

00:01:14.210  -->  00:01:14.220

76

00:01:14.220  -->  00:01:16.760
part of this section?  First, of all we

77

00:01:16.760  -->  00:01:16.770

78

00:01:16.770  -->  00:01:18.200
learned about the different types of

79

00:01:18.200  -->  00:01:18.210

80

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:20.060
joins, the inner join, the left join,

81

00:01:20.060  -->  00:01:20.070

82

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:22.160
there's also the right join and the

83

00:01:22.160  -->  00:01:22.170

84

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:24.080
full outer join and this knowledge will

85

00:01:24.080  -->  00:01:24.090

86

00:01:24.090  -->  00:01:25.700
not only help you in Tableau but in

87

00:01:25.700  -->  00:01:25.710

88

00:01:25.710  -->  00:01:30.859
other software like SQL, mysql, postgresql,

89

00:01:30.859  -->  00:01:30.869

90

00:01:30.869  -->  00:01:33.859
basically any relation a relational

91

00:01:33.859  -->  00:01:33.869

92

00:01:33.869  -->  00:01:36.590
database or database with structure data.

93

00:01:36.590  -->  00:01:36.600

94

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:39.050
They all use joins and you will

95

00:01:39.050  -->  00:01:39.060

96

00:01:39.060  -->  00:01:40.399
definitely benefit from this knowledge

97

00:01:40.399  -->  00:01:40.409

98

00:01:40.409  -->  00:01:41.480
going forward.

99

00:01:41.480  -->  00:01:41.490

100

00:01:41.490  -->  00:01:44.600
Next we found out how joins with

101

00:01:44.600  -->  00:01:44.610

102

00:01:44.610  -->  00:01:46.190
duplicate values work and by that we

103

00:01:46.190  -->  00:01:46.200

104

00:01:46.200  -->  00:01:48.710
mean when the column that were are joining on has

105

00:01:48.710  -->  00:01:48.720

106

00:01:48.720  -->  00:01:50.149
duplicate values in one of the tables

107

00:01:50.149  -->  00:01:50.159

108

00:01:50.159  -->  00:01:52.760
and we found out what exactly happens

109

00:01:52.760  -->  00:01:52.770

110

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:55.880
there and how to be prepared for those

111

00:01:55.880  -->  00:01:55.890

112

00:01:55.890  -->  00:01:56.660
things.

113

00:01:56.660  -->  00:01:56.670

114

00:01:56.670  -->  00:01:58.670
Also we learned how to join multiple

115

00:01:58.670  -->  00:01:58.680

116

00:01:58.680  -->  00:02:01.700
fields and we saw that when we do need

117

00:02:01.700  -->  00:02:01.710

118

00:02:01.710  -->  00:02:04.219
to join multiple fields and we forget to

119

00:02:04.219  -->  00:02:04.229

120

00:02:04.229  -->  00:02:06.620
do that, they can be very bad

121

00:02:06.620  -->  00:02:06.630

122

00:02:06.630  -->  00:02:08.419
consequences for instance we can all

123

00:02:08.419  -->  00:02:08.429

124

00:02:08.429  -->  00:02:11.540
over inflate certain metrics or of sales

125

00:02:11.540  -->  00:02:11.550

126

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:13.010
figures and so on. So it's very important

127

00:02:13.010  -->  00:02:13.020

128

00:02:13.020  -->  00:02:13.340
to understand

129

00:02:13.340  -->  00:02:13.350

130

00:02:13.350  -->  00:02:15.080
exactly what feels you are joining

131

00:02:15.080  -->  00:02:15.090

132

00:02:15.090  -->  00:02:18.680
on and then execute the join

133

00:02:18.680  -->  00:02:18.690

134

00:02:18.690  -->  00:02:20.660
accordingly. So that was joining data.

135

00:02:20.660  -->  00:02:20.670

136

00:02:20.670  -->  00:02:22.760
Then we talked about blending data, so

137

00:02:22.760  -->  00:02:22.770

138

00:02:22.770  -->  00:02:24.620
blending data is like joining but a bit

139

00:02:24.620  -->  00:02:24.630

140

00:02:24.630  -->  00:02:27.440
different, blend is like a smart join on

141

00:02:27.440  -->  00:02:27.450

142

00:02:27.450  -->  00:02:29.360
the fly. So you don't have to do the

143

00:02:29.360  -->  00:02:29.370

144

00:02:29.370  -->  00:02:31.190
blend before you do all your analysis in Tableau.

145

00:02:31.190  -->  00:02:31.200

146

00:02:31.200  -->  00:02:32.750
Tableau can help you do this

147

00:02:32.750  -->  00:02:32.760

148

00:02:32.760  -->  00:02:36.380
blend inside the dashboard or

149

00:02:36.380  -->  00:02:36.390

150

00:02:36.390  -->  00:02:38.120
worksheet while you're creating your

151

00:02:38.120  -->  00:02:38.130

152

00:02:38.130  -->  00:02:41.120
visualization, a blend is always a left

153

00:02:41.120  -->  00:02:41.130

154

00:02:41.130  -->  00:02:43.220
join so there's always a primary data

155

00:02:43.220  -->  00:02:43.230

156

00:02:43.230  -->  00:02:44.870
source which is marked in blue and there's

157

00:02:44.870  -->  00:02:44.880

158

00:02:44.880  -->  00:02:46.790
secondary data sources which are marked

159

00:02:46.790  -->  00:02:46.800

160

00:02:46.800  -->  00:02:50.330
in orange, so the datasource in blue is

161

00:02:50.330  -->  00:02:50.340

162

00:02:50.340  -->  00:02:52.040
your primary data source and the blend

163

00:02:52.040  -->  00:02:52.050

164

00:02:52.050  -->  00:02:55.070
will be executed as if it were a left

165

00:02:55.070  -->  00:02:55.080

166

00:02:55.080  -->  00:02:58.730
join. Next the common fields with the

167

00:02:58.730  -->  00:02:58.740

168

00:02:58.740  -->  00:03:01.130
same name are picked up automatically as

169

00:03:01.130  -->  00:03:01.140

170

00:03:01.140  -->  00:03:02.960
the blend clause, so if you are two

171

00:03:02.960  -->  00:03:02.970

172

00:03:02.970  -->  00:03:05.150
datasets that you're blending have a

173

00:03:05.150  -->  00:03:05.160

174

00:03:05.160  -->  00:03:07.910
same field for instance category or date

175

00:03:07.910  -->  00:03:07.920

176

00:03:07.920  -->  00:03:09.770
and it's called exactly the same then

177

00:03:09.770  -->  00:03:09.780

178

00:03:09.780  -->  00:03:11.330
Tableau will automatically pick up that

179

00:03:11.330  -->  00:03:11.340

180

00:03:11.340  -->  00:03:14.270
date as the field that you want to blend

181

00:03:14.270  -->  00:03:14.280

182

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:17.930
on. So, that's great if your fields

183

00:03:17.930  -->  00:03:17.940

184

00:03:17.940  -->  00:03:19.490
of the sa.. if you field's name are the same

185

00:03:19.490  -->  00:03:19.500

186

00:03:19.500  -->  00:03:21.410
if they're not, you can always control

187

00:03:21.410  -->  00:03:21.420

188

00:03:21.420  -->  00:03:23.750
this via the data menu so up at the top

189

00:03:23.750  -->  00:03:23.760

190

00:03:23.760  -->  00:03:26.480
on Tableau, you can go to data and then

191

00:03:26.480  -->  00:03:26.490

192

00:03:26.490  -->  00:03:28.550
edit relationships between the

193

00:03:28.550  -->  00:03:28.560

194

00:03:28.560  -->  00:03:30.680
data sources and you can add your own

195

00:03:30.680  -->  00:03:30.690

196

00:03:30.690  -->  00:03:32.330
clauses there and once again that is

197

00:03:32.330  -->  00:03:32.340

198

00:03:32.340  -->  00:03:34.610
important because as we recall joining

199

00:03:34.610  -->  00:03:34.620

200

00:03:34.620  -->  00:03:36.920
on multiple fields sometimes is

201

00:03:36.920  -->  00:03:36.930

202

00:03:36.930  -->  00:03:39.320
necessary. So you have to make that

203

00:03:39.320  -->  00:03:39.330

204

00:03:39.330  -->  00:03:42.770
assessment yourself in advance. Next, we

205

00:03:42.770  -->  00:03:42.780

206

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:44.330
also learned that blending occurs at the

207

00:03:44.330  -->  00:03:44.340

208

00:03:44.340  -->  00:03:48.260
granularity of your view and that is important

209

00:03:48.260  -->  00:03:48.270

210

00:03:48.270  -->  00:03:50.900
because it is different to joining. When

211

00:03:50.900  -->  00:03:50.910

212

00:03:50.910  -->  00:03:53.210
you join in Tableau, it happens at the

213

00:03:53.210  -->  00:03:53.220

214

00:03:53.220  -->  00:03:55.640
row level but when you blend it actually

215

00:03:55.640  -->  00:03:55.650

216

00:03:55.650  -->  00:03:58.070
happens at a radio granular level which

217

00:03:58.070  -->  00:03:58.080

218

00:03:58.080  -->  00:03:59.750
brings us to the next point that

219

00:03:59.750  -->  00:03:59.760

220

00:03:59.760  -->  00:04:02.360
aggregation in a blend happens before

221

00:04:02.360  -->  00:04:02.370

222

00:04:02.370  -->  00:04:05.060
the blend. So Tableau sends separate

223

00:04:05.060  -->  00:04:05.070

224

00:04:05.070  -->  00:04:07.790
queries to the two data sources, it asks

225

00:04:07.790  -->  00:04:07.800

226

00:04:07.800  -->  00:04:09.770
them to aggregate their data to the

227

00:04:09.770  -->  00:04:09.780

228

00:04:09.780  -->  00:04:11.810
granularity of your view to the required

229

00:04:11.810  -->  00:04:11.820

230

00:04:11.820  -->  00:04:13.940
granularity. Then that aggregated data

231

00:04:13.940  -->  00:04:13.950

232

00:04:13.950  -->  00:04:18.440
comes back and then it is only joined or

233

00:04:18.440  -->  00:04:18.450

234

00:04:18.450  -->  00:04:20.780
it is only blended at that stage and

235

00:04:20.780  -->  00:04:20.790

236

00:04:20.790  -->  00:04:22.490
finally blends are unique to each

237

00:04:22.490  -->  00:04:22.500

238

00:04:22.500  -->  00:04:24.020
worksheet. So you can have one type of

239

00:04:24.020  -->  00:04:24.030

240

00:04:24.030  -->  00:04:25.670
blend on one worksheet another type of

241

00:04:25.670  -->  00:04:25.680

242

00:04:25.680  -->  00:04:26.860
blend on your other

243

00:04:26.860  -->  00:04:26.870

244

00:04:26.870  -->  00:04:30.700
worksheet and so on. Also, let's have a

245

00:04:30.700  -->  00:04:30.710

246

00:04:30.710  -->  00:04:33.310
look or we discussed at discuss the

247

00:04:33.310  -->  00:04:33.320

248

00:04:33.320  -->  00:04:34.510
difference between joining and blending,

249

00:04:34.510  -->  00:04:34.520

250

00:04:34.520  -->  00:04:36.250
and when you should use either. So you

251

00:04:36.250  -->  00:04:36.260

252

00:04:36.260  -->  00:04:38.140
should use joins when you're combining

253

00:04:38.140  -->  00:04:38.150

254

00:04:38.150  -->  00:04:40.090
data at a row level and that's exactly

255

00:04:40.090  -->  00:04:40.100

256

00:04:40.100  -->  00:04:43.090
what you're after and you should use

257

00:04:43.090  -->  00:04:43.100

258

00:04:43.100  -->  00:04:44.980
blends when the data sources have

259

00:04:44.980  -->  00:04:44.990

260

00:04:44.990  -->  00:04:46.719
different levels of granularity and

261

00:04:46.719  -->  00:04:46.729

262

00:04:46.729  -->  00:04:48.670
therefore if you do if you were to use

263

00:04:48.670  -->  00:04:48.680

264

00:04:48.680  -->  00:04:50.560
the join, you would lose some

265

00:04:50.560  -->  00:04:50.570

266

00:04:50.570  -->  00:04:51.969
information from your data and

267

00:04:51.969  -->  00:04:51.979

268

00:04:51.979  -->  00:04:56.350
that's not what you want and also you

269

00:04:56.350  -->  00:04:56.360

270

00:04:56.360  -->  00:04:57.580
should use a when your data

271

00:04:57.580  -->  00:04:57.590

272

00:04:57.590  -->  00:04:59.290
sources come from different systems for

273

00:04:59.290  -->  00:04:59.300

274

00:04:59.300  -->  00:05:01.689
instance if one is excel and  the other one is SQL,

275

00:05:01.689  -->  00:05:01.699

276

00:05:01.699  -->  00:05:04.000
you won't be able to perform a join

277

00:05:04.000  -->  00:05:04.010

278

00:05:04.010  -->  00:05:06.909
you will have to use a data blend, and

279

00:05:06.909  -->  00:05:06.919

280

00:05:06.919  -->  00:05:08.770
finally some other topics that we covered

281

00:05:08.770  -->  00:05:08.780

282

00:05:08.780  -->  00:05:12.159
off, also very important topics. First

283

00:05:12.159  -->  00:05:12.169

284

00:05:12.169  -->  00:05:14.710
one was dual-axis charts, we learned how

285

00:05:14.710  -->  00:05:14.720

286

00:05:14.720  -->  00:05:16.629
to create a dual-axis chart and they're

287

00:05:16.629  -->  00:05:16.639

288

00:05:16.639  -->  00:05:18.370
very very handy in Tableau because they

289

00:05:18.370  -->  00:05:18.380

290

00:05:18.380  -->  00:05:20.200
save space and they make your visuals

291

00:05:20.200  -->  00:05:20.210

292

00:05:20.210  -->  00:05:24.189
real look really appealing and you have

293

00:05:24.189  -->  00:05:24.199

294

00:05:24.199  -->  00:05:26.320
to remember at least the most important

295

00:05:26.320  -->  00:05:26.330

296

00:05:26.330  -->  00:05:27.850
things you have to remember to access

297

00:05:27.850  -->  00:05:27.860

298

00:05:27.860  -->  00:05:29.980
chart is that remember to sign

299

00:05:29.980  -->  00:05:29.990

300

00:05:29.990  -->  00:05:32.800
synchronize the axes. A lot of people

301

00:05:32.800  -->  00:05:32.810

302

00:05:32.810  -->  00:05:35.650
forget that and if you forget to

303

00:05:35.650  -->  00:05:35.660

304

00:05:35.660  -->  00:05:38.830
synchronize your axis then basically

305

00:05:38.830  -->  00:05:38.840

306

00:05:38.840  -->  00:05:41.200
the visual comparison of the two charts

307

00:05:41.200  -->  00:05:41.210

308

00:05:41.210  -->  00:05:43.930
that are one behind the other can lead

309

00:05:43.930  -->  00:05:43.940

310

00:05:43.940  -->  00:05:46.450
to wrong results and wrong conclusions wrong

311

00:05:46.450  -->  00:05:46.460

312

00:05:46.460  -->  00:05:47.830
business decisions and can be a very

313

00:05:47.830  -->  00:05:47.840

314

00:05:47.840  -->  00:05:50.469
very bad situation. So as we discussed in

315

00:05:50.469  -->  00:05:50.479

316

00:05:50.479  -->  00:05:51.909
the tutorial, as soon as you create a

317

00:05:51.909  -->  00:05:51.919

318

00:05:51.919  -->  00:05:54.640
dual-axis charts just right away

319

00:05:54.640  -->  00:05:54.650

320

00:05:54.650  -->  00:05:56.320
synchronized axis and then you can

321

00:05:56.320  -->  00:05:56.330

322

00:05:56.330  -->  00:05:57.520
decide if you want to unsynchronized

323

00:05:57.520  -->  00:05:57.530

324

00:05:57.530  -->  00:06:00.640
them or not. And the other point here was that

325

00:06:00.640  -->  00:06:00.650

326

00:06:00.650  -->  00:06:02.500
you can move charts around backwards and

327

00:06:02.500  -->  00:06:02.510

328

00:06:02.510  -->  00:06:04.240
forwards as required so one child will

329

00:06:04.240  -->  00:06:04.250

330

00:06:04.250  -->  00:06:05.620
always be behind the other one but

331

00:06:05.620  -->  00:06:05.630

332

00:06:05.630  -->  00:06:07.659
it's very easy to switch them around by

333

00:06:07.659  -->  00:06:07.669

334

00:06:07.669  -->  00:06:09.790
adjusting what is in your columns or

335

00:06:09.790  -->  00:06:09.800

336

00:06:09.800  -->  00:06:11.589
rows the order in which they come in

337

00:06:11.589  -->  00:06:11.599

338

00:06:11.599  -->  00:06:13.240
there. And the other topic that we

339

00:06:13.240  -->  00:06:13.250

340

00:06:13.250  -->  00:06:15.400
discussed is calculated fields in a

341

00:06:15.400  -->  00:06:15.410

342

00:06:15.410  -->  00:06:18.010
blend, it is a more advanced topic but at

343

00:06:18.010  -->  00:06:18.020

344

00:06:18.020  -->  00:06:20.409
the same time I felt that we should have,

345

00:06:20.409  -->  00:06:20.419

346

00:06:20.419  -->  00:06:23.350
we should talk about it because you will

347

00:06:23.350  -->  00:06:23.360

348

00:06:23.360  -->  00:06:25.540
be doing a lot of calculated fields

349

00:06:25.540  -->  00:06:25.550

350

00:06:25.550  -->  00:06:27.370
creating calculated fields or in your work

351

00:06:27.370  -->  00:06:27.380

352

00:06:27.380  -->  00:06:29.620
in Tableau and inevitably you will be

353

00:06:29.620  -->  00:06:29.630

354

00:06:29.630  -->  00:06:31.330
working with blends so when you put the

355

00:06:31.330  -->  00:06:31.340

356

00:06:31.340  -->  00:06:32.680
two together, you should you really

357

00:06:32.680  -->  00:06:32.690

358

00:06:32.690  -->  00:06:34.330
should know how to create calculated

359

00:06:34.330  -->  00:06:34.340

360

00:06:34.340  -->  00:06:36.490
fields in a blend it has its own

361

00:06:36.490  -->  00:06:36.500

362

00:06:36.500  -->  00:06:37.770
specifics

363

00:06:37.770  -->  00:06:37.780

364

00:06:37.780  -->  00:06:41.280
and I'm so speaking of which you should

365

00:06:41.280  -->  00:06:41.290

366

00:06:41.290  -->  00:06:43.080
just keep in mind that values are

367

00:06:43.080  -->  00:06:43.090

368

00:06:43.090  -->  00:06:44.940
aggregated. The values that you're

369

00:06:44.940  -->  00:06:44.950

370

00:06:44.950  -->  00:06:46.590
working with in your calculated field there

371

00:06:46.590  -->  00:06:46.600

372

00:06:46.600  -->  00:06:49.050
aggregated due to the nature of blends

373

00:06:49.050  -->  00:06:49.060

374

00:06:49.060  -->  00:06:51.659
and therefore you should as we discussed

375

00:06:51.659  -->  00:06:51.669

376

00:06:51.669  -->  00:06:53.400
in the tutorial make adjustments

377

00:06:53.400  -->  00:06:53.410

378

00:06:53.410  -->  00:06:55.740
accordingly. So that brings us to the end

379

00:06:55.740  -->  00:06:55.750

380

00:06:55.750  -->  00:06:56.670
of the section,

381

00:06:56.670  -->  00:06:56.680

382

00:06:56.680  -->  00:06:57.450
thank you very much for your attention.

383

00:06:57.450  -->  00:06:57.460

384

00:06:57.460  -->  00:07:00.390
Please rate this course before you move

385

00:07:00.390  -->  00:07:00.400

386

00:07:00.400  -->  00:07:01.440
on to the next section, I'd really

387

00:07:01.440  -->  00:07:01.450

388

00:07:01.450  -->  00:07:03.150
appreciate that and I look forward to

389

00:07:03.150  -->  00:07:03.160

390

00:07:03.160  -->  00:07:04.080
seeing you next time.

391

00:07:04.080  -->  00:07:05.580
Until then, happy analyzing!

392

00:07:05.580  -->  00:07:10.470
