00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello this is Carol.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,810
And welcome back to the course I'm tableau.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,610
And today we'll be connecting our data source to Tableau.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,640
So I'll bring up Tableau and this is the data source that we're talking about office supplies.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,600
So we downloaded in the previous lecture and normally throughout this course I won't be spending a lot

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,420
of time on connecting to a data source because as you'll see it will become kind of a quick thing for

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:30,630
us.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,690
We'll be doing it pretty much on the fly.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,950
But today I thought I'd stop on it specifically because we did rush through it kind of lost time and

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,050
I didn't have a chance to show you around the connection manager interface.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,290
So let's go ahead and do that as soon as you open tableau here on the left you have a column called

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:56,150
Connect and it's got different types of files as you can connect to so last time we did an excel file.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,820
But this time if you have downloaded the CSP file a as few files actually considered a text file because

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,150
it's basically text delimited by commerce.

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,670
That's why it's called CSC comma separated values.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,200
So let's click on text file and now we will select our file here.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,390
Office supplies those yes we will open it up and right away we're redirected to the connection manager

18
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,490
for this data source.

19
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,200
And let's have a look around here.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,660
So on the left here you've got a directory where the file is located and at the bottom here you've got

21
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,570
only one file currently.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,510
That's because we only have one file in that directory.

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,250
Later on through the course you'll notice that when we have more files of the same type there will be

24
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,300
more.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,320
There will all be listed here and you'll be able to select from them.

26
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,820
So here you've got a window where all the files you have selected are located.

27
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,580
So what does that mean.

28
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:55,490
Well that basically means that you can select many files so I can show example now I can drag another

29
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,430
one of these into here and right away something happens.

30
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,790
Tableau is trying to find a way to connect these two files and basically join them.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,900
But we won't do that now.

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,750
So we'll just click the Red Cross here and cancel that.

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:14,780
We will talk about joining data further down in the course but just bear that in mind that your data

34
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,310
that you're working with in tableau doesn't all have to come from one file it can come from many files

35
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,460
or it can come from many tabs in a file or it can come from different types of files.

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:32,630
But once again we will talk about that later on at the bottom here you've got a preview of your files

37
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,710
so certain rows and columns of the files just so that you can have a look and see what you are dealing

38
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,720
with.

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,030
And in our case we do have the order date which correctly here has been identified as a date so you

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,100
can see this icon.

41
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:55,720
That's a data icon then these are have been identified as text and these have been identified as numbers.

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,050
And here are some more controls which we will talk about in further sections of this course.

43
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,430
And up top here also an important part of the connection manager the live or extract connection.

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,730
Once again we will have a separate lecture on that and we will understand what the difference is.

45
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,370
And when you would prefer to use an extract for now let's just leave it at life.

46
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,930
So everything looks good over here.

47
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:26,930
Now we can proceed on to the dashboard so we just have to go here and we'll talk about all this in the

48
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,590
next section.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,070
I just wanted to show you here that we have a data column and here we've got our data source.

50
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,360
So this little icon is an icon that is used to illustrate a database.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,760
If we right click on it and click View data you will see our data just as we saw in the previous window.

52
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:53,470
The columns can be rearranged here that that is that happens that's that's totally normal.

53
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,420
But this is like a preview of the data it's just as we had before.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,270
So that's pretty much it.

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,620
That's as easy as it gets to connect to a data source.

56
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,920
And before we finish up this lecture I just wanted to show you one more thing.

57
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,770
So if I want to connect to more data sources I can always go here and click.

58
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,540
Just go back to the data source connections over here or you can just go data.

59
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,040
New data source and connect from here.

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,450
So if you want to connect to another data source you just click this icon over here.

61
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,510
But what we are looking at now is the types of data sources that tableau can work with.

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,320
So as we read discussed there's Excel there's a text file which includes a suite files.

63
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,460
There's access databases.

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,370
There's now statistical files.

65
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,510
You are able to connect to statistical files and as you can see here these are SAS files SPSS files

66
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:50,280
and even our files for those of you who are interested in statistical modelling with our.

67
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,750
Let's have a look what else we have.

68
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,290
We've got Tableau Server files we've got Microsoft.

69
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:02,170
Microsoft tells a field server so we will have an example of this in the course there's Maya skill databases

70
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,250
for online use his oracle.

71
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,630
And there's lots of other different types of servers here.

72
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:15,920
So if you are doing for instance Hadoop and big data analytics then you've got two pivotal green plum

73
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,930
databases Postgres skill and even have SAP HANA here.

74
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:27,290
So as you can see tableau guys are constantly introducing new connection to connections to Tableau and

75
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,060
trying to keep up to date with the technical trends.

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,870
So that's just even if you don't use any of this just good thing to have you know kind of in mind to

77
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,980
know that tableau is not this to a little become obsolete one day.

78
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,400
It's always changing and always adapting to the market and what's happening.

79
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:44,680
All right.

80
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,740
So that's it for today's lecture.

81
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,440
We did connect very quickly we just had a lot of discussions about other things going forward in the

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,990
course connections to data will be much faster.

83
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,000
So there you go.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,250
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

85
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,870
Until then happy analyzing.
