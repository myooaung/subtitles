00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.730
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.530
And I've got this feeling that by now you're probably getting a bit tired of all of these data prep

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.630
tutorials.

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.150
We've had a few in a row and yeah definitely it is a bit tedious sometimes but it's a very important

5
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.000
topic so I'm happy that we're carrying it off.

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.580
And also to spice things up I promise you that at the end of this tutorial we'll look at some visuals

7
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.340
and play around with the data just to have a bit of fun.

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.000
So today we're talking about the metadata grid.

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.440
What is the metadata grid that allows you to do is it allows you to look at all the columns separately

10
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.620
before all of this data getting in your way and get some information and maybe do some work just with

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.140
the column names and just the columns themselves.

12
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.600
And that is a very handy thing to have especially if you have like 30 20 30 40 50 columns.

13
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.400
It can be quite a challenge crawling around this place and finding the ones you need to do something

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.690
about.

15
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.930
Whereas if you use the metadata grid the right in front of you all of them.

16
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.600
So how do you get to the metadata grid.

17
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.560
Well like everything in tableau it's very simple.

18
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.440
You just have to click this one little button over here.

19
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.200
And once you're there.

20
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.280
This is I think it's called managed metadata.

21
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.420
Once you there you've got the grid in front of you.

22
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.690
We only have four columns so it isn't that big but at the same time you can really see some how we can

23
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.360
add some value to our dashboard through this metadata grid.

24
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.940
So here we've got the original name of the current name of the column.

25
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.540
Then we've got the table where it comes from and the remote field name.

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.280
So what was the original name of the column.

27
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.560
So in our case we've got regions which came from our spreadsheet and it was also called the regions

28
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.550
countries.

29
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.100
It came from a spreadsheet.

30
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.390
It's called countries pivot field names.

31
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.040
In our case it came from the pivot and the it actually represents the years.

32
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.090
So because we pivoted on the year you can see that pivot field names is a different years and pivot

33
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.690
field values is the total number of cars sold.

34
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.020
So how about we go ahead and make these adjustments here so instead of pivot field names we'll call

35
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:20.890
it a year and pivot field value we'll call it maybe not cars it's called vehicles sold.

36
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.660
And I'm not I specifically don't want to put the vehicle sales because that might imply dollars and

37
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.060
we don't want to confuse the users so we'll just call it vehicles sold maybe we'll put a space in between

38
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.660
them and countries we can put us like on capitalize it regions as well or just call it region.

39
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.830
And in this case country.

40
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.710
So that allowed us to clean up a bit our spreadsheet or our data.

41
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.770
Now you can see it's much better Region Country year vehicle sold and that is how you work with the

42
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.980
meta data grid.

43
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.570
Once again very small number of fields for us this K in this case.

44
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.140
But if you do ever have more fields you can come here and work or fit and it will be much more convenient

45
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.940
and much more handy for you.

46
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.600
So here you can also like look at other things like aliases for changing names four countries or the

47
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.150
different values in fields like do some splits which we've already talked about and so on.

48
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.050
So let's have a look at some data as promised because we want to see some colors.

49
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.410
All right.

50
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.090
So we're going to go to a sheet.

51
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.080
What are we going to look at.

52
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.080
Vehicles sold and we'll look at it by year.

53
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.860
Right away we've got an interesting picture so the total number of vehicles sold globally has been growing.

54
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.050
And it's currently sitting at 65 million vehicles sold in 2014.

55
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.290
What else could we add here.

56
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.130
Let's add region.

57
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.530
And now we've got a colorful chart so orange is Asia here and blue Europe.

58
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:06.100
So we can see that Asia Oceania Middle East 34 and a half million vehicles were sold in 2014.

59
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.390
What do we want to do now.

60
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:17.670
Well perhaps we want to see how much what percentage of the global sales was the were the sales in Asia.

61
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.680
So we can see here right away that it is quite a high portion based on the size of this bar but we don't

62
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.430
really really see what percentage exactly it was.

63
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.830
So how about we compare the percentages instead of the total values.

64
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.070
All right.

65
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.750
So we're creating a calculated fields at table calculation and here we will look 4 percent of total

66
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.820
but not across.

67
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.670
We want the percent of total down because we want the percent of total for every single year.

68
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.100
Click Apply and then we go we can see that.

69
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:56.020
What what percentage exactly each region is constituting for every single year maybe it will just take

70
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.740
this level of calculation hold down control added into label maybe format our label by now I hope all

71
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.960
of this is very straightforward.

72
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.720
What exactly we're doing because this must be very easy stuff for you guys right now so we'll just click

73
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.400
format this whole tab and make it bold.

74
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.640
And now if we format our label we just want to change it from one.

75
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.270
Put a percentage with no decimals.

76
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.290
There we go so that's that's where we can see maybe we you might want to change it to an area chart.

77
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.390
But then the label doesn't look as good.

78
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.930
So maybe keep it a bar chart.

79
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.840
And so here we can see that in 2014 53 percent of the world's vehicles personal vehicles were sold in

80
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.690
Asia Oceania and Middle East.

81
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.400
Nineteen percent were sold in Europe.

82
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.830
So Europe is in second place but far far behind Asia ocean and Middle East.

83
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.780
But fair enough because that is a very big region and laughter.

84
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:03.780
So the North American Free Trade Agreement that's America US United States Canada and Mexico 14 percent

85
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.070
of the total vehicle sales.

86
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.870
Once again those are personal vehicles.

87
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.560
So there we go we had to play around with the data just to make a little bit more fun.

88
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.320
Feel free to explore further.

89
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.670
This is quite interesting dataset.

90
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.750
Maybe look at your countries see how the sales in your country have been changing.

91
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.330
This is freely available data on the net.

92
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.820
So it should be should be quite accurate.

93
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:33.040
Next what we're going to do in the next tutorial we will look at the errors that you can that can happen

94
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.540
when you're working with maps or data errors when working with maps and we'll see how to fix them.

95
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.730
And that'll be a very interesting more very useful tutorial if you are planning on working with maps

96
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.430
going forward.

97
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.280
OK.

98
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.490
So that's it for today.

99
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.810
Thank you very much for attention.

100
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.370
I look forward to seeing you next time.

101
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.140
And until then happy analyzing.
