00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,830
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,510
In today's tutorial we will look at what special files are and how we are able to connect to them in

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,320
tableau.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,320
Jones is all that you are not an expert if you are.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,800
Feel free to take a short break.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,260
Sit back and enjoy the presentation.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,250
Now the idea of this tutorial is not to make you an expert on special falls but at least to be able

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,610
to know your way around the different types and how to use them not Tableau allows us to connect to

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,990
four different types.

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,100
The first being shaped falls.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,000
We also have map info tables keyhole Markup Language or came out and the geo Jason fall.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,700
Let's have a closer look at shortfalls however now shape files was developed by the environmental system

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,610
Resource Institute and is one of the more widely used types with inside files.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,890
We have a few manatee files that needs to be included in the package.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,520
Firstly we've got the HP file which is the shape format.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,260
The S H x your shape index format and your db file which is your attribute format.

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,560
Now we don't need to know the details of these fields or these files but at least be aware that all

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,660
three of these needs to be present in our structure or in our folder to be able to use it within tableau.

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,750
Now they might also be some additional information that is supplied with the file and it can be any

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,310
of these fall types in there.

21
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,830
But as a minimum be sure that all three of those files are required to be used within tableau.

22
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,750
Now we have a similar pattern on the map in the tables where we have four different fault ups which

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,590
are required.

24
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,310
There are also a couple of alternative files and before came Al and Jason.

25
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,990
We just have one required File Type Two able to use this with Tableau.

26
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,190
Now working with Max in tableau we know there are three different types and some of these might seem

27
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,680
familiar from earlier on in the course.

28
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,220
The first type is the polygon map which is also referred to as the fold map where we have polygons depicting

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,070
the shape and or the outline of a specific area on the map and then we can use our dimensions and measures

30
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,210
to color those.

31
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:16,120
This the whole polygon then we also have a point map where we actually use the latitude and longitude

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,750
points within a map to point out where certain things are located and we can enrich that obviously with

33
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,760
our dimension as measures in terms of color and sizing and a few other attributes.

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,680
Lastly we have the line map which connects different points on your map to be able to show direction

35
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,250
or actual distances between points on your map.

36
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,380
Now we also know that tableau has some built in geographic roles that we can work with in Tableau and

37
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,530
we can define these as city country or state zip codes as well.

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,120
We even have airports and some other area codes that we can use but these are also quite limiting and

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,670
they might also be the occasional time when you might need to use geographic roles outside of what's

40
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,470
available with Tableau.

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:05,950
Examples of these might be school districts dams or parks where we need that additional spatial data

42
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,010
not from tableau ten point two onwards tableau has made it possible for us to connect directly to customers

43
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,830
spatial files to draw these shapes out on the maps but these are obviously limited to the four types

44
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,160
which we have just referred to.

45
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,200
So how does this work.

46
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,360
Now it's very easy you just need to obtain the spatial falls from an authority or an open data platform.

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,790
And this could also be from some of your cities or local government institutions that generally supply

48
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,210
a vast number of these different shaped files and what we need to ensure there is that we do have the

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,420
required fields for the types that are being supplied.

50
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,260
So once we have we are connecting to this tableau will then analyze the files and make the files available

51
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,810
to be used within tableau then the tableau basically transform the Falls using the latitude and longitude

52
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,960
information and creates a very important new field which we haven't seen before is the geometry field

53
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,560
and the geometry fueled basically acts as an alias for the underlying data that is able to draw the

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,480
lines or points or polygons even on our maps.

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,510
So generally the shape files that are supplied by these institutions also contain additional information.

56
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,970
So when you are looking for specific data or say have a look when you connect to the spatial files what

57
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,860
else is available in there for analysis before searching for it on any other platform.

58
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,200
Now the data that we are looking at for this specific case was obtained from the New York City open

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,460
data platform.

60
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,850
And if I just open up the folder you'll see that we have four files in there.

61
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,880
Firstly we have the debate file the shape file and the s h x file.

62
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,200
Lastly we also have the project which is additional information.

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,340
But as we know we at least have the three mandatory files that we need to use the spatial files all

64
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,220
the other the shape files for this specific format.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,190
But this opens a blur and see how it works in practice.

66
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,550
So we'll start off by adding a new data source.

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,750
And again we just look at our data source types and we can just select the spatial file when we go to

68
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,450
or when we navigate to our folder.

69
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,270
We'll see that tableau is only looking what it looks for the couple of types there.

70
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,600
But we have the shape file and that's what we'll select to connect there and immediately tableau connects

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,270
through it and draws through all of the information that's within these contained within these files.

72
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,120
So what's important for us is in this specific case will be the name field or the name three you want

73
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,430
one which will rename a bit later the borough in which it is fitting back to the case study we need

74
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,650
to do something with the borough.

75
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,410
And lastly the geometry.

76
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,880
So there'll be some cleanup necessary here but this is the important field that we spoke about that

77
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,800
contains and we know what kind of shape or what kind of point will be drawn and we know that this is

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,290
the alias that connected to the information in the background to know how to draw this.

79
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,590
The latitude and longitude because you'll do You'll notice that all that information is not captured

80
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,420
in here.

81
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,080
All right.

82
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,980
Just to see what it looks like we'll just open up a new sheet and go and look for the geometry image

83
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,520
over there.

84
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,630
Once you drag that into your map immediately it draws all of the different box as one object.

85
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,090
By the way so let's quickly put in the name into detail to make them individual.

86
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,510
There we go.

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,710
And you can see all of the different box and public spaces within New York.

88
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,370
It will be drawing and you can see there Central Park which we need to exclude for our best case study.

89
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,710
And all of them.

90
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,080
And if you scroll in as well you can see how the shapes are exactly the same as the actual box within

91
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,000
this city.

92
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,740
So quite a lot of public spaces and public box with in New York City.

93
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,130
And that wasn't for this lecture in the next material.

94
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:54,890
We'll be connecting the spatial files to our PBF data in preparation to solve the business challenge

95
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,130
inching our way forward to the final result.

96
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,010
I look forward to seeing you the next time.

97
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,820
Until then happy analyzing.
