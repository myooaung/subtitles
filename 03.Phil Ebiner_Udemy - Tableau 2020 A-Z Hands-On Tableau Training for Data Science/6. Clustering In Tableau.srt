00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,430
Hello and welcome back to the course and tell them today we're talking about clustering, so as we know,

2
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,740
we have our cities here visualize and we can see the revenue, whether it's high, whether it's low,

3
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,260
that is told by the color and the size.

4
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,350
We can also even highlight the new ones, these 10 new ones.

5
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,660
But we can't really tell from here which ones we should invest to in terms of marketing, which is the

6
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,440
best bets.

7
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,560
So we can probably say that this one has a low revenue, but at the same time, this is not really a

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,050
storytelling visualization.

9
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,400
So let's proceed to creating a storytelling visualization to create a new sheet.

10
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,680
And here we are going to actually visualize a revenue versus marketing spend.

11
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,400
So revenue is going to be Y-axis and marketing spend is going to be our X axis.

12
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,740
And as you see, we only have one dot here.

13
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,950
So we can either disaggregate these dots or their approach is to actually use the story in detail to

14
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,380
change the level of granularity.

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,510
And we already know how that works in the background.

16
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,780
So that's always exciting to understand what we're doing.

17
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,380
Exactly.

18
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,100
And as you can see here, we've got some points on our scatterplot and in total we have 150 points.

19
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,180
So you can confirm that if you check on the bottom left in the bottom left corner.

20
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:03,650
And what we are seeing here is every single city in our dataset, we're seeing the revenue versus the

21
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,440
marketing spend.

22
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,070
So maybe let's just make this a little bit bigger.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,770
That's a great start.

24
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,530
That is awesome.

25
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,230
And already from here, we can tell that there's at least there's there's two distinct groups.

26
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,880
There's a group of cities over here which are kind of performing quite OK.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,910
And then there's some cities here that are not performing either.

28
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,120
OK?

29
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,080
And why is that?

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,100
Well, here we've got marketing spend.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,660
So as you move from left to right, you're increasing the marketing spend.

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,680
You're spending more and more.

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,230
And here we've got the revenue.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,250
So you would expect that the more you spend on marketing, the more revenue you get.

35
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:43,460
So, for instance, for to start with you, if you take two cities, for example, you take this city,

36
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,170
it's or the store in the city, it's got an idea of 48 or a city.

37
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,380
This location, it is 48 basically.

38
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,570
So marketing spend is two thousand dollars, revenue is sixteen thousand.

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,680
And if you take this city here, marketing spend is three thousand, nearly four thousand.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,350
Revenue fifty six thousand dollars.

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,990
That makes sense.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,200
Right.

43
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,310
So when you increase your marketing spend, you expect a more revenue.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,400
But then this city, for example, doesn't make sense.

45
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:07,870
Right.

46
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,740
So you have a city here which the marketing spend for is one thousand eight hundred dollars and the

47
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,000
revenues nineteen thousand.

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,260
And this city marketing spend is three thousand nine hundred dollars.

49
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,080
So more than twice as much.

50
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,670
So this was one thousand eight hundred thirty thousand nine hundred, but there are still nineteen thousand

51
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,990
dollars.

52
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:32,300
So if we talk in terms of trends, then these cities, they might be sharing a certain characteristic

53
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:38,210
that they all kind of like they're all stuck at this twenty thousand dollar revenue level.

54
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,870
And regardless of how much you invest into marketing, it doesn't really change anything.

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,650
So if you invest more, you're not getting more return.

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,920
Whereas these cities here, you can see that there's an obvious trend.

57
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,290
If you invest two thousand five hundred dollars, you'll get somewhere around 40000 revenue.

58
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,090
If you invest three thousand five hundred dollars, you invest, you get somewhere on 60000 dollars

59
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,520
in revenue.

60
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,970
So as you can see, there's two distinct groups and we can actually visually see them.

61
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,900
So that's always a good thing.

62
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:10,460
But how do we now identify them analytically from a statistical point of view?

63
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,340
And this is where clustering comes into play.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,600
If we go to the analytics tab on the left here and we scroll down, you'll find this option for under

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,440
models, which is cluster, and that will allow you to cluster or create clusters, identify clusters

66
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,690
in your visualization.

67
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,560
So let's go ahead and try it out, will drag it onto the chart and that's it.

68
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,910
So right away you can see that the variables used are some of marketing spend, which we have over here,

69
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,710
some of revenue, which is also over here.

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,310
So the variables that are building our visualisation just by using them, Tableau is applying an algorithm

71
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:53,120
called K means clustering and it is right away building this visualization for us.

72
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:00,550
Now, it's a very quick way to derive very powerful insights.

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,380
So from here we can tell right away.

74
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,160
So Tableau grouped all of these into one cluster and grouped all of these into one cluster.

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,750
And it's it's quite intuitive, right?

76
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,400
So exactly what we spoke about.

77
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,860
We just didn't think that these would fall into that cluster.

78
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,120
But Tableau is using information that it has on a marketing spend.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,800
So these variables to identify which are alike, which of these stores or cities are alike, that they

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,790
can be put into one group.

81
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,390
And it turns out that these are all alike and these are all alike.

82
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,450
So they kind of like very close to each other in that sense, just by looking at this visualisation

83
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,010
in terms of distance.

84
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,240
Right.

85
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,010
So we can see that these if there is if you're going to identify two groups and this is how tableau.

86
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,390
Just identify them.

87
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:52,310
No, that's a great start, and we can already derive some insights from here, we can say which cities,

88
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:59,420
depending on which group you fall into your city falls into, you're either deriving a good return on

89
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,620
marketing investment or a not such a great return marketing investment.

90
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,870
And, for instance, we can check our cities that we have.

91
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:12,050
So if we go back to data and we look at new expansion, put it into detail and then we show highlighter.

92
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,770
So now I'm just going to bring the color to the left.

93
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,850
Now, what we can do is we can just look at the new cities and you can see them being identified there.

94
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:26,000
So you can see that we've got two cities in the lower group and we've got all these other cities in

95
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,970
the better group.

96
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,450
So this is some preliminary clustering analysis that we've performed.

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,130
And right away, we can tell from here that probably it's better to invest into these cities rather

98
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,190
than into these cities because the return investment is better.

99
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,130
But at the same time, what we can see is that this is probably not the final step in our clustering

100
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,090
and ours, because we can see that these cities, they don't look exactly that.

101
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,660
They belong to this group more so they look like they belong to this group.

102
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:00,170
And in the future, tutorials in this section will learn how to refine our clustering analysis even

103
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,310
more so that it is more sophisticated and it's telling an even better story.

104
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,040
Now, I wanted to mention as well that don't worry, if this is it looks a bit complicated right now

105
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,300
or something that you haven't encountered before, that's totally unexpected.

106
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,080
That's totally normal.

107
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,450
In the coming, tutorials will get more used to this concept of clustering and identifying these groups.

108
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,350
We'll talk about some trends and you'll see exactly how we'll derive the analysis.

109
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,290
For now, what is important for us is just to understand how to perform this clustering analysis, how

110
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,990
to create these clusters using the analytics pane and going forward will be much more comfortable,

111
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,360
will get much more comfortable with this whole concept.

112
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,900
I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

113
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,550
Until then, I'll be analyzing.
