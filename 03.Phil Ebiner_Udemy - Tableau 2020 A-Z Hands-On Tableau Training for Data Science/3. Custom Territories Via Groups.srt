00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,830
Hello.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,900
Welcome back to the course on Tableau.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,380
In today's tutorial we're going to solve the first part of the challenge and we'll identify which of

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,900
the two regions is outperforming the other.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,290
Specifically we will talk about measuring these three or assessing these three metrics and plotting

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,010
them on a map.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,340
And in order to solve this challenge we're going to learn how to create custom geographical regions

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,410
or custom territories in tableau.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,580
So give me a fun tutorial.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,210
Let's get straight to it.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,620
All right.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:38,000
Here is Tableau and let's open up our data set which is an Excel file so there it is startup expansion.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,720
And if you have a look here you'll see that indeed this is our file at the bottom of 150 rows and ten

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,870
of them are the new locations or the new cities where the company opened up recently.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,140
All right.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,780
So let's proceed to solving the spiral challenge.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,020
How are we going to visualize our different sales regions.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,260
Well first of all let's create a map will drag state onto the blank area and we will change this to

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,470
a field map.

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,860
As you can see here and now we've got the states where the company does operate.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,400
So you can see that they don't operate everywhere in the U.S. but in no problem the majority of states

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,430
they are present.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,140
Now how do we even for ourselves identify how these states are broken up into those two sales regions

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,740
so how do we know which states belong to sales region one and which states belong sales region two.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,290
Well the fastest way is to just take sales region and put it into color and then we go we can see that

26
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:42,450
there are two sales regions which are kind of like competing for performers which are trying to grow

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,300
faster and obviously it's it's a way to structure a company or a startup to split it into two pirates

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,700
and then see kind of put them against each other so that they strive for the better growth and things

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,730
like that.

30
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,440
So that's great.

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,700
And now how do we assess those metrics.

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,760
So for example one of the metrics that we're assessing is the average revenue per city.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,620
How do we how you measure that or how to assess it.

34
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,770
Well let's give it a try.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,380
We'll take revenue and put it onto label.

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,770
Now we will change this label very quickly so we'll click here click in side to form and liberal maybe

37
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,220
make it a 14.

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,860
So now you can see the some of the revenue for every state.

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,660
Now we can quickly change it to measure some sunless change to average snow you can see the average

40
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,080
revenue per state.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,120
So what does that mean.

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,290
Well for example in Texas you can see that it's is thirty seven thousand six hundred eighty one so that's

43
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,120
the average of all the revenues in the state of Texas for all the cities in the state of Texas.

44
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,740
So if you go to the top you'll see that in Texas we've got at least two cities.

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,670
So there's Midland there's Denton and probably some more cities in Texas.

46
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:55,290
And so they all have their revenue and what we see seeing here is the average of all the cities in Texas.

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,250
But what we are actually after is the average revenue for all the cities in sales Region 1 and the average

48
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,950
on the revenue for all the cities in sales Region 2.

49
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,200
So actually we don't want the grouping the aggregation that just occurred and even if we take the averages

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,010
of these averages that's not exactly what we're after.

51
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,250
We just want Tableau to recognize this orange territory as a separate geographical object and then aggregate

52
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,430
in that object and then also recognize the blue territories or territory as one geographical object

53
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,580
and group or aggregate all of the cities inside of that territory and aggregate over them as well.

54
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,520
So we just want to numbers not that many numbers.

55
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,650
So how would we go about doing this.

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,670
Well this is where we start talking about creating our custom territories.

57
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,000
So basically we want table to recognize is a custom territory and this is a custom church.

58
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,770
And then tableau there are two ways for creating custom territories.

59
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,800
Today we'll look at approach number one.

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,140
All right.

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,520
So how would we do it.

62
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,080
Well it's actually pretty simple.

63
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,570
Were you engineered to use a group.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,880
Now I know we haven't spoken about groups in this course and groups are a topic that we cover off in

65
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,990
the advanced class on Tableau but nevertheless we're going to need them now so I'm going to give you

66
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,650
a quick preview of groups and you'll see how you can use them to solve this challenge and if you're

67
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,400
interested in further developing a knowledge then you can always learn more about the groups in the

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,060
advanced course.

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,830
All right.

70
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,550
So what we're going to do is I'm going to hold on control and select all of the states that we want

71
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,130
to put into one of these regions.

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,080
So there there are.

73
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,640
And now we're going to just either hold our mouse over these one of them and you'll see that we've got

74
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,600
some options here and grouping is actually this option here which looks like a a little staple or something

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,250
like that.

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,320
And the other option is if you're right click and you slide group and you just in case we select all

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,430
dimensions.

78
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,810
So now we've created a group.

79
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,630
You can see the group on the left.

80
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,560
There it is sales regions and states so that's how the group was created.

81
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,710
That's what's included.

82
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,380
And if you right click it and select edit group you'll see that it has two parts to it.

83
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,520
Now I'm not going to go into detail about groups this is not part of what we're focusing on right now.

84
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,490
We actually just want to understand the custom territories.

85
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,130
So not in order to create the custom territory from here.

86
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,790
There's just one more step left.

87
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,850
All you have to do is take state out of your possession from here and voila as you can see now tableau

88
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,280
has created two custom territories.

89
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,650
So I'm just gonna move this over here and you can see that this is one huge custom territory which is

90
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,420
sales region number two and this is sales agent and once you can see that even it's not even though

91
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,240
it's not contiguous.

92
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,430
So it's like broken down into three bits.

93
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,240
Trouble is recognizing it as a separate territory which is a very very powerful thing to have and then

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,840
you have the average already has been calculated.

95
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,910
Now if you want to restore the previous color is very simple just click edit color select here orange

96
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,400
slice your blue click Okay.

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,000
There they are.

98
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,860
And so now you can see that that is our average revenue.

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,720
So right now out of these two custom territories this custom territory is performing better.

100
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
So a region one is outperforming region 2.

101
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,460
Now we have to check the other two metrics as well.

102
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,300
So let's put marketing spend in here as well we'll see average.

103
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,040
By the way here here's a quick tip.

104
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,540
So instead of sort of doing this instead of dragging the label or the object the measure into the label

105
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,360
and then selecting from the dropdown measure average what you can do to speed up the process is right

106
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:34,030
click when you're about to drag instead of left clicking right click drag it into label and right away

107
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,980
you're given this window where you can select has a pretty cool shortcut.

108
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,060
So it will allows you to save a bit of time on that one step and narrow it right away which to the average

109
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,450
marketing spend.

110
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,550
And finally.

111
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,480
So let's let's actually also put in the sales region into the label and what does the other thing are

112
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,250
we wanted the roaming rates.

113
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,740
So we wanted the return on marketing investment which is revenue divided by marketing spend let's create

114
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:07,210
a calculated field that's going to be Romi and marketing spend or revenue divided by marketing spend

115
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,670
click.

116
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,410
Okay.

117
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,960
Romi put that into the label as well.

118
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:17,800
Or again less is the shortcut right click put the label average Romi and let's just tidy up this label

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,940
a bit.

120
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:27,100
We're going to take sales region and put it at the top and then get rid of this and then we'll say average

121
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,560
revenue average marketing spend.

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,780
And finally average for Romi and all of these should be centered.

123
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,280
OK.

124
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,870
So let's click.

125
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,260
Okay.

126
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:49,080
So there you can see right away we've got some stats already region to average revenue 38 Region 1.

127
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,850
Average revenue 40.

128
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:59,200
So Region 1 is ahead in that sense then in terms of marketing spend got to two thousand in Region 2

129
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,340
and in Region 1 We've got two thousand eight hundred eighty nine.

130
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,720
So in this sense region one is ahead as well because average marketing spend that less it is the better.

131
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:15,370
And finally average Romi the more the better in Region 1 it's a bit better because it's 14 dollars revenue

132
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,630
per dollar marketing spend in a region to it's only thirteen point four.

133
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:20,900
All right.

134
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,560
So that is how we come up with these of course you can tidy these up a little bit so that so they look

135
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,260
a bit better.

136
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:34,390
So you can always change the font and size and for example let's just click on the label and here you

137
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,110
can change this to let's say at 12.

138
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,210
Probably would be better and bold and something that so very looks better than of course getting rid

139
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,790
of these zeros you can also round your average marketing span so apply some calculations.

140
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,450
But we're not going to focus on that the main focus was today's will was to hard to create this custom

141
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,160
territory.

142
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,470
And so we discussed the method for custom territories through creating a group.

143
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:04,900
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and it is a very very powerful feature that you can use in your mapping

144
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,830
techniques.

145
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,400
So definitely keep it in mind.

146
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,860
And I look forward to see you next time.

147
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,090
Until then Happy coding.
