00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,460
Hello and welcome back to the course and Tableau in the previous tutorial we learned how to create these

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,270
clusters.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,940
And at the same time we also identified that even though they are telling us some sort of story and

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,340
they are identifying some trends that we are also seeing with our naked eye at the same time they might

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,640
not be the final step in our analysis maybe we can somehow refine these clusters to tell of an even

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,530
better story.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,070
And that's exactly what we're going to do today.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,180
So to start off with let's just step away from this analytics in tableau for a second and let's just

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,640
do some analytical and critical thinking for a bit.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,770
So what company are we working for.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,660
It's important to always remember the domain knowledge behind what you're doing.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,350
It's a very powerful skill in data science the capacity and ability to understand the domain knowledge.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,560
So this company this company isn't just a company that produces pirates for a factory.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,180
This company isn't just a financial services organization that gives out loans to countries around the

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,950
world.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,070
This company deals with people.

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,650
This company heavily actually relies on people.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:19,080
In fact this company what they do is they come to your house they collect your washing and then they

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,210
take it to their store.

20
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,460
They wash it for you and then they bring it back.

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,210
So it's kind of like an outsourcing of your laundry.

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,110
That's a service that they provide.

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,230
And that's in their entire business.

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:38,700
So in this case as you can imagine their amount of work that they get is directly proportionate to the

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,550
amount of people that they can potentially service.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:49,620
So what exactly I'm hinting at is population to put it very bluntly the amount of dirty clothes in a

27
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,930
city is directly correlated to the population of that city.

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,730
Other companies that service a population they might not have such a direct correlation of the amount

29
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,470
of work to the amount of people.

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,850
But for a laundry company the more people you have exactly proportionately the more you will have dirty

31
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,870
laundry in that city.

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:17,400
So population of a city might play actually a huge role in their analysis that we're about to perform

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,430
and that is important to always remember and understand.

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:28,720
So what if these cities so this company it works all across different parts of the US and as we discussed

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,510
at the beginning they can't afford to compete with the major players so they're not present in cities

36
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,030
like New York like San Francisco Los Angeles that we're not present in the very big big cities they're

37
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,180
going for after the smaller cities still large cities with hundreds of thousands of population.

38
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:52,530
But at the same time a bit smaller so what if what is going on here is somehow related to the size of

39
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,180
the population maybe what if this trend that we're seeing here that even though they're investing more

40
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,800
and more into marketing they're not getting more and more people or they're not getting more and more

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,330
revenue.

42
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,210
Maybe that is related to the fact that they've maxed out their capacity or their share of that population

43
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,380
and that associated city maybe there is some sort of correlation there.

44
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,980
Maybe those marketing efforts that they're investing into whether they're online or offline maybe those

45
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:27,240
marketing efforts have a limit of how much what what portion of the population they can bring.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,150
And in these specific cities maybe they're just smaller cities and maybe we'll see something going on

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:40,920
like that there so is a very powerful skill to have to be able to bring in external data sets into your

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,880
analysis to refine your analysis.

49
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,080
And that's exactly what we're going to do now.

50
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:52,110
So as you remember in our data set we had another file which was the population data set.

51
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,260
So let's go ahead and find that file.

52
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,640
What I can do is I can connect to that file just so I can create a new data source connection and remember

53
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:09,000
it was an Excel file as a CSP file so if I go to text you will see here among these files U.S. cities

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,860
population.

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,790
So this file contains information on the population of the cities of the top cities in the US and among

56
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,690
them all of our cities are among those cities.

57
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,530
So what we could do is we could create a new connection and then we could create new tab.

58
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,840
And as you can see we have two separate connections.

59
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,230
So in order to bring these cities into the analysis what we would need to do is perform and blend and

60
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,360
that is one of the options that we have at the same time.

61
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,350
We can now do something that was not possible before in trouble previously in previous older versions

62
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,830
of tableau.

63
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,170
What you couldn't do is you couldn't create a cross data joint so right now I want to create a joint

64
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,100
and I want to join an excel data source or the one we have now to assist the data file the one that

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,540
we are going to connect to now the file with the populations.

66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,350
Previously you couldn't do that in tableau but the tables have created a facility that now you can create

67
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,810
cross out of joints and you can create cross-border joints for lots of different data sources not everything

68
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,650
but for very for a huge variety you can.

69
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,820
And one of them is Excel to CSB.

70
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,310
So that's exactly what you going to do.

71
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,090
We're going to click the Add button over here and from the dropdown we're going to select text file

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,900
because we're connecting to a CSP file U.S. city's population.

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,780
And once we've selected that as you can see it has been added.

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,480
Now before we talk about this joint first thing and we want to do is make sure it's being performed

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,160
correctly.

76
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,530
If we click on this button here you'll see that it's been matched by city.

77
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,800
But as we discussed there are duplicate cities in the US and more so there can be duplicate cities in

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,700
our data set.

79
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,620
So therefore this could be a do a join with duplicates that's happening right now.

80
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,720
So just city by itself is not a good enough is not specific enough.

81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,530
And as you can see that is exactly the case.

82
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,090
Right now we actually have 159 rows instead of 150.

83
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,490
So some arrows indeed got duplicated in part as part of this joint.

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,900
There's something very important you need to look out for.

85
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,590
So always make sure you're performing in the joint correctly in our case we want to not only join on

86
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:23,820
city but we want to join on state from this data source and state from this data source.

87
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,210
So we have to make sure that our joint has been performed correctly.

88
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,530
And now if I close this you'll see that there is 150 rows.

89
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,910
So no duplication has occurred.

90
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,700
So if you scroll down you'll see that there's 150 rows and it's always a good thing to check to just

91
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,330
double check that you haven't performed any duplication of rows and that the joints performed correctly.

92
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,240
And so now moving back to this great feature of Cross dinosaur joint what we actually created here is

93
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,130
a one of them.

94
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,070
One of those cross artists joints we've got an Excel file on the left.

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,820
We've got a CSP file on the right previously was not possible.

96
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,400
Now we can do that.

97
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,360
We can in fact we can create connect a SDL database with an excel file and a CSP file and also add a

98
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,590
Maya skill database.

99
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,080
So there's lots of different combinations that you can create a great shout out to the guys from tableau

100
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,060
for creating this functionality.

101
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,940
It is going to make analytics much more fun and interesting and it will allow us to perform on a list

102
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,310
that the privacy we couldn't perform.

103
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,430
So that's a great great feature.

104
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,770
And now we're just going to proceed with this combined dataset so we can actually just rename it's a

105
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,110
combined data set.

106
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,910
And here what we have is the original data set with the blue lines at the top then we've got color fields

107
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,380
and then Orange is the new dataset.

108
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:49,080
So we all all we need from here is actually the population so the 2015 estimate.

109
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,250
So we're going to just select all the other columns.

110
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,760
Hold down control and we're going to right click and we're going to hide them because we don't need

111
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,980
them in our analysis.

112
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,560
There it is the estimate of the population we're just going to call it population for our purposes and

113
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:12,450
now we can proceed on to our Advanced Clustering or refined clustering and we'll start on that in the

114
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,240
next trial.

115
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,600
Can't wait to see you there.

116
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,200
Until then happy analyzing.
