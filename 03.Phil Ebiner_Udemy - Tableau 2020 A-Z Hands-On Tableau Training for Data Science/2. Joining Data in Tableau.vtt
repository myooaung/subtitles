00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.520
Hello and welcome back to the course and tableau.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.580
And in today's tutorial we will download and connect to the data that will be working within this section.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.620
And we will also learn how to do a join in tableau.

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.770
So a very interesting tutorial ahead.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.080
Let's get straight to it.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.810
First of all we'll need a browser.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
And as usual we will go to Super daughter signs dot com slash tableau.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.760
And here if you scroll down to Section 4 you will see maps and scatter plots.

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.450
And let's just download this file which is amazing Marc.

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.870
You say I'm going to save that file to my tableau folder now and once a file is saved I can open up

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.400
the folder.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.730
Here you see the file and let's open it up and have a look what's inside.

13
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.670
So there's my file and I'm just zooming in a little bit so we can see a bit better what's going on.

14
00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.870
And here you can see first thing that pops in to our attention is that there's three tabs list of orders

15
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.030
order breakdown and sales targets.

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.070
So right now we're looking at the very first step.

17
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.820
What is it showing us.

18
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.130
Well this tab is showing us a list of orders.

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:19.220
So these orders this column of the values in this column are unique and every single order it has its

20
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.450
details here on the right.

21
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.780
So when the order is placed who the customer's customer is what's the name of the customer that placed

22
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.490
the order which region of Europe the order was placed in which country in this region.

23
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.660
Which state in the country.

24
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:43.280
Which city in the state and is also has information on whether this customer is shopping as a consumer

25
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.570
or corporate customer or how or for a Home Office has got the shipping date and the shipping mode.

26
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.270
So basically every single order is described here in detail and every single order is only featured

27
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.170
once in this tab and that's an important observation.

28
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.840
Now if we move on to the second tab we will see order breakdown.

29
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.540
So this tab is different now.

30
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.170
Here we can see that some orders are duplicated for instance these two orders are duplicated.

31
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.220
So it's the same order but it's shown twice.

32
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.130
Well why is that.

33
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.420
And that is because the customer that placed this order actually ordered several items he ordered Boston

34
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.560
markers and Elden folders and then for each item there is a discount the value that was discounted off

35
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.340
the order the sales the profit for the.

36
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.230
For that specific item the quantity and what category it falls under or whether it's office supplies

37
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.110
furniture or technology.

38
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.780
And the subcategory.

39
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.780
So here we can see that every single order is broken down it is itemized into what exactly constitutes

40
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.260
that order.

41
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.820
So we don't we no longer have information on where when the order was placed.

42
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.580
Which region is was shipped into.

43
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.540
But we know what was inside this order.

44
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:11.090
And so if we go back to the first tab here we will see that in total at the bottom so if I just highlight

45
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.780
the score column you'll see here that there is a count of four thousand one hundred eighteen sells.

46
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.540
So basically because the first sell is the header is four thousand one hundred and seventeen orders

47
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.460
and in order breakdown as we can expect there's more cells.

48
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.710
There's actually eight thousand and forty eight cells so that means eight thousand forty seven items

49
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.340
in total were well constituted.

50
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.380
These orders that were made.

51
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.290
And so that's important to remember that in this tab order idea is unique in this tab or the I.D. is

52
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.710
not unique anymore.

53
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.190
And finally there's another tab called sales targets.

54
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.760
Now in this section of the course we won't focus on the sales type and targets tab.

55
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.890
We'll talk about it in the next section.

56
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.710
So let's leave it for now.

57
00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.080
What we will need in our data is we will need to somehow join these two tabs because for us it's not

58
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.140
sufficient to only know where the order went and when it was made and what kind of and who the customer

59
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.880
is.

60
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.130
We also need to know what constituted that specific order.

61
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.820
So the information from this tab and likewise it's not enough for us to know just what constituted an

62
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.170
order because we also need to know who the customer was where it went and when it was placed.

63
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.950
So inevitably we're going to have to work with both these tabs and we need to find a way to combine

64
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.490
them more join them.

65
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.970
So let's see how we can do that in tableau.

66
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm just gonna close this Excel file for now.

67
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.580
I don't need to say changes and what we're going to do is we're going to help open up a tableau and

68
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.220
we will connect to this data source so we're going to connect to an excel file.

69
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.730
And here we've got amazing Mart EU open it up and here right away we can see something different to

70
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.730
what we normally used to on the left.

71
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.950
There's actually three sub items that we can choose from and these are the tabs that we just looked

72
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.270
at list of orders order breakdown and sales targets.

73
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.620
So let's have a look at list of orders.

74
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.180
If we drag it into here as we normally do we'll have a preview of the tab that is list of orders which

75
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.200
is fair enough.

76
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.790
Now let's close that and drag order breakdown into this section.

77
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.360
Now we have a preview of the order breakdown tab same thing as we saw just now.

78
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.450
So now what are we going to do how are we going to connect them.

79
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:40.170
Well tableau has a very convenient functionality it allows you to join these two files and that's exactly

80
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.180
what we're going to do doing we're going to be joining these two tabs.

81
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.540
So let's first do it and then we'll discuss what we did.

82
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.670
First we're going to take a list of orders and will drag it into this part of the data connection manager.

83
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.960
And now we're going to take order breakdown.

84
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.920
And we will also drag it in there but we'll put it to the right of list of orders.

85
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.640
And once you let go you will see automatically that tableau has come up with some sort of icon here

86
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.170
which is signaling to us that these two file two tabs are now connected.

87
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.840
And if we look at preview there is many more columns now.

88
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.380
So these columns here come from the first file that come from a list of orders and then these columns

89
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.390
on the right here.

90
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.960
They come from the second file.

91
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.760
They come from the order breakdown.

92
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.340
And if you click on this connection over here you will see what tableau did tableau did an inner join.

93
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.510
So now if you're not familiar with the term inner join don't worry because in the next section of the

94
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.160
course we will talk in detail about inner joins left joins right joins full outer joins and so on because

95
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.280
it is quite an important topic in Tableau and connecting to data.

96
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.640
But for now we'll just try to understand what exactly did tableau do based on this description or here

97
00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.870
you can kind of guess that tableau looked at order the order idea field in this tab and then it looks

98
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:07.040
at the order idea field in this tab and it matched the two of tabs based on this field.

99
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:14.730
So basically what that means is for whenever there was an order of X table looks for the same order

100
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.930
idea in this file and attached it to the rows in this file.

101
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:26.970
So now that we know that the call the order idea field in the first tab is unique and it's not unique

102
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.640
in a second.

103
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.570
What that means is that for every order idea in the first tab there were there might have been several

104
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.150
order ideas in the second tab.

105
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.710
Well in that case what happens is tableau will duplicate the rows from the first tab.

106
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.090
So let's have a look an example of that.

107
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:48.150
If you scroll down here to the very bottom I notice there is a few here so you as you can see here these

108
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:54.120
rows are duplicated so you can see and all the information in these columns is identical so tableau

109
00:07:54.150 --> 00:08:01.450
did duplicate these rows and then connect them to the Associated rows in the second tab.

110
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.110
And here the rest of the information is unique of course because these are different items in that second

111
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.350
for the second tab.

112
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:17.310
So what we did basically is we've created a new structure a new table based on those two data sources

113
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.050
and going forward from here tableau will be working with this table rather than with either of these

114
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.810
and that is a very very powerful feature that means that we've actually modified the data that tableau

115
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.910
will be working for not that we've changed the data we've modified the structure it's no longer two

116
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:40.500
separate tables it's one table that has been joined and to acknowledge this here will just change the

117
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.170
name from list of orders to plus order breakdown

118
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.490
so if we click just click anywhere here.

119
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:59.030
Now the connection has been created and if we go to sheet one you'll see our connection here and now

120
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:09.950
also you can see that tableau has got all the columns as was featured in the data connection but it's

121
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.840
also separated them here to show you which file they are coming from where it's coming from the list

122
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.450
of orders or from the order breakdown file.

123
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:24.530
So that is how we join in Tableau and once again don't worry if you're not entirely sure or comfortable

124
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:30.930
of what just what we just did because there'll be a whole section on this stuff very soon in the course.

125
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:38.630
So just follow along with what we did today and we'll get along with the tableau lost part of the course.

126
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:45.680
So the visualization part in the section and then we will recap again on joining in adjoins outer joins

127
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.110
and so on and even we'll talk about blending in the next section of the course.

128
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.030
So hope you enjoyed the tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

129
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.590
Until then happy analyzing.
