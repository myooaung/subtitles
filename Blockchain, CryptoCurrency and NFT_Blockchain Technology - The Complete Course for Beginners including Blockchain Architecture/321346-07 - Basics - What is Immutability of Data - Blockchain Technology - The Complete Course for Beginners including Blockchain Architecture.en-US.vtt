00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
hello.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.050
Blockchain has always been lauded for its data in mutability.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.540
This is one of the most powerful and convincing reason why Blockchain deployment is on the

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.980
rise across industries and industries such as financial services,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.150
identity management and so on.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.560
Where data mutability is very,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.950
very important.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.870
In this lecture,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:36.000
we are going to loan why data cannot be manipulated in Blockchain on how it ensures the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.050
data integrity on in mutability.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.050
Let's first try to understand the data image ability with a simple email example.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.950
You can send an email to multiple participants as long as you have their email i D.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.290
But once it has been received by them,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.240
you don't have any control on the data.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.150
Within the email,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.230
you cannot modify our alter,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.750
the content of the email.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.990
That's why the email can be said to have the muted ley de from mortification even by the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.630
center.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.220
So now let's say one off the participants,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.450
while forwarding the email,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.850
might modify the content of the email while sending it to boot.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.600
However,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.470
if Bill decides to verify it,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.540
he can do so from any off the other participants,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.760
such as Alice,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.750
Bob or even you who also have a copy off that email.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.060
So when we see Blockchain is immutable,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.950
we don't mean that the data can be changed.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.000
We simply mean that it's extremely hard to change,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.850
but very easy to detect our verify,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.990
for example,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.450
to break a combination off a lock.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.550
It might take a long time,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.650
but once you have the right combination,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.350
it's very easy to verify whether the lock will open with that combination or not.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.240
Let's try to understand that with a Blockchain in this Blockchain,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.520
if someone tries to modify any content or transaction off this block,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.260
it will change the hash off the block that makes the subsequent blocks previous hash as

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.110
invalid on those hashes also need to be changed in order for them to be valued on.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.650
It requires a great deal of energy on processing power.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.250
To calculate the hashes on this is the most prohibitive factor on.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.950
Hence,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.680
it is saying that block chains are immutable on the data cannot be tampered without being

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.950
detected easily.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.510
That concludes this lecture on mutability off data in the Blockchain.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.530
In this section,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.450
we have learned what is the block on a Blockchain,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.710
along with the characteristics off a Blockchain.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.450
We also learned what is a distributed leisure differences between database and Blockchain

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.410
as well as types of Blockchain such as permission less or public auction Was the permission

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.830
Blockchain Lastly,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.370
in this lecture weaker word how Blockchain and shows in mutability off the data Thank you

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.750
so much for joining me in this one and I will see you in the next section.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.250
Very learn about the details off cryptography.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.410
Until then,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.150
enjoy Blockchain learning.
