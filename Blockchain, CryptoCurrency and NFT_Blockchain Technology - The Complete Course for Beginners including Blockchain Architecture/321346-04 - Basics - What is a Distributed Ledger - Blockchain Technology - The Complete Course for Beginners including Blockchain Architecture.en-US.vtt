00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
Hello.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.050
In the previous lecture,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.250
we learned about what is a Blockchain and its various correct restricts.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.730
In this lecture,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.450
let's try to understand the core concert off distributed leisure.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.430
Let's try to understand the V current payment system works by going through how you have

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.550
purchased this course on how many parties were involved.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.540
When you click on the buy button,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.870
you were prompted to enter the credit card or similar payment instrument.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.240
Details which were provided to you by your bankers on the banker in this case is also

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.140
called as sure in the payment language you re.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.490
Me,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.740
on the other hand,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.250
also has a banker,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850
which is also known as an acquirer.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.050
The payment details are typically entered on passed through the payment gateways.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.910
You and your enemy are both interacting with this payment gateway for the transaction.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:15.850
The payment gateways in tone are also connected to assure acquirers as well as the payment

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.650
network or the payment service providers such as Visa Diners or MasterCard.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.950
Once the transaction has passed all the steps,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.750
a confirmation is provided so that you could purchase the course.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.300
In this case,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.550
it was only your bank,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.730
which stores all the transactions there.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.550
Summaries balances at sutra for your card.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.950
This form off a system or leisure is called as centralized leisure.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.120
Let me also tell you that you re me typically gets this payment after maybe one toe five

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.760
days,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.080
depending on the type off payment instrument that you have used all the other parties in

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.200
this entire payment network act as the frustrate toward parties that facilitated the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.120
execution off for transaction Veras.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.350
In case off a distributed leisure,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.110
all parties store all the transactions.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:33.190
So there is no one central repository every nor has a copy off the transactions and nor can

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.850
be visualized here as the participant.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.550
Very loosely speaking,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:46.830
these copies are built based upon the shared and synchronized data that has been built on

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.850
consensus.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.940
It's,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.740
however,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.430
requires a peer to peer network as well as a consensus algorithm to ensure the replication

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.130
off data on the single version off.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.920
Truth exists across multiple sides.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.350
We have a dedicated lecture to understand how the consensus works.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.980
In the next lecture,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.850
we will see how ah Blockchain is different from a database.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.760
Thank you so much for joining me in this one.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.650
And I hope you have understood now what the distributed leisure means.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.250
Enjoy your time
