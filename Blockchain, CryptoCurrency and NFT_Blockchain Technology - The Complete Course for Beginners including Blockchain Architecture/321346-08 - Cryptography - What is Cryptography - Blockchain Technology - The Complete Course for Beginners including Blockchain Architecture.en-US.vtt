00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
Hello one.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.260
Welcome to the new section off Cryptographic Cryptography is Theis Sense of Blockchain Andi

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.550
Cryptocurrencies.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.650
Let's try to understand cryptography with an example.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.960
Let's say we have Bill working on some business deal on.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.250
Julia needs to communicate a bill about what should be the correct price for a particle

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.650
tracks.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.050
However,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.150
she's afraid that there are other people,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.860
maybe competent teachers who are interested in this information on.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.650
She does not want to send it as it ease.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.020
So if she sends the information as they are,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.650
text it might leak it to the competitors on may even have a risk off losing the deal.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.090
So what she does in speed is she scrambles the information on instant off.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.350
Let's say 2300 is the correct price,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.530
she adds the next later in the cities on,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
then sends it this way.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.050
She has ensured that some amount off security off the message is guaranteed.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.780
Now any adversary will have to do an extra step off,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.050
decoding the message before they can read it.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.910
Well,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.230
if you apply a sophisticated technique,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.020
the effort off the according this message increases substantially.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.100
Now the question is,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.080
how should well,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.060
understand it.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.750
Well,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.810
Julian,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.440
both have already decided that whenever they send a particular information,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.900
this is the decoding logic on hens.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.750
Bill will have no trouble in decoding on understanding the message.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.820
This practice on study off techniques for secure communication in the presence off third

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.720
parties is nothing but cryptography.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.550
Now let's also go through some of the terms that we used here.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.350
The input message is called as the cord,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.330
which,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.720
after applying the safer techniques becomes encrypted on,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.250
is called as cipher text.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.820
And when the reverse off the predetermined logic is applied,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.550
it becomes a decrypted message.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.950
I hope that explains in a brief,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.860
What is cryptography on What is encryption Throughout this section,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.250
we've alone about various terms related to cryptography on encryption.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.350
We will also go through the symmetric and asymmetric encryption before we end this section

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.350
.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.950
