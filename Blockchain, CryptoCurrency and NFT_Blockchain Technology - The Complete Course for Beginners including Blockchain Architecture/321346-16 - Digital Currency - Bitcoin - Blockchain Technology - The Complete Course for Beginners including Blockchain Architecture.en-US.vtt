00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
hello and welcome.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.400
In this lecture,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.150
we are going to learn a brief overview off what is Bitcoin or digital currency.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.370
But before we do that,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.450
it's very important to understand some basic principles off money.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.810
So what is money?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170
Is this really the money?

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.010
Well,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.700
it's just another form off money,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.470
which is cash are.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.570
As Jeremy Irons said in the movie margin call money is nothing but pieces off paper with

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.520
pictures on it,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.850
so that we don't have to kill each other just to get something to eat.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.050
Is that so?

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.940
Well,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.770
that might sound cool for a Hollywood movie,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.650
but not the reality.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.800
For something to be categorized as money,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.840
it has to satisfy some properties off money on what are those?

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.650
Well,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.350
the 1st 1 is it's a medium off exchange.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.750
You buy things using money,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.800
whether it is in the form off cash or card or a wallet.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.250
That does not matter.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.520
The second property off money is it's ah,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.450
unit off a count or measure off value,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.450
which basically means it needs to be divisible.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.980
You should be able to buy items off different values using the bill.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.650
You may have and get the change for the remaining amount.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.750
It should also be transport table.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.650
You can simply put it in your pocket on carried with you.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.830
We should also be able to transfer it to someone else,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.490
either by handing them over.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.780
The cash are into their accounts and the last but not the least.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.680
It should be hard to counterfeit another property off money.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.900
It acts as this store off value similar to gold or any such store off value in many

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.610
countries,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.410
the amount of cash a country Kenshin rate is directly linked to the amount of gold the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.220
central bank off that country has now.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.700
With that in mind,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.650
the Cryptocurrency needs to satisfy these conditions before we can call it money.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.350
So what is Cryptocurrency?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.000
Well,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.420
it's the digital money that can be used for an Internet based Miriam off exchange on stored

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.700
in a digital form,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.380
instead off a paper based cash for But as is the case with so many currencies which have

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.510
amount of gold as the base,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.490
cryptocurrencies use cryptography to regulate the generation off currency as well as

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.850
transfer of funds.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.610
It derives its properties from mathematical properties on not physical or chemical

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.750
properties such as Gold.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.610
Bitcoin is one such digital currency,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.050
or Cryptocurrency.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.650
Bitcoin is essentially a global decentralized payment network,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.050
which uses Bitcoin with a small be as D currency.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.680
It has a completely distributed on publicly owned infrastructure we have seen in the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.150
previous sections what a distributed ledger or system looks like.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.420
It's also a permission list system on as we have seen during the Blockchain lecture,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.950
it simply means that anyone can join the network.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.200
We also know that the transactions are verified by network nodes using proof off work

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.980
mechanism,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.650
which involves cryptographic puzzles.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.640
In the next lecture,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.810
we look into how the Bitcoin works.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.450
Thank you so much for joining me in this one.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.050
Enjoy your time.
