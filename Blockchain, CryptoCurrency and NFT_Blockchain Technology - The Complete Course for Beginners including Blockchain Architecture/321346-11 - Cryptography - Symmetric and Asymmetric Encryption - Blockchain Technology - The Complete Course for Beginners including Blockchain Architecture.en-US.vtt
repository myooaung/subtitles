00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
Hi.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.050
In this last lecture off the section on cryptography,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.850
let's try to understand the symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.050
So what is encryption in the first place?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.550
Well,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.220
as we have seen,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.860
encryption is the process off encoding a message.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.910
Our information in such a V that only authorized parties can access it on those who were

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.650
not authorized cannot.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.540
There are broadly two types off encryptions that we're going to cover in this particular

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.050
lecture,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.250
symmetric on a symmetric encryption.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.550
Let's take a look at the symmetric encryption forced.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.950
It can be understood by using the analogy off the safe.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.250
Let's say Alice wants to store some information or documents or cash in a safe.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.820
Andi only warns John Toe,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.870
have access to those documents and cash This way.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.840
She has secure the cash on documents from the unauthorized people who otherwise may have

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350
gained access to it very easily.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.430
Now John,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.640
who has got the access to the key or the number combinations off the safe,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.750
can get hold of the documents and cash whenever he wants to.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.510
While this mechanism does secure the information,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.350
it creates another problem,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.150
which is how does Alice pass on the key to John.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.350
Either she hands it over to John or may tell the number combination on the phone.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.200
But that means she might expose the risk off key getting into the wrong hands.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.230
So the transfer off key also needs a secure channel in case off symmetric encryption and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.390
some of the examples off symmetric encryption R A,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.810
S,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.490
D,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.670
E,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.250
S and R C four.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.250
All right,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.950
moving on to the symmetric information.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.350
All symmetric information requires two sets off keys public on the private key.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.450
Let's take a look at an email as an example.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.420
When you send an email on an email,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.200
I d.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.250
There is no restriction.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.050
You can send the email as long as you have the email idea off the other person.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.650
Many people can send the email to that particular email i D.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:48.630
But only the legitimate owner who has got the password for that email Ivy can open and read

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.950
those emails so you can easily say that public keys are essentially on identity.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.040
Let's say the two individuals,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.550
Jon and Boo,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.650
I want to exchange some confidential information over the Internet,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:15.250
but they are worried about the security and wants to use encrypted information for exchange

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.250
.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.940
In this case,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.910
John will have his set off.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.930
Private and public keys on Bill will also have his set off private and public ease the boat

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.930
,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.660
then exchange there,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.990
set off public ease with each other so that now both John as well as both can encrypt the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.720
data using each other's public keys.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.150
However,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.300
John,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.950
who could use bills public E cannot decrypt the same message.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.980
It can only be done using bills.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.850
Private key.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.310
All right.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.650
Similarly,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.310
when Bill encrypts the data using John's public Key,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.850
it can only be opened using John's private keys.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.670
So,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.540
in a sense,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.720
it's requires a combination off private on public keys to encrypt or decrypt the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.410
information.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.150
These are some of the examples that you may often see.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:27.320
We almost always see the https for many off the Vape photos where you need to transact

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.250
securely Bitcoin on a sausage are the other two examples off a symmetric encryption.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.450
It's all I have for this lecture on the symmetric on symmetric encryption.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.750
I hope it's clear now off what is symmetric on what is a symmetric encryption.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.230
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.450
Enjoy your time
