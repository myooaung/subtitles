00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
hi.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.660
In this series off lectures,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.900
we are going to cover some very important technologies that power the distributed ledger or

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.850
block chains.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.250
We saw how detail Yin works with a high level architecture.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.800
In this lecture,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.650
we are going to cover another technology start called Hyper Leisure.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.320
I'm calling it US Technology Stack as it has multiple technologies and models that makes

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.350
this umbrella project unique,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.740
with the existing block chains and in particular the permission less block chains.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.350
There are numerous issues.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.950
They are predominantly designed for cryptocurrencies,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.950
and there is almost always a crypto token or currency that is required to make it work.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.120
Another issue is the slower transaction confirmations On very limited,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.040
true put Visa process is 1700 transactions per second,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.910
whereas papal does 115 per second.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.510
Now.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.140
Compare that with Ethereum at 20 transactions per second on Bitcoin at seven.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.450
Transaction specific in.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.930
They have a lot to catch of with the fact that anyone can join the permission list.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.750
Blockchain,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.600
the processor are the participants are literally unknown on.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.770
There is a possibility off.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.020
Malaysia's actors trying to sniff are still the data that basically means there is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.650
absolutely no privacy off your data.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.640
If,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.650
for example,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.420
would you want to make public all your credit card transactions are,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.320
for that matter,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.240
any such financial information as payroll leader?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.720
Let's say this gets magnified by the fact that there is literally poor or no governance

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.350
over these systems.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.480
It can get very tricky if things such as identities are stored on public Blockchain.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.920
All these problems make it difficult for a private enterprise to make use off public or

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.400
permission.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.610
Elise Bloch Shin's hyper leisure promises to solve some of these problems with a different

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.850
set off technologies.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.820
Hyper Ledger is an umbrella project started Violin Knox Foundation in 2015.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.450
On is a collection off various open source Blockchain and related technologies.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.170
It's a global collaboration among the leaders in various industries,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.150
such as finance I T Manufacturing and so on.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.290
It has got 18 premium members on 100 and 43 general members at the time off recording off

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.950
this video.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.550
These are all leading organizations in their own domain.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.810
So what,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.980
exactly it is?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.550
Well,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.450
it offers a plug able on modular solutions.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.620
That means there are different requirements for every industry on one size or one type of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.450
solution cannot solve the problems off.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.520
Every industry ends,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.650
different frameworks and modules are created.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.150
I will tell you what these are,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.690
but before that,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.080
let's try to understand the fundamental reference architectures off the the hyper major.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.240
It basically composed off to measure building blocks the top most here,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.870
being the AP eyes on as decays,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.310
which the developers on enterprises can use to connect our develop application using hyper

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.450
leisure technologies,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.940
while the hyper leisure frameworks provide some basic services required for these

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.730
applications to run in a distributed leisure manners as the hyper leisure is a permission

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.650
architecture,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.000
the participants need to get membership to access the hyper leisure on hands.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.670
You also have membership services such as registration,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.850
managing identity as well as the audit ability off the members.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.970
Apart from that,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.830
the rules and responsibilities off every note is controlled on hands.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.350
There is a greater need for membership services.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.020
Secondly,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.730
the Blockchain services,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.750
which basically comprises off services related to Blockchain on transactions within it,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.320
as we have seen some of the key principles that need to be managed for a Blockchain,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.190
are that it runs on a P two p network on.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.020
Hence,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.180
we need a service that go ones.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.340
Dp to be protocol aunt.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.110
How dp to be communication will happen Consensus among the peers is one of the court

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.450
requirements for the Blockchain,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.270
the consensus manager.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.750
Service within hyper leisure deals with the consensus protocol on how it will be achieved.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.780
Needless to say that we are talking about the distributed ledger technology,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:28.090
which will require the services that can enable the leisure storage in a distributed manner

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.090
.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.420
Gen cords are nothing but the smart contracts,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.750
so essentially they are computer programs written in go programming language.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.120
They are executed in a secured container on is isolated from the other processes.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.340
Thus they help in managing the state off the ledger every nor can and tracked with the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.000
leisure only through the chain cords,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.050
hands every nor our peer need to have Jenn cord and start great.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:10.090
That's a bit exhaustive on It's beyond the scope of this lecture to cover the architectural

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.950
in depth.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.940
But I hope this helps you and understanding how the architectural building blocks off hyper

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.250
leisure fit together.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.850
All right,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.340
let's now go back to some of the projects that are running.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.650
Under this collaboration,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.050
it essentially has four frameworks.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.350
Fabric,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.060
which is aimed at mostly integration projects on,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.350
is contributed by IBM and digital assets.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.050
Iroda,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.010
on the other hand,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.390
focuses mostly on mobile applications.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:51.050
This has been contributed by a startup serum Itsu under the Gardens off Hitachi and NTT

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.650
Data.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.100
Another framework is the sort Oot,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.150
which is contributed by Intel on it,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.350
uses off proof off elapsed time as the consensus mechanism.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:08.650
It has been used to burl some assets settlement on supplies and applications.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.920
Baro is the Blockchain client that has been contributed by a company called More Lax on

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.550
Inter.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.450
On it has got four modules are tool kits.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.050
Composer,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.760
which is a tool contributed by IBM,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:31.970
is a rapid prototyping to you can easily manage the data on Blockchain various participants

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.530
on smart contracts.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.950
Using the same Explorer is the analytical tool for hyper leisure.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:45.750
While Celo is attempting to bring the as a service model toe Blockchain,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.350
it could be a D app as a service software as a service and so on.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.940
Lastly,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.780
indie,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.210
which is still under incubation,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.450
is specifically being built for the centralized identity management.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:07.750
Many bangs and fortune 500 companies are working towards creating new applications using

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.450
hyper leisure.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.230
All right,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.150
so now we know in brief what's under the hood off hyper leisure.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.550
That's all I have for this lecture.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.820
We will go through another Blockchain technology in the next lecture.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.650
That one is Golda Artery.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.920
Until then,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.250
enjoy your time.
