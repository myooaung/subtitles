00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
Hi.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.440
In this lecture,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.740
let's look at one of the core concept off peer to peer network on which the public

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.340
Blockchain,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.850
Zoff,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.150
Bitcoin and Ethereum are based.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.910
Traditionally,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.050
most of the applications have a single version or copy off the data on application as well

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.050
.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.450
This application on data is typically accessed or some form off media such as Internet,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.950
But these applications typically cause single points off failure.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.290
What if the link is broken?

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.050
What if the central application are the database is hacked our crashed.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.250
In order to protect these systems from such failures,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.180
the idea off a decentralized system was introduced in traditional sense.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.550
What it means is you have multiple copies off database on application on it is spread

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.650
across the globe,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650
which can be accessed from anywhere.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.350
It also means that even if one off the server goes down,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.550
you typically have other servers are nodes working?

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.140
But even in this case,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.150
the application and sharing is managed by a central authority.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.290
A true peer to peer network does not have essential authority on still maintains the exact

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.270
same data on application across the network off pier notes Dorine download is one such peer

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.460
to be a network which the governments are finding so hard to bring down due to the same

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.050
reason explained above.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.000
In Blockchain,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.020
you have different piers,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.700
also known as nodes,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.470
which store the ledger information in a distributed form every nor has an exact copy off

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.150
the distributed leisure within the network.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.860
This not only prevents the Blockchain from any attack,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:15.250
but also helps increase the data in mutability by bringing in the consensus among the nodes

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.250
.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.590
Let's talk more about the consensus in the next lecture.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.450
Thank you so much for joining me in this one.
