00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.330
hi.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.720
We learned about the high level architecture off the three leading block shin or

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.770
distributed leisure technologies off it.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.430
Terry um,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.450
hyper leisure on Korda.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.950
We also know that there is huge potential off blocked in technology,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.150
and there are many Fortune 500 companies that are building proof of concept our projects.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.350
However,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.310
at the time off evaluating the Blockchain technology in your organization,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.700
it's better to keep our emotions crown did on.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.450
Consider the challenges that blocked in technologies currently fees.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.850
It will help you make an informed decision.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.630
They are mostly related to standards security,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.640
privacy,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.710
regulation,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.920
scalability on skills shortages.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.550
Let's go through them one by one.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.780
Currently,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.790
there is a lack off one global standard that can be used for blocks and application

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.450
development.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.150
Blockchain has become popular at a rapid pace.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.240
However,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.990
the standards for development has not kept pace with.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.050
This may result in a non interoperable systems being implemented,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.650
which could be a bigger problem and future.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.020
Also,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.510
a lack off clarity on how a smart contract will work in real life poses a beer danger.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.130
There needs to be a common protocol that will define how the terms off the contract will be

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.220
developed and executed across the board.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.250
There are plans by the British standards institution on the eyes so but there is still some

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.150
time before those standards can be adopted.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:01.910
I S O T C 307 plans to deal with the standardisation off Blockchain on distributed Ledger

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.820
technologies.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.640
However,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.550
it's under development at the time off recording this video.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.450
The second issue is that off security,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.970
the security off data is one of the biggest challenges that Block Shin will have to deal

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.240
with.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.460
Here.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.040
The security is more in terms off the leakage of information from the Blockchain to the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.250
other applications.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.110
Secondly,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.900
the sentry search in quantum computers may mean that the cryptographic security may not be

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.450
adequate.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.530
Quantum computers are able to do tasks.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.650
Those are even beyond the reach off traditional supercomputers.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.120
Lastly,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.720
the integrity off the data stored at the Nord level good in itself posed various security

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.810
concerns.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.450
The next big challenge that blocked unit to deal with these related to privacy.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.350
Though you can have an anonymous identity in block shin behind a public E,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:16.670
it's only until you decide to transact with another person that it will be revealed after

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.170
that.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.640
The nature of public Blockchain makes it completely transparent to everyone you dealt with

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.640
.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.750
That also means there is no privacy off transactions.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.450
All the monetary or non monetary transactions will be visible to others.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.910
Similarly,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.940
let's say we built a Blockchain in the health care dome in a public Blockchain off.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.470
That sort may expose critical health related data toe every participant on could be a huge

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.450
privacy issue.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.450
They can be many such sensitive information that we may not want to share with the rest of

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.950
the world.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.720
The 4th 1 on this is the one that can make our break.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.650
The Blockchain applications is the regulatory support.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.150
One key area is the technology governance Beyond standards.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.560
This one deals with various operational protocols,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.660
such as setting up off rules for leisure governance.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.750
What will happen if the keys are lost or stolen?

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.650
Who takes the responsibility on is held accountable for such machines?

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.650
The second point is about what will happen to various audit on regulatory filings.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.040
That is no clarity on the same,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.750
particularly when it comes to corporate on financial.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.240
Later,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.330
that will go on the block.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:57.350
Another key regulatory issue is the support from various regulators across the world.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.250
What will happen if the smart contract terms are not honored or there are disputes arising

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.550
out off smart contract execution?

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.910
Currently,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.950
we can go to various regulators and chords in case off a bridge.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.050
That's not the case with Blockchain based smart contracts.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.070
It also means that we need to find out a way such that traditional contracts and smart

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.350
contracts co exist and sort of dependencies across these contracts.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.300
We will be foolish to assume that over a short period,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.350
all contracts will be smart contracts.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.650
There are multiple issues that need to be resolved to make Blockchain a scalable solution.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.120
It's very expensive to deploy a Blockchain solution,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.700
so on enterprise grade global application might not be cost effective in terms off our why

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.850
it can generate.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.040
Also,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.950
as we have seen during the lecture on hyper leisure,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:09.140
the current throughput off the Blockchain application is very low and has very slow

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.050
transaction processing speed.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.350
That can really be a big problem for large scale mission critical applications,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.290
as every note need to store the entire Blockchain and because the Blockchain is right,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:33.880
only it could lead to an endless storage on transfer off information that may require huge

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.150
bandwidth on competition powers.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:44.520
It may also lead to a reverse from decentralized to centralized applications because the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.930
under point only the large players will be able to afford the kind off storage on

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.850
computational power that will be required.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.480
Last but definitely not the least.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.950
Is the skills shortage off Blockchain technology.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.850
Though we would be able to get around with most of the challenges mentioned earlier,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.250
Getting a skilled and experienced resource is a bigger problem.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.740
That means it will be risky to adopt the technology a bit early.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.350
For smaller players,

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.450
how they work,

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.860
these kind of challenges are always faced by a revolutionary technologies such as

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.450
Blockchain.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.310
Remember the early days off Internet it did evolve on?

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.380
We do have various regulations,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.250
technology standards on government support for it.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.280
Let's hope that Blockchain community,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.250
which you're also part by now will be able to resolve majority off these challenges.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.640
That brings us to the end of this lecture on Blockchain challenges.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.010
Thank you so much for joining me on.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.350
Have a great time ahead
