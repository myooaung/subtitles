00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
hello.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.630
So far we have seen the reference architecture off it atrium on hyper ledger while it,

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.300
Terry um,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.150
is a permission less Blockchain based software development platform.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.620
Hyper ledger is similar,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.730
but permission The third that we are going to see is not a Blockchain technology,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.550
but an abstract worsen off Blockchain.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.220
What I mean by that is it derives all the useful features on principles that the Blockchain

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.350
is made up off.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.880
Aunt has built a new technology platform called Border.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.350
This is a slightly longer lecture on.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.830
I want you to pay a special attention as many off the concepts Onda we called our works are

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.330
slightly different than our traditional Blockchain Colder has been developed by a

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:05.550
consortium led by our tree on 80 off world's largest financial organizations.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.450
This is what the Lipsyte off our three say's about Korda.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.750
All right,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.190
we have seen some of the issues associated with permission less or public Blockchain.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.050
While permission Blockchain might resolve some off these issues,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.350
colder goes one step further.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.830
Aunt has built a system that takes the best of Blockchain on molded it into the business

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.750
off finance some of the key features that Golda has are,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.850
of course,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.310
it's a distributed leisure.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.540
No need to tell us that.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.480
But apart from that,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.150
there is no global sharing off the data among participants.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.520
So only those who need to know will know that is.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.050
Only the parties involved in the transaction will know the transaction information.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.600
The key philosophy is,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.080
if you and me agree,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.350
why do we need an unknown party to know the details in Colder?

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.150
The consensus is at the individual level on not at the system level.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.280
And like every other Blockchain,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.150
the key concept is that the financial agreements among the forms need to be respected.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.360
So at the time off,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.200
writing a contract or a smart contract,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.230
it allows us to define which parties will participate in consensus.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.300
These two the consensus on the data sharing,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.080
are the primary points on Ridge.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.750
Older is radically different than the Orthodox Block Jane Systems.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.350
One more concerned in case off Blockchain has always bean about regulation and supervision

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.350
.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:10.800
Golda has boat default Nords for regulatory on supervisory roles on like hyper leisure.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.720
It also does not have a native currency for token.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.150
Great.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:25.070
I hope that gives you an overview off what border ease and how it is different with that

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.680
coward.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.250
Let's go through the reference architecture off Cora.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.250
This is where it gets slightly technical,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.800
all right.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.930
It's very comprehensive on Allow me to walk you through the different building blocks off

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.940
this architectures.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.300
This middle green box that you see is nothing but the North off the board,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.950
our system.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.210
It's basically a JV M or Java virtual machine running various components off the corner

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.750
software.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.320
Let's see,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.370
what are these things surrounding this particular Nor or we can call them or elements

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.370
within the architecture Well,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.150
it interacts with other nodes through the network layer off Korda.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:21.150
The database off SQL DB here is for storage services as well as for words.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
We will see that in just a few seconds.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.140
The owner off the node,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.490
which could be let's say,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.950
an intermediary can interact with the North and it services through the RPC,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.510
or remote procedure,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.450
calls Friend book.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.810
The North owner can fire various qualities,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.710
such as finding out the existing state or transactions about the network as well as the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.550
North specific information.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.930
The North owner as well as the order APS,

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.550
a short form for bold are decentralized application.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.700
Communicate with various North services through this service,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.040
huh?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.950
The court APS would be any functionality,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.270
such as a payments,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.950
always digital wallet or any other commerce service.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.660
Now let's go inside the North.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.750
Let's go through some of the services that discord on North offers.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.750
The first among them is the world.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.590
The vault is a database,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.080
very.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.650
It drags all the current on historic states.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.650
States are nothing but the information about the facts.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.710
It has a reference to the contract the participants on the properties,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.310
such as who pays to from then on?

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.190
How much so there might not be any state.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.770
In the beginning,

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.790
however,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.050
Let's say details borrows $10 from John.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:02.350
That creates a new state that say's judicial those $10 to John by a particular date.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.920
It may even have various clauses off penalty our interests on,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.710
Let's say,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.700
after a week.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.150
Gee,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.420
Tish pays half off the amount,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:21.150
which is $5 to John Now that changes the state to the new one that records this transaction

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.150
on makes the earlier state historic one.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.650
Walt actually stores all of these historic on current states inside the north.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.000
Remember,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.720
the states are information about facts on current state is something that's not changed on

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.720
.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.030
It also has the reference to contracts and its details devolved.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.090
Stores only.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.900
The states,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.930
which are 11 to its own note storage.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.160
On the other hand,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.510
stores actual transactions,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.620
such as key value,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.650
pair on any attachment documents,

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.410
etcetera,

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.750
which are related to the states in the fall.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:15.920
The flow here automate the processes that needs to be executed among various nodes and

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.850
participants,

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.260
as we have discussed earlier.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.150
Older does not broadcast every information to the entire network.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:30.150
It in speed shares the information from point to point our party to party,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.120
the flow framework and shores this communication between various parties.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:43.070
The flow can be visualized as the process functional flow chart or a business process

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.050
diagram such as this,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.650
you may want to pause the video on have a closer look at it.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:57.210
Identities on key management represent the legal or service identities.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.260
Legal identity is used by the party in a transaction,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:08.650
whereas service identity is used by those providing services within the North,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.750
such as a notary.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:18.500
Each identity is assigned a certificate on a key which is then very fighter by the North

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.070
Network map is something like a directory,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.160
which provides information about all the nodes within a network,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.650
which you can quickly.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:36.520
No trees actually signed the transaction on preventing double spent.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.770
So essentially no tree services are similar to mining nodes,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.010
which have their own consensus mechanism,

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:52.750
so a notarized transaction is considered as legitimate and final on.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.010
Then,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.780
finally,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.230
we have the messaging service,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:01.150
which is used to communicate with the other nodes within the network.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.460
On Before we finish this lecture,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.850
let's see what exactly happens when we are interacting with the Korda.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:16.500
I'm only going to explain some of the core functions without going march into the details

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.650
off every component or service.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:26.850
Let's say this Korda up deals with payments on the request is initiated as an http request

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:26.850
,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:35.740
we can imagine from the previous example that jellyfish is going to pay $5 from the 10 that

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.250
he borrowed from John.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:42.650
This payment request then triggers the flu related toe this quarter up.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.950
As the flow starts,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.220
you may require to fetch some additional details,

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.660
such as previous state.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.950
The earlier transaction details off how much money was old and so on,

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.830
such as interest,

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.150
penalty and all of that.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.700
We will then build on very fine the transaction.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.770
This is what the requester would do now.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.040
Once the transaction has been built,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:15.440
you would require the other party or the counter party which in this case is John to verify

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.050
on signed the transaction.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.850
Now that the requester has initiated,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.150
Andi Responder has responded positively.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:29.050
The transaction is said to be complete but not yet finalized.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.410
To finalize the transaction,

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:37.560
we need to send it to the notary on get it notarized after successful completion Off this

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:37.850
tape,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:45.550
the transaction gets recorded as well as stored in the SQL Devi Wald will now have a

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:53.110
different state that is sent as the response through the FBI colder that's uses various

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:59.600
principles off Blockchain and has combined them with the business of banking and finance to

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.020
bring us a unique technology.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.850
This could become a transformative technology platform in the near future.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.390
With that,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.880
we end this lecture.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.950
Thank you so much for listening to this long lecture on court our technologies.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.550
In this lecture we got an overview of colder.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:26.490
We also looked at the architectures on various components as well as services that forms

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.550
the Korda Nord.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:33.950
We finally saw how the transaction is completed using flow on notary.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.460
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.850
And I hope you learned a little bit about corner.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.150
Thanks a lot and enjoy your time.
