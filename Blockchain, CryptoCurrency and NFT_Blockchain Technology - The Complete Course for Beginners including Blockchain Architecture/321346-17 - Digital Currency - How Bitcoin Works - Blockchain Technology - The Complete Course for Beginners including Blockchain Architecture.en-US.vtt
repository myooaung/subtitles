00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
Hi.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.350
In this lecture we will see how the Bitcoin works.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.750
In a very simple and easy to understand terminology.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.550
The first step is to create a Bitcoin wallet.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.750
There are various types off wallets that you can create.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.540
You can create a test of wallet,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.750
which is among the first wallets created.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.350
The security off.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.080
Such wallets could be an issue as it is dependent on the security on your there stop or

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.650
laptop mobile wallet.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.740
Well,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.200
as the name suggests,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.520
is stored on the smartphone on the most popular one.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.720
You can also open a wallet on.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.680
Store it on 1/3 party,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.930
sir.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.150
War.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.950
This is nothing but the A bullet.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.750
It could be a problem if you store a large amount of Bitcoins on the third party servers

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.240
because off security reasons the hardware wallets are physical Special Purpose Harbor

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.850
devices which operate a Bitcoin wallet.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.350
They can only be accessed using USB are our browsers.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.430
They are considered to be very secured compared to other types.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.050
Off all its the paper wallet is nothing but the keys printed on a piece off paper.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.250
These keys control the Bitcoin transactions.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.650
It can be a very secured means off keeping it offline.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.850
However,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.310
there is a risk off losing the paper on Gus.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.080
Losing all the Bitcoins with it you may have ah,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.500
hot are cold wallet now.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.350
Hot wallet is the one connected to the Internet.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.610
Vile.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850
The cold ones are offline.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.750
You may want to keep a small amount in the hot wallet,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.650
while the majority of the funds in the cold wallet on away from the Internet.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.900
There are many website which allows you to create different types off wallets.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.650
You can go to Bitcoin dot org or coin based G Dax etcetera.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.570
On.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.220
We do not recommend any particular website.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.340
Andi,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.750
I request you to do your due diligence before you open an account.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.030
Now,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.510
once you have devolved,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.350
created,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.850
can use them for either buying a Bitcoin on storing them in the wallet.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:45.810
Or you can receive or transfer Bitcoins similar to an account transfer are you can pay for

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.420
the goods or services using the Bitcoins.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.450
These transactions take place using certain keys and addresses.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.850
It typically involves a pair off public and private keys.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.260
Public key is something like a bank account,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.490
whereas the private key can be considered as Lee been for the account,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:16.320
which only the account holder has access to Bitcoin addresses can be multiple for an

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.850
account.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.810
It's similar to a check book that is issued to an account holder.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.550
Aunt has a check number for every leaf off the book.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.010
The addresses are usually created from the public key.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.450
The Bitcoin address is the recipient address where the Bitcoins need to be transferred.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.370
All such transactions are secured using a cryptographic hash on,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.350
they become part of the bloc in the Blockchain,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.250
as we have seen in the previous lectures.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.650
These blocks then get mind by the minor nodes.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.900
The transactions are verified.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.560
Any fees for the transaction is also rejected on the transaction is said to be complete

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.550
when the recipient receives the Bitcoins.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.410
In the process,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.720
the miner gets to create an additional transaction for mined Bitcoins.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.580
I hope that explains in Archer how the Bitcoin works.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.250
Thank you so much for attending this lecture.
