00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
hi.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.360
In the previous lecture,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.150
we learned about what's inside a block.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.240
We now know three primary items that is data hash of the block on the previous hash.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.890
In this lecture,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.410
we are going to cover What is,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.490
Ah,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.550
Blockchain on?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.950
What are its properties?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:28.730
As you must have seen on the social media or any such platform where money is not involved

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.730
,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.800
the transactions flow directly from one person to another.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.650
It does not have any geographical boundaries.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.500
So your Facebook post is almost instantly visible to your French Perez.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.060
When we need to send money or for transactions which have monetary values,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.750
it's not so simple.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.290
We almost always have 1/3 party,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.660
such as bangs on multiple bangs on some international organizations,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.550
which acts as a frustrate party.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.650
This is also known as the centralized system.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.350
The problem with this approach is that if one off the parties does not function as desired

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.350
,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.950
it can lead to the collapse or huge disruption within the system.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.340
Blockchain Act aims to change this and brings the transparency that is required for such

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.250
transactions.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.740
So what is a black shen and how can you do this as we have seen in the previous lecture.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.650
It is a sequential chain off blocks.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.380
It's nothing but a continuously growing list,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.730
off records or a leisure,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:53.940
which are organized as blocks on they are linked to using cryptographic as we have seen in

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.250
the previous lecture.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.000
Each block typically has a cryptic pointer to the previous block,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.250
which has some transactions included in it and also has a time stop.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.430
Auction has typical characteristics,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.340
which makes it very secure,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.450
unusable in a distributed environment.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.380
In a sense,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.750
it's a former for distributed leisure.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.070
Unlike these centralized leisure system we saw when we are transferring the money from

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.550
abroad,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.950
the transaction copies are distributed across the network.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.850
The participants in the Blockchain can validate the information without any centralized

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.550
authority.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.630
So even if one nor are participant in the Blockchain feels the remaining nodes will ensure

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.980
that there is no disruption,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.450
what so ever we will look into the distributed ledger in the next lecture.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.380
The second property that it has to have is it's in the digital form and updated in in

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:12.180
Israel time that reduces huge paperwork for such contracts as we have seen block sh in our

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.550
cities or blocks which contain transaction records.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.650
The's connected blocks are updated in near real time.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:28.750
On this forms a chronological chain that provides a trail off all the transactions so no

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.950
transaction gets lost.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.640
Next.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.550
The rocks are cryptographic lee sealed,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.150
making it very difficult to tamper with the data,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.830
which means you have greater trust and robust neighs in the data that is stored well.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.110
Blockchain is also a right only form off a system that means you can only write the records

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.550
and not delete it.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.150
This means that the transaction,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.320
once created,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.960
cannot be reversed.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.030
Also,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.350
as it maintains the trail,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.450
it becomes very easy to do an order it on Blockchain based system.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.450
All right,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.700
In peace of a Blockchain,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.650
you don't need to trust one single party to execute transaction.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.280
The consensus,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.850
based on multiple unknown participants,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.950
helps build trust list Sister.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.350
It also means that we require fewer parties for transaction to execute.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.850
Now this further reduces the transaction costs to execute a trade or contract.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.450
Each of these points ARCA word in more detail in these subsequent lectures off the course.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.260
So in this lecture,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.250
we learned about what is a Blockchain on what are its various characteristics.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.970
In the next lecture,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.350
we will go through the distributed ledger and understand how it works.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.150
Thank you for joining and have a great time.
