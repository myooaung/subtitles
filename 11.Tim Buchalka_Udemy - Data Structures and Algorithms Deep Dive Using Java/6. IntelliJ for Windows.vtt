00:00:00.192  -->  00:00:02.367
(upbeat music)
2

2

00:00:02.367  -->  00:00:05.083
(keyboard keys clicking)
3

3

00:00:05.083  -->  00:00:06.880
<v Tim>In this video, we're gonna go ahead,</v>
4

4

00:00:06.880  -->  00:00:10.560
and download and instal IntelliJ IDEA,
5

5

00:00:10.560  -->  00:00:11.730
which is the editor or the IDE,
6

6

00:00:11.730  -->  00:00:14.820
that we're gonna be using in this course,
7

7

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:16.130
for our programmes.
8

8

00:00:16.130  -->  00:00:20.070
Now, this particular video is for Windows platform.
9

9

00:00:20.070  -->  00:00:22.890
Now if you're running a Mac, or you're running on Linux,
10

10

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:25.590
there are separate videos for both those operating systems,
11

11

00:00:25.590  -->  00:00:27.160
in this section of the course,
12

12

00:00:27.160  -->  00:00:29.340
so refer to those videos as appropriate,
13

13

00:00:29.340  -->  00:00:31.730
if you're on Windows you're in the right place.
14

14

00:00:31.730  -->  00:00:33.750
So the first thing to do is to go,
15

15

00:00:33.750  -->  00:00:36.391
to the website jetbrains.com.
16

16

00:00:36.391  -->  00:00:39.240
(computer keys clicking)
17

17

00:00:39.240  -->  00:00:41.730
That's the site or the creators,
18

18

00:00:41.730  -->  00:00:44.630
of this IntelliJ IDEA product that we're gomna be using.
19

19

00:00:44.630  -->  00:00:45.570
Once you get there,
20

20

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:47.940
you come down here and click on IntelliJ if it's showing,
21

21

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:49.466
if by chance, its not trying for some reason,
22

22

00:00:49.466  -->  00:00:54.050
go to IDE or IDEs and click on IntelliJ IDEA.
23

23

00:00:54.050  -->  00:00:56.550
Either way, click on that link to go to that page.
24

24

00:00:57.700  -->  00:00:59.500
Next option is to click on Download.
25

25

00:01:01.101  -->  00:01:02.580
You're then presented with two options,
26

26

00:01:02.580  -->  00:01:04.770
to download either the Ultimate Edition,
27

27

00:01:04.770  -->  00:01:06.550
or the Community Edition.
28

28

00:01:06.550  -->  00:01:07.390
Now I'm going to go ahead,
29

29

00:01:07.390  -->  00:01:09.287
and download the Community Edition,
30

30

00:01:09.287  -->  00:01:11.300
and we're gonna talk a little bit about it,
31

31

00:01:11.300  -->  00:01:13.543
once it's downloading, just to save a bit of time.
32

32

00:01:14.384  -->  00:01:16.660
I clicked on Download as you saw,
33

33

00:01:16.660  -->  00:01:18.120
that should pop up, you can see down the bottom.
34

34

00:01:18.120  -->  00:01:20.062
I'm going to click on Save to save that.
35

35

00:01:20.062  -->  00:01:22.980
I'm just gonna go back, just to show you the page,
36

36

00:01:22.980  -->  00:01:26.400
with the Ultimate Edition and the Community Edition,
37

37

00:01:26.400  -->  00:01:29.800
and just talk about both versions there.
38

38

00:01:29.800  -->  00:01:32.780
Now the Ultimate Edition is the commercial product.
39

39

00:01:32.780  -->  00:01:35.240
So if you want to use that past a trial period,
40

40

00:01:35.240  -->  00:01:36.530
you'll need to pay money for it,
41

41

00:01:36.530  -->  00:01:38.600
and you'll need to pay JetBrains for that.
42

42

00:01:38.600  -->  00:01:42.120
The Community Edition on the other hand is completely free,
43

43

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:43.930
and you'll never have to pay anything for it.
44

44

00:01:43.930  -->  00:01:46.130
It can make a good choice in many cases
45

45

00:01:46.130  -->  00:01:48.550
to take the free and open source version,
46

46

00:01:48.550  -->  00:01:50.520
but if you do want to have access,
47

47

00:01:50.520  -->  00:01:53.140
to other commercial features for example,
48

48

00:01:53.140  -->  00:01:54.530
Java Enterprise Edition,
49

49

00:01:54.530  -->  00:01:57.270
and using other frameworks that aren't compatible,
50

50

00:01:57.270  -->  00:01:59.560
or aren't available in the free version,
51

51

00:01:59.560  -->  00:02:02.821
the Community Edition, you can take this option here.
52

52

00:02:02.821  -->  00:02:06.393
With the Ultimate Edition there's a 30 day trial option.
53

53

00:02:06.393  -->  00:02:08.640
You can try it out for free for 30 days,
54

54

00:02:08.640  -->  00:02:09.530
and then after that,
55

55

00:02:09.530  -->  00:02:11.660
ordinarily you'd would have to pay for it.
56

56

00:02:11.660  -->  00:02:15.000
What I can do is extend that trial by another 90 days.
57

57

00:02:15.000  -->  00:02:17.378
So in other words, a total of 120 days.
58

58

00:02:17.378  -->  00:02:18.750
If you're interested in that,
59

59

00:02:18.750  -->  00:02:21.100
there's actually a lecture in this section,
60

60

00:02:21.100  -->  00:02:23.360
that shows you how to get a special key
61

61

00:02:23.360  -->  00:02:25.140
that you'll need to basically paste,
62

62

00:02:25.140  -->  00:02:28.130
into the Ultimate Edition to get the extra trial,
63

63

00:02:28.130  -->  00:02:30.020
the extra 90 days.
64

64

00:02:30.020  -->  00:02:31.540
So refer to that if you decide,
65

65

00:02:31.540  -->  00:02:33.330
to download the Ultimate Edition.
66

66

00:02:33.330  -->  00:02:35.390
Otherwise, as you saw me do in this video,
67

67

00:02:35.390  -->  00:02:37.340
I've downloaded to the Community Edition,
68

68

00:02:37.340  -->  00:02:40.250
and that will certainly work okay in this course.
69

69

00:02:40.250  -->  00:02:42.090
All right, so now that that's downloaded,
70

70

00:02:42.090  -->  00:02:43.040
I'm going to click on Run.
71

71

00:02:43.040  -->  00:02:46.090
So depending on your browser, you might need to navigate,
72

72

00:02:46.090  -->  00:02:47.990
to the folder where you've downloaded it.
73

73

00:02:47.990  -->  00:02:50.060
In any event, start up the installer.
74

74

00:02:50.060  -->  00:02:51.870
In this case I've clicked Run,
75

75

00:02:51.870  -->  00:02:54.430
and it's gonna to give us the option to start installing,
76

76

00:02:54.430  -->  00:02:57.260
and I'm gonna close the browser down now,
77

77

00:02:57.260  -->  00:02:59.110
and I'm gonna go through and follow the setup process.
78

78

00:02:59.110  -->  00:03:00.960
I'm gonna click on Next.
79

79

00:03:00.960  -->  00:03:02.190
I'm going to just assume,
80

80

00:03:02.190  -->  00:03:05.340
or select or use the default location,
81

81

00:03:05.340  -->  00:03:08.760
the destination folder, no need to change that.
82

82

00:03:08.760  -->  00:03:10.670
Now the other option you'll need to know,
83

83

00:03:10.670  -->  00:03:11.503
is whether you're running,
84

84

00:03:11.503  -->  00:03:15.370
a 32 bit or 64 bit version of Windows.
85

85

00:03:15.370  -->  00:03:16.203
Now in the previous video,
86

86

00:03:16.203  -->  00:03:19.440
I've shown you how to do that in the JDK,
87

87

00:03:19.440  -->  00:03:21.520
the Java Development Kit video,
88

88

00:03:21.520  -->  00:03:22.690
I showed you how to determine,
89

89

00:03:22.690  -->  00:03:25.290
whether you're running a 32 bit or 64 bit.
90

90

00:03:25.290  -->  00:03:27.660
So depending on now what you found
91

91

00:03:27.660  -->  00:03:28.750
when you're downloading that video,
92

92

00:03:28.750  -->  00:03:30.400
select the relevant option.
93

93

00:03:30.400  -->  00:03:32.570
In my case, I was running a 64 bit edition.
94

94

00:03:32.570  -->  00:03:35.089
So I'm gonna select that, obviously you'd select a 32 bit,
95

95

00:03:35.089  -->  00:03:36.300
if that's what you're running,
96

96

00:03:36.300  -->  00:03:39.443
or your Windows is running on the 32 bit version.
97

97

00:03:39.443  -->  00:03:42.510
And I suggest you click these three associations,
98

98

00:03:42.510  -->  00:03:45.310
these check boxes and that just enables,
99

99

00:03:45.310  -->  00:03:46.500
those particular languages,
100

100

00:03:46.500  -->  00:03:48.534
those files that've got that file extension,
101

101

00:03:48.534  -->  00:03:50.220
to be opened up in IntelliJ.
102

102

00:03:50.220  -->  00:03:52.050
That's usually what you wanna do.
103

103

00:03:52.050  -->  00:03:53.453
And then click on Next,
104

104

00:03:55.120  -->  00:03:56.500
click on Instal,
105

105

00:03:56.500  -->  00:03:59.790
and that's now going ahead and installing IntelliJ IDEA.
106

106

00:03:59.790  -->  00:04:01.410
I'm just gonna fast forward this video now,
107

107

00:04:01.410  -->  00:04:02.250
to save a bit of time,
108

108

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:04.650
and we come back after it's finished installing.
109

109

00:04:08.417  -->  00:04:10.133
All right, so you can see it's just about finished now.
110

110

00:04:10.133  -->  00:04:11.683
We'll just let that finish off.
111

111

00:04:14.508  -->  00:04:16.050
All right, so it's now actually finished.
112

112

00:04:16.050  -->  00:04:18.430
The next option is just to click on the checkbox,
113

113

00:04:18.430  -->  00:04:20.120
so we can run IntelliJ.
114

114

00:04:20.120  -->  00:04:21.500
That's irrespective of whether,
115

115

00:04:21.500  -->  00:04:23.330
you've downloaded the Ultimate, or in this case,
116

116

00:04:23.330  -->  00:04:24.433
the Community Edition,
117

117

00:04:25.340  -->  00:04:27.470
Click on that and click on Finish.
118

118

00:04:27.470  -->  00:04:29.930
It's gonna start up IntelliJ for us.
119

119

00:04:29.930  -->  00:04:32.220
Now usually you'll see this option,
120

120

00:04:32.220  -->  00:04:34.600
and it's coming up telling us that we've got an option,
121

121

00:04:34.600  -->  00:04:36.287
to try and import some settings.
122

122

00:04:36.287  -->  00:04:39.240
Now this would be useful if you're running IntelliJ,
123

123

00:04:39.240  -->  00:04:40.870
or you have installed a previous version,
124

124

00:04:40.870  -->  00:04:43.370
and you wanna retain the settings that you've configured.
125

125

00:04:43.370  -->  00:04:45.470
In this case I haven't actually installed IntelliJ,
126

126

00:04:45.470  -->  00:04:46.680
on this computer,
127

127

00:04:46.680  -->  00:04:48.910
and this is most likely the option you'll see.
128

128

00:04:48.910  -->  00:04:51.310
So you can click on Do not import settings.
129

129

00:04:51.310  -->  00:04:52.286
Otherwise there's a location,
130

130

00:04:52.286  -->  00:04:55.660
usually selected or found by IntelliJ,
131

131

00:04:55.660  -->  00:04:56.499
and you could select that,`
132

132

00:04:56.499  -->  00:04:59.480
and get IntelliJ to import those settings,
133

133

00:04:59.480  -->  00:05:01.910
and use them in your installation of IntelliJ.
134

134

00:05:01.910  -->  00:05:03.620
But in my case, I'm gonna just leave the default,
135

135

00:05:03.620  -->  00:05:05.523
Do not import settings and click OK.
136

136

00:05:07.984  -->  00:05:08.817
All right next,
137

137

00:05:08.817  -->  00:05:11.000
we need to go through a configuration section,
138

138

00:05:11.000  -->  00:05:12.457
to just set up some settings,
139

139

00:05:12.457  -->  00:05:15.440
and to tell IntelliJ what options we want.
140

140

00:05:15.440  -->  00:05:17.920
This is the theme and you can see the one on the left,
141

141

00:05:17.920  -->  00:05:19.300
has got a white background,
142

142

00:05:19.300  -->  00:05:21.090
the one on the right has got a darker background.
143

143

00:05:21.090  -->  00:05:22.480
We can choose either.
144

144

00:05:22.480  -->  00:05:25.238
So select which one you would prefer to work with,
145

145

00:05:25.238  -->  00:05:27.580
knowing that you can always change it later.
146

146

00:05:27.580  -->  00:05:29.770
I'm going to select the one with the white background
147

147

00:05:29.770  -->  00:05:30.823
and click on Next.
148

148

00:05:31.890  -->  00:05:34.950
Now there's a series of plugins on the screen,
149

149

00:05:34.950  -->  00:05:37.540
and you can choose all sorts of things.
150

150

00:05:37.540  -->  00:05:38.770
what I suggest you do generally,
151

151

00:05:38.770  -->  00:05:41.470
is leave this as it is now and come back later,
152

152

00:05:41.470  -->  00:05:44.170
if you decide you want to instal plugins.
153

153

00:05:44.170  -->  00:05:45.480
Just the other thing to note is,
154

154

00:05:45.480  -->  00:05:48.610
if you're running the Ultimate version of IntelliJ,
155

155

00:05:48.610  -->  00:05:51.440
you'll actually have more options to instal plugins.
156

156

00:05:51.440  -->  00:05:52.890
I'm just gonna click on Next.
157

157

00:05:53.920  -->  00:05:55.958
Same deal here if we want to change,
158

158

00:05:55.958  -->  00:05:57.990
or instal these two things,
159

159

00:05:57.990  -->  00:05:59.690
which we aren't going to use,
160

160

00:05:59.690  -->  00:06:00.690
in this particular course,
161

161

00:06:00.690  -->  00:06:01.610
you can do that now.
162

162

00:06:01.610  -->  00:06:02.677
But I'm going to skip both of those,
163

163

00:06:02.677  -->  00:06:05.423
and click on Start using IntelliJ IDEA.
164

164

00:06:07.220  -->  00:06:10.120
You can see that that's loaded up IntelliJ.
165

165

00:06:10.120  -->  00:06:11.730
Now the next step we need to do,
166

166

00:06:11.730  -->  00:06:14.283
is actually configure the Java Development Kit.
167

167

00:06:15.160  -->  00:06:15.993
We need to do that,
168

168

00:06:15.993  -->  00:06:18.002
so that we can actually programme in this course,
169

169

00:06:18.002  -->  00:06:20.573
so the way to do that is to click on Configure,
170

170

00:06:21.660  -->  00:06:23.930
and click on Project Defaults,
171

171

00:06:23.930  -->  00:06:25.763
and then select Project Structure.
172

172

00:06:27.470  -->  00:06:29.290
And that'll bring us to this screen,
173

173

00:06:29.290  -->  00:06:31.700
and if you don't see Project SDK showing there,
174

174

00:06:31.700  -->  00:06:34.010
you might have check boxes in another area.
175

175

00:06:34.010  -->  00:06:35.520
So just make sure you click the Project,
176

176

00:06:35.520  -->  00:06:38.350
and that will show that and click on the drop down,
177

177

00:06:38.350  -->  00:06:39.970
just to see whether there's been one configured,
178

178

00:06:39.970  -->  00:06:43.170
but in my case you can see it says No SDK.
179

179

00:06:43.170  -->  00:06:45.530
SDK meeting software development kit.
180

180

00:06:45.530  -->  00:06:47.560
So what we need to do is create one,
181

181

00:06:47.560  -->  00:06:51.330
so that we can actually programme within IntelliJ.
182

182

00:06:51.330  -->  00:06:52.163
So what we're gonna need to do,
183

183

00:06:52.163  -->  00:06:54.677
is basically associate the Java Development Kit,
184

184

00:06:54.677  -->  00:06:58.470
that we've installed previously, with IntelliJ.
185

185

00:06:58.470  -->  00:07:01.150
So to do that, I'm going to click on New.
186

186

00:07:01.150  -->  00:07:02.813
I'm gonna select JDK.
187

187

00:07:04.160  -->  00:07:05.620
Now what we need to do is navigate
188

188

00:07:05.620  -->  00:07:08.830
to the folder where we installed the Java Development Kit.
189

189

00:07:08.830  -->  00:07:09.850
And I did talk about that,
190

190

00:07:09.850  -->  00:07:13.220
in the Java Development Kit installation video.
191

191

00:07:13.220  -->  00:07:15.237
The need to know where that was installed.
192

192

00:07:15.237  -->  00:07:17.980
And if you recall that on my machine in that video,
193

193

00:07:17.980  -->  00:07:20.100
it was installed in the Programme Files folder.
194

194

00:07:20.100  -->  00:07:24.460
So navigate to that folder and go into the Java sub folder,
195

195

00:07:24.460  -->  00:07:26.610
and you'll see that there's two folder locations,
196

196

00:07:26.610  -->  00:07:29.667
the JDK and the JRE,
197

197

00:07:29.667  -->  00:07:31.250
and this number may change,
198

198

00:07:31.250  -->  00:07:33.240
depending on when you're watching this video.
199

199

00:07:33.240  -->  00:07:35.740
But the one you wanna to select is the JDK,
200

200

00:07:35.740  -->  00:07:38.117
then go ahead and click on JDK,
201

201

00:07:38.117  -->  00:07:39.250
and click on OK.
202

202

00:07:39.250  -->  00:07:40.870
Just before I click on OK,
203

203

00:07:40.870  -->  00:07:42.210
it's important to have a look
204

204

00:07:42.210  -->  00:07:44.710
and make sure that you selected Programme Files,
205

205

00:07:44.710  -->  00:07:47.030
and not Programme Files x86,
206

206

00:07:47.030  -->  00:07:48.260
cause there's two directories in there,
207

207

00:07:48.260  -->  00:07:49.680
that are very similar,
208

208

00:07:49.680  -->  00:07:52.120
and you can see there's this Programme Files x86.
209

209

00:07:52.120  -->  00:07:53.820
If I open that up and have a look,
210

210

00:07:54.760  -->  00:07:56.880
you see that there's no Java folder there.
211

211

00:07:56.880  -->  00:08:00.260
So common question will come up from students,
212

212

00:08:00.260  -->  00:08:02.170
not being able to find the Java folder,
213

213

00:08:02.170  -->  00:08:05.070
and that's because they're looking in the Programme Files x86.
214

214

00:08:05.070  -->  00:08:07.910
But in my case, close it back up again.
215

215

00:08:07.910  -->  00:08:09.510
We're in the right place here.
216

216

00:08:09.510  -->  00:08:11.210
We're in the Programme Files Java
217

217

00:08:11.210  -->  00:08:13.100
and I've clicked on the JDK.
218

218

00:08:13.100  -->  00:08:15.010
And make sure you don't click on the JRE,
219

219

00:08:15.010  -->  00:08:18.691
because we need the JDK because that's the development kit,
220

220

00:08:18.691  -->  00:08:20.610
which includes the extra tools,
221

221

00:08:20.610  -->  00:08:22.000
that we need to be able to programme.
222

222

00:08:22.000  -->  00:08:24.025
So I'm going to click on OK with that selected,
223

223

00:08:24.025  -->  00:08:28.050
and you can see now the Project SDK has been changed here.
224

224

00:08:28.050  -->  00:08:30.830
In the past it was No SDK but now we've got an option there.
225

225

00:08:30.830  -->  00:08:32.280
So if that got selected automatically
226

226

00:08:32.280  -->  00:08:33.980
make sure that is selected.
227

227

00:08:33.980  -->  00:08:35.180
And the next thing you want to do here
228

228

00:08:35.180  -->  00:08:37.137
is make sure that Project Language Level,
229

229

00:08:37.137  -->  00:08:41.560
we can actually see that it says SDK default 8.
230

230

00:08:41.560  -->  00:08:43.450
So it is possible to choose other versions,
231

231

00:08:43.450  -->  00:08:45.540
but you won't need to do that at this time.
232

232

00:08:45.540  -->  00:08:47.550
Leave that particular version selected,
233

233

00:08:47.550  -->  00:08:49.800
so we don't need to change anything else on this page.
234

234

00:08:49.800  -->  00:08:51.000
We're gonna click on OK.
235

235

00:08:52.140  -->  00:08:55.100
We've got a few other settings that we need to configure,
236

236

00:08:55.100  -->  00:08:57.250
and then we can actually move on to start,
237

237

00:08:57.250  -->  00:08:59.290
working with programme code.
238

238

00:08:59.290  -->  00:09:01.678
So we come back here and click on Configure.
239

239

00:09:01.678  -->  00:09:03.233
I'm gonna click on Settings.
240

240

00:09:04.770  -->  00:09:05.603
Once we've done that,
241

241

00:09:05.603  -->  00:09:07.028
we're gonna actually come over here,
242

242

00:09:07.028  -->  00:09:09.360
then into Editor.
243

243

00:09:09.360  -->  00:09:10.425
We'll expand that out,
244

244

00:09:10.425  -->  00:09:13.150
I'm gonna click and expand General,
245

245

00:09:13.150  -->  00:09:14.930
and we're gonna do two things.
246

246

00:09:14.930  -->  00:09:17.550
Firstly when I click on Auto Import,
247

247

00:09:17.550  -->  00:09:19.020
you wanna make sure that both,
248

248

00:09:19.020  -->  00:09:21.850
Add unambiguous imports on the fly is clicked,
249

249

00:09:21.850  -->  00:09:23.530
and Optimise imports on the fly.
250

250

00:09:23.530  -->  00:09:26.520
And that will just make your coding a little bit easier,
251

251

00:09:26.520  -->  00:09:27.970
as we go through the course.
252

252

00:09:27.970  -->  00:09:29.760
So I'm gonna apply that change.
253

253

00:09:29.760  -->  00:09:32.760
The next to click on is Appearance,
254

254

00:09:32.760  -->  00:09:35.670
and make sure that Show line numbers is selected.
255

255

00:09:35.670  -->  00:09:37.720
Now it is actually showing as a default for me,
256

256

00:09:37.720  -->  00:09:40.010
but if for some reason it wasn't checked,
257

257

00:09:40.010  -->  00:09:42.480
make sure you do check that Show line numbers.
258

258

00:09:42.480  -->  00:09:43.517
And once you've done that,
259

259

00:09:43.517  -->  00:09:45.140
you can click on OK,
260

260

00:09:45.140  -->  00:09:47.380
and we're actually done at this point.
261

261

00:09:47.380  -->  00:09:48.720
So I'm gonna end the video here now,
262

262

00:09:48.720  -->  00:09:50.490
and we can move on to the next video
263

263

00:09:50.490  -->  00:09:52.963
and start making use of IntelliJ IDEA.
