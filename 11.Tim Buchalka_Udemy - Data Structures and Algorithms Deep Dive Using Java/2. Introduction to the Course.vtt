00:00:05.490  -->  00:00:07.380
<v Instructor>Welcome to the data structures</v>
2

2

00:00:07.380  -->  00:00:09.810
and algorithms for Java course.
3

3

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:12.620
Congratulations on making a great decision
4

4

00:00:12.620  -->  00:00:14.030
to take this course.
5

5

00:00:14.030  -->  00:00:17.431
As a software developer, it's important that you understand
6

6

00:00:17.431  -->  00:00:21.360
the options available to you in terms of the data structures
7

7

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:23.530
you can use in your applications,
8

8

00:00:23.530  -->  00:00:26.740
and the algorithms you can use to sort and search data.
9

9

00:00:26.740  -->  00:00:28.014
So we're gonna start the course
10

10

00:00:28.014  -->  00:00:30.240
by going over a few definitions.
11

11

00:00:30.240  -->  00:00:33.304
We're going to discuss what is a data structure,
12

12

00:00:33.304  -->  00:00:35.230
and what is an algorithm,
13

13

00:00:35.230  -->  00:00:39.021
and then we're going to also cover Big O notation.
14

14

00:00:39.021  -->  00:00:42.620
Big O notation is a way of comparing
15

15

00:00:42.620  -->  00:00:46.210
how different algorithms perform in an objective manner
16

16

00:00:46.210  -->  00:00:48.460
that doesn't rely on hardware.
17

17

00:00:48.460  -->  00:00:50.770
We're gonna cover a bunch of data structures
18

18

00:00:50.770  -->  00:00:54.120
in this course, and some of those are abstract data types,
19

19

00:00:54.120  -->  00:00:56.860
and you'll learn what those are in the course.
20

20

00:00:56.860  -->  00:01:00.640
So we're gonna cover arrays, lists, stacks, queues,
21

21

00:01:00.640  -->  00:01:02.891
hashtables, trees, and we're gonna focus
22

22

00:01:02.891  -->  00:01:06.536
mainly on binary search trees in the tree section,
23

23

00:01:06.536  -->  00:01:10.510
heaps and a very brief look at sets.
24

24

00:01:10.510  -->  00:01:14.930
For algorithms we're going to cover search algorithms
25

25

00:01:14.930  -->  00:01:16.470
there are only two that we're gonna cover,
26

26

00:01:16.470  -->  00:01:18.920
linear search and binary search.
27

27

00:01:18.920  -->  00:01:21.160
We're gonna look at a whole bunch of sort algorithms
28

28

00:01:21.160  -->  00:01:23.680
I won't list them all, but just to sample a few
29

29

00:01:23.680  -->  00:01:26.106
bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort,
30

30

00:01:26.106  -->  00:01:29.896
Radix sort, insertion sort, quite a number of others,
31

31

00:01:29.896  -->  00:01:32.770
and we're also gonna look at recursion.
32

32

00:01:32.770  -->  00:01:36.251
That might be review for you, but many of the algorithms
33

33

00:01:36.251  -->  00:01:40.040
use recursion and so we're going to review
34

34

00:01:40.040  -->  00:01:42.483
what recursion is and how it works.
35

35

00:01:42.483  -->  00:01:44.990
So the way that most sections will go,
36

36

00:01:44.990  -->  00:01:46.830
is we'll start with some theory
37

37

00:01:46.830  -->  00:01:49.020
for example if we're discussing an algorithm
38

38

00:01:49.020  -->  00:01:51.360
we'll go over the steps for the algorithm.
39

39

00:01:51.360  -->  00:01:53.810
If we're talking about a data structure,
40

40

00:01:53.810  -->  00:01:56.010
we'll discuss what the data structure is,
41

41

00:01:56.010  -->  00:01:58.096
and what's it's advantages and disadvantages are,
42

42

00:01:58.096  -->  00:02:00.976
and then we'll code when it comes to a data structure
43

43

00:02:00.976  -->  00:02:03.647
a simple implementation if it's an algorithm
44

44

00:02:03.647  -->  00:02:06.778
we'll code a representative implementation,
45

45

00:02:06.778  -->  00:02:10.470
and after that we'll look at what's available in the JDK
46

46

00:02:10.470  -->  00:02:13.110
because this is a for Java course
47

47

00:02:13.110  -->  00:02:15.990
and in practise you're not going to code the algorithms
48

48

00:02:15.990  -->  00:02:19.060
and the data structures, because the Java team
49

49

00:02:19.060  -->  00:02:22.130
has already done that for us most of the time.
50

50

00:02:22.130  -->  00:02:24.740
There are cases where there isn't much available
51

51

00:02:24.740  -->  00:02:27.438
in the JDK, but for the data structures we'll be looking at
52

52

00:02:27.438  -->  00:02:30.211
there's good support in the JDK for most of them,
53

53

00:02:30.211  -->  00:02:35.023
and when it comes to the sort algorithms the JDK
54

54

00:02:35.023  -->  00:02:38.160
does have methods for sorting collections.
55

55

00:02:38.160  -->  00:02:41.460
Now it's important that you watch the videos in order
56

56

00:02:41.460  -->  00:02:44.270
because later videos assume you know what we've covered
57

57

00:02:44.270  -->  00:02:45.340
in earlier videos.
58

58

00:02:45.340  -->  00:02:48.359
So later sections build on earlier sections.
59

59

00:02:48.359  -->  00:02:52.680
For example, when we get down to a stack
60

60

00:02:52.680  -->  00:02:55.679
we'll say well you can implement a stack using a link list.
61

61

00:02:55.679  -->  00:02:57.860
Well if you don't understand link list
62

62

00:02:57.860  -->  00:03:00.930
because you haven't watched the list section
63

63

00:03:00.930  -->  00:03:04.810
you might have trouble following the discussion about stacks
64

64

00:03:04.810  -->  00:03:07.440
and so to get the most out of this course,
65

65

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:09.730
it's best that you watch the videos in order.
66

66

00:03:09.730  -->  00:03:12.266
Even if you think that some of the videos might be review
67

67

00:03:12.266  -->  00:03:14.650
you never know you might pick up something
68

68

00:03:14.650  -->  00:03:15.980
that you didn't know.
69

69

00:03:15.980  -->  00:03:18.730
I've been a software developer for over 25 years
70

70

00:03:18.730  -->  00:03:20.290
and every time I take a tech course
71

71

00:03:20.290  -->  00:03:22.840
I always watch the videos from beginning to end
72

72

00:03:22.840  -->  00:03:25.690
because usually there's one or two little nuggets
73

73

00:03:25.690  -->  00:03:28.170
that I pick up that I didn't already know.
74

74

00:03:28.170  -->  00:03:30.340
So to get the best out of the course I recommend
75

75

00:03:30.340  -->  00:03:32.210
that you watch the videos in order.
76

76

00:03:32.210  -->  00:03:34.567
Okay, so I didn't wanna spend a long time
77

77

00:03:34.567  -->  00:03:36.140
introducing the course,
78

78

00:03:36.140  -->  00:03:38.180
cause I know you wanna get into the material,
79

79

00:03:38.180  -->  00:03:40.480
and so do I so let's get going.
80

80

00:03:40.480  -->  00:03:42.030
I'll see you in the next video.
