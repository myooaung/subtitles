<v Instructor>In this section,</v>

00:00:06,093  -->  00:00:09,070 line:15% 
we're going to take a look at stacks.
5

5

00:00:09,070  -->  00:00:13,230
Instead of dictating how we store the items,
6

6

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:16,720
stacks dictate what operations we can do on the items.
7

7

00:00:16,720  -->  00:00:20,450
And so a stack is known as an abstract data type.
8

8

00:00:20,450  -->  00:00:22,640
And so let's move on to the next video
9

9

00:00:22,640  -->  00:00:24,550
where we'll take a look at stacks
10

10

00:00:24,550  -->  00:00:27,620
and what operations we can do on a stack.
11

11

00:00:27,620  -->  00:00:30,660
And then we'll implement a simple stack
12

12

00:00:30,660  -->  00:00:33,820 line:15% 
and after that we'll take a look at the support
13

13

00:00:33,820  -->  00:00:36,300 line:15% 
that the JDK has for stacks.
14

14

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:38,000 line:15% 
So I'll see you in the next video.
