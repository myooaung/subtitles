00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.967
(electronic keyboard sound)
2

2

00:00:02.967  -->  00:00:05.691
(typing sound)
3

3

00:00:05.691  -->  00:00:07.700
<v Tim>In this video, we're gonna go ahead and download</v>
4

4

00:00:07.700  -->  00:00:11.670
and instal the JDK, which is the Java Development Kit
5

5

00:00:11.670  -->  00:00:12.810
which contains the software
6

6

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:15.500
to be able to run programmes in this course.
7

7

00:00:15.500  -->  00:00:18.400
Now if you're running on a Mac or Linux machine,
8

8

00:00:18.400  -->  00:00:20.350
you'll wanna check out a specific video
9

9

00:00:20.350  -->  00:00:23.060
that we've created in this section of the course
10

10

00:00:23.060  -->  00:00:24.970
for those operating systems.
11

11

00:00:24.970  -->  00:00:26.700
The reason is the steps are slightly different
12

12

00:00:26.700  -->  00:00:27.810
for each platform.
13

13

00:00:27.810  -->  00:00:29.560
So this is the Windows video.
14

14

00:00:29.560  -->  00:00:31.720
So if you are on Windows, you'll wanna start
15

15

00:00:31.720  -->  00:00:34.663
by going to java.oracle.com.
16

16

00:00:36.390  -->  00:00:38.740
That'll bring you to a page from Oracle,
17

17

00:00:38.740  -->  00:00:41.680
which are now the owners of the Java product.
18

18

00:00:41.680  -->  00:00:43.680
And we come over here to under Technologies,
19

19

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:45.150
click on Java SE
20

20

00:00:47.310  -->  00:00:48.430
and once that page loads
21

21

00:00:48.430  -->  00:00:50.330
come over here and click on Downloads.
22

22

00:00:52.010  -->  00:00:53.990
And finally, once we get to that page,
23

23

00:00:53.990  -->  00:00:56.680
there's this little icon here, this little image
24

24

00:00:56.680  -->  00:01:00.810
and it'll say Java Platform JDK and a number here.
25

25

00:01:00.810  -->  00:01:02.870
Now it's highly likely that this number will change
26

26

00:01:02.870  -->  00:01:05.210
in the future because Oracle release,
27

27

00:01:05.210  -->  00:01:08.880
at regular intervals, updates to the Java Development Kit,
28

28

00:01:08.880  -->  00:01:11.460
so if you've got a later number than that, that's fine.
29

29

00:01:11.460  -->  00:01:14.410
Just click on the graphic there
30

30

00:01:14.410  -->  00:01:16.510
and that'll take you to the Download page
31

31

00:01:16.510  -->  00:01:18.900
where we can actually download the software.
32

32

00:01:18.900  -->  00:01:22.060
Now what we need to do, is determine whether your computer
33

33

00:01:22.060  -->  00:01:27.060
is a 32 or is running a 32 or 64-bit version of Windows.
34

34

00:01:27.330  -->  00:01:29.440
The reason for that is that there's two versions
35

35

00:01:29.440  -->  00:01:31.160
of the JDK available
36

36

00:01:31.160  -->  00:01:35.360
and you can see here Windows x86, Windows x64.
37

37

00:01:35.360  -->  00:01:37.930
So what that means is Windows x86
38

38

00:01:37.930  -->  00:01:41.110
is for computers running 32-bit version of Windows
39

39

00:01:41.110  -->  00:01:45.240
and Windows x64 is for 64-bit version of Windows.
40

40

00:01:45.240  -->  00:01:46.730
So to find out which version you're running
41

41

00:01:46.730  -->  00:01:48.700
on your computer, you basically wanna get
42

42

00:01:48.700  -->  00:01:52.030
into Control Panel, or from Windows 10 it's Settings.
43

43

00:01:52.030  -->  00:01:54.770
So I wanna come down here, I've clicked on the Start icon,
44

44

00:01:54.770  -->  00:01:56.420
click on Settings.
45

45

00:01:56.420  -->  00:01:57.760
Once you get into Control Panel,
46

46

00:01:57.760  -->  00:02:00.880
or in my case Windows Settings, click on System
47

47

00:02:00.880  -->  00:02:03.060
and then there's an option down here for About.
48

48

00:02:03.060  -->  00:02:05.540
That's certainly what it is for Windows 10,
49

49

00:02:05.540  -->  00:02:08.220
it might be slightly different for older version of Windows.
50

50

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:10.300
But there's an option on all versions of Windows
51

51

00:02:10.300  -->  00:02:12.850
to tell you what version of Windows you're running.
52

52

00:02:12.850  -->  00:02:14.350
And here under System Type,
53

53

00:02:14.350  -->  00:02:17.400
you can see that it's a 64-bit operating system.
54

54

00:02:17.400  -->  00:02:19.470
So ignore this part to the right
55

55

00:02:19.470  -->  00:02:22.050
where it says x64-based processor,
56

56

00:02:22.050  -->  00:02:24.140
because it is possible confusingly,
57

57

00:02:24.140  -->  00:02:27.010
to have a 64-bit processor but to be running
58

58

00:02:27.010  -->  00:02:30.900
a 32-bit version of the Windows operating system.
59

59

00:02:30.900  -->  00:02:32.920
So, the important bit here is to the left
60

60

00:02:32.920  -->  00:02:35.350
where it says 64-bit operating system,
61

61

00:02:35.350  -->  00:02:38.220
that tells me there that I'm running a 64-bit version
62

62

00:02:38.220  -->  00:02:41.650
of the operating system and I can now choose my download.
63

63

00:02:41.650  -->  00:02:43.380
The only other option that would come up
64

64

00:02:43.380  -->  00:02:46.680
would be a 32-bit version and once you know that
65

65

00:02:46.680  -->  00:02:48.400
you can close that screen down,
66

66

00:02:48.400  -->  00:02:51.440
you come back to the page that we loaded previously
67

67

00:02:51.440  -->  00:02:53.670
and choose the relevant version.
68

68

00:02:53.670  -->  00:02:55.570
Now before they allow you to download,
69

69

00:02:55.570  -->  00:02:57.810
you need to click on Accept Licence Agreement,
70

70

00:02:57.810  -->  00:03:00.400
this little radio button that you saw we clicked,
71

71

00:03:00.400  -->  00:03:02.370
and now we need to choose the version.
72

72

00:03:02.370  -->  00:03:06.090
So a 32-bit version, that would be the Windows x86 version.
73

73

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:08.920
In my case, 64 means 64-bit version,
74

74

00:03:08.920  -->  00:03:11.520
or 64-bit edition of Windows, so I'm gonna click
75

75

00:03:11.520  -->  00:03:13.180
on that little option there for me.
76

76

00:03:13.180  -->  00:03:15.410
So you'll choose whichever one is appropriate.
77

77

00:03:15.410  -->  00:03:19.530
And I'm gonna click on Run to let Windows run this
78

78

00:03:19.530  -->  00:03:21.780
so that we can go ahead and instal it.
79

79

00:03:21.780  -->  00:03:23.660
So I'll just fast forward this while it continues
80

80

00:03:23.660  -->  00:03:25.653
so it completes the download.
81

81

00:03:30.030  -->  00:03:32.330
Okay, so I've gone ahead and the download's finished
82

82

00:03:32.330  -->  00:03:34.660
and it's started because I've selected it to Run.
83

83

00:03:34.660  -->  00:03:35.870
Now if you didn't select Run,
84

84

00:03:35.870  -->  00:03:37.370
you might have to double-click
85

85

00:03:37.370  -->  00:03:40.270
the downloaded programme to start it,
86

86

00:03:40.270  -->  00:03:41.890
in any event, it should start.
87

87

00:03:41.890  -->  00:03:42.990
I'm gonna close down the browser
88

88

00:03:42.990  -->  00:03:44.400
because we no longer need it
89

89

00:03:44.400  -->  00:03:46.120
and you'll get a process like this,
90

90

00:03:46.120  -->  00:03:48.720
an installation process that we can actually go through.
91

91

00:03:48.720  -->  00:03:51.880
So I come through here now and I can click on Next.
92

92

00:03:51.880  -->  00:03:54.130
Now you may actually need to know this later in the course
93

93

00:03:54.130  -->  00:03:56.400
so just keep to the back of your mind
94

94

00:03:56.400  -->  00:03:58.670
or perhaps write down the area
95

95

00:03:58.670  -->  00:04:01.710
or the path that this software's been installed in.
96

96

00:04:01.710  -->  00:04:04.190
You can see in my case it's going to be installed
97

97

00:04:04.190  -->  00:04:08.950
in C:\Program Files\Java, then this number will relate
98

98

00:04:08.950  -->  00:04:11.630
to the version that you've downloaded.
99

99

00:04:11.630  -->  00:04:13.920
The important part is Programme Files\Java,
100

100

00:04:13.920  -->  00:04:16.810
so you may or may not need that later in the course
101

101

00:04:16.810  -->  00:04:19.518
but have like a mental note of that
102

102

00:04:19.518  -->  00:04:21.709
or write it down so you know.
103

103

00:04:21.709  -->  00:04:24.000
Click on Next, we don't need to change any options there,
104

104

00:04:24.000  -->  00:04:26.093
we'll let it do it's thing and instal.
105

105

00:04:29.350  -->  00:04:31.260
Next thing it does is instal the JDK
106

106

00:04:31.260  -->  00:04:34.387
but it also wants to instal the JRE.
107

107

00:04:34.387  -->  00:04:37.440
The JRE stands for Java Runtime Edition
108

108

00:04:37.440  -->  00:04:40.280
and you do need to have both things on your computer
109

109

00:04:40.280  -->  00:04:42.160
in order to be able to use Java.
110

110

00:04:42.160  -->  00:04:43.900
So we're going to just click on Next,
111

111

00:04:43.900  -->  00:04:48.900
noting that that directory, the C:\Program Files\Java.
112

112

00:04:49.750  -->  00:04:51.570
So it's actually putting it in a different sub folder
113

113

00:04:51.570  -->  00:04:53.870
and, again, you my need that later in the course.
114

114

00:04:53.870  -->  00:04:56.120
Click on Next and let it do it's thing again.
115

115

00:04:59.360  -->  00:05:01.380
Alright, so at this point you can see that it's come up
116

116

00:05:01.380  -->  00:05:04.780
and said the Java SE Development Kit 8 Update
117

117

00:05:04.780  -->  00:05:07.310
and then the number has been successfully installed,
118

118

00:05:07.310  -->  00:05:08.143
so we're actually done.
119

119

00:05:08.143  -->  00:05:09.860
So we'll click on Close.
120

120

00:05:09.860  -->  00:05:11.420
I'm gonna finish the video here,
121

121

00:05:11.420  -->  00:05:12.920
let's move on to the next one.
