00:00:00.290  -->  00:00:02.630
(bright music)
2

2

00:00:02.630  -->  00:00:05.330
(keyboard clacking)
3

3

00:00:05.330  -->  00:00:07.730
<v Sarah>All right, so let's implement insertion sort.</v>
4

4

00:00:07.730  -->  00:00:09.260
I've already created the project.
5

5

00:00:09.260  -->  00:00:10.970
I'll be putting code into
6

6

00:00:10.970  -->  00:00:14.150
academy.learnprogramming.insertionsort.
7

7

00:00:14.150  -->  00:00:18.160
I've added the usual array and code to print the array.
8

8

00:00:18.160  -->  00:00:21.490
And this implementation doesn't need the swap method.
9

9

00:00:21.490  -->  00:00:24.180
We don't swap, we shift elements.
10

10

00:00:24.180  -->  00:00:26.170
And so I have not added the swap method
11

11

00:00:26.170  -->  00:00:27.270
because we don't need it.
12

12

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:28.540
Okay, so let's get going,
13

13

00:00:28.540  -->  00:00:32.213
so we'll say for int firstUnsortedIndex
14

14

00:00:34.870  -->  00:00:35.930
equals one
15

15

00:00:35.930  -->  00:00:39.310
because remember, this implementation starts out
16

16

00:00:39.310  -->  00:00:42.440
by assuming that the element at position zero
17

17

00:00:42.440  -->  00:00:43.960
is in the sorted partition,
18

18

00:00:43.960  -->  00:00:47.710
and so the first unsorted index will start at one.
19

19

00:00:47.710  -->  00:00:49.220
And then we're gonna keep going
20

20

00:00:49.220  -->  00:00:52.250
as long as the first unsorted index
21

21

00:00:52.250  -->  00:00:54.710
is less than the length of the array.
22

22

00:00:54.710  -->  00:00:56.640
So we're gonna examine all the elements
23

23

00:00:56.640  -->  00:00:58.940
right up to the end of the array.
24

24

00:00:58.940  -->  00:01:01.010
And after each iteration,
25

25

00:01:01.010  -->  00:01:04.680
the first unsorted index will be incremented by one,
26

26

00:01:04.680  -->  00:01:06.730
because we're growing the sorted partition
27

27

00:01:06.730  -->  00:01:09.900
from left to right, and so the first unsorted index
28

28

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:14.650
is going to be increasing by one after every iteration.
29

29

00:01:14.650  -->  00:01:16.210
Okay, so the first thing we're gonna do
30

30

00:01:16.210  -->  00:01:20.380
is save the value of the element we're going to insert
31

31

00:01:20.380  -->  00:01:21.320
into new element
32

32

00:01:21.320  -->  00:01:25.090
because as you saw in the slides, when we do the shifting,
33

33

00:01:25.090  -->  00:01:28.700
that position, the element, is going to be overwritten.
34

34

00:01:28.700  -->  00:01:30.450
And so we need to save the value off,
35

35

00:01:30.450  -->  00:01:35.103
so we're gonna save off intArray firstUnsortedIndex
36

36

00:01:37.210  -->  00:01:40.790
and I'm going to declare i outside the loop
37

37

00:01:40.790  -->  00:01:43.020
because I need it after the loop.
38

38

00:01:43.020  -->  00:01:44.850
And now, we're going to code the loop
39

39

00:01:44.850  -->  00:01:47.890
that does the traversal of the sorted partition
40

40

00:01:47.890  -->  00:01:52.500
and looks for the correct position to insert new element.
41

41

00:01:52.500  -->  00:01:56.583
So we're gonna say for i equals firstUnsortedIndex
42

42

00:01:58.820  -->  00:02:01.410
because when we start out, the element we want to insert
43

43

00:02:01.410  -->  00:02:03.493
is that first inserted index,
44

44

00:02:04.420  -->  00:02:07.150
and we're going to continue to loop,
45

45

00:02:07.150  -->  00:02:09.410
in other words, we're going to continue to look
46

46

00:02:09.410  -->  00:02:13.150
and keep shifting items, as long as i is greater than zero
47

47

00:02:13.150  -->  00:02:16.000
because that means we haven't hit the front of the array.
48

48

00:02:17.010  -->  00:02:18.060
And...
49

49

00:02:23.070  -->  00:02:26.120
And we'll keep going as long as
50

50

00:02:26.120  -->  00:02:29.890
whatever's at intArray i minus one
51

51

00:02:29.890  -->  00:02:32.170
is greater than newElement.
52

52

00:02:33.170  -->  00:02:34.370
So what is this doing?
53

53

00:02:34.370  -->  00:02:35.680
Just to go over this again,
54

54

00:02:35.680  -->  00:02:39.620
we want to keep looking for the insertion position
55

55

00:02:39.620  -->  00:02:42.070
as long as we haven't hit the front of the array
56

56

00:02:42.070  -->  00:02:43.910
because if we hit the front of the array,
57

57

00:02:43.910  -->  00:02:46.410
it means that the element we're trying to insert
58

58

00:02:46.410  -->  00:02:48.420
is the smallest element we've seen so far
59

59

00:02:48.420  -->  00:02:50.810
and the correct insertion position is zero.
60

60

00:02:50.810  -->  00:02:54.290
And we wanna keep looking as long as
61

61

00:02:54.290  -->  00:02:56.990
the element we're looking at in the sorted partition
62

62

00:02:56.990  -->  00:02:59.800
is greater than the one we're trying to insert,
63

63

00:02:59.800  -->  00:03:03.660
because if the element at i minus one is greater
64

64

00:03:03.660  -->  00:03:05.290
than the element we're trying to insert,
65

65

00:03:05.290  -->  00:03:08.080
then we still haven't found the correct insertion position.
66

66

00:03:08.080  -->  00:03:10.410
So the moment we hit the front of the array,
67

67

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:13.210
or the moment we hit an element that is less than
68

68

00:03:13.210  -->  00:03:16.020
or equal to the element we're trying to insert,
69

69

00:03:16.020  -->  00:03:18.410
we have found the correct insertion position.
70

70

00:03:18.410  -->  00:03:20.860
And on each iteration, we're going to decrement i
71

71

00:03:20.860  -->  00:03:23.750
because remember we are traversing the sorted partition
72

72

00:03:23.750  -->  00:03:26.930
and doing the comparisons from right to left,
73

73

00:03:26.930  -->  00:03:29.610
and so we're moving down the sorted partition.
74

74

00:03:29.610  -->  00:03:31.570
Okay, so what do want to do
75

75

00:03:31.570  -->  00:03:33.650
if we haven't hit the front of the array
76

76

00:03:33.650  -->  00:03:36.410
and if the element at i minus one
77

77

00:03:36.410  -->  00:03:38.370
is greater than the element we're inserting?
78

78

00:03:38.370  -->  00:03:39.890
Well, if that's the case,
79

79

00:03:39.890  -->  00:03:44.570
we want to shift the element at i minus one to the right,
80

80

00:03:44.570  -->  00:03:48.310
because we need to make room for this new element,
81

81

00:03:48.310  -->  00:03:49.500
so what we're going to do
82

82

00:03:49.500  -->  00:03:52.050
is we're going to assign intArray i
83

83

00:03:53.730  -->  00:03:57.193
with intArray i minus one,
84

84

00:03:58.770  -->  00:04:01.290
and so this is where we're doing the shifting.
85

85

00:04:01.290  -->  00:04:04.770
We're shifting from left to right.
86

86

00:04:04.770  -->  00:04:08.050
So for example, when we want to insert minus 15,
87

87

00:04:08.050  -->  00:04:09.930
assume we've done the first iteration
88

88

00:04:09.930  -->  00:04:12.470
and 20 and 35 are in the sorted partition
89

89

00:04:12.470  -->  00:04:14.430
when we want to insert minus 15,
90

90

00:04:14.430  -->  00:04:16.730
the first unsorted index will be two,
91

91

00:04:16.730  -->  00:04:19.940
so i will be two, so we'll say is i greater than zero?
92

92

00:04:19.940  -->  00:04:21.040
yes it is.
93

93

00:04:21.040  -->  00:04:25.320
Is the value at intArray i minus one, which is 35,
94

94

00:04:25.320  -->  00:04:27.020
is that greater than minus 15?
95

95

00:04:27.020  -->  00:04:28.150
Well, yes it is.
96

96

00:04:28.150  -->  00:04:31.350
So this condition is met, and so what we're going to do is
97

97

00:04:31.350  -->  00:04:36.300
we're going to assign intArray two with intArray i minus one
98

98

00:04:36.300  -->  00:04:37.290
which is intArray one,
99

99

00:04:37.290  -->  00:04:41.270
so we're effectively going to assign 35 to position two,
100

100

00:04:41.270  -->  00:04:42.820
and we, you saw this in the slide
101

101

00:04:42.820  -->  00:04:43.970
so if you're having trouble
102

102

00:04:43.970  -->  00:04:45.590
understanding what's going on here,
103

103

00:04:45.590  -->  00:04:47.190
go ahead and look at the slides.
104

104

00:04:47.190  -->  00:04:49.480
And then we'll decrement i to one,
105

105

00:04:49.480  -->  00:04:51.530
and so on the second iteration,
106

106

00:04:51.530  -->  00:04:53.160
we'll say is i greater than zero,
107

107

00:04:53.160  -->  00:04:54.240
well, yes it is
108

108

00:04:54.240  -->  00:04:58.040
'cause it's one, and we'll say is intArray one minus one,
109

109

00:04:58.040  -->  00:04:59.400
which is intArray zero,
110

110

00:04:59.400  -->  00:05:02.000
is that greater than the new element, well, yes it is,
111

111

00:05:02.000  -->  00:05:04.450
'cause 20 is greater than minus 15
112

112

00:05:04.450  -->  00:05:06.700
and so we're gonna shift 20 to the right.
113

113

00:05:06.700  -->  00:05:09.220
So we're gonna say that intArray one
114

114

00:05:09.220  -->  00:05:12.740
is equal to intArray one minus one, which is zero.
115

115

00:05:12.740  -->  00:05:15.210
So 20 will get assigned to position one
116

116

00:05:15.210  -->  00:05:19.070
and then we're gonna loop around and subtract one from i
117

117

00:05:19.070  -->  00:05:20.880
and at this point, i will be zero,
118

118

00:05:20.880  -->  00:05:22.600
so we'll say is i greater than zero?
119

119

00:05:22.600  -->  00:05:23.700
Well, no it's not.
120

120

00:05:23.700  -->  00:05:25.020
So we'll drop out of the loop
121

121

00:05:25.020  -->  00:05:26.730
because we've hit the front of the array.
122

122

00:05:26.730  -->  00:05:28.700
Now when we find the correct position,
123

123

00:05:28.700  -->  00:05:30.040
what do we need to do?
124

124

00:05:30.040  -->  00:05:33.290
Well, our final step when we drop out of this loop
125

125

00:05:33.290  -->  00:05:38.020
is to assign intArray i with newElement,
126

126

00:05:38.939  -->  00:05:40.370
so in the case we just looked at,
127

127

00:05:40.370  -->  00:05:42.410
when we drop out of the loop, i is zero,
128

128

00:05:42.410  -->  00:05:45.920
and so we're going to assign minus 15 to intArray zero
129

129

00:05:45.920  -->  00:05:47.140
and that's exactly what we want.
130

130

00:05:47.140  -->  00:05:48.990
It'll put minus 15 at the front
131

131

00:05:48.990  -->  00:05:51.800
and we've shifted 20 and 35 over one.
132

132

00:05:51.800  -->  00:05:54.180
And so that's how this implementation works
133

133

00:05:54.180  -->  00:05:57.790
and we have finished coding the implementation.
134

134

00:05:57.790  -->  00:05:59.400
And so the outer loop is the one
135

135

00:05:59.400  -->  00:06:01.780
that's growing the sorted partition by one,
136

136

00:06:01.780  -->  00:06:03.680
and the inner loop is that one that's looking
137

137

00:06:03.680  -->  00:06:06.910
for the correct position to insert each element
138

138

00:06:06.910  -->  00:06:08.600
and is doing the shifting.
139

139

00:06:08.600  -->  00:06:11.683
So let's run this to make sure this actually works.
140

140

00:06:13.080  -->  00:06:17.100
And indeed it does, we get minus 22, minus 15,
141

141

00:06:17.100  -->  00:06:21.220
one, seven, 20, 35, and 55.
142

142

00:06:21.220  -->  00:06:25.070
I'll just close that off, and so that is insertion sort.
143

143

00:06:25.070  -->  00:06:28.170
It works by taking each element and inserting it
144

144

00:06:28.170  -->  00:06:30.430
into its correct position in the sorted partition
145

145

00:06:30.430  -->  00:06:32.870
and at the end, when we've gone through all the elements,
146

146

00:06:32.870  -->  00:06:36.450
the entire array is the sorted partition.
147

147

00:06:36.450  -->  00:06:37.550
And so we're done.
148

148

00:06:37.550  -->  00:06:39.040
Okay, now as you can imagine,
149

149

00:06:39.040  -->  00:06:42.200
sometimes this will involve a lot of shifting, for example,
150

150

00:06:42.200  -->  00:06:44.480
I guess I should remove that comma there, I'll do that,
151

151

00:06:44.480  -->  00:06:48.390
for example, in our array, the smallest value in the array
152

152

00:06:48.390  -->  00:06:50.160
is right at the end of the array.

153

00:06:50.160  -->  00:06:52.210
So when we finally hit minus 22,
154

154

00:06:52.210  -->  00:06:54.370
we're gonna have to do a lot of shifting,
155

155

00:06:54.370  -->  00:06:56.650
we're gonna have to shift every other element
156

156

00:06:56.650  -->  00:07:00.660
in the array to the right, to make room for minus 22.
157

157

00:07:00.660  -->  00:07:03.130
There can be a lot of shifting with this algorithm
158

158

00:07:03.130  -->  00:07:07.410
and so perhaps there is way to improve this algorithm,
159

159

00:07:07.410  -->  00:07:09.740
and there is, and we're going to look at that
160

160

00:07:09.740  -->  00:07:11.883
in the next video, I'll see you there.
