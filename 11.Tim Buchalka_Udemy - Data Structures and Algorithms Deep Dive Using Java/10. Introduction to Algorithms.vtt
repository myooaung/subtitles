(upbeat jingle)

2

00:00:02.383  -->  00:00:05.081
(keyboard clicking)
3

3

00:00:05.081  -->  00:00:07.800
<v Sarah>Alright so, what is an algorithm?</v>
4

4

00:00:07.800  -->  00:00:11.470
An algorithm describes the steps you have to perform
5

5

00:00:11.470  -->  00:00:13.830
to accomplish a specific task.
6

6

00:00:13.830  -->  00:00:16.160
Now one common example that's often used
7

7

00:00:16.160  -->  00:00:18.740
when algorithms are being taught is the steps
8

8

00:00:18.740  -->  00:00:20.200
for making a cup of coffee.
9

9

00:00:20.200  -->  00:00:23.270
I'm a tea drinker so I'm gonna use tea instead.
10

10

00:00:23.270  -->  00:00:25.920
And so here's one algorithm for making tea.
11

11

00:00:25.920  -->  00:00:28.300
In step one we boil water.
12

12

00:00:28.300  -->  00:00:31.350
In step two we add a teabag to a cup.
13

13

00:00:31.350  -->  00:00:35.060
In step three we pour the boiling water in to the cup.
14

14

00:00:35.060  -->  00:00:38.440
In step four we remove the teabag when the tea is ready,
15

15

00:00:38.440  -->  00:00:42.120
meaning it's steeped to the desired degree
16

16

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:45.210
either weak tea, strong tea or tea in between.
17

17

00:00:45.210  -->  00:00:48.760
In step five we add the desired amount of milk to the cup.
18

18

00:00:48.760  -->  00:00:52.310
We step six we add the desired amount of sugar to the cup
19

19

00:00:52.310  -->  00:00:55.120
and in step seven we stir the contents of the cup
20

20

00:00:55.120  -->  00:00:58.760
with a spoon and our tea is ready.
21

21

00:00:58.760  -->  00:01:01.100
Now you might be looking at this and thinking
22

22

00:01:01.100  -->  00:01:03.640
wait a minute that's not how I make tea
23

23

00:01:03.640  -->  00:01:05.210
I don't put the tea bag in the cup
24

24

00:01:05.210  -->  00:01:06.969
I put the teabag in to a teapot
25

25

00:01:06.969  -->  00:01:09.950
and I boil the water and I pour the water in to the teapot
26

26

00:01:09.950  -->  00:01:13.730
and then I add milk in to the cup before I pour
27

27

00:01:13.730  -->  00:01:15.040
from the teapot in to the cup
28

28

00:01:15.040  -->  00:01:16.380
because that burns the milk,
29

29

00:01:16.380  -->  00:01:18.660
it gives the tea a little bit of a different taste.
30

30

00:01:18.660  -->  00:01:20.050
But you'll notice that I said
31

31

00:01:20.050  -->  00:01:23.160
here's one algorithm for making tea,
32

32

00:01:23.160  -->  00:01:26.540
I didn't say here's the algorithm for making tea.
33

33

00:01:26.540  -->  00:01:28.540
There can be more than one algorithm
34

34

00:01:28.540  -->  00:01:30.330
for accomplishing a task
35

35

00:01:30.330  -->  00:01:32.520
and you'll see when we cover sort algorithms
36

36

00:01:32.520  -->  00:01:34.615
that there are many ways we can sort data
37

37

00:01:34.615  -->  00:01:37.180
and so there are many sort algorithms.
38

38

00:01:37.180  -->  00:01:39.420
There isn't just one sort algorithm
39

39

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:42.960
and this is the one and only one way you can sort data.
40

40

00:01:42.960  -->  00:01:44.560
This algorithm that you're looking at,
41

41

00:01:44.560  -->  00:01:46.870
the making tea algorithm, makes some assumptions.
42

42

00:01:46.870  -->  00:01:48.809
It assumes that we're using a teabag
43

43

00:01:48.809  -->  00:01:51.580
and that we're making the tea directly in the cup as I said
44

44

00:01:51.580  -->  00:01:53.250
rather than using a teapot.
45

45

00:01:53.250  -->  00:01:56.470
And it's not unusual for an algorithm to make assumptions.
46

46

00:01:56.470  -->  00:01:59.140
Some of the sort algorithms we'll cover make assumptions
47

47

00:01:59.140  -->  00:02:01.630
about the data they're sorting and some don't.
48

48

00:02:01.630  -->  00:02:03.430
So there can be many algorithms
49

49

00:02:03.430  -->  00:02:05.510
that accomplish the same task.
50

50

00:02:05.510  -->  00:02:07.730
Now there's one really important distinction
51

51

00:02:07.730  -->  00:02:08.960
that you have to understand.
52

52

00:02:08.960  -->  00:02:11.940
An algorithm is not an implementation,
53

53

00:02:11.940  -->  00:02:13.490
they're not the same thing.
54

54

00:02:13.490  -->  00:02:16.384
An algorithm describes the steps you have to perform,
55

55

00:02:16.384  -->  00:02:19.360
and implementation is the code you write
56

56

00:02:19.360  -->  00:02:23.020
to perform those steps if we're talking about programming.
57

57

00:02:23.020  -->  00:02:26.610
There can be many implementations of the same algorithm.
58

58

00:02:26.610  -->  00:02:29.810
For example, let's look at our making tea algorithm again.
59

59

00:02:29.810  -->  00:02:32.940
In step one we don't specify how to boil the water
60

60

00:02:32.940  -->  00:02:34.840
we just say you've gotta boil water
61

61

00:02:34.840  -->  00:02:37.702
and so it doesn't matter if the water is boiled in a kettle
62

62

00:02:37.702  -->  00:02:40.541
or in a saucepan or if somebody is boiling it
63

63

00:02:40.541  -->  00:02:42.262
in a pot over a campfire.
64

64

00:02:42.262  -->  00:02:46.190
As long as you boil water you're performing step one.
65

65

00:02:46.190  -->  00:02:48.860
So in the same way when we implement an algorithm
66

66

00:02:48.860  -->  00:02:51.150
it may be possible to implement a step
67

67

00:02:51.150  -->  00:02:52.770
in many different ways.
68

68

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:55.700
And so in this course I'm going to show you
69

69

00:02:55.700  -->  00:02:59.153
one implementation of each algorithm that we study
70

70

00:02:59.153  -->  00:03:01.748
but there can be, and likely are,
71

71

00:03:01.748  -->  00:03:04.250
other implementations of the algorithm.
72

72

00:03:04.250  -->  00:03:08.320
So just to drill that home there can be many algorithms
73

73

00:03:08.320  -->  00:03:10.070
that accomplish the same task,
74

74

00:03:10.070  -->  00:03:12.040
if you look at the sort algorithms section
75

75

00:03:12.040  -->  00:03:14.730
you'll see that there's at least eight.
76

76

00:03:14.730  -->  00:03:17.357
There may be more, we cover the popular ones.
77

77

00:03:17.357  -->  00:03:20.090
And also there can be many implementations
78

78

00:03:20.090  -->  00:03:21.320
of the same algorithm.
79

79

00:03:21.320  -->  00:03:23.170
So I'll show you one implementation
80

80

00:03:23.170  -->  00:03:25.750
but you may see other implementations
81

81

00:03:25.750  -->  00:03:28.580
for the same algorithms as long as the code you're writing
82

82

00:03:28.580  -->  00:03:31.243
is following the steps described by the algorithm
83

83

00:03:31.243  -->  00:03:34.030
you have an implementation for the algorithm.
84

84

00:03:34.030  -->  00:03:36.740
Now often the words algorithm and implementation
85

85

00:03:36.740  -->  00:03:39.710
are used interchangeably even though they're different.
86

86

00:03:39.710  -->  00:03:42.360
I'll probably do the same thing occasionally.
87

87

00:03:42.360  -->  00:03:44.410
I may occasionally use algorithm
88

88

00:03:44.410  -->  00:03:46.440
when I should be using implementation.
89

89

00:03:46.440  -->  00:03:48.250
So just remember that an algorithm
90

90

00:03:48.250  -->  00:03:49.722
can have many implementations
91

91

00:03:49.722  -->  00:03:52.610
and as I said there can be many algorithms
92

92

00:03:52.610  -->  00:03:54.660
for accomplishing the same task.
93

93

00:03:54.660  -->  00:03:57.287
So that's algorithms, not terribly complicated.
94

94

00:03:57.287  -->  00:04:00.180
They just describe the steps you have to perform
95

95

00:04:00.180  -->  00:04:01.834
to accomplish a specific task.
96

96

00:04:01.834  -->  00:04:04.846
And so now that we've looked at what a data structure is
97

97

00:04:04.846  -->  00:04:07.243
and we've looked at what an algorithm is
98

98

00:04:07.243  -->  00:04:09.648
let's move on and start looking
99

99

00:04:09.648  -->  00:04:13.580
at our first data structure, the array.
100

100

00:04:13.580  -->  00:04:14.563
I'll see ya there.
