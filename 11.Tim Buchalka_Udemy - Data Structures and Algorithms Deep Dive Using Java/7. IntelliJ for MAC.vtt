00:00:00.218  -->  00:00:05.218
(lively music)
(keyboard clacking)
2

2

00:00:05.220  -->  00:00:06.740
<v Tim>In this video, we're gonna go ahead</v>
3

3

00:00:06.740  -->  00:00:11.640
and download and instal IntelliJ IDEA for a Mac computer.
4

4

00:00:11.640  -->  00:00:14.030
Now if you're running Windows or Linux,
5

5

00:00:14.030  -->  00:00:15.700
you'd want to check out the videos
6

6

00:00:15.700  -->  00:00:18.530
that we've put together for each operating system
7

7

00:00:18.530  -->  00:00:20.300
in this section of the course
8

8

00:00:20.300  -->  00:00:22.380
and that's because the process is slightly different
9

9

00:00:22.380  -->  00:00:23.890
on those platforms.
10

10

00:00:23.890  -->  00:00:25.030
But if you're on a Mac,
11

11

00:00:25.030  -->  00:00:26.930
this is the video for you to watch.
12

12

00:00:26.930  -->  00:00:30.057
So, you're gonna start out by going to www.jetbrains.com.
13

13

00:00:36.310  -->  00:00:37.610
And JetBrains is the company
14

14

00:00:37.610  -->  00:00:40.870
that actually create this IntelliJ IDEA product
15

15

00:00:40.870  -->  00:00:42.970
which we're gonna be using in this course.
16

16

00:00:44.570  -->  00:00:46.850
Once you get there, if you see IntelliJ IDEA showing
17

17

00:00:46.850  -->  00:00:48.870
on the screen, you can click it there.
18

18

00:00:48.870  -->  00:00:51.880
Alternatively come over here to IDEs
19

19

00:00:51.880  -->  00:00:53.860
and select IntelliJ IDEA.
20

20

00:00:53.860  -->  00:00:55.910
Either way will get you to the same page.
21

21

00:00:57.010  -->  00:00:58.970
And next, we're gonna click on Download
22

22

00:00:58.970  -->  00:01:00.270
'cause that's obviously what we wanna do,
23

23

00:01:00.270  -->  00:01:02.393
download and then instal this tool.
24

24

00:01:03.280  -->  00:01:04.890
There's two options here
25

25

00:01:04.890  -->  00:01:07.260
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start the download
26

26

00:01:07.260  -->  00:01:08.770
for the Community Edition
27

27

00:01:08.770  -->  00:01:09.710
and then while that's downloading,
28

28

00:01:09.710  -->  00:01:11.760
we'll come back and have a chat about the two options
29

29

00:01:11.760  -->  00:01:13.110
we've got here.
30

30

00:01:13.110  -->  00:01:14.960
So, I'll just wait for that to start.
31

31

00:01:16.510  -->  00:01:18.540
And I'll just put that or have that downloading
32

32

00:01:18.540  -->  00:01:20.190
and I'll click on back
33

33

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:22.940
and I wanna go through the options here
34

34

00:01:22.940  -->  00:01:24.770
because we've got an Ultimate edition
35

35

00:01:24.770  -->  00:01:26.280
and a Community edition
36

36

00:01:26.280  -->  00:01:28.217
and you saw me download the Community edition
37

37

00:01:28.217  -->  00:01:30.980
and that's actually the free version of this tool.
38

38

00:01:30.980  -->  00:01:32.720
If you download and use that version,
39

39

00:01:32.720  -->  00:01:34.570
you'll never need to pay anything for it
40

40

00:01:34.570  -->  00:01:37.540
but JetBrains, the makers of IntelliJ IDEA
41

41

00:01:37.540  -->  00:01:39.450
also have an Ultimate edition
42

42

00:01:39.450  -->  00:01:42.460
with a free trial which you can try it for 30 days
43

43

00:01:42.460  -->  00:01:44.740
and the only reason you choose the Ultimate edition
44

44

00:01:44.740  -->  00:01:46.280
it's got a lot more power
45

45

00:01:46.280  -->  00:01:47.860
and it supports a lot more things.
46

46

00:01:47.860  -->  00:01:50.300
You can see that both versions do have a lot of things
47

47

00:01:50.300  -->  00:01:52.770
in common but some of the advanced things
48

48

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:56.010
can only work with the Ultimate product.
49

49

00:01:56.010  -->  00:01:56.890
So, it's up to you.
50

50

00:01:56.890  -->  00:01:59.330
The Community edition will certainly work fine.
51

51

00:01:59.330  -->  00:02:01.700
If you wanna take advantage of a 30-day trial,
52

52

00:02:01.700  -->  00:02:03.260
click on Download here
53

53

00:02:03.260  -->  00:02:04.570
and the other thing to keep in mind
54

54

00:02:04.570  -->  00:02:07.490
is I can actually extend that by another 90 days
55

55

00:02:07.490  -->  00:02:09.180
to a total of 120 days
56

56

00:02:09.180  -->  00:02:11.930
if you decide you wanna try out the Ultimate edition
57

57

00:02:11.930  -->  00:02:13.160
and you'll see that there's a lecture
58

58

00:02:13.160  -->  00:02:14.800
in this section of the course
59

59

00:02:14.800  -->  00:02:16.130
which will show you how to go about getting
60

60

00:02:16.130  -->  00:02:17.470
that special coupon
61

61

00:02:17.470  -->  00:02:19.250
that will give you 120 days.
62

62

00:02:19.250  -->  00:02:21.430
So, choose whichever version you wanna choose
63

63

00:02:21.430  -->  00:02:22.380
and then download it.
64

64

00:02:22.380  -->  00:02:24.040
You can see in my case that I've downloaded
65

65

00:02:24.040  -->  00:02:25.480
the Community edition
66

66

00:02:25.480  -->  00:02:27.010
and it's actually now finished
67

67

00:02:27.010  -->  00:02:28.510
in the bottom left-hand corner,
68

68

00:02:28.510  -->  00:02:30.803
so I'm gonna go and click on that to open it.
69

69

00:02:31.817  -->  00:02:33.250
Depending on your browser, you may need to navigate
70

70

00:02:33.250  -->  00:02:34.630
to the folder where it was downloaded
71

71

00:02:34.630  -->  00:02:38.323
and then open that file to start the installation process.
72

72

00:02:40.210  -->  00:02:42.286
And you can see that it's pretty simple.
73

73

00:02:42.286  -->  00:02:47.082
Just need to drag this over into the Applications folders,
74

74

00:02:47.082  -->  00:02:48.211
give it a moment to start,
75

75

00:02:48.211  -->  00:02:50.161
you can see that it's installing there.
76

76

00:02:51.500  -->  00:02:52.410
That's actually installed,
77

77

00:02:52.410  -->  00:02:53.500
so I'm gonna close that down,
78

78

00:02:53.500  -->  00:02:55.510
I'm also gonna close down the browser now
79

79

00:02:55.510  -->  00:02:57.562
'cause we're finished with that.
80

80

00:02:57.562  -->  00:02:58.395
And what I'm going to do then
81

81

00:02:58.395  -->  00:03:01.490
is open that product, so I'm gonna go to my Finder,
82

82

00:03:01.490  -->  00:03:04.830
open a new window, go into Applications
83

83

00:03:04.830  -->  00:03:06.660
and actually I'm gonna close down this as well
84

84

00:03:06.660  -->  00:03:07.560
because we've actually finished
85

85

00:03:07.560  -->  00:03:10.220
with the installation process
86

86

00:03:10.220  -->  00:03:11.726
and you go back to Applications.
87

87

00:03:11.726  -->  00:03:15.070
So, we downloaded it and the most recent version
88

88

00:03:15.070  -->  00:03:18.720
was the IntelliJ IDEA CE which is Community Edition,
89

89

00:03:18.720  -->  00:03:19.930
so I'm gonna double click that
90

90

00:03:19.930  -->  00:03:22.770
'cause that's the one I've just downloaded.
91

91

00:03:22.770  -->  00:03:24.270
In any event, you'll click on the relevant one
92

92

00:03:24.270  -->  00:03:26.200
that you downloaded which you'll probably only have the one
93

93

00:03:26.200  -->  00:03:27.710
on your computer.
94

94

00:03:27.710  -->  00:03:29.170
It then gets verified
95

95

00:03:29.170  -->  00:03:30.080
and then we just need to go through
96

96

00:03:30.080  -->  00:03:31.770
a few configuration options
97

97

00:03:31.770  -->  00:03:35.110
before we're able to take advantage and use IntelliJ IDEA.
98

98

00:03:35.110  -->  00:03:37.933
I'm gonna close down the Finder window for now.
99

99

00:03:40.530  -->  00:03:41.894
Eventually you'll get this message.
100

100

00:03:41.894  -->  00:03:43.160
Do we wanna open it?
101

101

00:03:43.160  -->  00:03:47.210
We can see that it's been downloaded from www.jetbrains.com,
102

102

00:03:47.210  -->  00:03:48.763
so we can click on OK.
103

103

00:03:50.530  -->  00:03:52.100
Now, depending on your installation,
104

104

00:03:52.100  -->  00:03:53.690
you may or may not see this,
105

105

00:03:53.690  -->  00:03:56.062
this is an option now for you to select
106

106

00:03:56.062  -->  00:03:59.770
whether you want to instal or import rather the settings
107

107

00:03:59.770  -->  00:04:02.730
from another installation of IntelliJ IDEA.
108

108

00:04:02.730  -->  00:04:04.720
Or most likely you haven't used this tool before,
109

109

00:04:04.720  -->  00:04:06.180
in which case the default option here,
110

110

00:04:06.180  -->  00:04:08.630
do not import settings will be correct
111

111

00:04:08.630  -->  00:04:09.830
but if you do see another option there
112

112

00:04:09.830  -->  00:04:11.670
and you do want to, you can select that
113

113

00:04:11.670  -->  00:04:13.960
and that will basically import the settings
114

114

00:04:13.960  -->  00:04:15.470
from another installation
115

115

00:04:15.470  -->  00:04:17.675
so that you don't have to enter them all again
116

116

00:04:17.675  -->  00:04:19.550
but in my case I'm just gonna click on
117

117

00:04:19.550  -->  00:04:21.600
or have selected which is the default option,
118

118

00:04:21.600  -->  00:04:23.563
do not import settings and click OK.
119

119

00:04:25.724  -->  00:04:27.540
And then we get to a wizard process,
120

120

00:04:27.540  -->  00:04:30.664
now we need to go through and just select a few things.
121

121

00:04:30.664  -->  00:04:33.590
The first thing is the UI theme,
122

122

00:04:33.590  -->  00:04:36.141
so we can choose whether we want the white background
123

123

00:04:36.141  -->  00:04:39.020
or a dark background or a sort of a dark theme.
124

124

00:04:39.020  -->  00:04:40.580
I'm gonna leave the white theme,
125

125

00:04:40.580  -->  00:04:41.900
the white background selected,
126

126

00:04:41.900  -->  00:04:44.440
but you'll choose whichever one appeals to you,
127

127

00:04:44.440  -->  00:04:46.260
noting you can always change this down the bottom,
128

128

00:04:46.260  -->  00:04:49.740
it says under Preferences, Appearance &amp; Behaviour, Appearance
129

129

00:04:49.740  -->  00:04:51.270
so you can go back and do that at a later time
130

130

00:04:51.270  -->  00:04:52.347
if you wanna change it.
131

131

00:04:52.347  -->  00:04:53.623
You click on Next.
132

132

00:04:54.820  -->  00:04:56.470
You get this option before
133

133

00:04:56.470  -->  00:04:58.200
and usually the option you wanna select
134

134

00:04:58.200  -->  00:05:00.070
is this one on the left-hand side here.
135

135

00:05:00.070  -->  00:05:01.560
I've never used IDEA
136

136

00:05:01.560  -->  00:05:04.700
and that's just gonna set up the Mac OS X Mac key maps
137

137

00:05:04.700  -->  00:05:07.900
which is probably correct for most people.
138

138

00:05:07.900  -->  00:05:09.300
So, I'm gonna click on Next.
139

139

00:05:10.150  -->  00:05:12.700
You've got an option here to create a launcher script.
140

140

00:05:12.700  -->  00:05:14.640
This is if you ever wanted to use IntelliJ
141

141

00:05:14.640  -->  00:05:16.340
from the command line.
142

142

00:05:16.340  -->  00:05:18.730
Probably it's not something you do very often
143

143

00:05:18.730  -->  00:05:19.563
but seeing as though we're going
144

144

00:05:19.563  -->  00:05:21.050
through the installation process,
145

145

00:05:21.050  -->  00:05:21.970
let's click that anyway
146

146

00:05:21.970  -->  00:05:25.473
and if we wanna use that in the future, we can do that.
147

147

00:05:25.473  -->  00:05:26.373
You click on Next.
148

148

00:05:27.520  -->  00:05:29.900
You've now got a list here or presented
149

149

00:05:29.900  -->  00:05:33.280
with various options for various extra plugins
150

150

00:05:33.280  -->  00:05:35.930
that we can instal for IntelliJ IDEA.
151

151

00:05:35.930  -->  00:05:38.660
The thing is you can come back and do these at any time,
152

152

00:05:38.660  -->  00:05:40.960
so I'm not going to select any at this point
153

153

00:05:40.960  -->  00:05:42.930
but if there's something there that appeals to you
154

154

00:05:42.930  -->  00:05:44.140
and that you wanna instal,
155

155

00:05:44.140  -->  00:05:45.850
this is the place where you can actually go ahead
156

156

00:05:45.850  -->  00:05:46.970
and do that
157

157

00:05:46.970  -->  00:05:49.150
and you can also disable some tools as well
158

158

00:05:49.150  -->  00:05:51.057
that they have installed
159

159

00:05:51.057  -->  00:05:52.110
but I would generally recommend
160

160

00:05:52.110  -->  00:05:53.384
you just leave everything as is
161

161

00:05:53.384  -->  00:05:55.810
noting that you can come back and change this later
162

162

00:05:55.810  -->  00:05:57.037
if you do decide to.
163

163

00:05:57.037  -->  00:05:58.620
And one other thing to keep in mind
164

164

00:05:58.620  -->  00:06:00.050
is if you're running the,
165

165

00:06:00.050  -->  00:06:02.230
or have selected the Ultimate edition,
166

166

00:06:02.230  -->  00:06:04.060
there's probably gonna be more options here,
167

167

00:06:04.060  -->  00:06:05.560
different plugins, so the screen might look
168

168

00:06:05.560  -->  00:06:06.750
a little bit different
169

169

00:06:06.750  -->  00:06:09.040
and that's because of the extra functionality
170

170

00:06:09.040  -->  00:06:11.269
that the Ultimate edition gives you.
171

171

00:06:11.269  -->  00:06:12.130
In my case I'm gonna click on next
172

172

00:06:12.130  -->  00:06:13.567
without changing anything
173

173

00:06:13.567  -->  00:06:15.630
and we've got a couple of tother options there
174

174

00:06:15.630  -->  00:06:18.380
to download some other featured plugins.
175

175

00:06:18.380  -->  00:06:19.730
You don't need them in this course,
176

176

00:06:19.730  -->  00:06:22.380
so I'm just gonna click on Start Using IntelliJ IDEA.
177

177

00:06:23.620  -->  00:06:24.630
It'll ask you for a password,
178

178

00:06:24.630  -->  00:06:26.453
so just type in your password.
179

179

00:06:28.640  -->  00:06:30.623
And that will now start IntelliJ IDEA.
180

180

00:06:31.771  -->  00:06:33.630
At this point we've started IntelliJ
181

181

00:06:33.630  -->  00:06:35.740
but we've got a couple of other configuration options
182

182

00:06:35.740  -->  00:06:37.070
we need to do
183

183

00:06:37.070  -->  00:06:39.050
and the first one is we need to define
184

184

00:06:39.050  -->  00:06:40.050
the Java Development Kit
185

185

00:06:40.050  -->  00:06:42.150
or configure that, we can click on that
186

186

00:06:42.150  -->  00:06:45.240
or select that by clicking on Configure,
187

187

00:06:45.240  -->  00:06:47.110
clicking on Project Defaults
188

188

00:06:47.110  -->  00:06:48.910
and then choosing Project Structure.
189

189

00:06:50.350  -->  00:06:52.210
Once we do that, we get this screen
190

190

00:06:52.210  -->  00:06:54.870
and if you don't see Project SDK selected,
191

191

00:06:54.870  -->  00:06:56.750
you might need to make sure
192

192

00:06:56.750  -->  00:06:59.775
that actually down here you've clicked on Project
193

193

00:06:59.775  -->  00:07:00.700
because if you clicked on another option
194

194

00:07:00.700  -->  00:07:02.330
in the past or something, you may not see it
195

195

00:07:02.330  -->  00:07:04.860
but clicking on Project will show that again.
196

196

00:07:04.860  -->  00:07:05.720
And you can see at the moment
197

197

00:07:05.720  -->  00:07:08.260
it's showing that Project SDK,
198

198

00:07:08.260  -->  00:07:10.110
in fact there isn't an SDK.
199

199

00:07:10.110  -->  00:07:11.100
So, what we need to do
200

200

00:07:11.100  -->  00:07:13.730
is associate the Java Development Kit
201

201

00:07:13.730  -->  00:07:16.090
that we've installed in a previous video
202

202

00:07:16.090  -->  00:07:20.400
with IntelliJ so that IntelliJ can use that in programming.
203

203

00:07:20.400  -->  00:07:24.273
So, to do that, we just click on New, we select JDK.
204

204

00:07:27.160  -->  00:07:28.700
Generally speaking when we do that,
205

205

00:07:28.700  -->  00:07:31.970
it will automatically find the Java Development Kit
206

206

00:07:31.970  -->  00:07:34.670
that has been downloaded that we downloaded previously
207

207

00:07:34.670  -->  00:07:35.990
and if you have a look there in the path,
208

208

00:07:35.990  -->  00:07:38.557
you can see that there's the Java Development Kit
209

209

00:07:38.557  -->  00:07:40.700
and that we downloaded in a previous video.
210

210

00:07:40.700  -->  00:07:42.420
It downloaded and installed.
211

211

00:07:42.420  -->  00:07:43.804
I didn't need to do anything.
212

212

00:07:43.804  -->  00:07:45.480
In some Macs, you might find
213

213

00:07:45.480  -->  00:07:48.120
that it won't automatically find that for some reason,
214

214

00:07:48.120  -->  00:07:49.930
if that's the case, this takes you to the path there,
215

215

00:07:49.930  -->  00:07:50.870
you can see on the screen there
216

216

00:07:50.870  -->  00:07:52.300
that would be where you'd go.
217

217

00:07:52.300  -->  00:07:55.890
Navigate to Library, Java, Java Virtual Machines
218

218

00:07:55.890  -->  00:07:58.630
and you make sure the Java Development Kit was selected,
219

219

00:07:58.630  -->  00:08:02.220
the JDK, making sure you haven't selected a J ari
220

220

00:08:02.220  -->  00:08:03.550
which is also an option,
221

221

00:08:03.550  -->  00:08:06.490
then you go to the Content, and then the Home folder.
222

222

00:08:06.490  -->  00:08:07.957
Once you do that, that's all you need to do
223

223

00:08:07.957  -->  00:08:09.660
and IntelliJ can do the rest.
224

224

00:08:09.660  -->  00:08:11.950
But in my case, as you saw, it automatically found it,
225

225

00:08:11.950  -->  00:08:13.650
so chances are good that it'll do the same
226

226

00:08:13.650  -->  00:08:15.210
for you and your Mac.
227

227

00:08:15.210  -->  00:08:16.043
Click on Open
228

228

00:08:16.043  -->  00:08:19.043
and you can see now we have got an SDK configured
229

229

00:08:19.043  -->  00:08:22.330
and if it's not selected for some reason,
230

230

00:08:22.330  -->  00:08:24.200
make sure that it is selected there.
231

231

00:08:24.200  -->  00:08:25.130
The other thing to do here
232

232

00:08:25.130  -->  00:08:28.220
is to make sure that SDK Default is selected.
233

233

00:08:28.220  -->  00:08:29.870
It is by default and that's version 8
234

234

00:08:29.870  -->  00:08:31.800
as you can see that's selected there.
235

235

00:08:31.800  -->  00:08:32.640
You don't need to do anything
236

236

00:08:32.640  -->  00:08:34.150
because that's the correct option,
237

237

00:08:34.150  -->  00:08:35.610
so once we've done that,
238

238

00:08:35.610  -->  00:08:36.470
we can click on OK
239

239

00:08:36.470  -->  00:08:39.620
and we've now configured our Java Development Kit.
240

240

00:08:39.620  -->  00:08:41.050
Then there's just a few other settings
241

241

00:08:41.050  -->  00:08:43.748
that I recommend you go ahead and configure
242

242

00:08:43.748  -->  00:08:45.590
before we finish the video.
243

243

00:08:45.590  -->  00:08:47.380
So, to Do that, click on Configure
244

244

00:08:47.380  -->  00:08:48.683
and click on Preferences.
245

245

00:08:49.960  -->  00:08:52.020
The next thing you wanna do is come down here to Editor,
246

246

00:08:52.020  -->  00:08:55.200
expand that option and then come down her to General
247

247

00:08:55.200  -->  00:08:57.270
and then expand that option as well.
248

248

00:08:57.270  -->  00:08:59.940
Try Auto Import first, select that option,
249

249

00:08:59.940  -->  00:09:02.020
you wanna go ahead and click on the checkbox
250

250

00:09:02.020  -->  00:09:04.610
for add unambiguous imports on the fly
251

251

00:09:04.610  -->  00:09:06.670
and optimise imports on the fly.
252

252

00:09:06.670  -->  00:09:08.030
Select both of those
253

253

00:09:08.030  -->  00:09:09.860
and that'll just make the coding a little bit easier
254

254

00:09:09.860  -->  00:09:12.530
and you'll see that in action as we go through the course.
255

255

00:09:12.530  -->  00:09:15.051
Click on OK, actually I'll click on Apply
256

256

00:09:15.051  -->  00:09:17.460
because I need to go back and go to Appearance,
257

257

00:09:17.460  -->  00:09:18.670
click on that.
258

258

00:09:18.670  -->  00:09:19.610
The other thing you need to check
259

259

00:09:19.610  -->  00:09:21.750
to make sure it's activated or is enabled
260

260

00:09:21.750  -->  00:09:23.400
is show line numbers.
261

261

00:09:23.400  -->  00:09:24.890
So, you can see in my case
262

262

00:09:24.890  -->  00:09:27.720
that show line numbers is checked
263

263

00:09:27.720  -->  00:09:28.850
and we wanna do that 'cause again,
264

264

00:09:28.850  -->  00:09:29.900
that makes it a little bit easier
265

265

00:09:29.900  -->  00:09:32.960
when you're programming to see which line number you're on.
266

266

00:09:32.960  -->  00:09:34.933
So, that's selected, click on OK.
267

267

00:09:36.160  -->  00:09:38.740
At this point we've now finished with the installation
268

268

00:09:38.740  -->  00:09:41.100
and configuration of IntelliJ IDEA.
269

269

00:09:41.100  -->  00:09:42.700
Let's move on to the next video.
