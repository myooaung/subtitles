<v Sarah>In this section we're going to look at arrays.</v>

4

00:00:08.450  -->  00:00:11.580
No you might be thinking, well, arrays,
5

5

00:00:11.580  -->  00:00:13.670
this isn't a beginner programing course,
6

6

00:00:13.670  -->  00:00:16.720
and most people have used arrays and that's true.
7

7

00:00:16.720  -->  00:00:18.801
But this is a data structures course,
8

8

00:00:18.801  -->  00:00:21.770
and the array is a data structure.
9

9

00:00:21.770  -->  00:00:26.030
And so we're gonna start out by doing a very brief review of
10

10

00:00:26.030  -->  00:00:27.960
how to use an array in JAVA
11

11

00:00:27.960  -->  00:00:29.900
and then we're going to take a look the array
12

12

00:00:29.900  -->  00:00:32.220
as a data structure, we're going to look at how arrays
13

13

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:35.300
are stored in memory, and why they're fantastic
14

14

00:00:35.300  -->  00:00:38.700
for random access when you know the index
15

15

00:00:38.700  -->  00:00:41.310
of the element that you want to access.
16

16

00:00:41.310  -->  00:00:43.510
We're also going to look at what's called,
17

17

00:00:43.510  -->  00:00:46.420
Big O Notation, it's a way of
18

18

00:00:46.420  -->  00:00:49.430
measuring how an algorithm performs.
19

19

00:00:49.430  -->  00:00:51.550
So let's move on and look at arrays.
20

20

00:00:51.550  -->  00:00:53.100
I'll see you in the next video.
