Hello everyone and welcome to despite an editorial in the previous video we successfully created our

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.660
image classification API.

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:18.920
We've sent the first post request to the model and received amazing results from it sometimes in production

4
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.760
or we are going to have multiple models on the same server for many different reasons.

5
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.730
Maybe we want to change the current model with a better one or just to perform a b testing of models.

6
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.470
In those cases we need to send the POS request to a specific model on a server.

7
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.650
In this video we are going to learn how to do that by changing only the url.

8
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.230
It's that easy so I copied the request code from our previous tutorial that sends a default request

9
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.850
to our model to start with our code.

10
00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.770
Let's change a variable name to a specific adjacent response and the only difference that we have to

11
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.060
make in this code is to change the URL.

12
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:16.380
The first part stays the same after it ad slash versions slash one and that is only difference that

13
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.680
we have to make in application to send the request to a specific model on our server D1 at the end.

14
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.850
Is the idea of the model that we want to target if you have for example model 5.

15
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:41.500
You would change that to 5 instead the one execute a cell and let's check if the response is 200 since

16
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.950
everything else is the same.

17
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.780
We want printed out again and as you can see response is 200 and everything works perfectly.

18
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.940
I want to congratulate you for coming this far and learning this complex topic on how to put the model

19
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
in production using tens of flow serving.

20
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.730
Well done guys.

21
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.860
If you have any questions about this or anything else please post them in the comments section.

22
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.960
Otherwise I'll see you in the next tutorial.
