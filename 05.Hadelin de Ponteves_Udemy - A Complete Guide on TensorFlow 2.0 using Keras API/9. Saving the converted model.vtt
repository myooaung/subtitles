Hello everyone and welcome to this biting tutorial.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:12.260
And as well as final video of this very exciting and simple project we reuse tends to flow like a library

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.460
to convert a model for a mobile device in this video.

4
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.010
We are going to conclude everything that we've done so far.

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.640
We will use our tens of low light version of a model that we've previously saved and saved in some file

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.030
that can be loaded on a mobile device so let's do that.

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.790
The first thing that we have to do is to open a file that we are going to use to save our model in so

8
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:49.370
right with open TAF underscore model dot of light because that is the extension for our Tanzer flow

9
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.840
light model.

10
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.030
We are going to open it in right binary mode it is followed by as f or a file you can name it whatever

11
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.060
you want then we are going to say f dot right.

12
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.760
And here we have to provide our converter model execute the cell.

13
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.200
And we've saved our model to a file if we check our files.

14
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.780
You will notice that there is a new file called The F model dot of light which is our model that has

15
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.970
an insignificant number of kilobytes that can be imported to resources about Android or iris app and

16
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.110
loaded from device itself and that's pretty much it.

17
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.620
If you have any questions or comments so far please buzz them in the comments section.

18
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.990
Otherwise I'll assume the next tutorial.
