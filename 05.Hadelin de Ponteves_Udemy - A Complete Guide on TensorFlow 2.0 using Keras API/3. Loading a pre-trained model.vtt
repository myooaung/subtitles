Hello everyone and welcome to despite an editorial in this video we are going to load the pre train

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.390
model from the section free of this course and make it ready to be used.

3
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:20.330
Fruit flies KPI the general way of saving and loading a model in the days upload 2.0 has two parts.

4
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.890
The first part is the model structure.

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.560
This part gives information on that apology of the network.

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.650
How many layers do we have.

7
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.440
What parameters it has.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.520
What optimizer and what laws do we use.

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.220
After the training process of the model we have some learned weight and that is the second part of the

10
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.360
same model.

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.060
And this is why we have two different files.

12
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.460
After saving the model the first one is the Jason that has information about the model topology and

13
00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:00.520
the second one is a dot age 5 that stores all learned the weights after the training process let's start

14
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.860
by opening our daughter Jason File right with open.

15
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.850
And here we need to specify two arguments a name or file and the method opening the file.

16
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.090
It could be read write or append.

17
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.910
In our case specify R since we want to read the file and for the second argument we need to provide

18
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.650
the file name so right fashion model flask.

19
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.790
Dr. Jason and you can check the file name here after that.

20
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.200
We need to specify a variable name that will contain the open model file.

21
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.390
I use f let's load the model now.

22
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.220
Right.

23
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.870
Model Jason is equal to FDR to read and now we have successfully read the models fracture.

24
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.030
Now that we have that information let's use it to create a model from it.

25
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.390
Right model is equal to the the care carers dot models.

26
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.020
And now there is a very intuitive function called model from Jason This function takes only one argument

27
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.060
and that is our variable that contains the whole model structure in our case that is a model Jason.

28
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.930
Select that part of the code and executed using controlled plus enter and we have successfully created

29
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.690
our model the next part is to load all pre trained wait for the model.

30
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.820
We can easily do that by using model that load weights.

31
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.180
This function takes only one argument as well.

32
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.380
If you remember we had this fashion model flask at that age 5 Fire which contains all learned weights

33
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.240
for the model in this case.

34
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.010
We only have to specify the file name and not open it separately from the model let's copy the first

35
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:08.020
part of the name and add dot age 5 at the end so like this line of the code and executed and now we

36
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.680
have our pre train model successfully loaded and that's it for now.

37
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.190
If you have any questions about this or anything else please post them in the comments section otherwise

38
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.700
I'll see in the next tutorial.
