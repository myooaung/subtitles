Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,250
In this video we are finally starting with a stage five of this project this stage is all about saving

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,690
the model and converting it to tens of low light version of it.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,790
So we are going to take everything that we learned so far.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:24,190
Train the model and save it to tens of low light version and the first step is to save the model itself.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,040
So let's do that.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,020
In this video before we say the model let's define a model name.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,600
So define a variable called Model Name equals two and you can set whatever name you want.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:46,380
It is only important to have H5 ext so in my case I'm going to name it fashion underscore mobile underscore

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:53,930
model dot age 5 the age 5 is extension of carers save the model.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,630
That's it for our name now that we have the name of a model.

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,780
The next thing that we have to do is to save it.

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,030
To do that we are going to call dear adult carers not models that save model.

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,930
This function takes two arguments a trained model and model name execute a cell.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,430
And now we have our model saved.

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,930
It is very easy to do.

17
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,450
And this is how you save models for other applications as well if we go to files of this project we

18
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:37,300
can find a new file called Fashion mobile model that age 5 which is our model itself and that's it for

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,030
now.

20
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,790
If you have any questions or comments so far please post them in the comments section.

21
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,070
Otherwise I assume the next tutorial.
