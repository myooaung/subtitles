Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,360
In this section we are going to build our image classification API using tens of low serving.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,590
The question you may have right now is what is the difference between our previous solution using flask

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,440
and this one using tens of low serving.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:28,460
And that is a great question the previous solution worked great but it wasn't scalable that much if

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,360
you end up having 1 million users or 1 million requests per day that solution wouldn't be able to handle

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
that.

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,830
On the other side we have tens of low serving which is built with that in mind.

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:48,040
It was built to handle millions or even billions of requests per day.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,120
All Google products from Google Translate to Google Maps are built on top of it.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,660
And if Google can use it.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,110
So can we.

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,630
If scalability is not your only concern.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,910
There are other great stuff that are handled in terms of low serving.

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,600
For example if you want to train or experiment with multiple models or versions of the same model this

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,810
library handles that for us in the background.

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,710
So we don't have to stop the whole application to handle that.

18
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,450
Everything is handled in the real time and users won't even notice a thing.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,140
Now let's start our project by setting up our environment to use you instead of CPO go to edit notebook

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:39,460
settings and for hardware accelerator select you the next thing to do is to install all dependencies

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,120
for the project in the first cell.

22
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,930
You may notice this long line that I've just pasted there.

23
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,870
I want explain it in great detail but in a nutshell it will set a path where our virtual machine can

24
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:59,110
find all dependencies for the tens of flow serving you can find this line in the resources of this section

25
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:07,460
copied from the resources to a free cell and executed the next thing to do is to update linux packages

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,230
if you use Linux before you already know how to do this.

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:21,980
And after that it's time to install tens of low model server exclamation mark up get update then this

28
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,700
and sign up to get install there's a flow model server.

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:37,170
The first part will update all packages and after that is done we will install tens of flow model server.

30
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,430
It's time to install tell the flow one point thirteen.

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,380
I know you may wonder why do we use this version after all this is a course for tens of floor 2.0.

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,410
Well at this point tens offload 2.0 doesn't have a great support for the tens of low serving because

33
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,400
of that we will use this one point thirteen version instead.

34
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,790
But no worries.

35
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,860
The code that we are going to write will be executable later down the road in the tens of 2.0 as well.

36
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,500
When they upgrade it tends a flow serving.

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,160
LIBRARY SO JUST RIGHT.

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,610
Exclamation mark pip install.

39
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:22,940
There's a flow that Jeep you equals equals to one point thirteen point one.

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,660
And the last thing to do is to install a library called requests.

41
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,200
It is most likely that we have it already.

42
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,480
But to make sure let's try to install it right.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,510
Exclamation mark pip install requests and that's it.

44
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,280
If you have any questions or comments please buzz them in the comments section otherwise I'll see in

45
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,110
