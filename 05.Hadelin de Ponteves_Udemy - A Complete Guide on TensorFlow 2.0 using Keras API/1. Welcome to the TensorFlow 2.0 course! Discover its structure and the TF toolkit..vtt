00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.640
Hello.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.360
A masseuse an enthusiast.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.680
Welcome to this new course on tensor float 2.0.

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.560
I am so excited because actually tensor flow 2.0 beta was just released and this is super good news

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.860
because that means that tons of flow 2.0 is here to stay.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.910
And besides it is starting to be super popular now.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.580
People are very happy about the new features because indeed now tensor flow 2.0 is more user friendly

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.620
more simple to use and besides it has many new features which allow you to build deep learning and AA

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.930
models in a much more efficient way.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.270
So this is the perfect timing for you.

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.450
You're about to get a very very complete course on tensor flow 2.0.

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.900
Indeed you will see we will study everything about sensor flow 2.0.

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.810
The course is structured in five parts and each port tackles something different something different

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.730
which you can do is tend to flow 2.0.

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
It's like you know a new combination of a deep learning course and an artificial intelligence course

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.050
because you will see with tensor float 2.0 we will learn how to build deep learning models artificial

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.690
intelligence models and many other applications.

18
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.540
So this is what this first lecture will be about.

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.090
I will introduce you to this course and walk you through its different parts so that you can already

20
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.030
take a step back and get prepared for this huge adventure.

21
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.280
We're gonna have in this course.

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.020
So let's do this.

23
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.860
But before we start I would just like to remind that the other big plus of this course is that not only

24
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.830
you will get a super extended knowledge intensive flow 2.0 but you will also get a large toolkit of

25
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.390
very complete toolkit with many deep learning and artificial terms Morales implemented with tons of

26
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.560
flow 2.0 and the tools in this toolkit are actually right here.

27
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.760
You know these are all these cool up files I'm going to explain what club is in a second but these are

28
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.820
all the tools that you'll get and each tool is like a different deep learning or amoral implemented

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.860
in tend to flow 2.0.

30
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.510
So in front of us we have the whole structure of the course.

31
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.020
And I'll give this to you right after this tutorial you know you'll get exactly this.

32
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.400
This is very practical because not only it allows you to take a step back but also it gives you all

33
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.600
the links to the different colored files meaning the tools that you will get in this course.

34
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
And so speaking of cool up files Well let me explain why this is such a good thing for you to have it.

35
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.010
That's because it is super practical to use.

36
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.010
I'll show you an example.

37
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.040
This is a cool app Val that built an artificial neural network intensive flow 2.0 and the great thing

38
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.630
about this is that you simply need to connect to this link.

39
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.640
You know the link provided here in this spreadsheet you just need to connect to this link and then you

40
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.820
can directly play the cells and execute your model either to train it or to make predictions.

41
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.360
So in other words you don't have to install anything on your machine.

42
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.020
You can directly plug and play your morals on this call up file which is just a Jupiter notebook with

43
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.490
many packages installed already including tensor float 2.0.

44
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.100
So in other words you don't have to do anything you can directly play your morals and do artificial

45
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.060
intelligence.

46
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.430
So that's a huge plus which I'm very happy about.

47
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.420
And this is a brand new feature by Google so this will be super practical for you.

48
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.290
All right.

49
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.350
So now let's do this let's explore and take a step back of what we're going to learn in this course.

50
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.050
Starting with the first part which is just an introduction to tend to flow 2.0.

51
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.450
This board is composed of two sections section one introduction which is just the intro lecture that

52
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.880
we are having right now where we have a look at the structure of the course and Section 2 very important

53
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.210
section that will give you the sense of flow 2.0 basics you know covering how constants work how variables

54
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.850
work how tenses work you know that's very important will work a lot with tensor flow sensors and how

55
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.920
operations work.

56
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.220
And of course tend to flow 2.0 and all the basics are included in the first collapse of this course

57
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.640
call up to you know corresponding to Section 2 and which is of course this one collab to sensor flow

58
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.930
2.0 introduction.

59
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.950
You'll get as we can see here in the table of contents all the different new features of tense flow

60
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.490
2.0.

61
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.130
And I started to remind what was intense flow once that we can understand the difference between of

62
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.340
flow and intense flow too you'll get a real understanding at how tense flow 2.0 got improved with respect

63
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.620
to tensor flow one.

64
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.930
All right.

65
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.110
So as I told you.

66
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.530
Here we studied the constants the variables operations with sensors and even strings intense flow 2.0

67
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.220
and that's because in this course we will even do deep natural language processing.

68
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.470
All right.

69
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.590
So all the basics are in this first clip file and then we move on to the second part.

70
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.880
Part two which is deep learning intensive flow 2.0.

71
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.110
And that's where you know you're going to build different new networks westerns float by nose.

72
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.490
That's why I was telling you this course is like a whole new deep learning course and also an artificial

73
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.990
intelligence course where you build tons of models with flow 2.0.

74
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.360
Right.

75
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.880
So this part too is composed of four sections in section three.

76
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.660
We will build an artificial new network intense flow 2.0 for a classification task and the collapse

77
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.400
valve for this.

78
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.540
Is this cool app 3 file which is right here.

79
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.000
That's where we build and not official new network intense float 2.0.

80
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.730
If we have a look at the table of content while you can see that we do it step by step we first pre

81
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.880
process the data and then we define the model as a sequential class.

82
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.910
Then we add the first fully connected hidden layer.

83
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.070
The second one w drop out you will learn about the drop out technique then the output layer which then

84
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.750
we can pass the model then we train it and then we evaluate it and make predictions.

85
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.880
So you see all the implementations will be done step by step so that you can really understand everything

86
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.750
and not get overwhelmed at any time.

87
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.750
And besides at the annual get some exercises so that you can practice your skills right.

88
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.360
So there we go.

89
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.280
Let us go back to the structure of the course.

90
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.120
The next section section 4 is about building a convolution or new network intensive look 2.0 for another

91
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.320
classification task and a collapse valve.

92
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.660
This is cool up Number 4 which is right here.

93
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.390
Here we go.

94
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.210
Cullinan before and it follows the same structure with first some data processing and then we build

95
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.650
it CNN by first defining the model adding the first convolution layer.

96
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.200
No worries you will get all the theory of that in the course and unexplored actually in case you're

97
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.010
not very familiar with the theory.

98
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.280
Then we add the second conventional layer.

99
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.040
The third one the fourth one the flattening layer.

100
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.340
The first fully connected layer the output layer.

101
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.770
So again everything is done step by step.

102
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.710
We implement every new network from scratch.

103
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:48.460
Then next section section 5 is about building a record a new network in sense flow 2.0 the application

104
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.660
for this will be a natural language processing application and the collapse alpha.

105
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.300
This is called at number 5 which is right here and again it follows the same process with First Data

106
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.190
Processing and then building the model with 30 embedding layer.

107
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.870
The Elysium layer the output layer we can powertrain and evaluate the model.

108
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.100
All right so I can't wait to see all this with you it's gonna be a fantastic adventure at the end of

109
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.730
which you'll get a super complete and useful toolkit.

110
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.720
Then let's move on to the last section of Part 2 which is about transfer learning and fine tuning intensive

111
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.860
flow 2.0.

112
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.680
The application is of course transfer learning and the collapse valve for this is this one where we

113
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.940
will do transfer learning from cats to dogs and dogs to cats.

114
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.520
It will be a very fun application where we can learn about transfer learning in a fun way.

115
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.530
I hope you like cats and dogs.

116
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.240
I do.

117
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.780
All right then moving on to the third part of this course.

118
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:52.930
Part 3 which is this dam about artificial intelligence because indeed we will see deep reinforcement

119
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.480
learning intensive low 2.0.

120
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.350
You know where we interact with an environment and play some actions inside.

121
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.600
And of course we'll do that with a deep learning model which means that it's going to be a new network

122
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.200
that will predict the actions to play when interacting with the environment.

123
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.800
So this part 3 is composed of two sections.

124
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.330
The first one where we'll just have a refresher on the deep reinforcement learning theory.

125
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.780
So here there is no practical activity because this is just theory and no girl at fault either.

126
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:28.930
But then in Section 8 we will implement a pretty cool A.I. which will actually be an A.I. training robot

127
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.890
and that's why the application is deep reinforcement learning for stock market trading.

128
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.400
We will just build an A.I. robot that will do stock market trading and you will see that the results

129
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.360
are actually pretty good and well the clap valve for this is called Number 8 deep reinforcement learning

130
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.940
for stock market trading.

131
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.460
And again everything is implemented step by step.

132
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:57.460
Finishing with of course how we are going to train that a trader that's going to be pretty cool.

133
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.550
I can't wait for you to reach that point then next point.

134
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.320
Part 4.

135
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.920
So here we move on to the more advanced part of tensor flow because as I told you this is a very complete

136
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.820
course intense flow 2.0 which is not only addressed for beginners who want to learn the basics that

137
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.400
tend to flow 2.0 and start to build some deep learning and admirals with it.

138
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.840
But for those of you who want to really go far in terms of flow 2.0.

139
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.850
Well you had these last two parts.

140
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:31.360
Part 4 and part 5 where you get to learn some more advanced features of tensor flow 2.0 and the first

141
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.700
one is tensor flow extended.

142
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.640
That's a super powerful feature of tend to flow which would be super useful for you to have in the toolkit.

143
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:45.520
And this part 4 is composed of two sections section 9 which is about data validation which tends flow

144
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.750
data validation TFT V.

145
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.900
So the practical activity is about data validation and the collapse felt for this is cool app number

146
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:59.320
9 where you will learn some very powerful techniques to do data validation which is something very useful

147
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:07.230
M. when doing learning or A.I. because indeed the data as you understand is power the data is super

148
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:14.400
important for your deeper morals and aims to learn correctly so the better you can do data validation

149
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.140
the higher chance you have to reach top performance with your deep learning and A.I. models.

150
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.840
Then next section is about data processing with to flow transform.

151
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.300
TFT So here you will learn another powerful technique to do data processing.

152
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:37.710
West End to flow 2.0 of course and the collateral for this is colored 10 which is right here and inside

153
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:44.490
which will do data processing with dense flow transform TFT which once again is implemented step by

154
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:50.550
step so you'll see we will work with real world data sets as the other ones here you know as the other

155
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.740
applications here.

156
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:58.020
This will be the pollution data set you will learn how to prepare assess it with sense of flow transform

157
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.130
and so once again this will be explained step by step.

158
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.960
And that's for those you who really want to get the advanced techniques of tense flow 2.0.

159
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:13.200
Then final part part 5 which is about putting a tensor float upon a model into production.

160
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.020
So here this bar is great.

161
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:20.430
If you want to really practice on how to apply your tensor flow skills in the real world because you

162
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:26.190
know in the real world what you usually do is to not only build a sense float quantum model but mostly

163
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.870
to put it into production.

164
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.480
And so that's what this part 5 is about this final part of this course divided once again into four

165
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:41.220
sections section eleven where you will learn how to create an API with flask and sense of flow 2.0.

166
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:48.140
So here there is no clap Val because Google collaboratively was not compatible with this application

167
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.540
you know because we are creating it with class.

168
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:57.360
So it was much easier to do it with a classic Python found you know that p y fell and so we will give

169
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:04.220
it to you separately once you reach section eleven then Section Twelve is about serving intensive low

170
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:10.830
morale with the RESTful API tensor flow serving and so the practical application for this will be an

171
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:17.700
image classification API which you will see in the collapse file number 12 which is right here there

172
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.350
you go you'll get to implement an image classification API with transfer to serving.

173
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.540
Again this is another advance technique which is totally optional but good for you to learn and the

174
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.210
technique of tense flow that does it extensive flow serving so it's really good if you can master this

175
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:40.530
as well then last two sections section thirteen which is about preparing a tensor flow model for an

176
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:47.540
injury or Iowa's device and that you can do extensive flow light so the collapsed value this is cool

177
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.880
and number 13.

178
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.960
There you go you will basically learn how to prepare a tensor flow model which will be integrated into

179
00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:02.390
a mobile device application whether it is Android or OS and that you do it with tens of low light.

180
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.970
So again congratulations if you decide to tackle this as well.

181
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:13.510
And finally final section of the course which is about distributed training of tensor flow 2.0 morals.

182
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:20.490
That's a great technique to know and master if you want to train some tens of floats on a morals on

183
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:27.690
a highly compute intensive task you know sometimes you can train a deep neural network or an AML for

184
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:35.710
days because the environment is so complex that your T L or AML can just take a very long time to learn.

185
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.850
Well in that case you have some techniques that accelerate the training process and one of these techniques

186
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:48.180
is distributed training which can apply on tens of loads point of morals and that's exactly what the

187
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.220
section 14 is about and the collapse after this is the last one.

188
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.880
The last tool of your toolkit.

189
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.020
Call up 14 distributed training of tensor flow 2.0 models so you will learn everything in this final

190
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.570
collapse file and I highly recommend it do it because I'm sure that at some points in your data science

191
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:14.940
career you will get to train some tens of floats on a morals on very complex tasks so therefore it can

192
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.640
take many many days to train before you get some results.

193
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.180
And for this you will definitely need some distributed training technique so I highly recommend to do

194
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.390
this.

195
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.910
That's why I put it at the end no because there is the usual final sprint at the end of an adventure

196
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:35.880
so I wanted you to have some great energy for this because this is a really useful technique to have

197
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.070
and a tool.

198
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.290
All right so there you go and now we can start the adventure I'll just quickly show you how to open

199
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:49.680
a collapsed valve by any chance you decide to re implement everything by yourself as you follow the

200
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:57.540
practical lectures of this course so it's very easy you just type here on your favorite browser Google

201
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.140
Q laboratory here we go.

202
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.280
First one here.

203
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.610
Then you can just click the first link and there you go you are on Google collab.

204
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.450
So you see.

205
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.450
Very very easy.

206
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.690
Then I'll show you the rest.

207
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.610
You can just cancel this here.

208
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.880
No useful.

209
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.800
And then so as I told you to open a new file you can just click file here and then click new button

210
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:24.260
three notebook not Python 2 because our implementations are compatible with Python 3.

211
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.650
So new Python 3 notebook.

212
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.620
And there you go.

213
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:33.090
You'll have a new notebook where you can implement stuff and I'll show you how very quickly so.

214
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:33.580
There you go.

215
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.740
That's a first cell.

216
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:41.200
And so for example if I type two plus two you can just click play here and it will return four in the

217
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.220
output.

218
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.240
There you go.

219
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:48.150
And then if you want add another cell you can just click here if you want to add some text as I did

220
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:54.520
you know for example here this is a text cell where I just implemented some texture to make some sections

221
00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:00.220
in this notebook to structure it well some text tax code and then as you can see you just click the

222
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:06.130
play button or press command or control plus enter to execute and this will execute your code so that's

223
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:11.250
only if you want to you know remake everything from scratch as you follow the lectures.

224
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.430
But I wouldn't recommend it because this is a long course and I really want you to finish it.

225
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:21.400
So I really want you to use these files which were prepared and structured for you very well so that

226
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.180
you can use them easily for your own problems and your career.

227
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.800
So I recommend to use them.

228
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.500
And lastly what I want to show you is that when you get this.

229
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.700
You know the spreadsheet with all the structure of the course and the different colored files.

230
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.550
Well you know you'll get the links here to the colored files.

231
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:44.110
And once you click on this link this will open the color files but this will only be given in view mode

232
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.680
which means you won't be able to edit it but of course no worries.

233
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.100
If you want to edit the files and get different cells.

234
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:56.400
Well you can do it very easily by clicking file here and then save a copy and drives.

235
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.980
You will need a Google address with a Google Drive account.

236
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.810
That's all free of course and I'm sure most of you has one.

237
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.750
And so there you go.

238
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:10.590
Now this is a copy which belongs to your google drive and now you can do some modification here right.

239
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:18.700
If I want to modify this file or you know maybe this one if I want to do 52 here well I can do it and

240
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:24.580
just play again well you can just modify anything and of course add some new cells by clicking plus

241
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:25.660
code here.

242
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:25.920
Right.

243
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.130
So very easy.

244
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:33.190
Now you talk is ready you can just start the course start the adventure and I can't wait to see you

245
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:40.270
in part 1 Section 2 to start with the sense of flow 2.0 basics.

246
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.190
So I'll see you in this next section.

247
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.720
Let's start the adventure.

248
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.140
And until then enjoy tons of love to find out.
