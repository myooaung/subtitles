Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in this video we are going to define our first class

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,120
application and briefly explain what the flask framework actually is.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,740
If you haven't worked with the flask before the flask is a python library used to create a backend for

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,400
web applications.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:29,230
With this framework we can easily create parts of our Web sites and functionality connected to a specific

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,200
path we can even specify what type of request that path expects.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,500
Is it a POST request or a GET request.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,440
There are other Python frameworks for building web applications as well.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But the flask is the easiest one to learn.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,580
It provides just enough to get an ad up and running OK.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:00,740
The first thing to do is to define the application right app equal to flask and if you remember this

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:09,040
is the main class from the flask library and if we take a look this class takes only one argument.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,620
This name This name is built in Python variable that the reference to the current python file let's

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,690
execute this line of code and it will define the flask application.

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,920
That's it for now.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,880
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comment section.

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,040
Otherwise see in the next tutorial.
