00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
Welcome to the HTML5 Canvas course,

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.630
where you go from beginner to be fully confident creator

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.110
in graphics and animations using the Canvas.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.895
My name is Chris, and I'm here to guide you through this process step-by-step.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:19.080
I have many years of experience developing websites and also creating

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.390
online courses with thousands of students and hundreds of five-star reviews.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.690
This course has been designed for a beginner to teach you

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.365
all about how to draw to the Canvas using JavaScript.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:34.110
By the end of this course, you will have the confidence and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.250
ability to draw or animate almost anything you can imagine,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.860
and display it within webpages,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.705
or in a web browser.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:46.295
Would take you step-by-step from the Canvas basics

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:50.375
right through to more advanced techniques such as transformations,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.925
animations, saving and install,

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:57.245
and also how to manipulate pixel data in images.

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:00.425
We begin by setting up the Canvas and

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:04.075
introduce you to basic script in drawing techniques.

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:08.755
We'll take a look at lines and puffs and how to draw a very shapes.

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:12.605
I will show you how to add text and images to the Canvas,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.440
remove sections of the Canvas along with the adding

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.270
some nice effects such as gradients, patterns, and shadows.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.360
As you progress through the course,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.205
we will step things up even further by looking at more advanced techniques,

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:29.990
we'll look at various types of curves,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.895
save and restore methods,

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.205
and how to use transformations.

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:38.180
You will also learn how to use loops, animations,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.850
and even how to modify the pixel data of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.245
images to allow us to add effects such as making photos black and white.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:48.605
We finish off by leaving you with a challenge,

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:50.480
let's draw Mickey Mouse's face.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.285
Let's put your new skills into practice.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:56.450
The ideal student of this course is somebody with

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.230
some web design or development experience,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.415
and looking to learn a new form of skill.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:08.465
