00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Welcome back everybody. I hope you had some success

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.725
with this challenge and do share what you've created,

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:08.465
and I'd love to see them.

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:13.155
Now I'm going to take you through exactly what I did to create this,

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.335
just in case you're having any trouble along the way.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:22.105
The first thing I done was to create a function called addReferencePoints,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.545
and this function contained

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:28.465
all the reference points which you can see on the right-hand side.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.530
I create these reference points to make life a bit

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.180
easier when creating the arcs and also the curves,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.995
and out of these, the function one by one,

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:42.225
just as we would draw on the curves further down in the code.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:45.630
Down the bottom outside of the function,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.775
this is the call to the function to actually draw all the reference points on the screen,

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:57.235
and the reason why all the reference points are contained in the function is so we can

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:04.500
simply comment all the call to the function when we want to remove them, just like that.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.355
I began by creating a line width of three pixels,

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:11.615
and then a path,

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:15.640
and then got to work on the top of the head outline.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.930
We used the arc method to draw the outer side of the head at the starting and end points,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.535
which we've added inside of here.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:30.130
Then the next thing I done, was create the left ear.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.615
Just comment this section out.

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:40.050
Created a arc once more using 2 times Math.PI to create a full circle.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.855
I then moved on to repeat for the ear on the right-hand side.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:47.075
As you go through this project,

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.825
you'll notice that a lot of the coordinates are symmetrical.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:54.380
We've got a line down the center which is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.285
300 pixels so a lot of the coordinates are equal on the left-hand side,

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.920
as you have to the right hand side,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.840
so it's just a case of working out one side,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.865
and then it's a lot easier to create the same on the other.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:09.830
Then we started moving inside of the face.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.495
We've got the interface,

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:15.960
which is the top-left arc and the top right arc.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.895
You can see I've made a comment that the coordinates that we're referring to is points 1,

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:29.150
2, and 3 which is available inside the function up at the top.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.690
We've created these points first and then added them inside of the bezierCurveTo method.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.210
Next step I create the reference points for the left cheek and also for the right cheek.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.355
I mentioned before about the symmetrical line,

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:53.350
which is 300 pixels across on the x-axis.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.120
We can then use this line to make sure that each side of the face is even.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.205
The left cheek is 40 pixels less than 300,

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:06.065
the right cheek is 40 pixels higher,

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:09.215
and this creates a symmetrical effect.

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:13.200
Then next I move down to the chin.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.000
To create this effect, we move the pen to the specified location,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.735
and this time use a quadraticCurveTo method rather than a bezierCurve,

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:31.110
simply because one control point was plenty for the section,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.720
and that's common to all the next section.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.910
This part is the curve which sits above the nose,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.490
and the eyes rest on top.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.800
Again, because this is a simple line,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.300
we used a quadraticCurve,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.745
and now we have this curve.

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:55.985
We now have a position to work at the eyes, so the left,

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.190
on the right eye,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.240
we just added those next,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.825
and these are the outlines.

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:05.750
I used a ellipse method,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.330
which we've not looked at yet in this course,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.760
but it makes it a lot easier than trying to use a certain type of curve to create this.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.550
I have added in the parameters just above,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.380
if you want to take a look at those.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.570
We have an x and y center,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.650
just like when using a arc.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.935
We've got the x and y radius,

00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:27.935
so the radius is the major axis,

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:31.475
and the y radius is the minor axis.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:36.120
We can also add a rotation to the ellipse,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.635
this is in radians.

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:42.685
We then are the start and endAngle,

00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:46.390
and they've got a optional parameter at the end,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.850
if we want it to be drawn in clockwise or anticlockwise.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.570
That's the outlines of the eyes.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.550
We then use the same ellipse method to draw the nose,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.540
and then move back to the quadratic curveTo,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.360
to the arc for the mouth.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.910
There's two different arcs that we're going to create.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.905
One is the top top part of the mouth and then we've got the bottom part of the mouth.

00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:19.575
To add some detail onto the tongue,

00:05:19.575 --> 00:05:28.550
we create two more quadraticCurveTos to give the tongue effect inside of the mouth.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.695
Then the next thing I done was create a curve just to the end of

00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:39.765
each section of the mouth, just like that.

00:05:39.765 --> 00:05:43.580
All of these items have the stroke effect,

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.875
so we add the stroke, just at the bottom of all these.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:50.975
Then we need to begin a new path,

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:54.320
and the reason we need to do that is because all of the elements from

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.190
here have a fill rather than a stroke.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.000
First of all, we've got the left eye,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.040
and again we use the ellipse method,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.570
but this time we added a little bit of an angle

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.260
just to create the effect that we're looking for.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.600
We then repeated on the right-hand side for the right eye,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.065
and then drew these all to the Canvas with the film method at the very end.

00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:32.760
Then lastly, we added some text to the very end just with the words of Mickey Mouse,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.165
and we added some basic alignments and also some fonts and color fills.

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:43.190
That's how I create my Mickey Mouse face and

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.550
remember number there's no right or wrong way of doing this.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.725
Everyone takes different approaches,

00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:53.425
but the main thing is you manage to draw something which resembles Mickey Mouse.

00:06:53.425 --> 00:06:56.220
That's it for the end of this project.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.395
Please do share what you've created.

00:06:58.395 --> 00:07:01.450
Thanks for watching and bye for now.
