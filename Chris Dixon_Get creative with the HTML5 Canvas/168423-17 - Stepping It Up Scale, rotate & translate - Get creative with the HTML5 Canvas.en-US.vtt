00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.270
Welcome back everybody. Let's begin with creating in our new pen for this video,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.509
which is called scale, rotate and translate.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:21.250
So let's just change the title to be scale, rotate and translate.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.215
Then let's create our skeleton template.

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:31.820
To reuse will give the function,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.990
the two variables and all the rest can be deleted.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.275
There we go. So this video is all about applying transformations to our Canvas drawings.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:50.980
In this video, we'll be looking at scaling, rotating, and translating.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.809
So first, we want to begin by creating a simple rectangle to manipulate.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.890
So let us draw a rectangle with a fill style.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.940
I'm going to make mine purple.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.090
Then draw to the Canvas with fillRect.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.120
So the top left-hand corner is 0, 0,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.900
300 in the x and 200 on the y.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.430
So just a simple filled rectangle.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.045
I'm going to begin by adding the translate method,

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:38.815
and this moves the reference points of x and y to a different location.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:43.660
So let's add ctx to our translate.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.464
It takes in two parameters,

00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:50.735
which is the x value to begin with.

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.400
Let's add y value of 100.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.855
So we can see what that just did.

00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:59.555
We've translated the reference points,

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:01.325
which was originally 0,

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:03.760
0 in the top corner.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.660
Then we've moved the reference point to be 100 across and 100 down on the y axis.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.510
We can also rotate our triangle or rotate our drawing by using the rotate method.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.980
By using rotate, the default value,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.700
which we're at, is in radians rather than degrees.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.860
So to convert to degrees,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.875
we need to multiply the degrees by maf.pi divided by 180.

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.740
Same value that we had at the start,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.235
such as 45, will then be in degrees.

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.970
This will rotate the rectangle by 45 degrees.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.960
We just got to be careful when using translate and rotate both together.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.420
We need to add translate first.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.515
Because if we don't, the rotation points is the Canvas origin,

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:01.715
which is the top left-hand corner.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:05.890
So just make sure these two are applied in the correct order.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.170
So I'm just going to comment out

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.090
the rotation and I'm going to move on to scaling our drawings.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.190
So you can scale them to be larger or smaller.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.005
To do this, I'm just going to create one more rectangle.

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:25.640
So I'll just copy this section and then paste the second triangle in.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.305
So the fill style, I'm going to set mine to orange.

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:34.190
Then to move it away, we'll add a translate.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.050
So the x of 100 and the y value of 300.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.550
So we got the two rectangles drawn to the screen with different translates locations.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.900
We're going to use the scale method to apply some scaling to the second rectangle.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.310
So we use the ctx.scalemethod.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.330
This takes in two parameters.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.890
So the width and the height.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.160
So if we wanted to scale the drawing to be half its current size,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.640
or 50 percent, would use 0.5 on x and y.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.640
This makes our rectangle half the size it was before.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.530
Of course, one would be 100 percent it's original size.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.645
If we wanted to make it twice the size,

00:04:33.645 --> 00:04:38.910
we could change this to be two or 1.5,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.780
to be 150 percent and so on.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.595
Such a basic look at applying transformations.

00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:53.870
In the next video, we'll build upon what we've looked at in

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.130
this video by looking at how to use both the transform method,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.620
onset transform. So we'll see you there.
