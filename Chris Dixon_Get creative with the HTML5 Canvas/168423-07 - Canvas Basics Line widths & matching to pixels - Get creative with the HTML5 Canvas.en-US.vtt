00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.625
I'm going to show you how to change the width of the line,

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.350
or the lines thickness.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.915
I'm also going to take a look at the important concept of much into pixels.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.960
To begin, we'll just fork the last video,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.550
which was lines and paths.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.950
Then once that's done, we'll change the name.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.580
Line widths & matching to pixels,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.260
I'm just going to copy that,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.000
and paste that in the title, just like that.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.485
Then we could remove some of the unnecessary parts of the script that we don't need.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.480
For this video, we don't need the original square,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.480
so I'll delete the first section.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.930
We can also remove the first triangle.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.590
We'll leave the third triangle,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.645
but we'll just remove the line dashes.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.135
So remove the set line, dashed line,

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.510
the variable, and also the console log.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.935
Then we're good to go. Save that.

00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:24.025
We should just be left with a outline of the red triangle.

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:27.150
It's changed the width of a stroke line,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.270
it's pretty straightforward to do.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.220
We need to use ctx, the method we use is LineWidth.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.445
I'm going to set a value,

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:43.745
let's say to a initial value of one,

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.225
and see what happens.

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:52.050
We don't get any differences, so let's try increase this to 10, and see what happens.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.255
We also get a much bigger line,

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:57.240
or a much wider line, than we had before.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.860
We'll make it even more visible,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.960
so let's increases to 26.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.930
That's pretty much, all we need to do to change the width of the line.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.805
It really is that straightforward.

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:09.830
But one more important concept,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.215
which is a little bit more tricky to grasp,

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.695
is much into pixels.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:17.525
Sometimes we don't much to pixels correctly,

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:19.535
we can end up with blurry lines.

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.010
Just to show you an example,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.640
I'm going to copy this triangle we just used,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.420
and then paste in a second triangle.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.105
But this time we're going to change the LineWidth to be a odd value of 25.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:41.570
Just to offset the triangle so we can see the difference,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.640
change all the 40s to 80s,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.480
and all the values of 230 to be 270.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.410
Then save that. Now we've got to offset triangles.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.335
One has a width of 26 pixels,

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:06.270
and one is 25.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.075
Just to show you what I mean,

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:10.280
I'm just going to zoom in,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.170
in the browser, and I hope you can see this at home.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.285
If not, it should be a little bit more easy to see on your own computer.

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:23.150
The second triangle which we just created,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.445
has a blurry outline.

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:29.305
The first one, we've drawn has a sharp crisp outline.

00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:32.530
Let's take a look at why this is.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.100
To help you understand exactly why this is happening,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.055
I'd like to take a look at the two examples.

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:42.635
The first one on the left-hand side,

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:45.515
is a straightforward Canvas grid,

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.500
with a green line,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.910
the green line is one pixel wide.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.265
This is drawn on the x-axis, seven pixels across.

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:58.975
The red line indicates the center of the line.

00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:03.465
Starting from zero, if we go across seven pixels,

00:04:03.465 --> 00:04:08.095
were taken right to the center of the green line which we've drawn.

00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:11.600
Because the green line is only one pixel wide,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.200
the Canvas draws it half a pixel to the left,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.375
and then half a pixel to the right.

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.695
As you can see, this doesn't fill a whole pixel,

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:24.360
if we look at the square grids on the background.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.480
Then what happens is the canvas then draws or fills in,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.235
the rest of the pixel with a partial shade.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:37.750
This is the blurred effect that you can see on the previous example.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.510
All we need to do to make the line much the pixel,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.360
is take a look at the example on the right.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.705
Rather than the starting position to be at seven,

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:50.495
we change it to be 6.5.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:54.730
Vertically the center line is halfway between pixel,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.030
and this then causes the line width to take up the full size of the pixel,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.045
and therefore, no extra shading like this example is needed.

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:06.475
Therefore we have sharp lines,

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:09.420
no blurred effect on the outside.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.725
Such a something I wanted you guys to think about,

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:16.860
and to be aware of, when drawing lines or shapes on the Canvas.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.620
Thank you and bye for now.
