00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.520
This video is all about using pattern and shadows with the canvas.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.380
We're going to begin with patterns,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.740
and for this example I'm going to add an image.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.755
This image is going to be a seamless tile,

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:17.955
which means we can repeat the tile horizontally and vertically,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:20.175
and it will all blend into one.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:25.665
I've created a new CodePen with the title of Patterns & Shadows.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.550
I've changed the canvas width to be a little bit larger,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.505
which is 1,000 by 1,000.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:38.250
This is because the tile which I'm going to be using is 640 pixels,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.340
this just gives you a little bit more room to repeat the tile.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.925
If keep the function,

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:48.115
the onload function from the last video,

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.085
the canvas variable, the context variable.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:55.640
I will also reuse this image variable that we used in the last video.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.480
To begin, I'm just going to head over to

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.895
Pixabay just to grab a image tile for use in this demonstration.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:09.110
I want to do a search for seamless tile,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.690
and then just choose a tile which you like.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.720
I'll go for this one and then I just click on the Free Download.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.230
Ideally we want to download the picture

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.885
and include it into our project folder, I'll link from there.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:28.685
But because we're using CodePen,

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:34.400
unless you've got a PRO account you won't build out these as an asset to actually use.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm just going to for this example,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.940
click on "View", and then select the image address.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.440
Then let's paste this into the image source from the last video.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.725
Now we can use this image to create a pattern,

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.530
and the pattern is declared in a similar way to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.580
the gradients that we looked at a few videos ago.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.960
We're going to stall this inside a pattern variable,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870
a variable of pattern.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.690
I'm going to set this to be ctx.createPattern.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220
Create pattern takes in two parameters.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.445
The first one we're going to add the image which you want to display,

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:27.040
and then the second parameter is the type of repeats that we want to use.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.525
I'm just going to set this to be repeat,

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:33.000
and we'll come back to that in just a moment.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.770
Then next we can set the fillStyle to be equal to the pattern that we just created.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.730
Then lastly, we set the shape that we want to be filled with the pattern,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.835
I'm just going to add a rectangle and keep it the same size as the canvas.

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:59.940
0, 0 and the canvas size is now 1,000 by 1,000.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.635
We can see the image has been displayed,

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:09.465
select your stretch the browser and see all of this.

00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:11.820
The image has been repeated,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.630
it's now filled the full size of the canvas.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.115
We know it's been repeated because Canvas is 1,000 pixels wide,

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:22.040
yet the image is only 640.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.700
We've got repeat just about there,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.090
and this is the start of a new tile.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.335
Let's take a look at some more of the parameters.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:37.930
This was repeat, I can change it to no-repeats and you can probably guess what that does.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.070
This changes the image to only display once at the specified position.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.805
There's also repeats on the x and the y- axis.

00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:58.925
So repeat-x, and this will mean they only repeats across the x-axis,

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:07.720
there should be some white space at the bottom and then let's do the same on the y-axis.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.540
There's the vertical repeats,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.760
and of course you can repeat anything you want,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.270
it doesn't have to be a image.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.360
Next, we want to move on to looking at shadows, and to do that,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.430
I'm just going to change the canvas width box to be 600 by 300.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.455
Then we can remove the pattern example to move all of the image section,

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:41.480
all of the pattern section,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.410
you can also remove the image from the bottom there.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.765
For this shadows example,

00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:54.755
I'm going to draw some text onto the canvas.

00:04:54.755 --> 00:05:00.584
With ctx.font will make it quite large,

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:03.405
we'll make it 80 pixels.

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:07.630
Then a font type of Helvetica,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:15.630
and then a fillStyle to be equal to a color.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.550
I'll make mine green and then the text-align,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.350
let's place in the center of the canvas.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.400
Fine, let's draw the text with fillText.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.510
Hopefully you remember how to do this,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.250
the first parameter is the text that we want to display.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.275
Let's keep it simple,

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:49.500
with text shadows is five this example.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.905
The X and Y position,

00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:58.835
I'm going to create a size of canvas width divided by 2,

00:05:58.835 --> 00:06:01.620
and then the same for the height.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.600
The last parameter was the maximum width,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.635
let's restrict this to be 400 pixels.

00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:13.890
There's text, but we just got a little typo on this,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.765
that needs to be px of course.Okay, great.

00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:20.925
We've got the text on the screen,

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:23.445
we can start to add some shadows.

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:26.895
Let's do this above the text that we just drawn.

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:32.010
The first method we're going to take a look at is shadowOffsetX.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.534
This is a value in pixels,

00:06:38.534 --> 00:06:40.755
let's begin with five.

00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:44.535
This is the shadowOffset on the x-axis,

00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:49.445
and then so that you can see the shadow that we just created let's add a shadow color.

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:54.110
We have ctx.shadowColor, it stands out nicely,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.260
let's change that to be red.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.505
We can see the red shadow,

00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:03.630
which is coming across five pixels on the x-axis.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.095
These values can be positive or negative,

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:09.545
so we'll change this to be negative five.

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:13.270
We should see the text shadow on the opposite side.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.410
We can do the same on the y-axis,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.030
we have a shadowOffsetY.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.210
Let's add a five pixel shadow on the y-axis.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:33.545
As you can see, we can combine the X and the Y to create some nice looking effects.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:40.110
We can also add a blur by using the shadowBlur method,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.055
and it sets the level of the blurred effects.

00:07:47.055 --> 00:07:49.255
The default value is zero,

00:07:49.255 --> 00:07:54.100
we'll set this to be something a little bit larger, it's just 15.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.445
This gives us a nice blurred or a blended effects.

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:01.550
We can increase this to be a little bit larger.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.640
We'll try 30, and that's a little bit more subtle.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.085
Let's change it back to 20.

00:08:08.085 --> 00:08:12.290
Have a little play around with those values and see what you can come up to with,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.910
and I'll see you in the next video.
