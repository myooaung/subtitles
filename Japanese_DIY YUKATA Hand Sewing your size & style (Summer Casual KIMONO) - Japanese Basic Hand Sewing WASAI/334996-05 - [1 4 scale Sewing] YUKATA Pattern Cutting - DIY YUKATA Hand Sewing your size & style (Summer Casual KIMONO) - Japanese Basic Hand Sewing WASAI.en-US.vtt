00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.110
The green one.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.760
It's showing Japanese standard size with the barbaric in quarter skill,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.840

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.800
Those air Western for big,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.900

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.750
their scale.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.850
It's folding in house.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:36.570
The Western Fire Book is almost like a three times wider than Japanese.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:54.360
Standard property even unfold the west on far brick is still wider.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.050
Don't happen.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:14.140

00:01:14.140 --> 00:02:21.490
The first part of to be asleep goes there the shoulders of the prophet.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.190

they see another front and back body together panel.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:52.050
Now we have a 48 layers in four patterns so that over public remaining the fabric,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.580
it's going to be going to make front of strips,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.950
color and the enforcement enforcement color.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:10.540
So we need to measure from the bottom of fold to the next layer of the bottom that is going

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.870
to be Okamitsu body.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.390
Then we gonna fold it last a year.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.730
Nokomis Zachary.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:26.520
It's indicated and d five on your sheet so women is fixed number that is 20 cents medal and

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.270
four men is depends on around the hip sides.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.250
So whatever the measurement you have,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.550
and please measure from the bottom off the body pattern to the last year off the bottom.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:55.440
Now you have a proper X layer that's two sleeves and two bodies and one last layer for

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.060
three patterns off color playing Forsman,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.570
cholera and the front strips once again,

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.450
Oh,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.150
commie surgery is indicated and D five on your sheet so women is fixed.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.930
Number that is 20 cents medal and four men is depends on around the hip sides.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.910
So whatever the measurement you have,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.150
and please measure from the bottom off the body pattern to the last layer off the bottom.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.390
Now are you going to cut the right hand side of the full?

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.770
But it you,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.460
lefty,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.110
you can flip to the left side and you can going to cut on the left.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.870
I am showing to cut on camera because that's why I'm picking up the far break close to the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.420
camera.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.310
But you don't have to do,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.510
and you can lay down all the layers on the table.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:09.570
They cut on the full point after you can't precisely you May.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:38.870
You have two sleeves and to body panels in that piece,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.380
off the layer you cut.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.920
It's going to be for front strips,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.550
color and the reinforcement color,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:57.700
so you need order to get the four patterns you need to on a folding horizontally.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:07.250
You need Teoh fold in half.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.800
Precisely.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.550
Please make sure you got the same weight all the way from the bottom to the top.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:27.070
So folding like origami,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.550
you can use Neil Fingernail to market on the center line.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.570
Or you need to irony.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.520
You can use the irony to make it precise.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:58.190
Half cut line after you marked 1/2 the folding line on the center in the center.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:05.950
Now you can cut in the middle from the bottom to all the way to the top.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:36.550
The last piece of the pattern you cut in

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.050
half.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:45.970
One of them is going to be a French strips holding in house particle and cutting,

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.260

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:53.780
Those are going to be your front strips,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:08:05.710
the last piece going to be your color and rain sportsman cover.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:19.680
Now you have a whole a patterns of the yukata,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.050
