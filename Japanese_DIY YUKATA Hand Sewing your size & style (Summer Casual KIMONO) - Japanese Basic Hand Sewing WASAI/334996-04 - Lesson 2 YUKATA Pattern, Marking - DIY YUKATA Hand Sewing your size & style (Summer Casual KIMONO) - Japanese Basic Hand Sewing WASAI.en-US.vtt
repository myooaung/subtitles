00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
so tonight and we're gonna go over the three things.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.510
One is like a live you for the body measurement.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.700
And then Oh,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.480
everything is like this soul,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.180
like documents I can give you later tonight,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.990
just through the paper to existing,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.700
because the more information I think the students,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.050
it's coming here.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.120
Maybe So what?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.100
What do we measure last time?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.380
It's a three area that's very key.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.500
14 around your hips,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.220
then also,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.750
Yuki is like from this is the born that the base off.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.610
These are there,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.890
Nick.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.860
Then what do you call this?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.050
Born here with the wrist people?

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.420
I think we have some definite you wanna bring,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.890
isn't it?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.120
Could wish you then I want Could've issue.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.380
But English doesn't have a word for that,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.750
right?

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.400
That's a risk.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.400
They also the your height Men's would be no have over a story.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.920
So and you just used their height And,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.960
uh so we have a more so I'm gonna go in detail because this is a little bit complicated,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
but you don't understand this all the measurement.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.050
It's gonna be really tough to cut your size,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:34.110
so I'll do it so and you over the Enter your heights,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.860
right?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.850
Heights and around your hip.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.890
Oh,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.650
she's gonna print bring out for the male size because male and female is slightly different

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.650
.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.420
Okay,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.230
I'll quickly explain.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.600
This is like a woman,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.880
and the woman always has actually expected.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.220
So that's why woman scatter is the from here to there is,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:05.180
like a heights things but men's measuring from here do the on the edge of the not on the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.730
floor.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.130
Do you see the bone over New?

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.970
Yeah,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.780
from here.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.360
So that's the lesson women is from from here to here.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.950
The legs off the kimono to the ankle.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.010
Because when they wearing,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.820
so they use the vehicle hostility.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.420
That kind of hold it,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.970
then make it nice.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.980
So that's why they need more length already.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.550
But a man,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.510
don't you?

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.430
Are you gonna make him for male human?

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.950
You got that?

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.140
Or do you have a tape measurement?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:51.050
Please measure your size for the you see the yellow part and can you measure?

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.900
Hi.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.930
So we're doing the measurements.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.850
So because we did the body measurement last time,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.020
so I wanted to make sure we got the right number.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.150
So the next step is Yeah,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.880
from the face off the neck,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.980
then wrist.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.270
And while I was explaining in the cutting area recording audio,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.450
what got the really bad sound?

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.120
So I'm going to re record as a boys over Let's leave you the three important body

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.000
measurement for cutting your yukata pattern heights for women,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.730
body lengths for men and around your hip.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.280
And Yuki Yuki is the measurement from base of the neck to the wrist.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.030
The body things for men is from based on the next to the uncle.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.300
Those three important body measurement you got collectively than entered in the yellow area

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.300
.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.200
The Googles she that you copy from the link you found on the class project important

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.630
lengths off the pattern is,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.290
or America we calculated after you enter the important three body measurements in the euro

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.920
areas.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.540
Let's lay down.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:15.340
You got that pattern I would be using this quarter scale off the Japanese fabric size off

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.450
the yukata pattern.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:24.500
Marcus Sport near the EDS off the fabric where the 23 ends overlap.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.590
This will be the starting point for the sleeps.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.350
Please take a look at the measurements for fabric cuttings,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.460
so d to be cuts leavings,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.150
and please measure the cut scribblings on the fabric unfolding half.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.710
Then you repeat the one more time than now you have two sleeves,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.950
and he would like to longer or shorter asleep.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.250
Adjust the measurement accordingly.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.950
I was mentioned in the class and standard.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.670
Steve Blank's between 38 cents middle to 60 cents.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:07.780
Middle Standard sleeve length is 1/3 off your heights for women in 1/3 of your body lengths

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.670
for men,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.540
but you can adjust the measurement accordingly by age or your preference at the sleeve

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:24.400
lengths mark fall the boasts layers off fabric over so that you now and fully is at the

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.050
point where the apple two layers meets a straight monk.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.650
Pull them back one again,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.210
once again,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.130
full them back.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.720
Once again,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.200
you have a full layers off sleeps.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.630
So next things is the body panel.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.820
So please take a look at the cut body links,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.490
then measured about this measure.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:56.110
The car body lengths located on the sea number is de four four khat bah dealings,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:03.350
So please take a look at the measuring measurement for public cutting and D four pat body

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.800
links.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.910
The forewoman is indicated 334 cents medal and the quarter scale is 83.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.550
Sentiment.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.430
83.5 cents.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.880
Medal.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.080
So not section is indicated.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.470
The half size off the measurement,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.990
Sir,

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.410
please measure the half sides off their heart measurement off the car body Ling's,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.730
then make a fold,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.750
then coming back to the starting point.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:35.670
Some measure your cut body links from the starting point and measure your major you half of

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.180
the cut body things located under the note.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.460
If you doing the quarter scale and please take the quarter scale of the measurement from

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.740
the starting point and fold the fabric once again.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.250
Now you it's giving you a total layers.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.670
At this point,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.300
the bottom full they years of the sleeves and the top full layers are the body at the

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.250
starting point for the fabric back one time that one last time.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.870
Whatever fabric remains will be used to make this run steps color and colorless.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.280
What lay enforcement stripped previous measure?

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.320
Okamitsu Zachary.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.580
They're located on the sheet number D five before women is 20 cents medal,

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.850
that is fixed number,

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.650
and please measure the 20 cents medal from the folding point,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.150
then make a last last one day years and folding half,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.960
then coming back to the starting point for men's Okun.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:40.120
Surgery is also located in thes five from shoulder to tip off the front stoop.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.870
That that is open is a very is that depends on the hip size,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.150
hip around hip sides.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.750
If this is there is still for Rick.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.560
Correct over.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.690
After these miscellaneous piece A cut out.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.890
Cut the fabric whenever it's touched.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.450
Study Study Mark.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.900
You will have to sleeve panels to body panels and a one miscellaneous panel.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.760
So Hugh started the far back from the right hand sign.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.850
The car in park is only right hand side.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.390
Hugh Lefty,

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.450
If you started from the left,

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.810
cut on the left hand side.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:28.370
Please do not cut the Diatta side off the fabric folding in this class.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.260
All the students wants to do the Japanese fabric cutting.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.950
So we didn't go through the western fabric cutting this time.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:42.680
But I'm going to create a different coasts in showing how to cut using western fabric,

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.590
which is wider for Rick to cut.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.480
You cut the pattern,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.890
so please take another class too.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.140
Learn how to cut the pattern from the Western problem.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:09:13.190
You wait,

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.000
okay?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.800
And also get people make you already
