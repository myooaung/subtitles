00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
in this video,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:09.290
I am going to show you how I attached the color on women's yukata.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.580
Eddie is a color.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:22.850
I really pin at the mark of color first,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:40.650
then transferred a pin with body together.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.720
The first pain.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.250
It's going to be a center back,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.430
the seam of the winds.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.100
So to be one centimeter quarter off the sides,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.940
or to be 2.5 million major second big,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.850
it's going to be four cents mirror from the sent that back.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.650
So this case would be one since Mineral.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.150
It's almost like going between sent that back to the color opening.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.810
The third pain should be a sense mirror from the lump second pin and four Spain would be

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.210
0.3 cents matter from the current cut opening.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.770
But I'm not using that for a spin on this quarter size.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.470
The fifth ping.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.210
It's going to be hot way off the second on the force,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.220
then six peen.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.350
It's going to be 10 cents medal from the tip off the front strip,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:04.180
the seven spin would be highway off third and six,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.150
and a spitting at the tip off the front strip.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.050
The nice being at the edge off the under color hem line.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.450
The intense would be five cents middle from nine spinning.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.980
The evidence is going to be highway between 10 and eight,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.210
then 12 Ping will be halfway off Elevens and Ace,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.690
then third thirties pain here to be halfway off 10.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.470
And it happened.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.650
But I want you.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.050
I didn't use the thirteen's pin.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.880
That's how you pin before you saw the color.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.810
Then I repeat the same way off how I pain on the other side off the color.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:25.900
I'm going to start sewing from four cents mirror from the edge that when I at the edge do

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.720
the one scoop and make a loop not or just one backstage.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.520
Then I am going to running stitch until the a committee point when I reached the or

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.730
committee point,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.590
I'll do choose back stitches,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.600
Then keep doing running stitches until at the corner,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.350
off the color opening one.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:17.390
Oh,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:47.460
Uh huh

00:04:47.460 --> 00:05:17.150
Um uh

00:05:17.150 --> 00:06:43.210
uh uh uh uh
