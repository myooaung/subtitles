00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Hello everyone, thanks for joining DIY.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.349
You cut that workshop Q and a session.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:14.460
So few probably registered one of my classes,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.554
either Skill Share or Udemy and tablet.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:20.790
Tablet website.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.010
And suitable.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.710
Thank you so much for joining DIY.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.155
You cut a workshop with UK ego.

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:32.940
And this is being very popular class and I'm really happy

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.954
to have over 250 students as of today and since dust.

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:43.534
So thank you so much for submitting your question.

00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm really happy to answer all your questions tonight.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.890
So one of the question is very common and I've been asking for a lot of students,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.434
how many years do I need for the Jakarta project?

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:06.169
How many years do I need it for my Jakarta project?

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:11.749
So the Japanese fabric and Western fabric with a difference,

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:16.534
looks like almost as I showed in a class video.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:20.609
It's twice as much or maybe even more.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.124
You know, the difference between Japanese fabric and Western probe.

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:29.629
So we're staffed fabric is the right-hand side and

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:33.389
Japanese fabric is best left hand side.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.305
So the Japanese TOM mano,

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.475
it's like a one roll,

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:41.990
is always comes in between thirty-seven cents middle,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.770
between, between 37 to 41.7 centimeter.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.779
But a Western fabric,

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:52.370
which is government fabric,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.930
is normally comes in between 44 inches to 60 inches.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.000
That is 111, $0.252 mirror.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.220
That's why students get confused or don't know how

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.855
many yardage OR harmony meter they need to get.

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:15.290
So if you buy Japanese eukaryota,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.154
keep Japanese Jakarta fabric.

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:21.005
It's comes in one row.

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.769
Sameness showed they can sell half role.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.499
I had heard that they're selling half role,

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:33.124
but I don't recall golf croissant,

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:39.634
kimono fabric store selling half yard of the Jakarta fabric.

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:43.025
But these days there's a lot of things is changed.

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:47.179
And kimono fabric store is having hard time.

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:52.220
So maybe they sell by the yardage as well.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.970
But I'm not sure and I don't know.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.275
Sorry about that.

00:02:57.275 --> 00:03:01.220
So it's normally when you buy you gotta fabric is,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.804
comes in the role which is 12 meter.

00:03:04.804 --> 00:03:08.764
Maybe they started to have a longer,

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:14.704
like 14 or 15 role because for the tall people.

00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:19.264
But a standard side length is 12 meter,

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:24.619
which is 13 years, and 4.4 inches.

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:30.260
So in order to get western fabric,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.254
like a width would be between 44 inches to 60 inches.

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:39.274
You need to get 6.6 years,

00:03:39.274 --> 00:03:40.924
which is six meter.

00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:43.350
And for since middle.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.869
That's my answers.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.430
So you need to get up.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.679
Sorry, that's the mistyped yard.

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.185
I don't think I need a over here.

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:56.839
So x plus signs,

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.069
you may need more,

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.634
more according to your heap size.

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:02.809
And if tall size,

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:06.420
you may need more according to your height.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.234
So because everybody has a different type of body shape.

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:18.055
So please make sure to take your measurement collectively,

00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:21.400
like only four places you need to take a measurement.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.849
So if your boss is bigger than hip,

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.569
so I think you need to follow the burst size.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.989
So it's normally taking pore sizes hip to be around the hip

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:47.710
then is this this arrow is kinda long because the width,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.805
not including Akami with a hip width is

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:59.970
equal to your body with a body panel width.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.384
And Titicaca, which is height.

00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:08.479
Would it be like a body length?

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.190
That will be the chemo.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.689
I mean, you gotta links.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.230
But women shouldn't be longer because women has a history.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.399
It's like a kinda tackling under the OB.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:29.010
So you gotta lens 3dB, you're high.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.209
This is a Japanese standard size and premade eukaryota is you

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.980
go to Japan or a Hugo to Japanese kimono store.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.230
The you normally find

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:51.280
this size of the Jakarta if you go to a unique role and they provide,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.229
I think they provide three different sizes.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:06.864
The reason why I create this class is because if you buy premade Jakarta, an American,

00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:08.830
or a foreigner, I mean,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.040
non-Asian people is much taller than regular Japanese people.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.534
And the little bit thick body,

00:06:19.534 --> 00:06:24.244
not really thin as a Japanese girl.

00:06:24.244 --> 00:06:27.845
So it's tend to get too short.

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:30.949
This is called mythically in Japanese.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.519
Short lengths or two short sleeves.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.765
And the width would be to narrow.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:43.280
Those type of problem is always happened.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.099
That's why I create

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:53.345
this class to available students do make their own size of your carta.

00:06:53.345 --> 00:06:56.960
Especially the people who do cosplay if they

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.530
wanted to use Western fabric to me, your card.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.480
And also they may use different type of fabric to looks

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:12.539
like some of the character wearing kimono or Jakarta.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.995
But my first staccato classes very traditional

00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:21.640
and I won't go to the kind of mickey costume design.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:30.384
But maybe in a future I may have Carter Glass for cosplay people.

00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:33.295
So second question is,

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:38.209
where can I get nice fabric for my Jakarta project?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.860
But a nice means,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.780
this depends on the person's taste and style.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.369
Doesn't have to be good-quality or maybe good pattern or

00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:58.319
nice scholar and nice style on the steps of style is depends on a person's preference.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.449
But since I moved to United States 1934 and I don't,

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:10.055
I'm not really familiar with the store in Japan anymore.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:16.940
Because this class is focusing on using Western fabric.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.115
I always recommend to these two companies,

00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:25.430
corner Bay fabrics and Robert Kaufman fabrics.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:32.180
They have a really good sense of style and color of Japanese print.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:38.524
So I think they don't sell the fabric from

00:08:38.524 --> 00:08:44.404
their own website because they their business style is B2B, I think.

00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:49.730
But I'm not sure it's been has been changed because in a pandemic is happening,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:55.025
economy kind of garment industry is suffering everyone.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:09:01.879
So you can try a hue like and if you have a company in the UK and buy

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:09.260
from them that you can get the half breath I think issue by other company.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.500
But of course, there are the minimum order.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.370
And I think you need to get by one role.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:24.950
But around I'm not sure the one round role would be ten not ten years,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.554
15 years, I think.

00:09:26.554 --> 00:09:30.569
I think 15 years or 20 years with one road.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.404
Yeah. If you need 15 years a little bit too much,

00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:36.469
maybe you can make two.

00:09:36.469 --> 00:09:42.875
You got that. But I'm not sure what role is the minimum order.

00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:48.154
Maybe two or three row is minimum order than there will be a different story.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:53.345
So any Hubei as a B2C business to consumer,

00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:59.939
you can find these two companies fabric on eBay or Etsy.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.909
Then you type being cornered a barbaric.

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:24.039
It's going to come to a different type of pattern.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.870
So maybe you could say.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.030
And it too.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.184
Very nice.

00:11:47.184 --> 00:11:49.554
It's like a very traditional,

00:11:49.554 --> 00:11:50.619
This one is also,

00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:54.260
but it looks like a candle.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.290
Chemo.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.550
Okay.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.920
Those two companies I recommended,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.129
but

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.419
that's

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:17.185
the company based in now.

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:18.760
None not going aij.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:26.369
Aij prefecture, this ship fabric to United States.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.165
But I think that English is everything,

00:12:32.165 --> 00:12:39.109
ceremonies or expected.

00:12:39.109 --> 00:12:40.759
These are very traditional.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:43.399
Japanese mono birth, it's really nice.

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:52.025
12 of these studies is Decker customer order.

00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:54.815
So you send your sides.

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:59.730
They're going to they're going to make one for you.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.089
For what weight of the fabric,

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:10.940
what radio, the cotton or linen.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.195
To get four Jakarta.

00:13:14.195 --> 00:13:19.009
For audience, The way at four answer would be that good science.

00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:24.725
Maybe six or eight on so deeply too heavy and too aunts,

00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:27.710
would it be too thin?

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:34.535
Maybe kinda semi-serious r2 if you use the two ons fabric.

00:13:34.535 --> 00:13:37.250
But if you're willing to,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.550
for women a year wearing underneath under chemo.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.244
So you, if you don't mind to see through your under kimono and you can.

00:13:45.244 --> 00:13:46.460
Two arms as well,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.395
but also to be too soft,

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:51.845
it's not gonna structure of your sleep.

00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:59.195
But it sounds sort of interesting looking and you can use to ons cotton fabric as well.

00:13:59.195 --> 00:14:01.250
But if you making,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:07.040
you gotta first-time, parents use the forums first.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.684
Then if you get used to a new human,

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:15.815
make something different, you can use it to on so a different type of fabric.

00:14:15.815 --> 00:14:20.435
Because he here not using natural fiber,

00:14:20.435 --> 00:14:23.210
which is the use of synthetic,

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.049
especially nylon, polyester or acetate.

00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:33.630
We really hot when you wearing outside and under the sun.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.980
So as you learn from my class,

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:45.424
you already know what harmony patterns to make the eukaryota,

00:14:45.424 --> 00:14:46.744
there's a very simple,

00:14:46.744 --> 00:14:48.740
everything is straight cut.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:54.244
So only eight pieces to make eukaryota.

00:14:54.244 --> 00:14:56.224
And most of them,

00:14:56.224 --> 00:14:57.980
it's kind of duplicate.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:04.100
So you just make only five patterns,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.560
nor even patterns is cut.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:15.054
So this is the kind of mistake uses the line between B and C,

00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:16.450
It's deck a cut line,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.279
but that shouldn't be like this.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:24.204
So don't make a mistake to cut in between or sleep or body.

00:15:24.204 --> 00:15:31.419
So this shouldn't be like this and the dots indicated by folding line.

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:36.265
But adults in Jakarta doesn't mean that the folding line,

00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:40.615
this is just showing the harmony length.

00:15:40.615 --> 00:15:44.334
How much length, how many events of just you got.

00:15:44.334 --> 00:15:47.049
This one is showing four feet in nine inches

00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:52.159
length and to feed in one inches links obviously.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.439
But please don't worry about the number.

00:15:56.439 --> 00:16:00.160
This is not a I won't say accurate disease number for

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.060
some specific size may not be your size.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.405
So when you're cutting,

00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:10.520
you cut up fabric.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.649
It's certain way to fold as you learn the lesson.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.234
Then when you fold nicely and the only one side,

00:16:21.234 --> 00:16:23.800
you can cut their case.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:29.904
You not gonna make a mistake because he he cut both side.

00:16:29.904 --> 00:16:37.865
That's what I did when I make the better for us time. That's a long time ago.

00:16:37.865 --> 00:16:41.225
So that would be the mistake.

00:16:41.225 --> 00:16:46.235
But just only only once and one side,

00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:47.974
which is righthand side.

00:16:47.974 --> 00:16:49.160
But if you're a lefty,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.240
you can flip to cut on the left side.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.599
You already know you learn in the class.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:07.849
So next question is how to self measure my body or how to measure myself?

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:08.930
Or you got that?

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:17.089
This is really good question because during the quarantine or shelter in

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:22.384
Place. You don't have anyone to measure your body.

00:17:22.384 --> 00:17:29.759
And even though you have someone and someone doesn't know how to take a measurement.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.334
This is great to know,

00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:42.030
and I am going to show you how you can do that at home by yourself.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:51.170
So making your Carter is only for area you need to measure that you learn in the class.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.390
So this is showing men's version,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.400
but a man and a woman is balsa,

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.430
same area to take a measurement.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.519
So maybe I should eliminate S,

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:07.490
high AND body lang,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:16.349
hip and width from center backup backbone at the base of the neck to wrist bone.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:28.160
So that's called the yuki is from center back of the born to wrist, born.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.739
So easiest way is if you have a tape measurement and you're going to

00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:41.809
hold left hand on the center Back to hold them.

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:44.990
It goes around your arm.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.759
Then you can hold the data side of the tape measurement and right hand side

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:54.485
and kind of make a little angle because if you make a stray is maybe too short.

00:18:54.485 --> 00:18:58.219
Like it's kind of similar to do the Taylor measurement.

00:18:58.219 --> 00:18:59.914
And so it kind of humic,

00:18:59.914 --> 00:19:01.579
may at least 40,

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:04.639
doesn't have to be 90 degree angle,

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:07.770
at least 45 degree angle.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:13.889
Or I will say the other way around 45.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.345
The other side of the angle.

00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:24.124
135 angles.

00:19:24.124 --> 00:19:28.970
I'm going to show you in a video very soon.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.030
That's how you take a measurement.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.739
It's not to be so difficult.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:44.690
So I'll do you know that you cut a sleeve is little shorter,

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.700
books one inches shorter than regular sleep.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.645
So I do see the picture in the yellow sleep is like a garment. Sure.

00:19:53.645 --> 00:19:56.030
It's covering your response.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.634
But you cut the sleeve is showing your wrist bone.

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.345
So that's why, you know,

00:20:02.345 --> 00:20:04.800
please don't worry about

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:12.709
do you think that too short or too short mean this is not too sure.

00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:15.349
Sometimes people think that this is to show,

00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:18.589
because showing the risk borne by the,

00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:21.724
this is the right size.

00:20:21.724 --> 00:20:29.525
To make the Jakarta both mens and would target,

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:33.510
which is the length of Uganda.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:42.480
So as kids and you know how to measure your height.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.880
Using maybe wall or you already know your height,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.679
that will be easy.

00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:58.265
You just take a measurement of your head from back of the neck to the top of your head.

00:20:58.265 --> 00:21:04.670
And also the your heel with you have a born and the ankle bone.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:09.680
So ankle bone to floor, take a measurement.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.700
You just distract from your height.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.549
So height is a 168 sentimental.

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:22.399
And you substruct?

00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:25.174
Yes, I'm sorry, substruct to your head.

00:21:25.174 --> 00:21:26.270
Hi.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.699
It's $0.30 metal.

00:21:28.699 --> 00:21:31.655
Then your heel height going to be eight centimeter.

00:21:31.655 --> 00:21:38.369
Your Keita comes out a $0.130 metal.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:48.530
That's another way to take a MSM and then tack a little bit different.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.324
Depends on how you want to wear.

00:21:52.324 --> 00:21:58.084
So he went to where it just showing uncle born.

00:21:58.084 --> 00:22:00.410
And it's like on left-hand side.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.625
And you can use the formula I just showed you.

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:07.154
But if you wanted to,

00:22:07.154 --> 00:22:11.844
where are the shorter or make the shorter you cut?

00:22:11.844 --> 00:22:21.830
And you can substruct more sense middle to make it this looks.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.335
But even though you make the cut there,

00:22:26.335 --> 00:22:28.869
like on left-hand side lens,

00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:34.495
you can also make it look like shorter.

00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:37.704
Make, make the shorter.

00:22:37.704 --> 00:22:42.535
You gotta lengths as you see on the right hand side.

00:22:42.535 --> 00:22:45.085
So that's another way.

00:22:45.085 --> 00:22:49.845
Just you adjust and tackling under your OB.

00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:53.689
Think you can still wear like a shoulder.

00:22:53.689 --> 00:22:58.249
You gotta neglected side.

00:22:58.249 --> 00:23:08.075
So I'm going to show you when I click Create the eukaryota styling class in detail.

00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:11.855
Maybe I'm making video and

00:23:11.855 --> 00:23:17.930
more fixture and illustration to show you how you can make this shorter.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.179
So don't worry about it.

00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:28.130
Just use a regular jacket unless you make you really short lengths of the cup.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.265
So next question is,

00:23:31.265 --> 00:23:34.189
it is hard to move in Jakarta.

00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:35.030
Smith?

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.364
Yes, it is.

00:23:36.364 --> 00:23:39.169
And is there any way to fix that?

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:44.015
So most of the people normally willing that Western

00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:50.435
clothing and pants or shorts when you where you cut,

00:23:50.435 --> 00:23:53.225
it's kinda hard to move around.

00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:57.544
But the ECU coating,

00:23:57.544 --> 00:24:04.445
you are Cremona or you cut it on too tight or wrong way.

00:24:04.445 --> 00:24:12.290
It's, that's also cause the tightness and harder to lose.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.240
In a eukaryotes Muslim.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.920
So that's one way you can fix it.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.864
This is how to make the UK either like a procedure.

00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:29.814
So please pay attention on the third picture.

00:24:29.814 --> 00:24:33.310
On top, top things just over here.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:42.564
Third picture can pointer finger to follow.

00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:46.999
That says, okay, third picture, this one.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.900
So this is enlargement.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.185
When you put a eukaryota on body,

00:24:53.185 --> 00:24:57.769
bringing the right side to your left hip.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:04.789
If the edge of the panel that's

00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:12.290
beyond your left hip bone is really be too tight to move.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.860
I know it's little harder to imagine.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:25.474
But I'm going to show in the video when I make the data,

00:25:25.474 --> 00:25:31.954
how to, when I create the class of how to where you cut.

00:25:31.954 --> 00:25:36.469
But I am going to repeat it when you put a Jakarta on your body bringing

00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:41.749
the right sign to your left hip?

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:46.849
If the edge of the panel that's beyond here,

00:25:46.849 --> 00:25:52.370
left hip bone, it would be too tight.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.500
So here is the trick.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:03.739
Fold. This per Becker only for the edge of the panel,

00:26:03.739 --> 00:26:08.509
approximately seven to $0.15 metal

00:26:08.509 --> 00:26:14.940
to the left that the Aloe Aloe indicate to the hardware you are going to fall there.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:21.419
So if you fall there the different direction.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:29.464
Then put the layer over the left side of the Jakarta panel,

00:26:29.464 --> 00:26:34.415
which is where my to your right hip bone.

00:26:34.415 --> 00:26:39.050
So that Js you have a more room in here.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:48.060
Then it's kinda, it's much better to move your neck around inside of the eukaryota.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.139
That's the little trick.

00:26:51.139 --> 00:26:53.090
And as I said,

00:26:53.090 --> 00:27:00.990
I will explain in detail when I create a class of how to where you got.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.855
So next question is my arms are thick and mass growing and should I make my whole bigger?

00:27:08.855 --> 00:27:12.020
The answer is no.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:19.505
Because as you see the small restaurant, he also wearing,

00:27:19.505 --> 00:27:22.820
he didn't adjust the size of

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:28.069
the arm hole because man's arm hole is much bigger than woman's arm hole.

00:27:28.069 --> 00:27:31.820
The Women's Hall, which is sorted scale is fixed,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.130
number is $0.23 metal,

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.270
but a man's, Is it men's doesn't have a fixed number,

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.714
but when you calculate it, this is a 100.

00:27:40.714 --> 00:27:43.775
18th century marrow height.

00:27:43.775 --> 00:27:45.230
Dance number.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:51.635
I think the 41.75 is normally comes out 4242.

00:27:51.635 --> 00:27:53.420
The formula is high.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.649
Now I have to eliminate S height by

00:27:57.649 --> 00:28:04.174
quarter N minus 2x metal.

00:28:04.174 --> 00:28:07.730
So here r is not the thick,

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.799
so don't worry about the arm hole,

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:12.209
so it's going to be fine.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.614
So arm Hall is over here.

00:28:17.614 --> 00:28:22.770
It's going to be 40 centimeter from top left shoulder.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:28.720
So the line to the bottom of the scale.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.900
So it's great to have a much more room.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.675
So next question is,

00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:40.929
I understand that nacho fabric so breathable,

00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:44.139
but you cut that covers our body.

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:48.054
Are there any tips to make it readable?

00:28:48.054 --> 00:28:50.710
That's a really good question.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:58.039
And also had a question from H2 because the cutter is kind of covering all your body.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.884
Of course, if you're showing your skin,

00:29:01.884 --> 00:29:04.429
would be much readable.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:11.530
But these day and cause poor people or this is fashionable people anywhere in Jakarta,

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:17.530
it's shorter, but the man doesn't wear like this.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.175
So here's another option.

00:29:21.175 --> 00:29:24.670
This is they can go or cut out or

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:34.764
some type of chemo when they're practicing something or training something.

00:29:34.764 --> 00:29:38.905
Or woman is doing cooking.

00:29:38.905 --> 00:29:40.945
Or what's the key?

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:43.240
This is called the Tuskegee.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:50.059
So use, uh, one of the hemo is a code to make this type of look.

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:59.584
The sleeve is shorter and hold under your arm.

00:29:59.584 --> 00:30:03.770
So when you type tasky,

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:10.260
cocky, and you can find how you're going to make this look.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.829
And men know Marie,

00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:17.225
if it's too hard and kinda path naked,

00:30:17.225 --> 00:30:22.949
take the, take the top of the cooling down.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:29.690
And this is kinda nice way to make like a breathable looking

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:35.284
at this is kinda mad SUV type of material is Festival,

00:30:35.284 --> 00:30:39.035
that summer festival type of styling.

00:30:39.035 --> 00:30:44.674
They use also Tuskegee with the red code.

00:30:44.674 --> 00:30:49.925
And they have statical is Sabrina pants underneath.

00:30:49.925 --> 00:30:52.714
Sabrina pass type of undertones.

00:30:52.714 --> 00:30:53.960
But they don't say Sabrina.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:31:00.305
But so when you want to make this type of Luke is not so difficult.

00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:10.439
I just pull the ham center of the ham and put underneath of the orbit.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.500
That's pretty simple.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.009
There's a really good suggestion.

00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:25.325
So when you go to the body measurements she in a class.

00:31:25.325 --> 00:31:28.399
So when you get the link from the class and

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:32.194
the body measurement is going to take you to this page.

00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:36.304
There is a two section and female and male.

00:31:36.304 --> 00:31:40.595
So the C only yellow area.

00:31:40.595 --> 00:31:46.850
You need to take a measurement to enter than other area is automatically calculated.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.894
So for instance, this is a 180.

00:31:49.894 --> 00:31:59.899
Here, height is two meter and the body length is automatically calculated to yeah,

00:31:59.899 --> 00:32:06.125
body length is or also automatically calculated by their formula.

00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:08.824
But just in case,

00:32:08.824 --> 00:32:11.375
please measure your head high

00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:18.785
and heal to make sure this is the right length you wanted to make.

00:32:18.785 --> 00:32:21.454
If it's too long,

00:32:21.454 --> 00:32:23.720
you can always adjust.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.010
Not adjust.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.644
You can always read,

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:31.800
refill your exact measurement of your body. Next.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.629
Also the heap size.

00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:37.085
You need to enter.

00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:43.069
Your heap size, it's a 100 and you can make the yuki is 80,

00:32:43.069 --> 00:32:45.800
then you can put the number,

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.099
then it's automatically calculated underneath.

00:32:49.099 --> 00:32:55.489
So the suggestion was adding picture.

00:32:55.489 --> 00:32:58.159
And each section because this side is,

00:32:58.159 --> 00:33:03.320
everything is Japanese and hear.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.535
The other side is English explanation.

00:33:07.535 --> 00:33:14.524
But you don't know where the d1 or d2 and E1 and E to the area.

00:33:14.524 --> 00:33:21.640
So I was trying to add the images,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:27.280
but this Google, she not allow me to add the images.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:35.245
Then I created the sheet to jump in to the area.

00:33:35.245 --> 00:33:40.149
You want to see what's the so they have to know,

00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:42.459
so they hover then you can click e2,

00:33:42.459 --> 00:33:44.200
then jumping over here.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.984
So they have a is over here.

00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:49.314
So that means from here to here,

00:33:49.314 --> 00:33:51.639
then here's already have a number.

00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:56.665
So this number is a fill from your measurement.

00:33:56.665 --> 00:33:59.895
So he's going to cut.

00:33:59.895 --> 00:34:04.444
You're gonna see over here this already filled

00:34:04.444 --> 00:34:10.654
from the cupola number from us she so you don't have to be calculated.

00:34:10.654 --> 00:34:16.504
So you just after you fill out your exact measurement of the four areas,

00:34:16.504 --> 00:34:23.060
this yellow area then is automatically calculated this number and this also

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:32.584
automatically tall connect to the cut pattern page and also marking pattern page.

00:34:32.584 --> 00:34:38.344
So I tried to make everything is easier for you to understand.

00:34:38.344 --> 00:34:42.059
So here using Japanese fabric,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:50.079
then you need to 424.

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:52.135
We have size of a 120,

00:34:52.135 --> 00:34:53.830
that would be 60.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:59.139
You're gonna make a first stay with, with 60.560 them.

00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:09.625
A hundred, seventy hundred circular tube to make the fabric fold.

00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:16.314
If you using Western fabric and total would be six meter and 46th century metal,

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:26.399
then you can cut body and sleep and Akami and Eric,

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:33.239
that's how you go into cut the fabric.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.715
