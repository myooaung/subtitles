00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.350
I am going to so cocky Eddie Reinforcement cover.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.370
I fold in half them pin in the center.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:20.110
Now I'm going Teoh creasing the scene other ones,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.620
which is one sense medal in actual size.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.860
But this case who to be?

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.550
2.5 millimeters.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:38.580
I am folding a diagram at the corner to make the need squared off edge like origami.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:50.210
Oh oh

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.340
koucky Eddie to the body started from the centre back.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.800
The next thing will be the full sense marrow,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.180
but this case is one sense mirror from the centre back.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.320
It's like a slightly little over 80 the third of being.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.640
It's going to be a little bit Paco,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:14.410
because there is a car therefore spin good to be the end of cocky 80 nine cocky Eddie

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.250
reinforcement colors shooting cover the 80 Mrs Color.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.950
The reinforcement colors should overlap the edge off the color by Ki Se.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.350
This should have completely hide a color from Butte.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.810
Now I am going to prepare two.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:52.360
So the edge off the reinforcement color I pin very edge off the cocky 80 then now make the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.070
owner just the other side of the scene to cut Kitty.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.820
They also pain the very yet,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:11.550

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.850
