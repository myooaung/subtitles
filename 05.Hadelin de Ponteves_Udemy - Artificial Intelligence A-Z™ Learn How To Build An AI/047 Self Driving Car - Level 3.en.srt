00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,550
Hello and welcome to the level 3 of our self-driving car A-game.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,570
So now the challenge is going to be to still do the round trips between the airport and the downtown.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,590
But this time by avoiding obstacles and we will do all the obstacles ourselves you can draw any difficulty

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,710
of obstacles.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll try not to be too tough with the car because I want to make it to level 4 but let's keep this challenging.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,380
All right.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:33,680
So as usual we're going to select all these codes and execute and then we go with level 3.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,840
So let's load our brain.

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:42,020
Here we go brain is loaded the car isn't around trips properly.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,940
And so now let's throw some obstacles.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,380
All right.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,330
So what can we do now.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,680
First let's roll something like this.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,120
OK.

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:01:04,200
And then what we can do is draw another obstacles like this and then maybe something like this.

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,020
Something like this.

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,160
And something like this.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's see what it does.

19
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:45,950
All right.

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,400
So now what it's going to do.

21
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:47,940
OK.

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,660
Avoiding this obstacle now avoiding this one no mistake again.

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,750
So still it has to learn it's still exploring avoiding this obstacle.

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,410
Perfect.

25
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,230
Very good.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,780
Is it going to avoid this one.

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,660
Great.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,380
It did.

29
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,820
And going to the downtown and now going back to the airport avoidance obstacle.

30
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,690
Great.

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,710
Now is it going to avoid this one this time.

32
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,160
And no we're still on the stage.

33
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,790
It's OK.

34
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,570
I'll get this sticker.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,700
Maybe something like this will be better.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,470
The car will understand more because right now it is being quite stubborn.

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,170
All right.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,370
Still avoiding this obstacle it seems not to have any problem with this one.

39
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,640
What kind of problem with that one.

40
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,770
Better now.

41
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,890
You see I got thicker which means that the punishment was harder with a worse word.

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,850
And now it managed to avoid.

43
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,470
And this one avoided as well.

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,810
Perfect.

45
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,210
Now we have a functional self-driving car as it seems.

46
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,000
So we're watching this one again.

47
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,040
Great.

48
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,530
And now avoiding this one great still going on some sun but it's ok.

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,290
It's it will be punished for that anyway.

50
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,820
Avoiding this one.

51
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,640
So sorry this this one was totally unuseful But you know we can do something like this if you want.

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,280
You know to get this even more challenging for the car.

53
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,320
All right.

54
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:35,240
And OK we can add a big tip here so that it doesn't cheat because it's still crossing the tip of the

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:46,890
obstacle and we can do the same for the other tips of the other obstacles that we go there we go there

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,000
we go.

57
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:56,810
Now

58
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,740
let's see what it does now.

59
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,850
OK.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,320
There we go again trying to reach the airport now.

61
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,290
OK.

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,710
Perfect.

63
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:17,130
So it's going around the obstacle is not trying to find the best path.

64
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:24,460
But anyway the goal is to reach the two goals the downtown and the airports.

65
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,020
Then we can add some code to you know try to find the best path.

66
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,720
But we definitely already have a soul train car.

67
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,770
All right.

68
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,470
Great.

69
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,700
Great job.

70
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,810
And there we go again.

71
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,540
I still get you on the Simpsons so it's still in Panish we can actually look at this core function which

72
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:54,520
is here as you can see it gets the punishment and this corporation is actually decreasing with time.

73
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:01,790
So that's because I got the obstacles figure and

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,940
right now as you can see it's trying to avoid the tips of the obstacles more and more.

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,110
It's doing them better and better job as you can see you know it's going around faster now.

76
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,150
Except for this one.

77
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:24,350
But if we save again and look at this core function as you can see we see some kind of improvement here.

78
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,710
But anyway the car is going to get better with time.

79
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:35,220
But I think that right now we can say that level 3 is past because any way it manages to do the round

80
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,060
trips between the airports and downtown by going around obstacles.

81
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,420
And that's what we wanted.

82
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,400
So yes maybe.

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,260
Let's move on to level 4.

84
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,250
Level 4 is going to be very challenging.

85
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,300
I don't think we'll be able to pass level four but that will be the challenge of this model.

86
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,650
You will have to change something in the code to pass level 4.

87
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,200
It will either be something that it has to do with the word or something that has to do with you know

88
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:12,240
the strategy of the game or even something with the neural network or something with the D2 an algorithm.

89
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,290
Well you will look for it you will do some research and you will try to get an even better card than

90
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:27,150
this one that avoids any kind of obstacle that will never go into some sense or that will try to find

91
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,960
the best way.

92
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,440
The best path the shortest path.

93
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,980
So good luck with that.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,380
It's going to be excellent practice for you.

95
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,660
And I can't wait to see you solutions.

96
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,580
So now let's move on to level four.

97
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,710
And this time it's going to be very very challenging.

98
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,670
So I'll see you in the next tutorial and until then enjoy.

99
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:45,990
I.
