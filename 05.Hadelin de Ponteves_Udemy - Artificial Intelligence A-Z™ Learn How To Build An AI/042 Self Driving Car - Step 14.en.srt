Hello and welcome to the site and to talk to.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,600
All right a very quick tutorial today to make this core function.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,820
And so basically this function will just compute the score on the sliding window of the reward.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,060
And so basically we will very simply compute the mean of all the rewards in the reward window.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,860
So this will be very simple let's do this now we're going to make this new function that we're going

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,590
to call core and this core function will just take the argument itself because basically we don't need

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,590
anything.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,840
We need to take cells because of course we will take self-talk.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,670
We were winda so just self and then Cullin and there we go.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,840
It's going to take one line of code.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,860
So we want to compute the mean of all the words in the window.

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:50,730
So that's basically the sum of all the words in this window that are between minus 1 plus 1 divided

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,080
by the total number of elements in this window.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,170
So let's do this.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,270
We are directly going to return that.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:05,680
So in starting with we turn and so we need to take the sum of all the words in the window and to do

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:14,090
this we simply need to take the we were Windu itself and so on inputting here self that reward window.

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,500
All right.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,540
And so very simply this will sum all the elements inside we were window.

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,190
That's pretty practical.

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:29,080
And then to get the mean we need to divide this sum by the number of elements in then we were window

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,110
and to get the number of elements.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,060
Well we need to take the len function and then we say are we were window again.

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,930
There it is.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,630
But now we just need to be Yahoo with something that lends itself.

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,030
We were window is a denominator and this must absolutely not be equal to zero no matter what we need

27
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,670
to avoid this and to make sure that the denominator here is not equal to zero.

28
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,720
We are going to add this safety trick.

29
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:06,300
We're going to add here a plus one so that Lancefield that we won't win window plus one will never be

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,450
equal to zero if the denominator is equal to zero.

31
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,240
This will crash your system.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,290
So we must avoid it and that's totally fine.

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,880
Our plus one will still get a good measure of the score.

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,760
All right perfect.

35
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,520
And so that's all we have.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,920
Our school function which will give us the meaning of the reward in the sliding window.

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,590
All right.

38
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,910
Now let's move on to the next function which is the same function that will save your model that is

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,500
said the brain of your car so that you can then be able to reuse it by loading it with another function

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,610
that will make after this a function.

41
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:46,170
So that's really practical to have this save trick safe function to save your miles in case you want

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,620
to reuse them for any kind of purpose where they can be useful.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,540
So that's what we'll do in the next tutorial.

44
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,030
And until then enjoy our.
