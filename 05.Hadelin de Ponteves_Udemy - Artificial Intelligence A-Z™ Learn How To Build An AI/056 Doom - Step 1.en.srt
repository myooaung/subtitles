00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,740
Hello and welcome to the second module of this course building an AI to beat the game Doom.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,970
So yes that's right.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,290
We're going to play Doom with an artificial intelligence which will try to kill some monsters to reach

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,280
some goal in a 3D environment.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,710
You know 3-D map exactly like when you're playing video game on encounter differences.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,430
You are not going to play this game the way you're going to build and code we'll be playing it for you.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,630
So there we go we have another very exciting challenge ahead of us and besides we're going to take it

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,620
to the next level now because we're going to make a more complex model which is the deep convolutional

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,550
Cuellar.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,470
So I hope after this intuition lectures you're now very excited to implement it.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,480
I am definitely very excited to implement it.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,790
So let's start right now.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,500
And as you can see I'm starting with Google because I want to show you the opening eigene environment

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,610
and walk you through the game we're going to play that is of course do.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,630
All right so starting with Google we're going to type here open a gym.

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,760
So there we go opening a gym.

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,570
Then you click on the link and you will find a page that page and on the upper left corner of this page

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,840
you're going to click on environments and that is where you have all the environments which are actually

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
environments of games.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,940
And for each of these games you can implement an AI to be the game.

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,180
And each time it is specified which goal you have to accomplish what are the actions and what are the

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,210
rewards and know that for most of the games the input states are actually the input images.

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,850
That is it's not like before with the self-driving car where we had you know a vector and coding One

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,490
state of the environment for most of the games here the input state is instead the image.

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,890
So it's exactly like our future I will have eyes like as humans do.

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,790
In fact this AI we're about to implement is to be the closest to a human brain because it is going to

27
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,060
observe a series of images then it is going to detect where it has to do in the images and then using

28
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,800
a classic neural network.

29
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,560
Well we'll know which action it should play.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,530
And so now let's move on to the game.

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,430
We want to beat which is the last games on this list do.

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,300
So let's click on it and there we go.

33
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,630
Welcome to the doom and violence.

34
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,460
So as you can notice we have several versions of doom.

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,010
And these are just different maps with different levels.

36
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,210
So for example let's have a look at the first one to basic zero which is this game that you see here.

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,200
And as you can see for this game and for any of the games it is specified to go so for this game the

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,260
goal is to kill this monster here in three seconds with one shot.

39
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,580
Then it is specified the rewards.

40
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,610
So you get plus 101 points for killing this monster here.

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,080
Then you get a bad word with minus five points for missing a shot.

42
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,940
So actually right now it is getting some that want because it's missing a lot of shots and you get minus

43
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,690
one every point oh 20 seconds 20 seconds that's all the rewards.

44
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,770
And then you have how the game ends.

45
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,720
So it ends when the monster is dead.

46
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,000
When the player is dead or when there is time out.

47
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,170
And you also have the actions so you have three actions for this one attack.

48
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,530
So when that when you shoot move right and move left.

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,750
OK but that's not the game we're going to play.

50
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,040
Actually this one is too simple.

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,210
That's my favorite.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,000
I prefer the one where we can move forward move back turn left turn right and shoot many monsters.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,030
This one is much more exciting than actually this is this one corner.

54
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,590
Let's click on it.

55
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,520
That's the one.

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,020
So as you can see now we can actually move forward.

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,410
We can move left we can move right turn left turn right and we can shoot again.

58
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,470
And we have many more monsters like these guys here.

59
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,840
And our goal of course is to not only to shoot them but that's because the main goal is to reach this

60
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,010
tip of the map here which they call the vest.

61
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,510
The goal the main goal and that gets us 1000 points is to reach the vest over there and to do this well

62
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,970
we'll have to kill the monsters because if we don't kill the monsters we will get killed and we will

63
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,280
not be able to reach the vest.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,610
All right.

65
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:36,630
And so that's our main goal which of us then let's see what our rewards are we get a first word when

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,820
we are getting closer to the vest.

67
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,300
So that plus distance the words is exactly the distance we complete while getting closer to the vest

68
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:52,200
than mine is distance reading further from the vest and minus 100 points for getting killed.

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,650
So here the reward is just measured with the distance.

70
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,310
When you get closer to the vest you get a reward that is equal to the number of meters you've got closer

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,120
to the vest.

72
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,360
So that's a continuous positive reward.

73
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,010
And when you get further from the vest you get a reward that is equal to the number of metres completed

74
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,650
by getting further from this list.

75
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,950
And then if you get cancer you get a bad word of minus 100 points then the game can end when the play

76
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,020
touches the rest.

77
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,260
That's when we win.

78
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,480
When the player is dead that's when we lose.

79
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:31,340
And when there is time that game over and here are our allowed actions attack shoot right and left forward

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,220
turn right and turn left.

81
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,510
We have more actions than before.

82
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,440
We now have six sections.

83
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,030
That's OK.

84
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,480
This will not increase the complexity so bad.

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,920
All right so I hope you're excited with this game.

86
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,340
I actually think this is the most exciting game.

87
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:53,420
So we're going to build an AI to beat that game and to do this we will implement a deep convolutional

88
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,730
neural network.
