00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,360
Hello and welcome to the fun tutorial of this first module self-driving car it's going to be epic.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,850
We're going to test our eye on the environment and we're going to test it on four different levels.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,620
That is we're going to play a game the game will have four levels of difficulty and the aim will have

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,280
to pass these four levels.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,640
So we're going to be these four levels.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,480
First Level One the first level is going to be to reach the airport and then do some round trips between

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,160
the airport and the downtown.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,430
So as soon as we see the car do these round trips Well we pass level 1 then Level 2 Level 2 will be

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,490
to still do these round trips.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,290
But on the specific road that we draw ourselves but it's going to be an easy road because it's level

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,840
2.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,030
And of course the car will have to self-drive by staying on that road.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,420
So it will be a road that goes from the airport to downtown and then the other way.

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,010
And so the car will have to do these round trips by sitting on that road.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,980
If it does we will pass level 2 and level 3.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,410
Level 3 will be to draw some obstacles on the map to see if the car manages to avoid the obstacles and

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,850
still reaching its goal.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,730
So no worries will draw some difficult obstacles that the car will have to avoid.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,010
And we'll see if it managed to reach the airport and the downtown and finally level for the most challenging

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,380
level for the car will be to draw a very difficult road to reach the downtown.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,060
So I don't know you know it will be a road like some zigzag.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,720
I'm not a brilliant architect but I'll try to make a challenging road.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,830
So let's hope we pass at least the first level that would be great then let's hope we can also pass

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,190
level two and three.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,180
And if we passed level 4 that would be wonderful.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,540
So let's do this let's take the challenge.

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,840
Well actually the self-driving car is going to take the challenge but we are the brains behind this.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,110
So let's tell how that works.

29
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,280
All right so the first thing I'm going to do is just to give you a quick reminder about the map.

30
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,060
So that's the map.

31
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,810
And first we're going to look at the map we're going to look at the self-driving car without the AI

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,540
to it will just be a car having those random actions that you saw at the beginning of this model.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,970
So how can we look at that.

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,330
Well we have to deactivate the AI and the activity.

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,590
We simply need to put a temperature equal to zero.

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,380
Remember that parameter here is the temperature.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,240
And right now it is equal to seven.

38
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,830
That's a low temperature.

39
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,280
We will increase that afterward.

40
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,700
But if we don't want the car to have a brain that is if we don't want to activate the AI we simply need

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,210
to set the temperature to zero equals zero.

42
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,980
And same here of course that's the real temperature in the cold too.

43
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,460
There we go.

44
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,580
And then we must not forget to say because otherwise that won't include the change.

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
I guess now we don't have any.

46
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,210
I see I used to activate it.

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,180
So let's have a look at the map just to give us a quick refresher.

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,370
A quick reminder about what it looks like.

49
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,070
So I'm going to select everything and press enter.

50
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,630
All right.

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,840
And there's our map and there is our car.

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,540
So as you can see the car is having totally random actions you know to go left to go straight to the

53
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,480
right and therefore it is not reaching the airport which is I remind at the upper left of the map and

54
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,500
not reach it.

55
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,410
Well it just did.

56
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,230
That's totally random.

57
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,680
You see it right now it is at the airport and it is not reaching the other goal which is downtown at

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,220
the bottom right of the map.

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,030
So we were just like here but we can clearly see now that the actions are totally random.

60
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,270
It is going nowhere and there is definitely no artificial intelligence but no worries.

61
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,080
We will activate it right now.

62
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,480
I'm going to close the map and then I'm going to restart the kernel restart DeCarlo.

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,390
You click on this tool button here and then yes.

64
00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:00,730
And now time for the show we're finally going to put this train we made in the car and activates the

65
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,350
AI.

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,090
I'm super excited to see what's going to happen.

67
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,730
We're going to activate the air right now and to do this we need to raise the temperature so to change

68
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:17,300
the temperature which is it replaced at zero by well let's start with seven as we had before.

69
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,660
So let's specify seven here.

70
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,510
All right let's not forget to say.

71
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,870
And now let's get back to our map and now we can just re execute this again because we restarted the

72
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,790
kernel.

73
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,470
So let's say it.

74
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,790
And there we go we have the car.

75
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,600
And what is it doing.

76
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:41,180
Well it is trying to find its way its exploring its understanding what it has to do and its about to

77
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,900
reach the airport and there we go first go reached wonderful and now the next goal is to reach downtown

78
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,540
and there dead just reach downtown.

79
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,750
And now its trying to find the airport back going to the airport and there there again Wonderfalls that

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,450
works.

81
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,200
It didn't take time actually to explore learn from the mistakes you know the mistake here is to get

82
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,380
further from the go.

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,770
Thats where we punish the car by giving it a slightly negative reward.

84
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,270
You know its minus 0.2.

85
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,760
So it learn from that mistake and by learning from that mistake it managed to get the positive rewards

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,980
by getting closer to the goal.

87
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,940
And now it finally understood what it has to do.

88
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,530
Its definitely reaching the airport and then reaching the downtown and then doing these round trips.

89
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,970
That's perfect.

90
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,090
We have a self-driving car but I cannot help but notice it is looking like an insect.

91
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,510
The car doesn't really seem sure of itself.

92
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,610
No it doesn't have a very confident movement.

93
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,570
It's like your left and right that's not moving like a car movement.

94
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,090
It looks more like a bug.

95
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,820
So we're going to fix that.

96
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,560
And as you might have guessed the way to fix that is increase the temperature because remember the temperature

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,690
is the parameter in the soft Mac function that we can increase so that the action is returned with more

98
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,730
certainty.

99
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,630
So that makes sense that if we increase temperature well we might end up getting a car more sure of

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,750
itself because the AI will be more sure of which action it should play.

101
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,350
And that remember is because the action will be played with a higher probability.

102
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,780
The only problem with this increasing the temperature is that remember the AI is less exploring the

103
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,380
other actions because by increasing the temperature of the other actions we'll have low probabilities.

104
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,760
But right now that doesn't seem to be a problem because the car seems to have no problem reaching its

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,310
goals.

106
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,840
The airport into downtown so we can totally increase the temperature if we want this thing that so far

107
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,140
looks like an insect looks like a car.

108
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,620
So let's do this.

109
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,530
I'm going to close this now.

110
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,370
There we go.

111
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,310
Restart the kernel again.

112
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,590
And press yes.

113
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,810
And now we're going to increase the temperature.

114
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,090
So let's do this.

115
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:02,170
I'm going back to my file then replaces seven by 100 There we go.

116
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,410
Then we save.

117
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,890
And now we have a self-driving car sure of itself.

118
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,990
So we might get better results and we might get something that looks more like a car.

119
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,780
Let's take a map and then let's to that again.

120
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,900
All right what's happened.

121
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,730
OK.

122
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,340
It did some kind of a burnout.

123
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,190
Not sure why.

124
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,980
But anyway now we have something that looks more like a car.

125
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,240
You can see that it is going more straight.

126
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,190
It is not doing these quick left and right movements.

127
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,410
That's because now the car is more sure of which direction to take and each time you know it wants to

128
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,720
take the best direction going to the airport and then to downtown.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,490
So clearly we can now say that we passed level one.

130
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,840
The car is doing these round trips between the airport and the downtown.

131
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,610
So we are going to save that that's I'm going to show you how to save the brain.

132
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:59,520
We just need to click on this save button and if we look at what happens here.

133
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,640
Well we have the curve of the we were at the beginning we can observe some mistakes that it made.

134
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,990
So that's where the reward is negative.

135
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:14,280
But then it learned from its mistakes and the reward increased little by little until reaching a constant

136
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,100
positive reward equals to open one but that's the maximum reward we set.

137
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,640
And that's because it ended up exploring.

138
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,490
That's the expiration phase.

139
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,200
And then it just knew what it had to do.

140
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:32,230
That's where it was doing these round Rountree between the airport and the downtown without any mistake.

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,450
So there we go.

142
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,470
We passed level one.

143
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,850
Congratulations.

144
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,170
Now let's get things more challenging.

145
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,120
Let's take things at the next level.

146
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,810
Let's try to pass level to which I remind you we do these round trips on a specific road.

147
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,060
We're going to draw ourselves.

148
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,170
So let's check that out in the next a toil.

149
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,780
And until then I.
