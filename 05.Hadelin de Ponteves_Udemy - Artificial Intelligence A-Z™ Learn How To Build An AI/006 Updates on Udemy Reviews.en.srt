Hey guys welcome back to the artificial dungeon.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,560
It is at four in the toilet.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,060
I'm taking you on a walk through Africa.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,150
How crazy is that.

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,150
Now while we're on this quick walk I wanted to also share a few.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,590
A heads up the Eudemus system is very soon going to ask you to leave review for this course.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,030
Now I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of a course this early on Homer.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,800
Their system has simply changed and you to me is asking to leave review earlier and earlier on in the

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,730
course.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:45,380
Now with that in mind we're going to ask you to leave a five surface course to go the go go there.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,870
We're not going to ask you to feel sorry for this course but what I would like to ask is that if you're

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,960
not familiar with tutorials well enough to read this course a faster course than please scroll through

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,800
the topics of this course please have a look at the different artificial intelligence Algren's that

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:07,090
recovery goes into reinforcement learning CULE learning deep learning deep convolutional key learning

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,430
and even cover A-3 see and hopefully also you see all of these different and exciting things that you'll

16
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,020
learn as course.

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,710
It will give you the confidence to write this course of course.

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,370
If on the other hand you think that there's something wrong with the course if you're unsatisfied about

19
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,740
something then please do let us know before you rate the scores.

20
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,330
You can contact the superdense and supporting directly where you can leave as a short message in the

21
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,330
course Junee Your feedback is very valuable to us.

22
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,900
We will get back to war.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,830
We will fix up whatever the issue is and then get back to you and hopefully that will give you the conference

24
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,400
or at this course of our course.

25
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,800
Now on that note if something's wrong of course then please do let us know.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,480
Or another hands if you feel that everything is great for course if you're excited about the journey

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,990
ahead.

28
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,640
And if you're enjoying these tutorials if you feel that this a five star course then please do read

29
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,560
it appropriately so that the rest of the world will also know that this is a five star course on artificial

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,720
intelligence and they can learn everything they need to get started in the space.

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,810
Thanks so much guys for being part of artificial intelligence.

32
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:15,760
It is a very excited to have you on board and super pumped about the journey ahead of you and I look

33
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,940
forward to seeing your browser tutorial.

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,090
Until next time in Jarad a visual.
