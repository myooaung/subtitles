00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,210
Hello and welcome back to the course on artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,400
Today we're talking about the first part of A-3 see the actor critic part.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,540
So here we got a synchronous advantage.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,380
Actor critic algorithm.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,440
And we're going to be talking about that underlined Akrotiri.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,210
That's where we're going to start.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,960
You could technically start anywhere but it just makes a lot more sense to start from a critic because

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,640
that way we'll have like a very consecutive explanation of intuitive understanding of what's going on

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,470
is going to facilitate us.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,970
But if we start surprising yet at the end of this aberration.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,840
All right so so far in this course we've come up with a deep conditional Kule learning which is illustrator

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,780
here so we've got the computer seeing the pixels so the actual image and pixels not just a vector.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,610
So it's not cheating it's actually seeing exactly what a human sees it sees the monsters it sees the

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,540
health it sees the parameters at the bottom it sees the card or it sees the gun it is exactly the same

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,080
thing as a human would see when playing this game.

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,450
Then that image is passed through a convolutional lair and then it's passed through a pulling lariats

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,380
flattens and goes into a neural network and then at the output we've got actions as remember we've got

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,270
those cube values then we apply a action selection policy to them.

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,540
So for instance we apply a soft Max and we find out which action we want to take.

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,470
And so there is some exploration plus exploitation going on.

21
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,860
There are a combination of the two.

22
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,480
So that is how deep convolutional cool learning works.

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,980
But now let's see what we're going to do with it.

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,510
So for simplicity's sake just so that it's easier for us to operate with is because we're going to adjusting

25
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,770
this image and moving it around.

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,490
We're going to replace circles with squares with these or these rectangular boxes.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,190
And we also are going to get rid of those lines and between just change them to arrows so this doesn't

28
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,440
change the essence.

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,590
This is just the representation on this chart.

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,620
This is still even this representation is still deep convolutional Kule learning is just going to be

31
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,520
easier for us to modify it and show exactly what it is.

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,820
So that's just how we are going to represent things from here.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,070
And what does or this specific part so is starting.

34
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,680
Remember we're starting like step by step we're starting with the active critic part.

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,490
So we're going to see how we go from deep crucial Kule learning to A-3 see step by step and first step

36
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,520
we're going to introduce this this actor critic PARTOVI here so we're going to talk about that.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,490
So the first thing that happens is this last bit.

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,990
The output is actually we're just going to redraw it like this so it's exactly the same output exactly

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,350
the same q values are exactly the same action.

40
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,810
So if he if you had eight possible actions you still have eight possible actions which is going to put

41
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,280
them at the top so they take up less space so nothing so far nothing has changed so so far.

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,080
This and this are exactly the same.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,080
But now this is where the active critic part comes in.

44
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,580
We're going to have a second output.

45
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,460
We're going to have the first one as a set of outputs and here we're going to have a separate individual

46
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,040
output so technically we are going to be using our neural network.

47
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,310
So once an hour.

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,720
Or the image and everything like the values go through the network from left to right over here.

49
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,910
They don't just spit out one set of values they spit up actually two sets.

50
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,910
And so the top said we really know what it is it's it's possible actions but here we're actually going

51
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,970
to have another extra value so let's have a look at that.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,430
What is that value.

53
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,260
So here we go that's the top.

54
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,190
So we just kind of like reduce the size of this illustration.

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,210
The top output is are the cube values as we discussed previously for the actions.

56
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,500
So they're the same thing.

57
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,240
Everything is same.

58
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,640
But then now this bottom part and the top part is actually called the X or we're going to give it a

59
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,400
name that's the actor because that's the part where the agent chooses what it wants to do so that it's

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,160
like it's acting it's as if it's performing on stage and it'll make more sense once we have the second

61
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,730
name up on the screen as well.

62
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,120
And then the second output is just like one value and that is V of S so that is the value of the state.

63
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:16,800
So if q of S is the Q of A is the q value of a certain action and as you can see that's why there's

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,450
action one action two action three are up to action six or higher meaning actions there possibly are

65
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,030
in that state.

66
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:28,410
So in a given state s What is the q value of taking action a action to action one action to and so on.

67
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,900
Then here we're also predicting we are also using neural network to predict what is the value of the

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,620
stage we're actually in and this part is called the critic.

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,070
And so that's the intuitive for the kind of not even full intuitive that's just like the start of the

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,260
intuition behind actor predict that there's two outputs now from the neural network not just one.

71
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,470
P before we just had that one at outbred which we now call the action.

72
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,040
But now we have two outputs Akshara and critic.

73
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,320
And there's going to dynamic between them which we'll explore further.

74
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,850
But for now it's important to understand that we're predicting not just the values of the actions that

75
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,100
the agent can take from the current state but are also predicting the value of being in this kind of

76
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,750
state using that same year old network.

77
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,700
So that's the core of the first step into the active critic.

78
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,990
And now we're going to need to talk about a synchronous which we'll do next tutorial in order to understand

79
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,900
exactly what's going on between duty and the final thing for today is that all of these key values as

80
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,640
we know that's also called Pulse.

81
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,720
So in some literature in some blogs and some discussions you might find in the active critic you might

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:47,400
find the author talking about Cue values on the side of the actor in some in other literature and blog

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,780
posts and discussions you'll find the agrah the author talking about the policy so and usually is use

84
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,810
the user like a Greek letter P for representing the policy or just say policy of state.

85
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,790
So altogether these are the policy of state of is because as we remember the policy is that if you put

86
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,660
all the actions together the possible actions and then it's deciding which action to take.

87
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,400
So these are going to be like the probabilities of taking each action so that's the policy.

88
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,410
So don't be thrown off if you see one or the other.

89
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,090
They basically mean the same thing.

90
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,720
So on one hand here you've got the policy or the q values on the other hand you've got the actual value

91
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,620
of the state and they're being predicted from that year on that.

92
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,770
So that's the start of the active critic will continue of this in the next tutorial when we're talking

93
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,320
about a synchronous and look for see there.

94
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,910
Until then enjoy the.
