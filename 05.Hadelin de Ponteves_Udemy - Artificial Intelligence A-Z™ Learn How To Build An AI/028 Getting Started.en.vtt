00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.680
Hello and welcome to the first module of this course self-driving car.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.170
Now that you have a torch and can be installed on your system.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.470
We are ready to start implementing the self-driving car and I can tell you we have an exciting adventure

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.680
ahead of us.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.340
So the first thing we're going to do now before we start is set the right for those working directory.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.830
That's very important because we are going to have three files to implement this car and all the cars

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.350
are connected to each other.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.630
So when you execute the file it will take that classes functions and objects from another file and this

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.900
other file has to be in the same working directory as the file that you're executing.

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.250
That's why it's very important to have one simple there with all the files and that is your working

11
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.340
directory folder.

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.910
So let's just get this done.

13
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.980
And then we will be able to start.

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.840
So first thing you do is go to 5 4 here.

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.310
That's this window.

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.990
And then you will probably be on your desktop.

17
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.280
So right now you can see them on my desktop or maybe even your documents.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.070
But anyway you have to find the folder that contains your artificial intelligence.

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.800
It is that template folder that you downloaded from the Web site that will walk you through it.

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.900
So just find this folder then open it from file explorer then go to module one self-driving car and

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.180
then there you go.

22
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.800
This Mudgal one cell shopping cart folder contains three files that's the three files that are connected

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.590
to each other to implement not only the self-driving car on the map but also the brain of the car that

24
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.720
is the AI that will be integrated to the car.

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.400
And so this folder containing these three files is your working directory folder.

26
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.410
And now to make sure that this folder is set it's working directory.

27
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.380
You can click on the two button here and then restart kernel.

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.950
Then you can click on yes and there you go.

29
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.540
Now you are sure 100 percent that this for the content in your three files is that as a working directory.

30
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.350
OK.

31
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.520
And so now before we start I would just like to explain quickly what are these three valves.

32
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.370
So as you probably recognized the first one here.

33
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.000
Why is the file that contains the brain of the car.

34
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.430
So you know that's in this file that will implement the artificial intelligence that will be integrated

35
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.020
to the card.

36
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.090
So that's why I'm calling it the brain of the car because this artificial intelligence is based on a

37
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.170
neural network.

38
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.130
So it will be like your car will have a neural network inside of it.

39
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.830
That's why electrical brain.

40
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.300
Then the second file here is occasionally found car that Katie and you cannot open in here inspirer.

41
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.560
But you can open it from a text editor and actually that's what I'm going to do right now.

42
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.440
I'm opening it with subcontext.

43
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.070
There we go.

44
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.300
That is subline text and this is this card that cavy fell open and subcontext.

45
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.890
For those of you who are on Windows you can open it with notepad plus plus.

46
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.330
So here is what the character looks like.

47
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.550
We're not going to focus on it in this course because this is only related to KDE but basically to understand

48
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.640
what's going on here.

49
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.410
Well as you can see we create several objects that will be on the map.

50
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.100
So for example this first object here is the car and for this car you can find some valuables like the

51
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.470
angle that is the angle of rotation.

52
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.270
Then you can define the shape that you want your car to have.

53
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.820
So this will be a rectangle like the basic shape of a car.

54
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.410
Then you have some other objects will want to involve three.

55
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.550
So these three balls here will be as you will see later the sensors of the car because the car will

56
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.930
have sensors that will detect if there is some obstacles around the car.

57
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.520
So these rebels here are just to highlight the sensors on the car.

58
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.540
So we will see them and besides I set a different color for each of them.

59
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.720
And then we have a last object which is to connect all the previous objects together to make the car

60
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.060
because the sensors will be attached to the car so that when the car moves well the sensor moves as

61
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.050
well.

62
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.090
All right but this is not the most important here so we are going to move on to Boston.

63
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.280
This is just to show you what cable looks like.

64
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.270
And this Fall of course will be connected to our other files.

65
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.290
And mostly it will be connected to the third file.

66
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.840
Not that way which is this one right here in Nevada.

67
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.970
Why what is it.

68
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.620
Well this is where we make the whole map and also the whole game because you will see that we'll be

69
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.150
playing some games with the car.

70
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.910
You know we will give it some challenges like avoiding some obstacles or doing some round trips between

71
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.770
two destinations on a more and more difficult road.

72
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.860
So we will make a game and that game happens in this big fall here.

73
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.030
So this fall is important therefore we're going to see it in details.

74
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.100
However since this is not directly related to AA I will not go to it line by line.

75
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.660
I will just explain each line of code.

76
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.790
Besides the template for that you'll find the same code as this one but commented.

77
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.770
So each line of code will be tormented.

78
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.030
So that's if you're interested in knowing how to develop a game within the application.

79
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.110
Well you will be able to understand anything that we do here.

80
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.850
But what's important also is that not only we make the map in the game but also we make some important

81
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.460
connections between the map and the future that he will implement afterwards.

82
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.170
And by the way this is much more important and therefore we will implement it step by step.

83
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.520
We will write together each of these lines of code.

84
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.350
But for the math I will just describe all the code sections here and that's what I will do in the next

85
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.390
section right after this tutorial.

86
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.970
I think the next two tutorials are important for you to understand the connection between the map and

87
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.550
the AI.

88
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.570
All right so I will be explaining all this in the next tutorial.

89
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.240
And until then I.
