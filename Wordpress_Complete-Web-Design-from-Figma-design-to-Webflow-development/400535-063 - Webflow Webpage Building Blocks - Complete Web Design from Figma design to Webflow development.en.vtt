00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
alright In this section,

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.540
we're gonna learn by doing instead of learning wet floor feature by feature,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.100
we're gonna actually learn it by building our pope age that we have already designed.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.940
And little by little,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.960
we're one step at a time step by step ferociously.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.250
Remember where you're going to learn all the ins and outs a web flow Onley as we need it.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.940
I'm not going to cover any future until we actually come to a point where we actually

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.880
needed to use it while we're doing and building our home page.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.320
So what we're gonna do is take that design that we have made and then each section by

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.770
section,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.760
we're going to go over it and kind of re create and rebuild it inside wet flow.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.670
And let's start simple with our content on the left side,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.810
on the hero section before you start building something in wept the first you have to plan

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.470
in your head.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.580
What sort of layout is going to be needed?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.230
So what do we have here?

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.440
We have a blue background in fig MMA.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.540
We use the rectangle for that in weapon Oh,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.880
we don't have such things as rectangle we have boxes.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.450
Instead,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.630
there are three types of empty boxes and wept flow.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.250
You can find them right here in the Elements Panel Elements panel is where wet flow keeps

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.820
all the new elements we need.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.830
It's divided in need categories like typography,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.620
where you have heading paragraph and old tax related elements.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.450
So we have three empty boxes for our general use section container in the D Block.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.140
This section is exactly what it says.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.630
It's an empty box where we can organize a section off our page.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.940
Which is exactly how we have our designs organized,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.480
don't we?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.700
We have a hero section than several sections below.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.140
Finally,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.110
the footer section.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.440
Those are old sections,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.350
and that's how we're going to organize inside wet floor as well.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.920
Container is what we put the content off the our page in our designs.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.980
It's everything we have put in the boundaries off our grade.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.370
The most popular box in HTML is a D block short for division block.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.530
It's an empty box and most useful,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.850
most basic building blocks off a webpage.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.780
It's under basic category.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.020
So which one of these do we need?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.350
First,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.990
obviously a section so let's add a new section to our page section and do block identical

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.500
elements.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.250
They work exactly in the same way.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.490
So everything I described for a section right now applies to the deal block to.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.910
There's only one difference.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.230
You can put a section inside another section,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.450
but with the blocks you can as much as you want.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.600
So a section or the block is an empty box.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.510
There's nothing in it.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.980
These books doesn't actually have a height until we give it some height.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.400
What floor is showing us?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.460
A little bit of high temporarily so we can notice it.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.720
And don't drive ourselves crazy looking for it.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.950
It's a special box to when you place other elements inside it.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.020
It will grow to match the hide off its child element.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.410
Let's give it a caller so we can better understand what happens to it.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.250
We can do that from backgrounds.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.330
The basic things inside the style panel is very similar to fig.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.530
Must proper dismantle so very easily you can work with it now.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.390
If we enter the preview,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.200
the section disappears.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.090
Why is that?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.740
Because it's empty and has zero pixel hide.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.700
It's invisible wet floor just gives it a temporary high.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.920
Just inside the net.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.730
Designer Soto help Huster sit If we dragon image element inside is going to stretch from

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.070
zero pixels to the exact height off that image element that we just put inside now the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.460
whole thing is visible in the preview mode as well,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.650
because it's not zero pixel hide anymore.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.140
If you would something smaller inside,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.150
like a small attack that is going to shrink.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.500
But it didn't actually shrink.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.440
It was Europe exults.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.180
It's just shrank Onley inside the designer because it had the temporary height hope you're

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.980
getting and of it.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.710
I remember this strange behavior was a little confusing for me in the beginning,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.010
so I wanted to clarify from the start.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.990
So you understand,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.950
and you also understand the basic logic of how the structure is formed on the website.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.540
Give it a go yourself right now,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.150
and then we'll continue styling our section
