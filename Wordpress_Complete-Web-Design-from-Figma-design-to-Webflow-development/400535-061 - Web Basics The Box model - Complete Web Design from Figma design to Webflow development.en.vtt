00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
before we get on with building our page.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.310
First,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.090
I want to explain the structure off a webpage every webpages structure in a so called box

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.830
model for the HTML,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.400
Every element is in reality,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.030
a box,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.010
no matter their final shape and content.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.300
They all start as a box.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.340
And all of those boxes actually sit inside other big boxes all the way down to the final

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.320
big box where everything else sets.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.530
And that's our weapons.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.870
When we were designing our navigation bar and female,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.670
we simply dragged our links exactly where we wanted them to be placed.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.160
But fig,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.560
my another design tools use a different model.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.680
That layer model.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.630
You can think of it as paper shelves.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.070
In figure,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.710
every new objects sits on top of existing object not above it.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.950
But right on top of it,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.370
it basically creates a new layer of space.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.150
And is the king and only citizen off that space?

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.170
And if something else is directly underneath it,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.900
the lower guy won't be visible at all until we actually push it up in their layer panel.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.390
Exactly what happens when you place papers on top of each other.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.770
Now what pages are more like drawer Organizer's when a drawer is divided into boxes,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.810
which on their own can be divided into even smaller boxes in drawers,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.880
things don't usually go on top of each other.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.150
They go either below er next to each other.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630
So when we build our NAB are using HTML,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.190
we first are going to take an empty box and put our logo and link boxes in it.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.180
The bigger boxes,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.170
called parent and smaller boxes inside our cold Children and those Children boxes are each

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.330
other siblings just the way you do expect it by default.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.590
They're going to come one after the other because that's how HTML works without CSS.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.450
Then we're going to apply a CSS style so all these boxes are arranged horizontally.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.830
Then using other CSS properties and a couple more boxes,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.700
we can distribute them in exactly the way we want.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.190
Don't worry,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.240
you'll get the hang of this in no time.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.790
If you ever get stuck trying to figure out how to make something work,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.350
the solution is most likely.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.480
And now they're books where flow is kind enough to show us boundaries off our boxes.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.050
When you click on that any element,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.250
it will show you the full box that this element occupies.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.270
As you can see,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.050
even though our headline is short,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.370
the box stretches on the entire page.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.420
That's the default behavior off most HTML boxes without any CSS apply to it,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.310
and by default,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.350
all of these boxes come one after another unless you put them inside another box.
