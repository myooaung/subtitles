00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
before you can get work on our pork.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.070
First,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.240
you have to get approved.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.120
This is sort of bad news in the beginning,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.670
but once you get approved,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.200
then it's a good news because that means that up work is trying to keep the marketplace

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.960
nice and tight.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.370
So it's not over cried that we're overcrowded with freelancers,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.450
because then if there's too many freelancers,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.970
that competition is too much and the prices will be driven down.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.170
And basically it's not gonna be a big benefit for freelancers who are working on up work,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.470
and neither for the clients,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.320
because then they just have to go through so many different real answer since too much

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.880
competition,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.370
basically.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.700
So when you open an account as a felon center up work,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.030
you submit your application,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.170
and they have to review it within few days,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.070
and they either approve or reject.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.160
If you get rejected,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.360
don't freak because you can reapply and there is no limit on how many times you can reapply

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.090
toe up work and you'll just improve your profile and then apply again.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.090
And if he doesn't work,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.600
and then again and again and again,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.980
my experience with this application process is not much to talk about.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.900
I made it.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.210
It was accepted.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.970
End of story.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.720
But there's this guy,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.670
Danny Margulies.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.310
If I'm pronouncing his name correctly and he has this blogger on,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.210
and I think it's called Freelance to win and on he's block he has brought this article,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.150
which I'm going to link in the resources.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.370
And I want you to read that article because there's great tips.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.030
And I want you to read that article before you apply Teoh op work because he has tried and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.230
tested many different strategies on applying to our pork and get getting accepted.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.730
So I want you to read that.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.950
And here are some tips that I'm shamelessly stealing from that article.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.880
Upward wants to create a balance on the marketplace between number of jobs posted and then

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.560
freelancers bidding on that job.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.940
So when ah,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.150
when these balance kind of disturbs and let's say somebody post the local design and you

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.380
have 1000 freelancers bidding on that job,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.010
then things going to get out of hand.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.930
So whenever that balance is disturbed,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.240
the upward closes the gate on new applications who are applying for the particular skill so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.930
For example,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.460
if it's let's a logo,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.930
designers right in pork has way too many local designers,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.350
but not enough jobs that are being posted in that category.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.240
Then they're going to sort of temporarily closed the gate on new applications and new

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.620
freelancers who are coming within that category.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.550
So until that kind of balance comes back up,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.810
long way to avoid this happening to you during your application process is to show up work

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.540
that your skills sort off stretch between many different categories.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.430
As a Web designer,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.170
you automatically fall under multiple categories first,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.030
under family off development,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.480
you have Web and mobile design,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.250
plus Web development.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.670
And under the family of design and creative,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.030
you have graphics and design category and maybe even other for things like user experience

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.580
and user interface design,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.040
since they're not listed there.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.800
In any case,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.840
you have other skills,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.640
and you plan on doing other jobs,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.440
maybe like logo or brand design.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.250
Then you can include that,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.650
too.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.800
But don't stretch yourself artificially because up work from time to time,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.690
they do check the skill.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.410
The lab Also,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.070
they might do some interviews where they can check if you know and if you're capable in

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.050
these categories.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.980
Besides using categories up work also asks you for specific skills that you have in.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.870
Danny suggests in his article.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.260
To list as many skills as possible and up work has this huge database of skills where you

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.550
search and then it out of fields and gives you the option which you have to select.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.850
For example,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.980
in terms of Web design,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.800
these are skills you could easily go for thinks like Web design.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920
Obviously responsive design.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.270
Fig Mama wept,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.710
flow lending pages and so on.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.230
But Onley choose genuine skills that are relevant to the job.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.140
Don't put Microsoft wort because that's not relevant to your category of work.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.780
I'll let you read rest of the tapes from the Dennis article itself there.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.600
13 MAWR.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.550
So check them out.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.820
Okay,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.850
back to my own content and not stealing other people's advice.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.330
So when you first submit your application,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.040
you don't have an option to submit to perform your but when.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.640
If you get rejected and you have and you re apply,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.700
then this portfolio option opens up and you're able to submit the portfolio and show your

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.210
password to sort of support your application in case you're going through this application

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.690
process second time and you are uploading your portfolio.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.530
Do not upload portfolio work from this course.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.550
Here is why,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.120
since there are a lot of students on this course and a lot of year will probably going

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.280
upward to apply,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.990
you'll end up applying with the same portfolio pieces.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.460
If use those that we overly building this and design in this weapon in this course and for

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.170
the off chance where it's the same person reviewing our your application on up work,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.930
then for them to see two different applicants applying with the same exact part for you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.040
that's going to raise red flags for both off them.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.800
Once approved,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.370
then it's OK.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.430
You can use this work is your portfolio,

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.020
and you can use it with your clients.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.030
That's not a problem.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.360
At the end of the day,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.670
you did build this website.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.820
I didn't do it for you
