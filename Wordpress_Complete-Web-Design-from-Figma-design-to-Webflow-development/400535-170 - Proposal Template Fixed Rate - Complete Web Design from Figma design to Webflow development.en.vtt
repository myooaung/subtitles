00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
outside of freelancing platforms.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.880
How you send proposals.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.950
It's all up to you.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.190
You can email them,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.660
send them a message,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.600
tell them over the phone or send them a rave in.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.670
It's all up to you,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.510
your the boss.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.590
Some options are better than the others.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.070
If you want to look serious and impress your clients than sending Ah,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.770
proper,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.170
well designed proposal document is the right approach.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.670
This is what profiling stars dio to help you seal more deals.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.760
I have created a very solid proposal template for you.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.890
It's a Sigma file,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.860
the link you confined in the resources as you can notice.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.490
It's designed in the same theme as the portfolio website that's going to help you set your

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.420
personal brand make you look more professional,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.250
like someone who has thought about the smallest details.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.530
You will instantly stand out from the competition,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.220
and standing out is what you need.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.230
If your clients have multiple freelancers to choose from,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.800
let me take you through the content and explain why I put what I put in.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.540
What are the things you'll need to add it when generating the proposal?

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.490
The header is pretty straightforward.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.500
Edit the logo put whatever you want in the headline you can even mention there Company name

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.440
like Google website proposal.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.160
It's a nice,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.510
personalized touch and your details and the details off your client overview is a place

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.720
where you show your understanding off the project that you know what you're going to be

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.240
doing.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750
You tell them your objective and explain what's the final deliverer?

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.860
Herbal have inserted a little spiel on how their website will be hosted on amazing Web flow

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.030
servers making its secure and super fast.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.430
This a good place to pitch a little on how good the final result is going to be to create

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.410
an excitement.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.960
Not you don't sell how amazing you are.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.370
They want a website not to go on a date with you.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.970
Then we have a price breakdown.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.560
They set flat rate pricing.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.850
I've created a template for hourly rate projects,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.250
too.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.470
It has different price table and some other content is different,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.630
to which I will explain.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.350
After this,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.070
the price breakdown shows different parts of your job.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.360
If you have more items,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.640
you can just duplicate the rose and add more or remove as you wish.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.590
I like breaking down design and development in separate items.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.210
They are two different phases,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.840
and with some projects you can even do Onley one off them.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.730
For example,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.060
if they already have designs,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.040
then you can just do the wet floor development have also added some extra things that are

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.300
included in the price.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.650
It increases the value they're getting out of the price like responsive development and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.650
training session.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.340
That way,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.700
the price list looks much more valuable and full of benefits than just a single value off

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.180
$2500.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.420
It feels like there is a lot more that they're getting about this particular values.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.540
I'm just throwing numbers here doesn't mean that's what you should charge.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.150
You can charge last sort of way about this value.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.710
That all depends at the category of clients you'll work with.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.450
As we're discussing the pricing class,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.780
I'll just give you one advice on values use.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.640
Round values don't do 9 99 That's just going to look stupid.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.580
Your clients are aware of the fact that you are the one putting this prices that there

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.530
isn't any complex pricing equation that you're using.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.250
Surround them up or you're gonna look silly underneath the price table.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.680
There is a line saying that well,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.350
flow hosting isn't included.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.950
Transparency is key in such relationships.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.530
Don't forget in quotes to mention important things,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.980
especially costs.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.550
Next,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.770
we have a timeline.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.310
This is something clients really want to know.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.670
So,

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.640
breaking down as much as you can,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.480
clients are making a big risk with their money and tie.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720
They want to be in control off their project,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.050
so they want to know exactly how things are going to progress,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.560
makes them feel at peace,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.950
and they will trust you more.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.350
These are rough estimates.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.120
Projects never go exactly with the predicted timeline.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.890
It doesn't just depend on you how Creek lines give you their fit back on each phase.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.150
How many alterations you go through and how quick they provide necessary content is going

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.750
to significantly impact the project timeline.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.490
Open some other tax work rip up during the project.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.350
They might ask you for small things which will adopting the end.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.110
If you're working on an hourly rate,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.240
then that's not a problem.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.560
But on flat rate project,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.060
you'll soon end up losing money.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.700
If you don't set the record straight on what's going to happen if there is extra work which

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.190
is outside of the main scope,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.520
even if they are just extra meetings that are taking your time.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.620
I myself had to learn this the hard way.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.150
I had a client who wanted to meet almost every day.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.550
I think he was just getting a kick out of talking and brainstorming.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.380
But for me,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.570
it was just taking too much time and I wasn't being paid for it.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.050
If you send an hourly rate for any extra Warrick,

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.750
then everyone will be clear.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.260
The last part is terms.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.900
I have listed some important points to have clarity on the way things will work and avoid

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.350
any future disagreements.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.590
These terms aren't probably legally binding terms.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.940
Their purpose is clarity.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.880
So everyone is on the same page.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.550
For example,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.900
it has a payment structure.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.460
When working with strangers outside of the platform,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.450
you should take some payment up front.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.370
25% is really is a good idea.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.430
This is my structure,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.550
but you can feel free to change it as you wish,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.950
and obviously you can change any of these terms or at your own.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.360
The final four month can be in pdf.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.780
Or you can even share a link to the prototype view like I'm showing right now.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.980
But I think pdf is a better option.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.570
You already know how to export.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.250
Just go to the properties panel export,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.190
choose PdF,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.150
and that's all I want to give you.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.740
One rule.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.950
When it comes to sending proposals outside of platforms,

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.970
do not surprise them.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.490
So when you send a proposal and they get the value and that value,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.980
if that is maybe too much for them or it's expensive,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.130
it's going to surprise them and shock them a little in,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.380
you know,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.520
kind of disappoint them.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.580
And because you put it inside the document and you some sort of scented already as

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.520
something returning something definite,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.730
then they don't have a way to oppose our negotiate,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.250
and you yourself don't have a way to sort off,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.190
give arguments and benefits off the price and tell them and explain them.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.100
Why is it good for them to go with you and so on?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.690
Right.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.080
Neither.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.760
You have an ability to maybe negotiate and perhaps give them a discount because maybe

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.370
sometimes you have that put inside the inside the price as a buffer,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.690
right,

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.810
so you put a little bit as a buffer to make sure that you can negotiate it down if they

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.200
want.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.150
If they ask you for the discount or sometimes you can even bring the price down by maybe

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.190
removing number of revisions or doing something a bit less or what you know,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.390
there is many different ways you cannot can move things around to decrease the price.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.170
If there really can't afford that,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.630
that value that you gave them.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.390
So the right approaches to do the discussion off the price during the meeting like you

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.400
don't have to finally agree on it.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.570
But what you can do,

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.650
an important thing is to give some sort of ballpark range,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.410
so they're not surprised when you give them a final value.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.980
And what you can do during the meeting is this is,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.510
for example,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.200
what I do.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.910
I have a meeting like it's a Skype meeting or face to face meeting,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.600
and when we go on the meeting,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.560
I ask a lot of questions about the project and I already have some sort of pre ah value in

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.410
my hat that I'm willing to go with.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.870
I sort of have this range,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.360
which is like a minimum that I'm willing to work for in like an ideal price that I want to

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.050
get out of it.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.710
Once I ask the questions,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.630
I understand that if the website is just like a one or two pages or if the website is like

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.000
maybe a big website with,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.350
you know,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.910
25 different pages or a blogger or something like that and I kind of come up with a range

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.730
which is maybe something like many move between 4000 to $6000 then I give them that range

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.710
and if they have some sort off objections to it,

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.650
will discuss it.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:48.190
And I'm ableto give benefits and tell them you know why this is a good option for them and

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.450
why it's the price is actually worth it.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.390
And if they don't any,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.210
for example,

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.990
sometimes it can be that I give them a value and they were expecting something less than

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.600
1000.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.200
Now,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.820
I know that you were just a bad match and you know,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.790
I'm not gonna do all that website Bork for a lodger website less than 1000 so I don't have

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.870
to bother about creating the proposal and sending emails everything we instantly understand

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.870
.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.240
We're really in a different different game here and we're not a good match.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.860
The ice,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.090
you know,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.070
save a lot of time.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.470
But if we are still in this right phase,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.690
then I can We can negotiate if we need to.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.850
But if that's price also sounds nice than once,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.050
right,

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.360
Once I'm done with the meeting,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.820
then I prepare the proposal and probably I would put something like $5000 for the website

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.960
and now they're expecting that prize and they're not surprised and we have a deal.
