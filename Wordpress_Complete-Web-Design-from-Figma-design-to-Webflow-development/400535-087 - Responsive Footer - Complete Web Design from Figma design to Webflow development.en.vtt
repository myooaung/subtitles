00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
So what have we got here?

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.740
This up flex box that has columns inside the columns have this percentage rate applied to

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.050
them.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.460
Let's get mobile views in mind when creating his solution.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.890
Here we will need some sort of vertical alignment.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.670
We could go for vertical option from the flags box,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.670
but that sets everything vertical.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.680
Even when there is space on the sites.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.750
A batter option is to use a rap future.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.610
We've discussed this option in black spokes video,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.350
but let me refresh your memory by default.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.250
Flax box tries to fit all Children in one single line beat horizontal line or vertical line

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.250
.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.850
But when we enable rap option than Children will jump to the next line or rap to the next

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.100
line,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.550
one by one as needed,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.230
but changed the justify settings to the left or start.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.050
Now let's tweak the columns.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.690
There's this empty column,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.880
which was nice on that.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.010
Asked up but not needed for tablet and mobile views.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.710
We'd like columns to align to the left without extra spacing.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.170
We can remove this empty column because it's going to remove from the desktop a swell,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.150
but what we can do is hide using styles.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.120
Let's give it a combo class or we don't mess with other columns and then from display

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.550
options.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.000
Select.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.090
Hide the display non property heights,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.870
Telemann and freeze out the space it was occupying.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.920
What us?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130
The columns have the left and right margins,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.820
so when they jump to the next line,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880
it's going to create this extra space.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.320
Let's remove that left margin and Onley use right,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.040
but make sure to edit the calm that has Onley a global class.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.430
The first and last column have a combo class applied to them.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.250
We used it to fix some margins on the desktop.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.700
That's pretty good.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.180
And let's at a bottom margin.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.750
Show that columns on the second line don't jam into the first line.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.050
On smaller sizes,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.220
you'll see that they don't really wrapped properly,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.420
and instead the column squeeze themselves very tightly.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.490
That's because they have the percentage rate applied to them,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.730
which is fine on the desktop but becomes unnecessary in this sort of layout.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.730
So let's get rid of it now that calm with this automatic,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.570
it grows with the content inside,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.020
and that makes the first column too wide.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.550
We gotta give it a maximum with so it doesn't grow this much,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.350
and that's better.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:46.750
And the whole thing wraps nicely across all views.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:57.950
One last thing we should tweak is the spacing between the copyright and the links.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.350
I think 60 pixels will be much better.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.450
Let's have the final look at the whole thing.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.450
-

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:39.060
And

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.780
that concludes our entire page development in the next section.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.460
We're gonna go over finalizing our page,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.390
things like publishing s CEO and so on.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.340
This doesn't mean that we're completely done with Web faux designer and the development

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.980
process.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.820
There is still more to learn things like CMS and forms and interactions and animations that

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.310
can make any website looks so amazing and so fresh and so modern and so professional

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.720
looking.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.380
But all of those concepts we're gonna learn in other parts of this course one part,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.490
we're gonna learn them inside this big client project that we're going to do from start to

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.770
finish that you get this hands on experience on how to start everything with declined with

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.210
things like project brief and wire framing and designs and then moving toe wept floor and

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.900
developing.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.950
CMS and blawg inside wept,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.970
flow and then interactions and finally delivering everything,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.370
publishing with a custom doma and all that stop and we also some parts.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.290
I'm going to put inside that events part of this,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.390
of course,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.210
because you don't need everything.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.250
You don't need to learn everything in one single go.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.040
So I put everything that is not essential skill and essential knowledge for you to start

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.480
freelancing inside the advanced part.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.550
So once you reach that final part of this course which is advanced,

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.870
you already know everything that is essential and bread that can get you started with

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.570
freelancing.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.650
And while you're freelancing one while you're looking for jobs,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.990
you can also continue with advanced parts and cannot hold your skills and get better at
