00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
every website out there has text on it,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.800
and a lot of design depends on how we select that taxed styles.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.980
This is called typography.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.830
Typography isn't just choosing the right phoned.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.090
It's about choosing the combination off those phones,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.690
the different styles like skinny and bold and regular and wait,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.350
choosing right typefaces and phones for the right occasions and bright contacts.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.480
Topography can make website grade and with outstanding readability.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.290
Or it can make it childish looking,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.430
or maybe out of contacts or look confusing and very hard to rid.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.980
You can easily have a website that is typography only and still make it look good and

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.100
designed without any graphic elements.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.330
As a matter of fact,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.850
the world's most popular website is primarily just text.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.060
If taxes this important in design,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.980
then there must be some rules and guidelines on how to choose the and use them,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.450
right?

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.370
You bet there are,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.080
and you'll learn all about them in next few less inches.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.320
Following the simple guidelines will make your designs look great.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.450
You'll hear me use the terms typeface type and fallen interchangeably type of short for

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.120
typeface,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.590
and the difference between typeface and font is this in this case.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.800
Hello,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.860
Vatikai za typeface family that has many different phone styles in it,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.710
like light,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.050
bold and so on.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.830
Doesn't matter which term we use,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.470
not really,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.250
but it's still good to know the difference and not get confused.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.640
I remember I was confused in the beginning because everybody was using whatever they wanted

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.090
and he had phones and types and typefaces,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.830
and I was like,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.250
Am I using the correct thing for my designs?
