00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
We've got the boot board.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.250
We've got the wire frame.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.210
We're ready to design our home page.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.930
Let's create a new page and name it design and copy the wire frame in here because it's

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.030
going to be easier for us to follow the wire frame instead of going back and forth between

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.260
pages next to it.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.250
Let's add a new frame in our usual 12 point grid.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:30.510
Okay,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.950
let's find a background photo for our hero section.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.100
I quite like this photo because it looks non stock and been more realistic shows that she's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.410
working remotely.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.050
And she's happy because our team collaboration platform is just that good.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.900
The only problem is that she is centered and we want to have a layout where we can put the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.910
content on the left,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.950
and it's not overlapping with her face.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.400
If the photo is a good quality than we are able to move her around and position her on the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.050
right side,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.660
I'm going to create a new rectangles so we can mask the photo inside it and position it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.050
exactly the way we want it.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.470
I have included all the photos and assets in the project file,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.330
so if you want to reuse same photos,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.190
you can do that,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.360
and you can find that on the assets page.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.250
But if you want to go for your own interpretation and now definitely recommended you to do

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.510
that,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:44.330
to find your own photos and use that one instead looks pretty good.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.450
There is a good amount of space so we can put our content on the left.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.740
Now let's choose typography.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.470
This time,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.990
let's try to find a typeface that can work both on headlines and paragraph on for any

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.460
specific reason but just a practice for these.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.670
We need to find something that is neutral because we're going to use it for a paragraph and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.010
something that has a lot of weight variations.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.550
We can narrow that down in Google using number off styles.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.460
Six styles in reality means three different weights because each weight has an italic

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.450
version with it.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.770
So that's not really enough.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.250
I'm going to go with at least eight styles.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.950
This one is actually called Bork Sands might be a good option.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.950
Cabin isn't bad,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.550
either.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.810
On the bottom here,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.090
you can switch these around to see how it looks in a paragraph as well I don't like work.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.890
Sounds how it looks inside the paragraph.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.400
It quite nice in the headline,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.270
but in a paragraph,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.750
it seems a little clumsy.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.250
Let's check cabin.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.900
Yeah.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.010
Paragraph looks much better on cabin.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.510
Just a great double check off the typeface manual.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.000
Remember,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.240
we always read the phone.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.650
Manual will avoid embarrassing choices.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.240
Accident All safe in the description.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:14.090
And now let's go Apply that phone toe our page instead of creating it from scratch.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.600
I'm going to copy it from the wire frame in here.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.550
No need to reinvent the wheel every time.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:36.370
I'm just playing around here.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.450
Mind listed to see what works of s,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.950
I think this will Dio,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.700
since we're not using a heavier weight than line high doesn't need to come closer.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.630
Last mass means last gravitational pull.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.960
Hope you have been paying attention to your physics class in school and the paragraph text

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.960
.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.950
Uh,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:10.040
uh huh.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.860
We need to add a dark overlay on the image.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.370
Otherwise,

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.960
content won't be visible much.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.950
Uh,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:34.680
now for the call to action form.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:43.070
Uh,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:05:06.450
I'm going to use the blue from this design,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.640
but I'm actually going to Brighton and up a little to make it even more vibrant.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.750
Uh,

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.490
they also have these yellow on their page,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.420
so let's copy that to maybe we'll find a use for it.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.130
You're free to choose different colors.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.830
If you'd like up to you how closely you want to follow along with me,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.410
pixel by pixel or maybe remix a little,

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.140
it's fine.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.760
Either way,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.350
there is a learning value in both of the approaches.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.350
-

00:05:37.350 --> 00:06:18.850
Uh

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.850
,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.460
I'm just trying the margins and distance this year not really going by the greed.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.210
As you can see.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.810
Always trust your eyes over any design guidelines and rules.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.920
Blindly following them sometimes will render far from optimal results.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.640
I'm also trying to avoid that corner off the furniture.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.990
The objects in the photo in our interface elements sometimes can interact with each other.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.850
This can be good interaction,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.350
but sometimes it can create unnecessary tension.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.910
There's,

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.430
for example,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.600
is a bad tension.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.450
That corner in the gap between the button and the field makes me cringe.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:02.650
L A reid looking sweet so far.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.650
Let's put a navigation bar.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.650
-

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:57.500
Uh

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.040
huh.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.150
Uh,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:09.750
let's make margins 12 from the top and bottom and 20 on the sides.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.250
Uh uh.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.480
If you want to do a ghost bottom here you can,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.540
or even to make this Gloria's well feel free to remix.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:31.150
Uh

00:08:31.150 --> 00:09:03.750
uh

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:11.370
uh,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:17.790
Let's add a logo to Here's another simple and quick way to make a local just right to name

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:41.150
in small caps and add a dot at the end with some contrasting color and that you've got a

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.090
brand new logo.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:10:00.350
So if I looking good.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.370
One thing I want to fix,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.590
though,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.660
is that dark overlay on the image.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.940
Right now we're using a full overlay,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.640
but the model doesn't actually have to be sitting under a dark overlay because we don't

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.380
have any content in front of her.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:15.640
Now.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.060
How do we brighten her up but keep other parts dark?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.510
We'll use a Grady and fail instead of a soul.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:21.950
It Phil.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:27.630
So go to the field that we created and switch that toward radio radiant this time,

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.420
not linear.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:28.780
Why?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.230
Because with radio we can create sort of a spotlight on her.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.890
You see how the black color starts in the center and fades in all directions.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.370
That's not the direction we want.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.910
We want exact opposite off that to start transparent in darken on all directions.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:52.570
We need to reverse the starting and colors there.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.420
We have exactly direction we need.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.570
Now we can position that spotlight exactly where we want it to be.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.450
This handle on the left decreases the radios off that circle.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.550
You can play with other handles to to achieve exact results you want.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.340
Okay,

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.350
now back to 40% opacity.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.180
And there you go.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.050
Her face isn't dark anymore and looks better.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:19.700
Overall,

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.320
this a great way to utilize images that have too much detail and too much going on in them

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.320
.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.950
You can create spotlights on your focal points and then dark and rest of the image.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.440
All right,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.550
let's pause here and continue the rest in the next video.
