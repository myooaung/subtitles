00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
Here are two other methods off finding collars 1st 1 and my favorite Stealing.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.150
There's nothing wrong with feeling colors,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.250
unlike other created war colors,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.820
can really be owned by anyone,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.940
so designers borrow colors from each other all the time.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.770
This is basically sampling colors from other people's work.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.710
Instead off the photography.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.660
It's also more simpler approach to finding color,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.890
staying sampling colors from the photography as we did.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.150
It's more out of the box option that you can start applying to award right away.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.210
There are a lot of websites that curate design,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.440
work and inspiration.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.870
I have dedicated a special lesson to this.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.100
Later we'll dive,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.840
differing the topic of inspiration and its importance in your board flow.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.650
For now,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.590
let's look at one place to find color inspiration dribble dot com.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.610
You can find excellent inspiration in here.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.850
Most of the Warrick Year isn't even for real projects.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.610
It's a designer show in town,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.240
a lot of exploration and ideas and practice by other designers.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.100
Let's say we are working on a finance related website.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.430
We were surged by the Finance key award and get a lot of inspiration for our Warrick when

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.880
we find colors that were like we can either simple the color in exact the same way as we

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.800
did with photos.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.830
Just save the image and place it inside fig ma,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.750
and then use the eyedropper tool.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.190
Or use a separate eyedropper tool that can simple colors from anywhere on your screen.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.810
If your own Mac then it already has an eyedropper toe,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.610
it's inside utilities called Digital Color Meter.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.560
If you're on PC,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.430
you can use browser extensions.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.090
Color zilla,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.700
for example,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850
is a pretty good chrome extension for this.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.460
The second way to find color sees through color generator sides like coolers that co you

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.640
can either generate pallets from scratch.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.700
Or you can paste one or two colors that you want to use and generate some other matches

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.210
that will work with that color.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.050
Here's a pro tape.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.400
Avoid role collars.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.680
Road colors are those that have 100% saturation and 100% brightness.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980
This is a mistake many non designers make when they,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.480
for example,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.000
designed presentations for school or work or Facebook covers on what not They often use

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.210
role colors like this.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.640
We generally like colors that are present in the natural world and rarely you get such

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.660
colors in major.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.080
Even the most extreme examples,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.930
like Nemo here don't have role colors in them.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.420
However,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.250
that doesn't mean you can never use them.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.400
There might be times when there's,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.630
like trains going on,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.010
right.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.700
Or maybe you deliberately and intentionally want to do something like a very bright

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.020
fluorescent green.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.070
Not a problem,

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.450
as always with design.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.340
If it's intentional,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.490
it's probably going to work.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.270
And if it's not the mind suck.
