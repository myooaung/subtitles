WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
And we're back.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.355
Finally, let's add the navbar and we're done with our hero section.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:10.710
Let's create a logo for our fake chat application and let's give it some original name,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.950
something like chat app we can use Poppins

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.835
is our typeface and create that similar contrast of thin and thick,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.070
just like they have it on their logo.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.355
Remember this trick from that contrast lesson,

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:42.170
combine thick and thin and bam,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.015
you have an interesting elements.

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:48.120
Let's add some navigation links and a button at the end.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.075
Here's another cool trick.

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:39.050
Select all lanes and in the alignment panel click tidy up.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.290
This will usually distribute objects equally between them.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.045
But we can go step further.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.705
Instead, exact margin between the elements right from here.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:52.940
Let's use 30 pixels because that's our default margin of the grid. We need a button.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.640
Let's create a button out of one of these links.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.320
When we put a button in the nav bar,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.910
It's usually best to use the same textile as a navigation link. Looks better.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.370
Let's use the same 30 pixel margin from the top.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.140
I'm pressing Alt or Option key here to see that distances between objects.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.710
And we are going to align everything in the navigation bar horizontally in the center.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.950
Always check your designs in 100% view because those are

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.280
the real sizes and dimensions that are gonna go on the actual side.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.235
Now for the middle section,

00:03:58.235 --> 00:03:59.960
I'm gonna do it a little simpler,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.630
just with a headline paragraph and just one screen of our chat app that we already have.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.240
I'm going to use exactly their font color.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.505
It's what you'd call off black.

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:23.435
Black, but not as saturated and sharp as a usual black.

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:26.450
And I'm going to add that black to our palette.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.000
It's a good choice for our palette as well because it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.505
has some blue inside, like a blue hue.

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:34.320
You can see that inside the color map.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.700
Let's remove the letter spacing because this headline isn't as big and heavy anymore,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.830
so we don't need as much tied space.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.500
Let's do the same for the paragraph text.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.090
I think they're using light version here,

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.940
but I'm not a fan of thinner paragraph fonts because they

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.135
are sometimes hard to read on lower definition screens,

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:04.700
on phones, tablets and routine a display,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.870
your laptops, it's fine,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.720
but on desktop screens with less pixel density,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.850
they're not going to be as sharp.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.000
Do you know to the visual hierarchy they have created here?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.620
The paragraph is smaller,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.480
thinner, and lighter color.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.100
I'll do the same with a color.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.650
We can just decrease the opacity of our texts.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.990
And that's enough. 70 percent is good.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.610
I won't bother filling this one out with real tags.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.475
Let's have to google and generate some dummy text.

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:43.560
There are websites that can do that for us.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.565
This is one website, for example.

00:06:49.565 --> 00:06:54.650
We can specify amount of tax we want and it can generate it for us.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.160
And then copy the text and paste it in our designs.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.070
Center and less snap into our grade.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:44.540
It's a little tight. Let's give it a little more line spacing. That's about right.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.095
I'll skip the button and add the mockup of our imaginary chat app here.

00:07:54.095 --> 00:07:56.885
Now instead of copying this whole thing in our document,

00:07:56.885 --> 00:08:00.320
I'm actually going to export it as an image and place

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.830
that image instead will make it easier to work with the end,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.940
we want overload our page with unnecessary elements to export anything from

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.380
Figma selected and in the properties panel go to Export and click Plus.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.300
You can pick a different file formats.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.745
Jpeg is good for us this year that says 1 x lets you change the size of the export.

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:23.780
If it says 1 x, then it will export in its exact dimensions.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.045
If it's two x, then it will double.

00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:29.600
So if your designs out to a 100 pixels by 300 pixels,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.735
the export is going to be 400 by 600 pixels.

00:08:32.735 --> 00:08:36.965
What's this for is to make our assets looking nice and crisp on HD screens.

00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:38.075
More about this later,

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.070
let's not get ahead of ourselves for now.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.570
One X will do just fine.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.730
Let's place our mockup in our designs.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.110
As you can see here,

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.640
they are using this browser bar on it and also a shadow behind the mockup.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.020
Let's pass the browser bar,

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.135
but at a similar shadow to our image.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.010
Shadows are under effects.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.340
Plus icon. The first thing is usually the shadow.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.990
It added this small shadow,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.355
this doesn't look very nice.

00:09:37.355 --> 00:09:40.235
Click the sun icon to edit the shadow properties.

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:43.235
Let's use our black as the base of our shadow.

00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:45.140
And it has this little blue in it,

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.750
which will make it look more like part of our designs.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.480
When you add color with 100% opacity,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.340
you get this weird shadow. Never do this.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.855
This isn't really a shadow.

00:09:53.855 --> 00:09:56.540
Figures default 25 percent is generally

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.750
the maximum opacity you'd want to use for your shadows.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.075
Blur is basically how the shadow spreads,

00:10:02.075 --> 00:10:03.530
how it feathers out.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.945
Play with it so you understand how it works.

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:09.560
They're using a heavy blower and law passage under shadow.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.960
I quite like that and we'll do something similar.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.280
X and y is the offset of the shadow,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.755
meaning which way the shadow falls x for a horizontal offset and wife or vertical.

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:25.160
When they are on 0, it falls equally on all four sides.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.870
If we add horizontal offset,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.540
notice how shadow moves towards the right.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.300
And if we add a vertical offset, it moves down.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.860
Or if you go negative values,

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.210
then it moves up.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.080
And good design practices to add positive vertical Y offset,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.140
because light most of the time comes from the top,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.695
feed outdoors in the sun or indoors to the ceiling lines.

00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:50.315
And if the light comes from the top,

00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:53.840
then it will cast shadow pointing downwards. This just looks weird.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.445
It doesn't even look like a shadow.

00:10:55.445 --> 00:10:59.405
Often I see websites use no offset at all,

00:10:59.405 --> 00:11:01.010
and that's not very natural.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.580
That means light sources coming directly from the front,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.220
like someone is pointing a flashlight at an object.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.795
Now a very common scenario,

00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:11.390
adding horizontal offset isn't very common.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.995
Some designers do it,

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:14.825
but it's not my thing.

00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:17.240
And I don't think it's a wrong thing to do.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.240
But for elements that are part of the interface like this image,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.385
the buttons, cards, and so on.

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:25.415
Shadow with only the vertical offset looks the best.

00:11:25.415 --> 00:11:28.880
So keep x to 0 and add some vertical offset only.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.470
That looks about right.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.130
I'm eyeballing here not using any particular guidelines with shadows,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.930
just looking what looks the best,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.660
most natural and nearly unnoticeable.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.190
That usually is the best thing for shadows that it doesn't feel like it's there.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.520
Otherwise it creates extra shapes that our eyes need to digest.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.445
They're using rounded shapes on their mock-up. It's quite nice.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:55.640
Rounded shapes are usually the nicest in web design.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.775
They feel like finished object rather than unfinished.

00:11:58.775 --> 00:12:01.835
Of course, strict edges have their benefits as well.

00:12:01.835 --> 00:12:04.100
Again, no rules with the rounding the corners,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.070
but if we match it with the roundness of the shapes within the mockup

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.330
itself will achieve a more consistent look. And that's quite nice.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.230
Let's add those dotted patterns behind it using shapes like this,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.390
dots or other sorts of shapes are a good idea.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.325
They add an extra level of dimension in

00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:24.460
all those other benefits we have learned in the overlapping trick,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.765
because that's what this is.

00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:28.090
Overlapping. It doesn't have to be the dots.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.400
It can be circles, rectangles, triangles,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.885
or any other sort of shape,

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:34.060
but obviously a has to make sense.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.490
Then when we repeat this dots across our pages,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.530
we get the benefits of repetition trick.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.020
It creates this rhythm of the design just like

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.020
a beat in a song and ties the whole design together.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.330
Okay, I'm going to pass these boxes here.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.740
I'm not gonna do them in.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.240
Go to the next section right away.
