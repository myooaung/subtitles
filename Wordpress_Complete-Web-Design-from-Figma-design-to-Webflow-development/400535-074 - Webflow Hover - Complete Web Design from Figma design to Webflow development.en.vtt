00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
our hero section looks great right now,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.380
but not very exciting to interact with.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.000
When we move our mouths over the elements,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.690
they don't really react to it.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.710
This are called mouse over or hover effects in Web design.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.960
Remember this law?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.850
It's called Jacob's Lof user experience.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.420
The law says that users spend most of their time on other sides.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.730
What does that mean?

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.180
This means that they expect for your side toe work the same way as all the other side's

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.260
they already know.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.850
If you try to be very original and make your side work in a different way than what our

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.080
users are used to,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.340
you're gonna end up with a very original ghost website that everyone wants to leave

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.050
instantly.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.150
So people have expectations for links and buttons to react when they move the mouse over it

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.150
.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.160
Adding hover effects and wet floor is quite simple and very fun.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.250
This is managed under these drop down called states.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.500
After selecting the hover state from the drop down,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.660
any changes that you make to the styles will apply to the hover states offer that class.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.030
And just like that,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:14.970
the button changes the opacity on hover States now show at blue dots to indicate that a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.050
change has been made to the hover state.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.700
There are other states,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.140
like pressed and focus,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.270
but I won't go into those until we need it.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.290
We haven't designed hover states and Sigma.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.120
I don't do this in really client projects,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.490
either.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.190
It's too much extra work that isn't really necessary.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.580
I come out with hover fact on the go during the wet floor building process.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.150
This way,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.120
I can also visualize how it's behaving.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.960
We can change almost every property on hover.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.170
A lot of fun animations can be created just from this,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.320
although what floor does have another way to build animations and interactions?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.700
And it's super amazing.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.050
But more about that later.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.760
For buttons,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.050
changing the background feel it's a good and simple way to add some simple holler effect.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.200
And changing the opacity of the background field is easy.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.950
Way to do that.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.690
You can use that as your go to technique for a quick and simple effect.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.600
It's easier than putting a different color.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.170
Another simple way would be to add a shadow on hover.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.040
That's a common and fun animation,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.680
adds an extra layer of dimension.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.220
Now,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.310
without Ghost button here,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.680
we can decrease the opacity.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.810
It's already transparent,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.020
but what we can do is to add a thin layer of transparent white sort off life.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:38.970
That button in the knob are ending white background with 10 20% opacity for the button in

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.420
the knob are Either we can play with a pass ity again,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.470
or fill it with 100% white when you feel it with why we have to change the tax color,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.660
too,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.800
because Texas White and it doesn't show.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.290
Luckily,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.890
we can change any style on hover.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.870
So without a problem,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.450
we can turn tax into blue.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.900
As for navigation links,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.960
we can do something similar,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.420
like decrease capacity.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.140
Change the color to something else,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.650
or we can do something even more interesting.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.380
We can add a border underneath.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.400
I don't mean underlying that's lame.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.250
I mean a border underneath the entire link box.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.050
We can do so on their border settings.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.240
Select the box that indicates the bottom border.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.230
The show automatically select a solely line as a style if it doesn't make sure you have it

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.350
selected and it's not set on X and change their color to white.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:45.250
This is a nice over effect and suitable for us because we're using the link as an entire

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.750
box,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.760
not just the tax,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.050
So it shows that this whole thing is clickable.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.880
We could bring these border closer to the tax by decreasing the bottom padding,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.250
but I actually like it being spaced out like that.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.100
There's one strange thing that's happening on hover.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.000
Pay attention,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.250
how the content underneath shifts likely every time we hold her own links.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.400
That's certainly not nice.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.440
The reason this is happening is because to pixel border adds to the available space

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.960
dedicated to the knave wings,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.550
so it pushes all the content down.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.570
So how do we fix this behavior?

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.900
We need to somehow make sure the height of the knave ling doesn't change on hover because

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.650
off the border,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.310
and one way to do that is to add to pixel border.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.050
Also on the regular state.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.850
We can make it transparent so it doesn't show this way.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.120
Naville Ian Box has a true pixel border either way,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.340
so it doesn't change sizes on hover.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.460
The only thing that changes is the color.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.650
That's a good solution.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.990
The hover effects right now transition quite abruptly from one state to another.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.950
It's a very instant jerky jump.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.710
This instant jump might not be much,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.490
but it's too fast for us to register the change.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.000
So it doesn't feel very natural and smooth Web designers in such cases at a little

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.100
transition effect.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.570
So there is a slight time delay in transition.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.230
We can add the transition style from here under a drop down.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.430
You'll see there are many transition types.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.590
It's listing everything that can have a transition effect.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.760
Liken opacity,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.750
often element or a background color.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.850
Not every Salik in transition,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.360
for example,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.890
you see phone name is enlisted because phone change can't be animated on many other

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.450
typography settings can.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.800
In our case,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.760
we want to transition a border color,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.250
which is an available option.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.020
There are two more values.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.080
Duration and easing duration is what it exactly says.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.040
How long does transition take in milliseconds?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.700
The default value of 200 milliseconds is pretty good for most hover of facts that you can

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.450
live it as this.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.230
As for the easing,

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.980
it might look a little complicated,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.310
but they're quite simple.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.180
In reality.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.730
This are sort of different formulas on how fast they go or accelerate and how faster slows

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.730
.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.610
They sort of deceleration when the transition is ending.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.170
Let's leave this to the default ease.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.210
Most of the time,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.550
it works perfectly fine,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.600
and now we view over the novel ings.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.150
You'll notice that border appears and disappears smoothly,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.550
and that's just so much nicer than that jerky transition that was before.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.970
Once more thing to note,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.840
the transition effect has to be applied on the regular state,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.450
not on the Holler State that just house he assess for its okay,

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.850
the same thing we can do for buttons and their background transitions.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.100
Often,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.300
instead of selecting specific transition type,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.320
I actually like to sell our old properties.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.500
This will apply same transition settings to any hover effect.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.370
It's just simpler way to do it.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.710
Instead of looking for a transition type every time we want to apply some sort of different

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.760
Harvard change.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.340
If one element and several properties that change on the Hauer like phone caller background

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.040
color shadows instead of adding three different transition types who can just add one that

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.740
can I apply toe unless we want to transition different effects in different speeds,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.650
but those will be very rare occasions,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:23.390
the same transition,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.790
in fact,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.180
on the other buttons and there we have it all.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.730
Buttons and links transition.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.850
I sent smoothly.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.220
All right,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.500
so let's recap what we did in this video.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.550
We're added hover effects to the links and buttons on our hero section.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.970
The hover states are changed from the states in the Styles panel.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.170
We can change almost any style inside the Harbour State and to make this state changes from

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.210
regular tow horror look nice and smooth.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.050
We can add transitions from effects settings.
