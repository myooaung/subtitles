00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Here's some tapes on pricing.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.630
A lot of freelancers think that clients pick lower prices,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.220
and if that bid low,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.760
they think they're gonna look more attractive for the clients.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.980
Sort of like a bargain.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.570
Freelancers will have the sort of mindset they have,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.960
this negative sort of taste and attitude towards up work and the stuff freelancing

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.260
platforms thinking,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.320
because everybody's now computing for the price.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.590
And there's a lot of pricing,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.450
a lot of people competing with a price.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.400
So everybody's kind of bringing the prices down,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.460
but they couldn't be more wrong if that was true,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.240
then you wouldn't have some freelancers getting paid $500 per hour on up work.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.650
Websites are high value products.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.840
They're not like toilet paper that the chief is gets the most sales.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.750
Businesses are going to use website for their own business so they can get more sales right

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.750
.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630
It's going to represent their company,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.250
represent their business,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.540
and there are brand so they don't want shape.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.570
They won't stand,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.050
aren't they want quality and often they're more than happy to pay for it,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.620
just like a lot of us who are happy to pay 1000 bucks for iPhone instead of paying 100

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.470
bucks for Alcatel by bidding low.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.880
Not only you make less money,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.470
but you also win less jobs.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.960
It sounds counterintuitive,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.700
but clients actually prefer higher prices.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.190
Why?

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.600
Because pricing is one way to tell if something is quality or not.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.780
We know that it's not always true,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630
and we do realize that.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.190
But often we can help ourselves,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.480
right?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.640
So we use pricing as one of the indicators to judge or something is going to be high

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.000
quality or not.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.710
By bidding low,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.190
you're quietly whispering to your clients that your lower quality look at this list of

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.170
proposals lower you scroll more depressing.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.900
The situation looks less qualified people,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.640
no rating,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.020
no Proview's jobs for this presentation,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.580
and you get lower prices on the bottom two.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.250
So being on the bottom doesn't look attractive at all.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.760
The last experience talent is sorted on the bottom,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.730
so lower prices are associated with lower quality.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.450
Just by looking at this list,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.300
this list is a clear indicator to the client that they should be careful with low prices.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.110
In this case,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170
lower prices look like a warning sign,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.220
not a bargain declined.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.340
When I'm hiring freelancers.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.190
I hate the question.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.040
What's your budget?

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.620
Because most of the time I don't know What's my budget?

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.390
I know that I won't something down,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.860
but often I don't know how much is it going to cost?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.530
I don't know.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.950
What's the good value for it to pay?

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.430
So asking that question is gonna put me into this confused state where I don't know how to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.950
answer.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.810
But when you post a job on up work as a kind,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.200
and if you choose a flat,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.420
braid up work is going to ask you what is your budget?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.840
And for somebody like me who doesn't know exactly what's there but what is their budget and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.380
doesn't like to answer the question.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.630
What we do is we try to pick the lowest number that comes to our mind.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.450
Last thing you want to do is to over pay for something.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.850
So if I don't know what something costs,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.950
I will go way,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.660
way lower on my estimates.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.450
Then it's actually going to cost because I really don't want to over pay,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.330
so I don't want to say you know what,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.250
I'll pay 2000 for this job And what if it costs just 300 bucks.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.100
Then I'm gonna assume that freelancers are going to abuse me for me,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.600
kind of putting this high budget.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.120
So now everybody's going to try to take advantage off that,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.980
and they will say,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.130
Oh,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.640
we'll do it for 2000 will do it Maybe 1500 so on where,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.630
in reality,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.800
the job just cost $300.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.660
So to avoid over paying,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.660
you will see that clients often will pay way lower budget,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.470
but then what they're actually willing to pay.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.600
And at the end of the day,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.190
they will be fine,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.320
paying to three times more off.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.860
What they propose is the budget.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.100
So when you see a number on the budget,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.880
don't take it as 100% truth that that's exactly the amount of money available they have.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.780
Sometimes it's true,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.060
right?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.050
Some businesses will have exactly that amount of money available for that project,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.460
but often it's not true.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.270
It just Klein's pulling numbers out of there hats.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.310
And when you see these budgets,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.210
just ignore that and propose what is the project worth to you?

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.410
Unless if you see inside the job description that they explicitly mean that that's their

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.140
top budget,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.550
and that's what they're going to pay
