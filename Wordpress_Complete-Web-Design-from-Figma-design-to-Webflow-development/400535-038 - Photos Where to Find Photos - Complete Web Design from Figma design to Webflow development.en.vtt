00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
All right,

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.280
So where to find good photos?

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.400
There are free and paid sources.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.150
My favorite free stock side is on splash dot com.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.760
You have already used this in the assignments.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.610
There are many size that offer free photos,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.980
but they're not fully free.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.860
They come with some copyright rules,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.800
like you must credit the author or only for personal use,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.720
but for commercial use on splashes truly free.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960
You can do whatever you want with the photos,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.750
and you don't have to credit that author.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.550
Photos on on Splash that come are very realistic looking.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.820
A lot of times they're submitted by individual photographers around the world and not buy

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.250
stock photo studios.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.350
For this reason,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.950
you get very realistic scenarios and people that look genuine and real well,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.090
at least most of time.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.030
Another decent free website that uses pack cells dot com pack cells is fully free as well.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.250
New limitations,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.220
their concept and photo styles are very similar to on Splash,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.050
but you get a bit more diversity here.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.130
Every photo sides have a downside,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.790
though everybody uses them,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.350
and a particularly good looking photo will be used by a lot of people around the world.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.790
So the photos that using your Web designs can easily be used by a lot of other Web

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.350
designers for their websites.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.070
At some point,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.230
when you go through a lot of these freeze photos from on splash or pack cells and other

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.850
places,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.120
you start recognizing them in many different websites.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.640
If the audience sees this photo being used on other websites to,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.480
it sort of cheapens the website.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.990
It's not that unique anymore,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.320
although the same applies to the paid stock sites,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.000
but because they're paid significantly less amount of designers will be using for using

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.270
this photos for the website.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.360
Plus,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.970
the stock sites have way bigger selection of photos than the free sites.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.870
So for this reason,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.750
on well paid projects out definitely recommend you to use paid sources instead of free

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.340
photos.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.450
My favorite from paid stock sizes,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.710
I stock they have one of the best quality photos with realistic looking models and scenes.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.180
But,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.640
of course,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.000
you get fake looking photos here,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.330
too.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.250
It's unavoidable.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.130
As long as people are buying that graph,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.040
I can really put an exact number on how much a photo coast on a stock side because it all

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.350
depends on how many you by subscription plans and sometimes another on the image itself.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.910
I still gives a little on the price,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.550
your side and in much year coast between 9 to $24.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.690
But then,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.730
with bundles and monthly subscription,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.740
you can get a pretty good discounts.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.920
Another good paid sources shutter stock,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.600
and it's much cheaper than I stock.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.060
With their prepaid plans,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.460
you get an image for $10 tops.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.150
Prepaid means buying a pack like $50 for five images.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.120
For heavy users,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.910
you can get a monthly subscription.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.410
You'll get certain amount of free images per month that can come down to $3 per image and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.640
less one of the troopers but decent options.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.230
He's big stock dot com here.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.880
The maximum should be about $3 per image with package bundles.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.860
Unlike others,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.200
big stock has a seven day free trial that gives you 35 images for free during that trial

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.750
period.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.600
Keep in mind,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.770
though,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.340
they ask for a credit card details,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.750
and you have to cancel it before the last day or you'll get charged.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.780
Take all this pricing information with a grain of salt because this are independent

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.140
websites and their pricing can change very often.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.570
And also it will depend on the country where you're from or where you're checking the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.480
prices due to the taxes and be 80.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.570
But in the ballpark,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.050
this is how the pricing works for these three websites and many other paid stock sites.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.880
I have put the links to these websites both free and paid and a little more in the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.660
resources page,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.330
so you can feel afraid to check them up.
