00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
on the right hand side,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.630
where all the panels are.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.250
There's one dedicated for interactions.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.010
There's this toggle for legacy interactions.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.560
That's an old version that Weppler usedto have.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.660
They still keep it there because there are a lot of websites built on it,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.250
and designers still have to use it.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.430
If he accidentally you clicked on it,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.350
make sure to sweep the toggle off.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.220
So what are interaction?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.920
Simply put,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.870
it's when user interact with some object on our page,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.120
and by doing so,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.110
something else happens to this or another object.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.650
By using interactions,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.190
we can have mouse interact with one element.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.590
This is called a trigger and animate another object,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.450
even if it's completely unrelated.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.150
This is called an action.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.650
Every interaction starts with the trigger.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.440
First,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.120
we have to select an element that we want to interact with and then select the type of the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.690
trigger.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.420
For example,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.180
interaction can trigger on mouse,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.070
click or mouse,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.650
hover and other options.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.730
There are also page triggers,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.890
which means we don't have to interact with any particular element.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.230
But an animation can be triggered by page related actions.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.150
For example,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.520
when page loads each trigger type has its own set of options.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.250
For example,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
mouse hover can be triggered either on hover or hover out.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.420
One is when mouse moves on the object in another when it moves away from it.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.160
When we build our interaction,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.130
we have to specify both of this.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.850
What happens on the hover and what happens on the hover out?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.120
And finally you have actions or,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.690
in other words,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.370
animation In the drug Done,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.430
you'll see there are several presets like Fade,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.110
Slide and so own in the first option is the custom animation,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.000
and this is where the magic happens.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.600
Here we can specify which element gets animated,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.710
and we can create entire set of actions that are timed.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.750
And we get this timeline of animation with a granular control over each action.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:10.660
So that's a quick and rough overview of interactions.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.340
Don't be alarmed.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.610
If you didn't catch everything will learn these slowly by doing,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.680
and in the next video,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.930
we'll start with some simple interactions.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.650
Stick around
