00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
in this video,

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.030
we're going to cover buttons and links.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.450
You'll find two types of buttons and elements panel,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.450
and you'll also find two types of links.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.930
This duality got me a little confused in the beginning,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.130
and I had trouble to understand which one to use and where.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.960
So let's clarify why that are two wings and two buttons.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.930
Let's start with links.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.750
Link Block is a regular day block accepted can be linked.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.450
You can put anything inside the link block and the whole thing will be clickable.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:43.020
The tackling,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.580
on the other hand,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.870
is just that attacks link.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.730
You can put anything inside it to link the links.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.350
We select the link and click on the setting step.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.790
This is where we can update ling settings.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.290
1st 1 easy or l where weaken hyping the exact destination.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.770
Next,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.950
we have pages.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.110
This is where we can link to other pages in our website,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.210
and this is exactly the option we would use if this links weren't fake and we actually had

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.950
other pages.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.770
Right now it only shows one page home.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.690
That's where we are.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.050
Next.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.090
We have a page section.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.850
This is when you linked to a specific section on the same page or even on another page.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.290
Right now it's empty.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.770
There's one extracting we need to do to be able to link to a section.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.060
We'll get to that at some point and last to our email and phone links for email addresses

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.050
and phone numbers,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.730
E mail Link will open up a default email client.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.550
That user has sat on their computer,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.260
for example,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.820
like Outlook or Gmail.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.100
And it will open the new male window with email,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.970
address and subject lying pre filled with the values that we have put their.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.830
In my case,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.870
it opened up in Gmail window because that's what I have said as my default email client On

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.550
my computer.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.710
The phone number is for mobile devices,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.900
so the person looking at the side on their mobile device can click a link directly to call

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.830
without needing to copy and type in the digits on a computer.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.030
This is mostly useless.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.150
You'll get the ever message sometimes.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.030
Now,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.750
for the buttons.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.740
We have two types,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.850
a regular button and a form button.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.780
The form button can be style just like a regular button,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.550
but it's linked on Lee to the form and submits the form when clicked.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.770
The regular button,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.620
on the other hand,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.060
works just like a text link.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.830
It has the same link settings,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.100
and just like a tax ling,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.140
we cannot place other elements inside.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.030
This means you can create buttons from text links.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.210
You can also create buttons from link blocks.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.420
And if you want to create a button that has an icon inside or an extra line off tanks than

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.570
linked blocks are exactly what you'll need to use if you ever find yourself lost,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.070
what each element does use,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.260
UM,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.390
or info pop up from the Elements panel.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.120
Each element has a little question mark on top.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.830
Click on it to get a quick explanation what this element does.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.130
And if you're still not sure and want to see that in depth guide,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.130
click on this link.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.250
It will lead you to the tutorial page for that element on Web close website,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.050
and they're very good tutorials.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.480
So back to our button lattes added the button shape.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.730
Our bottom in FEMA has a specific size.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.160
It's 168 pixels wide and 50 pixels height.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.150
We can use this exact values but you'll see that using exact with is not a good idea.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.480
Firstly,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.390
strike to center the tax inside our button.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.390
How do we do that?

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.090
Vertical alignment is quite simple.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.770
We can simply use the tax alignment option and center it.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.370
But for the horizontal alignment,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.450
we have to use patting so we can push the text around until it looks centered.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.810
Now here's the reason why setting an exact with is a bad idea.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.600
He fed simple.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.540
We decide to change tax and read something longer.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.110
That button doesn't adjust,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.050
and text has to overflow a better ways to use the petting value again,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.190
we can grab the padding value right from our designs.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.710
Spacing on the left and right is a 48 pixels.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.250
We can use these values for our button petting.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.850
Remove the with and add 48 pixel padding on both sides.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:26.050
This will make our about the nun fixed,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.330
and it will add up to the size of the text and lastly,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.380
the rounded corners.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.550
This can be changed inside the border section under radios option.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.880
Just like we did in fig.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.580
Now we can just increase this until button becomes rounded completely So,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.110
to recap,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.190
we have two buttons regular and foreign button.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.850
Ah foreign button can only be used inside a form,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.800
and regular button is used for linking to other pages.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.850
Sections on the page email Goodling's phone links etcetera.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.090
We have two types of lengths tech slings and link blocks.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.680
Link blocks are just like Dave blocks empty boxes that can nest many other elements inside

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.680
,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.000
even other do blocks,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.540
but it can act just like a regular link.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.750
As for the text links,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.440
they can nest ending inside,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.550
and they were just like a regular text.
