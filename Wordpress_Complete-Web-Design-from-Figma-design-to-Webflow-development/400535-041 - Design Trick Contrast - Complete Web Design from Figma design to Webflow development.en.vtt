00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
take a look at this page.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.790
This is a very simple design,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.820
yet quite effective.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.790
The descent trick that is used strongly in this composition is called contrast.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.020
It's this contrast between the gigantic headline and smaller paragraph text.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.180
Also Contras.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.100
Between the heaviness,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.230
off the headline and the lightness off the paragraph contrast between black part off the

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.450
headline with blue and contrast between the life background and the big blue button.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.170
I got to say it's a little sloppy on the alignment,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.050
though the contrast is very widely used design trick.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.180
It also helps us create visual hierarchy between the elements,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.200
and it can be expressed mainly in three ways.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.650
Contrast in color contrast in the size big versus small and then contrast in weight like

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.100
heavy vs light.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.940
Let's take a look at another website.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.130
Do you notice the contrast in the color about You do wide phoned and book on a bride red

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.220
background to him.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.870
That's one Bulls,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.550
in contrast,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.970
see the contrast in size and weight between the headline and the text.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.100
Above and below.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.600
It contrast in the design achieves two things,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.670
Usually first,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.980
it helps us establish visual hierarchy on the page and second it creates interest.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.910
Put two identical squares together,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.820
and it says nothing.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.720
It's boring,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.810
but blow one of them to extreme size in comparison,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.450
in thes large contrast between them creates interest.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.740
Now it seems like there's a story behind it or create a contrast in collar,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130
and it becomes instantly more interesting.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.600
Contrast in color is created by using complementary colors.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.840
Purple and yellow.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.650
Here are complementary colors,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.470
and last but not least,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.250
you can create contrast using weight.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.970
So how would you create weight Contras between these boxes by removing the feel on one off

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.850
them and living it with outline stroke Full box feels heavier and empty box looks lighter.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.380
Let's see how it works in practice.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.580
Say we're working on a website for bicycles and we're designing one of the sections.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.250
The client gave us a headline,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.550
a paragraph of text and a photo for one of their bicycles.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.310
Say we don't know where to begin,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.330
but we remember that contrast trick.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.750
Let's see how we can use it.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.850
Let's start with a contrast of weight.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.270
What can we may have a looking and what can we make light?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.330
Why not the headline versus paragraph.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.690
Let's create a nice contrast between them.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.350
We can make the headline extra bold and all uppercase.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.500
We don't have to stop here.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.510
We can actually add await contrast,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.850
even within the headline.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.070
Excellent.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.390
This has made it even more interesting as we apply contrast to the elements.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.580
Yours notice how visual hierarchy starts to take shape.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.970
Okay,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.580
up next.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.350
Let's do the size contrast.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.720
Let's supersize the first part of the headline and see what happens.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.150
Go big or go home right.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.680
Aligned the elements properly,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.310
All right.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.750
It's starting to take shape.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.260
We can use it extreme crop that we have already learned and crop out some parts of the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.940
bicycle.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.320
It's looking pretty good last night,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.170
but least we have color contrast.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.850
There's already one color contrast,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.470
of course,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.510
since background is white,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.510
dark tax than dark bicycle.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.160
Contrast very well with it,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.460
but we don't have to stop there.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.980
We can add an extra color in a part of the headline,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.440
something that will contrast well with the dark text weaken simple.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.110
The orange from the bicycle sit this way will kill two birds with one stone,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.890
one great color countries between orange and dark headline.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.600
And of course,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.650
you already know they sampling the color from the bicycle helps us tie the design together

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.650
.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.490
That's all by applying a simple contrast rate,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.570
plus one photo propping technique.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.330
We went from this to this.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.850
You don't even need a design software for this conduce this in Power Point.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.780
This is my favorite.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.210
Go to tricks in design.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.030
If you ever stock on struggling with making design look interesting at some contrast,

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.490
star beat color Wade size,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.970
and I guarantee you it will instantly improve your designs.
