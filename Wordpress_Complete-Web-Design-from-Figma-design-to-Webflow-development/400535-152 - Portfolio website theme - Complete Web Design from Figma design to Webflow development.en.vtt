00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910
I used to have a company with two of my friends,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.390
and we did a lot of hiring back in the days.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.230
And what most ah,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.000
a lot off candidates would do is they would undersell themselves.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.720
They would come and they would say,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.160
You know what?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.430
Oh,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.670
I'm just a beginner.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.460
I don't have much experience.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.220
Yeah,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.980
buddy,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.200
No,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.220
I'm a quick learner,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.860
but my conclusion is your potential employer is that you suck.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.600
How do I know that you just told myself getting started in any new profession is tough

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.010
because people do want to hire pros.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.900
They don't want beginners.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.300
They won't.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.970
Pros.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.990
That's the truth.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.240
But here's a big mistake a lot of people make.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.030
They think being a pro is someone with years of experience.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.950
Not at all.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.950
A pro is someone who takes their work seriously,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.090
a someone who looks like they can get shit done and someone who wants to deliver great

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360
service to their clients or employers.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.890
So how do you make yourself look like a pro?

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.020
For starters,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.510
you have to show what you can dio and in the Web design that's done with a portfolio you've

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.790
already designed and built to projects in this course,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.850
and that's already something to show for.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.140
But my recommendation would be to do one more project from designed to a building outside

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.740
off this course that's going to give you three portfolio pieces,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.980
and that's enough for you to go out there and start applying for jobs.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.160
And,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.000
more importantly,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.110
doing another independent project is going to give you practice and experience outside of

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.260
this guided course.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.530
But portfolio pieces are not enough to look like a true pro.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.400
We need a portfolio website because what do you think?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.450
Wouldn't that pro Web designer have their own personal website?

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.580
But you'd be surprised that big chunk off Web designers they actually don't they have their

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.920
portfolio on platforms like be hands or dribble,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.240
And that's what they share with their potential clients,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.820
sending that link to their profile with older portfolio work uploaded on there.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.370
But I never do that first.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.920
That doesn't make me look like a pro.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.650
As a freelance Web designer,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.210
you're essentially a business who provides a service to your clients ride,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.400
and no good business would ever do something like that.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.610
It's like being a professional photographer with portfolio only on Instagram.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.190
I want to be a pro photographer who has his own photo studio,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.070
not just instagram profile.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.770
And second,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.120
I'm sending them to a place with other good designers that just a bad idea.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.910
I'm helping them to find someone else.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.850
I'm showcasing my work next to World's best design work.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.350
And even if I was the best candidate available for them,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.310
I don't look so good anymore.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.180
My work doesn't look as impressive next to the world's basketball work,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.800
and third,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.860
I'm losing an opportunity to make a persuasive pitch to them.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.330
With my website right,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.620
I can showcase them my design process.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.930
I can write a very persuasive and convincing content and a copy by to convince them that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.090
you know they should hire me.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.550
I could impress them with my website itself,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.330
and I can prompt them to take action so they can get in touch or submit a form or whatever

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.330
.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.510
Now,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.190
I'm not saying that you shouldn't have profiles on those platforms.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.620
Sometimes you can even find work through there.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.480
But it's not a place to direct your potential clients to.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.300
Plus,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.670
you're a Web designer.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.410
He never thought off making a website for yourself that just doesn't look serious.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.350
It's like being a car mechanic who never owned a car.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.430
Portfolio website can do a lot of selling and pitching for you.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.680
And I had clients are higher me just because they liked my website,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.100
not even thinking or looking at the portfolio webs.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.380
My portfolio pieces,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.790
they just really like the website itself.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.980
So,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.030
knowing from the personal experience how much a good portfolio websites can help,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.450
I have designed and built an awesome portfolio upside for you.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.450
After a lot of thought into this design,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.350
my goal was to give you something that would look very stylish,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.060
serious,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.620
but with a hint of fun off Sprinkle some subtle interactions to show that you're capable of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.650
doing such things.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.940
And I've already at a two point for your piece is that you have done in this course so you

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.850
don't even have to worry about putting them up.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:05.250
And I run a persuasive copy that will do it a lot of pitching for you,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.430
all that to show you that you are a strong,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:24.860
solid professional who can get things done in the next video.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.320
I'm going to show you how to install this website for yourself.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.190
How Teoh add content,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.680
your own content and how to make some customers ations so it so you can make it a bit more

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.270
personal.
