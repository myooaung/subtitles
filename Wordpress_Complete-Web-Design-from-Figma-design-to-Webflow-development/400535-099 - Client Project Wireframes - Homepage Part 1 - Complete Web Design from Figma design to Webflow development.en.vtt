00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
in this video,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.710
we're going to start creating wire frames for our tune collaboration Home page.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.550
Inside the Client Project file.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:25.900
Create a new page by clicking the plus.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.720
I come and name it wire frames.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800
We're going to add a frame and degree the usual way.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.750
We do it desktop frame in our usual 12 point grid.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:48.020
Now that we know how to create styles,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.090
let's save this great style for later use in this project because we can.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.590
So why not will save us time later for us to come up with some ideas on what content and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.650
lay out we should have.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.190
Let's have a look at our project Griffin the Mood Board,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.740
because project briefings were the goal and high level details of the project is and in

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.220
mood board.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.060
We have a Luca and fear,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.950
which we already agreed with our imaginary client,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.450
so the website is going to be pretty standard,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
but the primary goal is to get early access sign ups.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.740
It's going to be our culture action.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.290
We know it's going to have a block,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.560
and we also need a place for people to subscribe to a new Slater.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.690
Now let's have a look at the mood board.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.610
So from the brief,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.310
we know that decline wants a website that is more photographer based rather than

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.350
illustrations.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.450
So I think this sort of background photo approach is something that's going to be liked by

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.550
them and a good approach overall for our target audience.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.820
We could find a photo that audience relates to so they can see themselves in it,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.890
and that's going to help us connect with the audience so raised on that let's wire from the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.650
hero section.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.510
We need a background photo,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.270
not a real photo,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.620
but just a placeholder.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.490
So find an image element and drag it onto the canvas and then resize to fit it to the full

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.950
screen.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.170
Make it around 800 pixels in height.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.250
That's usually a decent sized for the hero section.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:23.850
Now we need a navigation bar logo on the left and the links on the right.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.390
Pretty straightforward.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.950
Let's use having four style for the logo.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:42.650
The link style for the links and secondary button for the call to action in the knob are

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.650
-

00:02:42.650 --> 00:03:21.090
I'm

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.090
going to resize the button to make it smaller because we'll use a regular size for regular

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.750
buttons.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:39.150
Uh,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.050
so far so good now for the headline in the subhead,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:54.800
We're going to choose a heading one style and choose the black color from the wir franc It

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.800
.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.730
It's a good idea to stick to this neutral gray color palette when creating wire frames.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.250
I really like this palette.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.650
Actually,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.350
I stole it from a wire frame till that I used in the past.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.110
And in addition to the blacks and greys,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.690
stick to one primary color from those options.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.950
Or choose your own primary color if you'd like.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.200
But stick to one.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.450
If you want to change the primary color of buttons,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.950
changing their field color on the entire company in one war it because it has mixed content

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.950
.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.620
The rectangle is blue,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.850
but text his wife so you'll have to change the rectangle on Lee.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.230
But the better option is to change the master.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.830
That's why we use components selected instance,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.470
then click to go to master and in there just choose a different color for the background

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.550
off the rectangle.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.410
The same goes for the secondary button changed two colors,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.550
one for the border and one for the text.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.210
In my case,

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.650
I'm going to stick with this original primary color.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.580
All right,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.150
already have content in my mind.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.520
I'm going to steal that headline from this one.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.260
Instant collaboration for remote teams,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.520
as I mentioned before,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.420
were not copywriter,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.720
so we don't need to be perfect with the content,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.940
just anything with thing works and will give an idea to our clients as little dummy text as

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.550
possible.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:23.610
I'm not worrying about distances here too much,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.450
but still making show there are lined.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.960
So now we need to ARJ users to do something,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.260
which is our primary goal to get their emails for early access.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.690
This is commonly referred to as call to action or short city.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.450
A city is either a form or just the buttons.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.250
Let's see what our inspirations are doing in this case.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:57.460
Many of them are using a form with a single email filled.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.380
I think that's what we should do as well.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.600
We could have a pop up form,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.340
but when needs small form is special with a single filled,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.810
it's a batter practice because it's less threatening.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.920
It's right there.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.640
No triggers,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.550
very transparent,

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.770
asks user for Justin email,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:25.550
and they see what's going on and that you go very simply and quickly.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.060
We have a wire frame before our hero section.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.110
Thanks to this wire,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.140
Frankie didn't take us much effort,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.120
and we didn't have to waste time on choosing phones and colors.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.060
This is how you should work with my friends,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.070
thinking about the layout and content and not worrying about the look and feel in your real

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.630
projects.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.700
When you share the wine from to your clients,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.820
you can add comments to different sections and different elements on your page.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.220
Teoh.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.050
Show them your thought process.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.810
To do so,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.360
switch to the commenting mode,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.530
and by clicking anywhere on the frame,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.750
you can add new comments.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:01.450
Clients love seeing the sort of thought process that you put behind your designs because

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.040
when you build a website and design and Pepsi website for a business,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.840
you're not just giving them something pretty to play with your giving them a solution to

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.370
their problem and open your giving solutions to several problems,

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.950
like are generating sales or Leeds or traffic,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.440
creating online presence and good brand and some reputation Ah,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.710
website that looks fancy and modern that you know is going to create a very specific image

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.770
and reputation for that company.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.260
And you need to show that you have a deep understanding off their problems and you have

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.400
come up with some potential of solutions.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.010
In other words,

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.050
you need to sell them on your designs.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.870
You made the first sale by convincing them to hire you for your service is now you're

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.070
making another sale.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.320
You're not done there.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.480
You're making another cell to show them that these designs that you created their great

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.050
solutions to the problems that they face as a business.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.740
And I don't mean this to use some sort of sleazy sales pitch over techniques.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.060
When you're explaining you're designs,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.180
just explain your self like a designer.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.350
And how you thought about this elements that you created,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.260
for example,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.650
that single email field that I put in the wire frames.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.480
I would explain,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.410
they said to the client,

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.240
Something like this.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.440
My suggestion is to use a single email failed for the coal traction and the subscription

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.100
instead of asking first name,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.420
last name and so own.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:29.030
Because one single email field is low commitment from the user side,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.120
it's less threatening and because it's also visible,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.230
were able to fit it,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.810
because if we're before asking for several different things,

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:42.250
then you would have to put probably a proper form because then it would occupy too much

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:42.860
space.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.340
But by showing the field and email failed is visible.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.790
We're showing that were transparent.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.950
This is the only thing with we are asking at the step right now.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:57.150
And this low commitment exchange will increase the overall subscription rate,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.890
and that's it.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.240
Now,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.470
if we didn't do that and if we didn't explain our thought process there,

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.440
chances are they're just not going to know the reasoning behind one fail because they're

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.610
not designers that have been building websites.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:14.840
And they think from the business owners perspective and not from the user's perspective,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.650
right.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.120
So they're going to think,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.770
Wait,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.360
I would like to have more information about the users.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.430
I would like to know their email address,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.530
phone number,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.970
Social Security number,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.350
credit card details and so on.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.470
Now,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.270
because you haven't put all these fields in there and you just put email address,

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.140
they feel that you're being neglectful.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.130
Or maybe you just didn't understand their business challenges and what they want from the

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.600
business,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.730
so they're gonna feel that you're just not getting them and not not offering good solutions

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.540
for their business.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.900
So it is our job as designers to educate our clients about topics like face.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.390
But you can't educate your clients if you don't educate yourself first.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.030
So as an external reading,

00:09:55.030 --> 00:10:02.150
I would recommend you to subscribe to blocks and newsletters that share information and the

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:07.620
latest research and anything new basically about design or user experience,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.910
topics and things like that.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.500
For example,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.830
Noose and Norman Group is one such place.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:17.320
You could subscribe to the often publish articles A and research about user experience

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:17.850
topics.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.070
Also product hyper dot io,

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.560
which has this newsletter that includes It's not that our primary Focus,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.230
but it also includes the top posts block posts,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.040
usually about topics,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.810
off design and user experience,

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.320
and everything.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.990
Sort off Web related.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.860
If you like Books out,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.670
recommend you reading Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug,

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.480
which is a great book about Web and mobile experience,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.630
user experiences and usability in another one.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.530
The design off Everyday Things by Don't Norman.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.870
That's the same Norman guy from the Nielsen and Norman Group,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.390
and it's not really about Web design,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.750
but it's more about attempts and everyday things that we use in real life.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:05.510
But it's a good introduction to the journey off user experience and understanding what you

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.540
have to look for and basically sort of a philosophy behind designing things and objects and

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.020
