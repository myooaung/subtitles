00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
and other obvious but often overlooked option of finding work is networking.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.090
In every big city,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.950
there are swarms off interpreters and start tops that are hassling and trying to make the

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.940
men of their business for and they all need a website.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.350
You're in a very good market.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.050
Every business be small or large,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.060
or international or local.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.990
Even individual professionals like you and me photographers,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.930
coaches Con Murray organizer's They all need a website.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.200
So where do you network start with?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.710
Meet up,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.760
meet up if you've never used it is a place where people organize different events

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.470
surrounding a specific theme or a topic.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.010
For example,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.480
this group least when you axe organizer's different design related meetups and events in my

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.290
city entrepreneur startups,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.300
other designers,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.360
they're quite valuable connections for you in the often go to meetups like this because

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.320
they run their own sort of meet ups and organized their own talks and workshops and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.730
different sort of events that attract right crowd that could be useful for US connections.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.910
Everyone's got a gig out of an event like that.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.410
I once attended a workshop on what have to wire frame my website.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.210
Really,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.210
I actually attended to the water shop on that.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.720
Not that I needed to learn.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.200
But I thought,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.710
You know what?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.800
It's gonna be fun.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.010
And what do you know?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.850
I got a gig out of it.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.440
Even if you meet right crowd in mid tops,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.300
you'll realize that many off them don't have good enough budget to pay you well for website

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.890
projects.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.840
It's good when you're starting and you're fine.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.330
Sacrificing some pay for the experience and network.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.340
But in a later state,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.480
it's not the best option.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.250
A better place to find bigger fishes,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.160
conferences,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.030
tech or other startup related conferences.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.450
Startups often go to places like these to exhibit their product or find investors or find

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.650
customers for their company.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.310
Most of these conferences are paid,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.310
so it's more suitable on a later stage.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.120
Once you get your freelancing going and you can afford a little for the marketing,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.120
many cities will have startup incubators,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.320
and you can check that if your city has such incubators,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.730
because this place is they cannot put a lot of startups together,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.030
and then they are always organizing different events and demonstrations and things like

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.350
that,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.230
and a lot of jobs and freelancing board can be found within this eco system and environment

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.610
and a lot of people who are Web designers,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.060
designers or developers.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.750
These are crowd and good connections for you to develop and grow.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.350
And if you hadn't networking,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.160
then don't do it.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.500
Put your time in F or in something mawr suitable for you and your personality high myself.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.730
I don't like networking.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.800
I'd rather chew glass and go and talk to people.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.140
It's always best to put your efforts in something that clicks with you.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.570
I have one rule for you.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.170
Don't do anything that will make you hate Web design You liking and enjoying Web design is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.400
crucial to your success.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.290
It's a batter factor off making your profitable and successful than any talent or fancy

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.340
university education and your enjoyment.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.900
Awkward designed depends on a lot of things around it,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.380
because just like any other job,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.000
there is much more involved in just sitting down and designing.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.050
Right there is looking for clients and negotiating,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.800
sending proposals and all the meetings and all that stopped.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.610
So make as many off those things enjoyable to
