00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
so far,

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.020
we're rocking a responsive versions in this video.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.430
We're going to style the now bar menu button or,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.640
as school kids call it,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.750
the hamburger menu.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.450
You know,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.550
because that I can sort of looks like a hamburger right now.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.600
It looks quite horrific.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.820
Not to worry styling.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.950
This isn't a big deal.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.820
First,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.600
let's style the button itself.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.320
The many Aiken debts inside can be changed.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.500
We're not stuck with it.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.330
If we want to get our own icon and add that instead,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.980
we can.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.000
We can just delete the icon and add an image element inside the menu button,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.310
which is a simple Dave,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.850
and upload your own icon in SVG or PNG format.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.020
Although there is one benefit of just keeping this default icon because the color is edible

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.550
from the phone settings and this makes it easier to change colors,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.410
we're gonna also build our own menu I can from D Block.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.370
Sometimes I do this.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.810
If I'm building a super snazzy animation for my client,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.500
almost anything is possible in what flow for now,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.570
let's stick with the default I can First,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.200
a collar will need this in white.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.590
We can change the phone color,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.100
toe white,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.350
and that's going to do the job when styling this element.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.570
Stick to selling them menu button element instead of the ICANN.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.250
Next,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.460
let's increase the size.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.870
It's way too tiny.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.660
We can do this again from the phone settings,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.400
and 30 pixels should be good and Lance shrink the padding.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.150
A little planning is what controls how much off this is clickable and visible on the drop

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.550
down,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.600
and lastly,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.310
let's align it with the logo.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.850
We wanted to be centered,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.460
not floating in the air like it is now.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.550
Can we center it?

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.450
We could go on and change.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.330
The NAB are displayed.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.950
The flex marks and do all that.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.250
But a simpler option is to just add a top margin on the bottom and then pull it down.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.370
We got a size this by eye.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.340
You can see it better in portrait view and 27 or something like that seems like a good

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.920
choice.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.250
We don't need to add on our animation here because it displays on Leon Mobil's where we

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.240
don't use a mouse.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.750
So ovaries pointless.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.540
Now let's style the inside of the menu.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.310
Styling blindly isn't nice,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.830
so we can open the menu and style it while open.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.810
We can do that from settings just like any now bar element and go to settings and then

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.970
click open menu.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.350
This will keep them in your open until we style it.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.660
There are two other men.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.560
You type options,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.240
but I'm not a big fan of those.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.930
I like this default drop down version.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.150
It's easier to work with and needs less styling.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.010
Now let's understand the structure of the whole menu.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.030
This knob menu block is exactly the same block that holds all our links in the desktop.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.210
You on desktop?

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.520
It doesn't have any background,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.100
and it's arrange Horace until it.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.840
But if we make any changes to it on desktop,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.750
those changes will be carried down on the mobile of you too.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.850
Same goes for any layout changes.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.740
So if one day you see mobile wings,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.790
arrange oddly check.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.860
If you've made any changes to the desktop version and inside this knob menu block,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.020
we have all the links,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.050
including the button.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.290
So to start the whole menu of first,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.910
we're going to start enough menu,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.150
and then we will style the links inside.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:20.910
Let's give this a different background color are black color from the design looks pretty

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.350
good.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.740
Let's at the same padding on the sides,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.450
like our hero section that way will be consistent with our grid.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.820
Right now.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.250
The links are notched inside a little because they have their own patting,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.790
which we're going to remove once we style the links.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.850
Let's also at top and bottom padding,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.150
but make it 30 pixels instead of 60.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.170
Right now,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.810
we have stars that are being inherited from the desktop,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.240
like the underlying on the harbor and paintings.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.040
Let's fix that padding first.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.310
We don't need side settings,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.650
and let's choose and equal top and bottom to maintain the nice separation between the links

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.650
.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.240
20 pixels look good.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.240
We don't need a hover effect because it's for mobile devices.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.630
How to remove that from the Harbour State,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.550
which we confined here understates.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.470
Don't worry if the menu disappears.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.290
Not sure why this happens exactly,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.790
but we don't actually need the menu to be open.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.170
We can just make the style changes as longest.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:31.590
We have the knave allowing selected click acts under the border style to disable the button

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.150
border.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.660
When you test these,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.390
you'll see that border still appears.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.470
That's because we have this border enable not just don't hover,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.300
but also on a regular state.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.650
So we need to remove it from a regular state as well.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.240
To avoid this funding behavior,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.090
just double track that you have it disabled on both states.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.200
No need to open the menu.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.710
Just go inside the Navigator and select the NAB link.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:05.350
And they're now we got no holler.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.500
Okay,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.310
now the button.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.700
First,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.350
let's get rid of the left margin.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.930
Next,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.090
Let change display to in line block.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.250
Right now it's set to block.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.750
That's why it's stretching like that.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.350
For some reason.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.000
The button alliance in the middle.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.680
That means some sort of property on the parent element is doing this.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.350
There are two properties that could align it to the center.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.110
First of flax books lay out,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.440
but our never menu isn't flax box,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.500
so that's not it.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.750
And second is a regular text alignment.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.260
And that would make sense because England block elements can be aligned using text

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.850
alignment.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.730
But if we check the text alignment off the knave menu,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.860
it's set to left,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.470
and this is deceptive because in reality it's not set to left.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.980
If you change the property something into something else and then put it back to the left

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.850
alignment this time it will do what it says.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.470
This looks like an issue from wept flow.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.330
I might be wrong,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.040
but it looks like there is a default central alignment on the knave menu block and wept.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.870
Flow does,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.550
for some reason,

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.400
doesn't reflect this in the styles.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.390
Whenever you come across with something like this,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.580
just follow your logic and what you see it doesn't make sense.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.080
Then play with the styles,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.000
and sometimes you'll notice that they're just pretending.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.830
All right,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.200
let's decrease the margin off this,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.650
but earn to match the rest.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.110
The spacing we use between lynxes 20 pixels top plus 20.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.870
But Tom Total of 40.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.080
So let's ah,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.670
total days to 40 here,

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.950
20 from the last link and 24 the top margin.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.770
And same for the bottom margin.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.680
The rial space on the top is 30 pixels from the menu padding and 20 pixels from the knave

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.810
ling patting to match this 50 pixel total.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.850
That's add bottom 20 on the button,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.930
and there that's looking good.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.440
We can keep the hover effect here.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.150
We don't need it,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.490
but neither is doing any harm.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.620
And sometimes some buttons.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.400
It's quite nice when you press it and it's sort off changes the state.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.130
Finally,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.780
let's at the same background color on the hamburger.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.820
Now for this.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.150
It's important that we add that background color on the open state,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.010
because if we add a background on a generic state,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.050
then we'll get the background when menus even closed.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.160
Changing styles for the open state is sort of like changing styles for the hover state.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.080
It has to show this green label,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.390
but the open state is not listed in the states.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.080
Drop down.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.930
Instead,

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.350
open state needs to be enabled from the settings by opening our menu.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:43.190
Now you can see the open label appears.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.490
This means edits that we make now will be reflected on Lee on the open state.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.130
Keep it in mind just opening the menus and enough.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.730
Make sure this green label is there.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.400
Sometimes it malfunctions,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.700
and you might have the navigation menu open.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.050
But this open state label doesn't show up,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.080
which means whatever you're going to add it,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.980
it's not going to add it on the open state,

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.250
so you might need to refresh the designer.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.100
Now we can change the background color and also less around the top corner,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.770
so it looks more polished.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.990
But instead of rounding all four corners,

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:19.650
we're just going Teoh around the top to and have the bottom two flat.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.020
This way they will kind of connect with the menu to do so.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:31.570
We're going to need to select the individual corners option inside the borders and then

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.450
selects the top two and then put them something like six pixels.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:41.750
Let's test our results in the preview,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:46.450
and that's all looking great.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:53.380
It's also looking great on the portrait view.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.360
We don't need to change anything except for one small detail.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.380
