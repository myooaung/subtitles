00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
before we create wire frames,

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm gonna teach you to futures off Fig Ma that we haven't covered yet.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.250
We're gonna need them to create our wire frames.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.030
This our styles and competent in this world video,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.630
we're going to cover styles.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.650
You know how in web so we can style classes and tax.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.250
We can do something similar in fig my as well.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.830
For example,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.890
let's take a heading and style it under these dots.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.130
We have option for textiles if we click on that.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.910
Plus I can.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.630
This will create a new textile from the currently selected text.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.530
We can name it H one similar to what we doing Web flow in styling all h one text.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.250
Now we can take any other tax and apply h one style to it.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.890
In the properties panel,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.130
you'll see that a lot of taxed editing options are disabled like the phone size line.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.570
Hide and others are gone.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.050
But we still have thinks like feel color and tax alignment.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.710
They don't become part of the textile,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.300
so they can always be edited.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.090
And it's not going to affect the tax dalits out.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.450
It will be applied only to that instance If this was Wetklo,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.620
we wouldn't be able to do this.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.450
Everything would be edible and reflected on all instances with the same tag or class.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.400
Inside the interface.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.290
Designers like Thing about this behavior makes more sense to edit a style,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.150
click on it and then go to the edit style.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.790
We have an option to edit the style from here.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.340
You can change whatever you like,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.970
and you will see changes to the star instantly reflect on all of the instances.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.560
This doesn't seem like much,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.140
but when you have several pages with multiple headlines on each page,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.430
then you realize how big this is.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.050
We also have an option to detach the style that's going to let you added all the tax

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.890
properties and any future changes to the original tax ties.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.710
Not going to affect the second headline because it's now detached from the textile.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.120
If you want to delete the style,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.160
that's not very evident,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.550
but right click on it and you'll get a delayed option.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.460
Textiles are not the only thing we have in fig ma.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.830
Almost every other property the panel can have.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.040
These global styles feel stroke of facts.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.920
Even the grid the second most useful is always the colors.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.490
Dallas.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.480
From the same place,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.880
you can add a new color style and just like tax styles,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.490
it can be applied All other elements that have color Property doesn't matter if its textile

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.130
rectangle just like textiles.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.180
Cooler stars are big.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.600
I often end up changing color several times while designing the website.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.900
Better pick it with colorists and can change my mind easily.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.550
God bless the color styles,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.660
so that's the styles,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.190
and Sigma applies to nearly everything feel.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.110
Caller attacks,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.520
layout grade up.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.860
Next,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.300
we're going to cover components.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.080
Stick around.
