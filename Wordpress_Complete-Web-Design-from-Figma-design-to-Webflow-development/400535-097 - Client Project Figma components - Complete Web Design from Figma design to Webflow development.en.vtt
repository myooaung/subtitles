00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
Let's create a button.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:14.850
Now,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.930
if we select this button and click this create competent on the toolbar,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.550
this will turn this button into a confident,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.610
which we can reuse across our file and drag them any time from the competent.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.140
Stab confidence in fig MMA are the group off elements.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.180
So with styles,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.510
recreate this global connection for one particular style.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.890
But with components,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.420
we can create a global connection for several stars and every single other object that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.750
inside that component,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.950
the original button is called the master Competent in the one we just dragged is called the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.650
instance.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.250
Changes that we made to the master will be reflected on every single instance,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.850
but each instance individually can override the styles for themselves.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.480
However,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.260
the changes are not going to be reflected back on the master or any other instance,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.640
you know,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.130
sort of like combo classes in Web flow and just like public classes.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.870
New changes to the master will effect on Lee the styles that have not been overridden.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.940
So the first instance did change the color to the green,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.340
just like the master did.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.020
But the other two billow,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.480
didn't Why?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.960
Because on the two below.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.560
We have over eight in the background feel off the button,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.580
but on the 1st 1 we didn't touch it.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.540
So it's still inherits from the master of competent until we override it.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.790
And a doctor like combo classes in West Low Other stars that we didn't touch and didn't

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.650
override will still be inherited from the master.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.700
For example,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.750
if we around the corners off the button,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.280
one big difference between classes and weapon components and Fig Mayes that classes don't

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.870
have other elements inside.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.480
For example,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.740
if you create a class for a hero section and you put headlines,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.510
buttons and images inside,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.150
those elements are not part of the class,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.410
but in fig mark components,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.050
they are.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.060
So if I delete an object from the master company,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.750
it will be deleted from everywhere.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.150
If I had a new object inside the master that will reflect every other instance,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.610
there are things you cannot override on the instance.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.480
For example,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.570
whatever is the competent made off you can remove or add new layers.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.780
Inside the instance,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.030
I can track this rectangle inside the instance that doesn't let me and neither I can remove

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.670
an existing layer from the company when I pressed too late on any of the ingredients.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.990
It does disappear,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.270
but it actually is only hidden,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.440
and you can see that in the layers how the layer is still there.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440
It's just hidden.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.120
If I want,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.350
I can show it from here.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.760
Another thing.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.830
We cannot override the structural changes,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.540
like sizes or the position off the layers inside the come competent.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.500
As you can see when I select Direct and Bill,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.570
there are no sigh of resizing handles.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.830
I can't change that,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.600
however,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.850
were able to change the size off the entire competent,

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.160
so the resizing off the rectangle is not possible but resizing off the whole component.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.010
We can do that.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.170
If I change the sides off the master company,

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.250
it's not going to cascade down to the blue button because it's overriding it.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.720
But that's only for the full,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.560
competent size.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.190
If I change the size of the rectangle itself,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.260
that blue button is now helpless and will have to obey neither.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.050
I can change the position of the tax inside the instance.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.820
There's no way for me to move it now.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.490
It's for things that we can override.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.100
We can override the styles off each element,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.450
whatever they may be.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.960
We can override the size of the entire competent,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.550
like I mentioned previously,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:57.640
and we can override the content and again if we override it,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.290
then whatever we changes we make to the master component,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.840
it's not going to be reflected.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.460
As you can see,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.700
the other two buttons instantly updated their attacks,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.850
but the blue button didn't.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.350
We're also able to detach instances from their confident he can do that from here,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.840
wants detached.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.210
It stops being the competent,

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.550
and they're completely free and independent layers.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:26.090
Another thing we can do with instances it's to reset.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.310
The changes we've made to the this option here will reset every single change we've made to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.880
the instance and inherit everything from the master.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.580
We also have an option to reset only particular properties if we select the rectangle and

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.530
go to the reset option again,

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.800
the drop down highlights all the styles that have been overridden,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.150
and we can reset them independently.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.100
For example,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.010
we can reset on the background Fillmore.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.060
We can resettle the override on the rectangle without touching any changes that have been

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.750
made to the tax inside the button.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.420
If you have a closer look at the players panel,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.920
you'll see that master component has thes diamond.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.300
Aiken,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.130
with four squares in the instance,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.360
has this single Diamond Aikens to locate the master competent.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.990
You can select any instance and click go to Master competent from the properties panel.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.350
This will work even if the competent is on a different page.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.140
But one war give.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.250
It's in a different file.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.700
Competence are part of individual files to add a company,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.960
and you can either drag them from a competence panel.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.350
Or you can just copy pace either master or an instance.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.720
If you want to create a new competent,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.330
for example,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.650
like primary button and secondary button,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.130
first detach it from the competent and,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.720
frankly,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.050
create new competent.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:49.540
If you in statically create competent on a live instance than that just going to create a

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.950
new component with an instance as part of it,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.140
this gets weird,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.030
so make sure to detach it first.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.430
Alright,

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.220
that's all for now.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.280
You'll get a handle competence with practice,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.770
and we're going to start that practice by wire framing in upcoming videos
