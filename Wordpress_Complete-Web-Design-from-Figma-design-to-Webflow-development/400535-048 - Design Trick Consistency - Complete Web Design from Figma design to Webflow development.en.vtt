00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Do you know what's the easiest way to tell good design from bad one?

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.480
It's through consistency.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.520
Looking at the website and noticing how consistent the layout,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.550
typography,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.280
colors and all that ace inconsistency is very easy to tell.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.490
We are wired to recognize patterns and everything we look at and noticing breaks in those

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.920
patterns.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.470
It's very easy for us to tell.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.380
Breaking the pattern is sort of like a glitch in the Matrix,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.490
and sometimes it's hard to tell exactly what's breaking that pattern.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.980
Yet it's always easily noticeable.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.500
Often it's better to use poor design and be consistent with it,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.850
then have nice design and be not consistent.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.250
Consistency isn't really a trick,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.280
but more like a design principle.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.550
So I'm cheating here a little bit by including this as one of the design tricks.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.580
Consistency applies to everything about broken in down in several categories for easier

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.250
understanding.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.890
First and most obvious,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.400
one is layout consistency.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.630
This is exactly a purpose of the great.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.570
The great is a great way to create consistency and layout.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.550
When alignment repeats on the page,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.700
users notice it and start expecting things to be laid out in a certain way.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.290
when this expectation is met,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440
the users have a joyful experience of the site,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.050
and they trust the side of on more.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.600
One way I see what designers are from break layout consistencies by mixing different Texan

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.580
alignments together.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.870
Both three elements on this frame are aligned in the center with each other,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.860
or at least their containing boxes are,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.330
but paragraph tax is left aligned.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.250
This is breaking the layout consistency and making the design looks sloppy.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.150
We have to choose one style off alignment and stick with it.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
Either we center align everything or left aligned them.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.550
Either of these options are fine as long as we stick with one alignment.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.680
This is an evident example more central and non evident examples when we have inconsistency

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.110
between different sections of the page.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.640
For instance,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.980
the middle section has the content left aligned,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.600
but other sections have it center aligned.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.920
This would be completely fine if this was a different type of tax,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.960
a second or a headline or other,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.300
but it's the same headline,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.750
but with a different alignment.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.820
This is quite satellite as it spread between different sections.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.200
As we scroll through a page,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.510
we only see one section at a time,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.590
so such a subtle inconsistency isn't too big of a crime.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.550
But it's a good habit to stick to one style across different sections and even across

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.050
different pages of the website.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.380
Creating consistency and typography is quite simple.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.770
We just need to create specific phone stars for each occasion and then stick with it.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.010
Your website has several different types of tax.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.300
There are main headlines.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.200
Those are usually the biggest size.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.840
Then you have smaller level headlines like titles and subtitles.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.820
You have obviously the paragraph tax,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.750
and you have buttons.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.560
You can have more,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.040
for example,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.500
tiny captions and footnote tax menu links.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.200
And so on.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.950
The keys to define a single style for each occasion and stick with it.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.510
For example,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.590
having one paragraphs dive and keep with it across sections,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.100
pages and everywhere on the side in fig mine in my flow.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.210
This tax stylings actual one of the future,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.550
so we will practice greeting to text colisee now riel projects,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.980
color consistency almost doesn't need any explanation.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.150
It is the most evident and simplest to see most of the time.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.420
We're working with existing brand in the logo this means cars have been defined for the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.970
company,

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.980
and these colors have to be consistent not just within the website but across.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.740
It's all representation flyers,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.410
business cards,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.110
PDS,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.860
front office and so on.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.870
In times where we don't have defined Brent colors,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.530
then we do this ourselves.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.000
We usually choose one or two primary colors,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.270
like the blue and green in this example.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.700
In the rest of the cars are monotone,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.490
blacks,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.120
grays and whites.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.720
One way we might break consistencies by mixing different shapes on the page on a page like

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.090
this that has this smooth,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.530
rounded,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.750
wavy edge.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.120
Introducing an angle shaped like these would break the consistency,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.650
making it look very odd.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.550
But keeping with the same smooth shapes would create the consistency across the page.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.720
He doesn't have to be same exact shape.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.350
As long as the shape has similar characteristics.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.670
Decent consistency with shapes can actually happen in very unexpected places.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.330
For example,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.750
when we use cutouts like this,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.820
they create smooth that just on the page they're not evident.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.660
But they're there,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.000
and when we place and none cut out regular books photo in the next section,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.690
we are introducing a new,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.100
conflicting shape all over san them from smooth,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.130
natural adjusted going to very strict straight hard lines.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.050
And it even created this new shape that wasn't there before.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.940
Just like I mentioned in optical illusion.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.090
Lesson placing objects and shaves on a black canvas will effect that canvas and create new

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.700
shapes.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.830
This is especially true two straight lines and rectangles.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.980
But if we use cut out again than those hard lines and foreign shapes disappear in,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.950
the section becomes consistent with the above hero section.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.510
When he comes to photos,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.330
we have to be consistent with the style of photos as well.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.020
By style,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.190
I mean sort off a photographic style like collars filters the way models look and so on.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.430
In this example,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.220
for instance,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.460
I didn't do a good job at choosing same style photos.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.360
The left one has more polished look,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.390
whereas the second is more natural.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.680
The camera work seems quite different to I'm not a photographer,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.490
but I can notice that this is not taken in the same studio nor by same photographer.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.620
Most of these photos will have very different style between that,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.140
because they are taken by different photographers and indefinite different scenarios it can

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.170
be quite tricky to maintain consistency,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.150
but there is a way one way is to pick images from the same contributor.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.300
I mentioned this before.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.730
Many stock sides will have this option to see photos from the same contributor meaning from

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.010
the same photo studio photographer.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.310
And if we pick photos from the same contributor,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.140
then we will more or less get the same results because the same photographer will have sort

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.840
of same style,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.350
same camera and same habits of taking photos,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.760
although not 100% is the same,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.570
because sometimes they will have just different shoots and different ways of shooting in

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.430
different scenarios.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.380
So also,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.600
their styles can change from year to year.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.450
There's a very simple and excellent way to make your design consistent and show that it's a

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.530
high quality design.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.240
I know this sounds like an insane detail to pay attention to about when it comes to design

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.240
,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.890
Devil is,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.520
and details attention to this tiny to tell us is what differentiates and mediocre designer

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.280
from a top notch one one final place I want to discuss consistency is I consent

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.090
illustrations.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.840
Web is full of icons and illustrations.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.140
They are an excellent way to show different actions,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.190
demonstrate some complicated concept or simply to give a design a unique look,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.190
just like photography.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.130
Combining Aikens with different styles were created very inconsistent and unpolished.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.350
Book Not fun.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.210
As a matter of fact,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.720
I consent illustrations are even more unforgiving than regular photos.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.490
In this example,

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.150
the third icon is a different style than first to.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.640
It's the same color palette similar around the chains,

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.160
but it still looks out of place.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.530
The difference is only in one small detail.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.040
In fact,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.300
first to Aikens have outlined stroke on them.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.730
It's that black line that appliance each object in the drawing,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.470
but 3rd 1 doesn't have it,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.550
and it creates a completely different look.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.400
In this example.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.090
Three icons are from the same pack and have the same exact style,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.460
although the same size,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.740
the first to have thinner lines when the last one is a little thicker.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.040
Third,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.590
Aiken is poking my eyes,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.150
and non designer client will notice exactly what's wrong with it.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.330
They might not be able to put a finger on it,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.250
but they will pick up such inconsistencies and will not feel like the design is very good

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.980
to avoid such inconsistencies in icons and illustrations,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.240
just like with stock photos,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.330
Pick them from the same source.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.480
My favorite place to get,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.340
I concedes flat.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.420
I conduct calm.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.450
Aikens here and elsewhere are usually organized by packs.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.080
All Aikens within the same pack are going to have the same style sizes,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.470
thickness,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.550
off lines and all that.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.400
When picking Aikens for your projects,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.520
look for packs rather than individual.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.850
I comes from different packs.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.510
This will give you a look that is consistent and polish and will have you designing like a

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.960
pro.
