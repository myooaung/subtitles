00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
all right,

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.620
so now we need to build the testimonial section.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.510
We've decided to use the sort off slider,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.060
sometimes called carousel or just cider a carousel slider.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.540
To build that in Web flow,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.550
we need to use a very handy competent,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.810
called logically,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.550
a slider.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.150
In this video,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.510
we're going to get to know to the slider competent,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.150
and then we'll finish up the testimonial section in a later video.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.840
Let's start with the usual section container.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.450
So on,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:48.490
then at a heading.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:58.180
Now let's add a slider,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:07.430
which we confined under confident section or just searching inside a quick finder.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.280
This is a slider at pre made confident,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.400
which has a lot of freedom to be customized,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.230
but it does have its limitations.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.330
Sometimes as almost with everything in weapon,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.650
Opri made competence aren't the only way to create such layouts or competence.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.290
We could build our own slider from scratch,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.450
but it's a bit more work,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.820
and these pre mate slider does a damn good job.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.850
For most of the time,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.310
Slider takes up a full with off its parent container,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.040
so if we move it right on the body outside of our container and the section that it will

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.250
stretch edge dredge.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.950
Let's see what it's made off.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.470
There are four elements inside.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.120
First is mask.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.670
This is where our slides go.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.310
Right now,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.220
there are two default slides inside.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340
Off course were not limited to two.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.850
Then we have a left and right arrows reach are linked blocks with an arrow,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.510
icons inside and the last we have the slider navigation.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.350
They started the white dots that you see in the middle.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.850
They're clickable and will take you to that corresponding slide.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.120
The slide itself is just a good old of block.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.290
Nothing particularly special about them.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.870
They can be styled as any other day block,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.430
and we can drop any other element inside them.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.590
Let's change the background off its slide so we can see better.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.350
What's going on?

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:38.390
Check that in the preview mode.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.570
Two slides,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.850
red and blue arrows and the navigation dots switch between the slides.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.550
Basically,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.290
what's happening is that there are two diff blocks sitting next to each other horizontally

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.290
,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.670
and controls move between these day blocks with some animation,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.350
that's all.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.080
There are multiple ways we can switch between the slides inside the designer.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.810
We can do that by using controls.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.510
But we can switch by directly selecting the slide from the Navigator or from the slider

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.210
settings,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.750
which has its own arrows.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.620
More from this drop down where we can select exactly the slide we want.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.850
That's how we switch between the slide so we can edit them individually.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.410
We have two options to add slides.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.830
First,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.960
we can add a new slide from the Settings panel by pressing at slide.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.810
To be able to see the slider settings,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.750
you have to have some element off the slider selected.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.770
As you can see now,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.910
we have three slides.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.630
Thes has added a new slide.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.100
Do block inside the Navigator to the second option is to duplicate the slide element,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.100
either by right click and duplicate or the usual control.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.580
C control deleting slides happens in a similar way.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.450
Select a slide either on the cameras or in the Navigator and hit Delete key.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.180
Since the slide is just a regular deadlock,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.040
we can add other elements inside,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.290
like tax images,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.450
buttons and so on.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:10.900
We have just added this into the first line.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.000
The second blue slide is going to be empty.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.650
We can add similar or different content in the blue slide to So that's the slider.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.440
In the next video,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.450
we're going to turn that ugly slider into pretty carousel made of testimonial cards.
