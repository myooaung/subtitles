00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
finding work online is not the only place,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.800
and we have a lot of jobs available locally as well.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.670
In one such place would be studios,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.150
So this would be marketing agencies,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.320
digital agencies,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.980
creative agencies,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.150
a design studios.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.510
I don't know.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.210
There's many 1,000,000 different names that they have.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.650
Basically,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.850
these are companies that do Web design and digital work for their clients,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.330
wherever maybe individual or company clients,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.620
right?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.510
So if they are advertisement agencies,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.040
for example,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.270
right,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.430
the marketing agencies there being hired by some big company that they need a lending page

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.410
or than the website.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.970
So this sort of studios,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.710
then they hire they do have in house staff,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.010
right?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.650
Obviously they do have in his house designers and in house developers and all that.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.840
But what happens is many middle,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.850
sort of medium,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.540
medium sized agencies like that and studios.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.550
They have,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.810
like a small amount of staff in house,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.360
and they have like an hour meal flare freelancers.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.150
They do most of their work,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.080
so that's how they sort of work.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.920
My biggest work engagement was actually with such studio,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.610
and we work for a long time,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.410
and there sent a a ton of work for me,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.970
and I've learned a great deal from them.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.670
And that doesn't mean that they have to be local studios that can be from different

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.040
countries,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.470
different cities and even different continents.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.810
I myself worked with with the studio that was in Australia and really,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.920
really far from where I live,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.760
which is in Europe,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.780
in Portugal now,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.220
how you can approach the studios will depend case by case.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.550
But here are some strategies on how to approach them.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.680
I have a friend who is an illustrator,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.420
and he has this approach.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.000
Where is once I asked him,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.170
You know,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.310
how do you get your clients?

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.590
Because he doesn't work on floor of freelancing platforms,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.480
and he told me that he just spams them.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.700
So he has this email list off different potential clients,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.560
like agencies,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.090
company's advertisement agencies,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.970
publishing books or magazines,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.720
because those are the type of clients that he works with.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.680
And every time he needs work,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.390
every once in a while he will blast email using some email software,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.220
and basically he will inquire for work,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.670
saying like,

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.800
Oh,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.330
do you guys need an illustrator or something like that?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.890
And I'm not sure exactly what's the taxi users and how he approaches.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.690
But I know he just,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.890
you know,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.670
inquires and asks if they need an illustrator.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.430
And what happens is more off sometimes at the exact toe that time one off these companies

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.140
will need an illustrator for at that exact time.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.900
So they come back to him saying that,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.170
Oh yeah,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.550
we actually do need an illustrator and he gets hired and it's a great approach because this

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.750
saves the other the other guys time so they don't have Teoh post the job on freelancing,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.260
platforms or whatever.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.650
Go through different peoples part four years and interview them.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.050
Hire them all that.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.550
It's really easy when somebody already came to you at the exact right time,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.170
every design studio will have their own sort off style off designed that they do on

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.740
websites,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.100
right?

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.600
They'll have specific approaches with the designs.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.680
They might be a bit more illustration based designs Might be more photography might be more

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.110
typeface and layout based design,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.450
right?

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.910
So when you approach this where you decide to approach this design,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.510
studios go through their examples off work and most of them obviously will have their

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.320
portfolio work on their website,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.210
go through them and understand and kind of kneel down what sort of style they use and then

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.270
approach those that you match the style or refine your part for you in a way that you're

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.700
kind of bridging that gap between your work and their portfolio to make it match as much as

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.440
possible.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.730
Because we knew then applied to the studios,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.830
they're going to see if they have later no dozens and hundreds of different candidates

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.760
they're looking for.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.660
Obviously,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.890
they're going to be leaning towards and picking somebody who really matches their style

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.130
because they know that they will.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.980
You will easily plug in into their design into their workflow so they don't have to train

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.080
you.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.110
If you're liken more illustrator and they're more into,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.890
like photography based websites now,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.560
they would kind of have to retrain you on how to do photography.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.210
Or they might.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.200
They will need to kind of completely challenge and alter your design style.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.950
So bridge that gap between there and your portfolio and you'll increase your chance itself

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.050
being hired by them.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.730
When I was managing company,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.910
we had this vaccine see posted online and we had in the whole bunch of candidates obviously

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.660
applying for it.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.040
But one of these guys,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.970
one of the candidates,

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.000
showed up a tower.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.220
Doorsteps just showed up in our office and had a printed resume and CV off his.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.550
And he just handed this.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.670
He setting like Ohio.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.310
Just you know,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.790
I was applying for this job ad,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.130
and I just wanted to hand it my CV personally.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.900
And I was like,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.640
I was very surprised but very impressed as well.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:03.800
To see these guys kind of confidence and audacity to kind of show up in calm and apply for

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.140
the job at in person.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.190
And when I had to go through 200 different job applications,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.550
one person really stood out.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.210
Obviously,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.960
because he showed up no one else date and no one else did anything differently and funny

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.240
enough,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.470
I would probably dump his application if he hadn't showed up because he's CV and his

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.920
application wasn't strong enough,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.850
and his experience wasn't good enough for what we're looking for.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.610
But because he showed up,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.080
he was just,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.320
you know,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.030
memorable.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.320
And I kind of like that confidence and he's sort off proactive attitude,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.560
and he got the interview.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.530
He actually skipped into re apartment,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.770
got to the final phase final selection phase with the three other finalists.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.800
And he got that on Lee because he showed up.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.150
Sometimes all it takes to just show up and handing your printed portfolio because not many

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.140
people are doing that.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:58.300
People who hire their BZ and they appreciate any extra step that the candidate will take No

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.330
one can get you closer to the job opportunity than the people inside the studios using

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.420
LinkedIn and Facebook.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.230
You can definitely find people who work inside those studios and then connect with them

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.030
directly,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.090
using other social networking sites probably like Facebook,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.760
instagram,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.910
Twitter and direct messaging them.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.160
I myself have never done this,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.590
but I know a lot of freelancers.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.610
They do things like that.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.170
They connect with people inside.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.560
Even those were actually,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.780
you know,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.570
hiring the managers or the founders off the studios.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.660
If you're that kind of person,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.930
and if you can easily connect with strangers,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.650
give it a shot.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.970
I'm not that kind of person,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.040
and it doesn't work for me,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.310
but maybe would for you.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.040
So just throwing it out there as an idea
