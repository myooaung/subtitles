00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
our webpage design and build is full of finished.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.460
Now we have last bits toe finish up and then publish.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.990
First,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.750
we need to set the S E O settings and CEO stands for search engine optimization.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.530
And it's set of practices on how to make a page more appealing to search engines like

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.550
Google being and Duck Taco,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.840
especially the doc.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.400
Taco S E O is a whole separate field and we're not going to dive into the details in this

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.820
course.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.880
However,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.380
there are some things that we absolutely have to take out for stars.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.000
This our title and matter description off the page,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.190
they saw what usually show up when your page appears from Google.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.080
This is title and this is meta description.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.220
If you don't set this up.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.670
Google Thatcher random tax from your page.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.970
Well,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.170
not entirely random.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.260
It has its own rules,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.420
but we want to be in control off this and choose what exactly would like to display these?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.340
We can change under page settings,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.750
which would confine inside pages panel,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.150
go to the page you want to edit in this case,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.860
the home page,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.870
all other pages we have for our side will appear here,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.760
and each of these pages have their own individual settings,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550
which can be accessed from this gear.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:22.110
I can let me collapse these settings so we can go through them under General Group.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.480
We just have a page name.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.990
These page name is what shows up in Web flow.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.290
It's an internal name,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.000
so you can name anything you'd like here under s CEO Settings will have to values title

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.750
tack and meta description if we leave this title blank,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.130
then wept.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.180
Flow will use the page name by default.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.470
Is you typing this field?

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.430
You'll see a search result preview,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.850
which is a good way to nail down that awesome title and description.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.290
There are many different ways to name your pages on home pages.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.040
It's common practice to put the name of your company or a product first and followed by

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.550
some sort of tagline.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.500
For example,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.090
chat up simple team chat application and inside the description failed.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.850
We're going to describe the page.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.110
So since this,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350
the home page will describe the product itself,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.610
Google and other search engines will truncate description beyond certain character count,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.520
usually after 155 characters open graph settings are similar to S E O.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.230
But this is information that shows up when sharing content on social networks like Facebook

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.230
,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.640
Twitter,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.990
LinkedIn and Pinterest.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.780
For example,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.280
when you share a link to a car you just bought Facebook and pull title description and even

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.050
a photo from the open graph settings off that page.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.370
If this settings are empty than Facebook will pull random information or sometimes no

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.450
information at all.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.570
We can put custom title and description,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.800
but we can also check this options to make them same as S e.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.250
O is for the open graph image.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.900
For that,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.350
we need to insert a link to the image,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.990
which means we have to upload the image somewhere and then get the link.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.740
We can upload image right on west,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.500
flow in our assets and then get the euro from there,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.250
Or just use already uploaded image in Get the link for it.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.760
We can get the link under the skier.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.410
I can then click this link icon so the image opens in a new window.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.350
This is a euro off this image,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.740
which is uploaded on weapon.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.820
Oh,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.550
servers.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.750
Copy this your l and pasted in the image felt.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.270
Now you can see a preview of how it might look like when the link to this page is shared on

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.350
social networks.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.100
Two other settings are not related to ASIO.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.850
The site search settings,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.510
which might seem like there s you and Google Search related,

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.170
but they're not.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.560
It's actually about search functionality within our website.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.220
You see,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.870
we're able to add search competent on our website where users can search the contents of

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.610
our website.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.950
This is useful if we have content based website like blawg e commerce,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.080
something where a search makes sense on small websites like a company website or report for

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.350
your side's not really needed.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.750
The last option is custom code.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.440
It's not going to show anything right now because you'll need to add a hosting plan to

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440
unlock this future.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.740
It looks something like this Custom code gives us an ability to add our own external code

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.660
to the page.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.720
Usually it's for like third party applications that we want to connect to our webpage or

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.640
some sort of JavaScript plug ings or anything that is usually external things like trackers

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.640
,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.960
analytics and old,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.930
those kind of stuff so to recap each page on our side has S CEO and other settings were

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.470
used title and meta description to control how our page shows up in search results on sites

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.110
like Google.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.010
In addition to these,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.460
weakens that open graph settings,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.020
which is sort of a CEO,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.340
but social media networks like Facebook,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.400
Twitter and so on.
