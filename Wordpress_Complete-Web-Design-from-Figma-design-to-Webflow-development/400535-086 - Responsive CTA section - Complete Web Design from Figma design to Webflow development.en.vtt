00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.720
A call to action section doesn't look bad right off the bat.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.365
We can make a couple of tweaks to increase the size of the image a little.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:09.870
First, I think that headline is a little too big.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.565
It wasn't an issue on the above section where there was more space and smaller texts.

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:17.670
But here it gets hard to fit more than one word per

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.050
line is a good rule of thumb to use if you can fit at least two words per line.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.375
And the font size might be too big.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.950
If we're doing a full website,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.470
we would hit more limitations of this headline size.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.255
So I'd rather nipple and above.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.670
Remember this headline isn't a class,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.500
it's at default H1 tag.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.435
So that's what we're going to start.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.610
By default, the tag is not selected.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.950
We have to do that each time we're styling it.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.365
35 pixels looks pretty good.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:52.805
One more thing, the right block has a minimum width of 400 pixels.

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:56.640
Let's shrink that so we can make more space.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.335
340 pixels look good.

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:02.999
Let's check the fluidity.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.340
Nice. Moving on.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.730
Here, we're going to do what we did with the hero section.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.855
Change the direction of the flexbox to vertical and align to the left.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:20.870
Don't forget to create a new comp class first or it's going

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.035
to alter all flex boxes across the page.

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:27.890
I'm regretting the use of common class for all this Flexbox.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.724
This should have its style them individually.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.720
Oh, that's how you learn.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.800
The content block didn't align because it has a margin set on the left.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's remove that margin.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.220
Let's see the image is way too big on wider version.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.530
Let's set the maximum width on the image,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.630
but better yet on the left block itself,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.685
as I mentioned previously, anytime I can,

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:59.660
I tried to style the container of the image rather than the image itself,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.620
except for the case in the previous video where we directly had to style the image.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.905
You don't need to memorize every single rule and recommendation I gave you.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:13.865
You learn by making these mistakes and adopting your own rules and habits.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.805
And Webflow is a great help with this learning procedure.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:20.870
You can see everything visually and you can see the styles that are enabled and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.950
that might be causing the issue without needing to read the lines of code.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.140
Even for those people who want to learn how to code,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.915
I would still recommend learning with Webflow first

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:33.215
because it's just such an incredible help and guide.

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:37.505
And everything in Webflow works precisely in the same way as the regular coded as.

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:39.395
Anyways, back to our section,

00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.680
580 pixels, max-width is looking fine here.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.635
I don't like the orphan board in the headline.

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:45.950
So let's shrink the right block.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.290
So the word small jumps to the next line.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.675
Also, let's shrink that spacing between buttons and the stars.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.340
It's part of that gray line.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.070
And let's increase spacing around the content a bit.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.470
It's too close to the image and to the footer.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.925
Finally, the portrait version.

00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:19.260
Okay, here we need to remove the minimum width which is sat on the right block.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.155
Good.

00:03:24.155 --> 00:03:26.915
The headline tax is pretty big for the portrait.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.370
So let's shrink that too.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.275
27 pixels look right.

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:47.105
And on the stars,

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:51.035
let's arrange the layout so it's vertical instead of horizontal.

00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:52.730
This the flexbox layout.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.830
So we can switch that with one click,

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.750
but don't forget to add a combo class first,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.070
see if you don't already have it.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.365
That's it all looking snazzy.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:12.960
We just got footer laughed and we are done.
