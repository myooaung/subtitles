00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
and continuing where we left off.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.040
Now we need to add the bottom author block.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.310
That's pretty simple.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.240
Let's start by a new D block,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:26.250
which we're going to turn into flex box and had some space and on top.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.500
Now for the authors profile image,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.580
we're not going to add an image element,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.920
right?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.890
Because this is the dynamic avatar,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.150
just like a ball.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.330
So let's just call pay the one from above.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.050
So we have less changes to make.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:53.750
Uh,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:08.410
now we need some textbooks,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.040
but we're going to put them inside another day block.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.950
So they are neatly grouped on the right side of the photo.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:36.850
Uh uh uh uh.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.550
Connect the tax to CMS.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:55.680
And then just style each one individually author bio would be better to have maximum with.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.750
So we don't have this odd long line,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:10.700
and we're going to match all the styles,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.750
just like we have it inside the designs.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:38.060
Uh,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.440
uh huh.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:58.240
Uh uh uh.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.240
-

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:48.120
And

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.310
there you have it all nice and styled.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.350
We can check how it looks for different block posts by changing the block post on the top.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:08.250
And that's it for this block.
