00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
So we've created a database for all blawg,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.330
and that's all cool.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.540
But where on our website is that visible?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.240
Where are those block posts besides it being tucked away somewhere inside weapon so well,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.630
right now,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.220
nowhere.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.350
But in upcoming videos,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.240
we're going to bring them to light the moment we create a new collection inside CMS and new

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.150
pages automatically created under pages panel On the top,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.490
there are static pages.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.530
That's where our home pages and any other page that we create that is not part of the CMS.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.290
On the bottom,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.680
we have this page called CMS Collection pages.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.950
These are master pages that can be populated by dynamic content from the database.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.590
Right now we have one page block,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.360
post template.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.250
I call it a master page where Flo calls it a template.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.080
I somehow prefer Master Page.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.420
Kinda makes more sense.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.680
Each CMS collection gets one such page Right now.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.720
It's completely blank,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.980
just like any other new page would create.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.880
But this page is going to turn into our block post page from our designs.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.320
He wants the same way as any other static page,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.670
with only one difference.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.750
We can bind elements to the database items.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.750
Let me demonstrate.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.000
For example,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.710
we have a headline on our block post.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.240
Right,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.090
Let's at a headline if it right text ourselves inside this headline than this content is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.630
going to be static just like any other page.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.850
But because this is a CMS page,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.870
we haven't extra option under the settings off these headline get tax from block posts.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.120
If we check this and click on the drop down,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.550
you'll see something familiar.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.350
Some of the fields from the collection settings headline post summer in some dates since

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.380
this the headline Weaken,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.360
Select the headline and Wall Up.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.930
Now this headline element is in static anymore.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.880
It's dynamic,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.410
and it's pulling content from the database.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.740
It's not edible anymore.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.630
If you double click,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.460
nothing happens.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.150
We can put custom text inside.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.400
This headline like me had the other two fields,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.750
the image and the post body,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.450
just like we did for the headline.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.100
For the image,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.750
we have to add an image element.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.810
We cannot populate.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.790
A headline element with an image or a do block with a headline that field types and element

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.430
times have to match will not exactly match,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.760
but be compatible.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.570
For example,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.340
Headline Field Inside our CMS is plain text,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.090
which is compatible with any sort of tax element.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.290
Beat,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.780
headline,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.150
text,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.280
block or paragraph.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.840
Okay,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.950
so the same thing we're going to do with the image Click Image settings,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.350
then get image from the block posts.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.080
Here we only have one option main image because that's the only field in our database that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.910
is compatible with the image element.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.400
Which makes sense moment.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.050
I select the main image field.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.750
You will bind and pull the content from the database.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.550
Let me just shrink this a bit.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.670
Leads ad lost.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.110
CMS item post body This filled in CMS is a rich text field.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.810
We never had to use rich tax elements so far.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.350
And now I can bind this reach tax element to the post body filled in our database.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.530
And there you go.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.650
It's instantly gets populated with the content that is inside the CMS.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.540
Now,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.450
this headline image and taxes part off the same block post we have six in total.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.750
Which one shows here it doesn't really matter.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.360
Once republished this page,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.950
all those six block post will go live and each one of them will pull their own headline,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.720
their own image and their own text on the top toolbar.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.550
We have the option to go through different block post and see how they look like Remember

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.970
this one?

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.660
It's the one I created manually.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.220
Right now.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.390
It's all quite ugly about we're going to style and build our pages.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.100
We usually dio dynamic content doesn't affect the way we do the designing off the page.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.280
So to recap for each collection that we create inside CMS database,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.450
Web slow automatically creates a page for it.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.040
The's page,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.090
unlike other pages,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.280
is a dynamic page.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.550
It has an ability to bind with fields in the database and pull content from there.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.290
Onley compatible fields and elements can be bound together,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.140
for example,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.880
image fields with image elements or plain tax fields with any type of text element like

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.080
headline text,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.910
block link,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.560
etcetera.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.350
In the next video,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.720
we're going to a start building and styling this block,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.450
post page
