00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
when designers gather different work for their inspiration and they arrange what's called

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.950
the mood board,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.500
it's basically putting together any sort of inspiration that you think will be useful for

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.240
your project.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.640
This,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.130
for example,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.100
is a mood board from one of my client projects.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.570
There are screens of different home pages that I found on the sides that I mentioned before

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.570
.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.190
You can even draw inspiration from your own personal work.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.630
So,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.270
for example,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.500
one of this shots that I put here is my own work.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.580
Inspiration doesn't have to be a website design.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.160
You might gather illustrations that you've like APP screens,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.890
art architecture,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.990
photography,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.590
movie posters or,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.860
you know,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.350
dough gon tribe mask.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.360
Just like Picasso.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.250
There are no rules.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.450
It's basically sending the mood for your project.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.650
Just like the name says.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.600
In this exercise,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.550
we're going to practice creating a mood board.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.030
Your goal is to go in those inspiration websites that I mentioned previously and gather

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.320
inspiration for a Web site for a uber kind ridesharing app.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.560
The app itself is not your project.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.890
The project is basically a website like a home page for the right sharing app.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.410
Let me demonstrate an example,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.670
I'll create a mood board for a team collaboration website or lending page.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.370
You know,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.180
products like slack and trail.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.340
Oh,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.430
if you're familiar with it,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.430
I have my inspiration.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.380
Sides open here,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.460
but first I'll start looking at product websites already know.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.870
So I'm going to check.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.300
Slack Osanai is another one that I know in trail.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.640
Oh,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.210
and see what they're doing.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.820
When you like a website or a section or any parts of the page,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.950
just take a screenshot.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.650
We will organize old screenshots and images later.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:48.080
Okay,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.250
lets now check on other inspiration websites dribbles Search with keywords.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.040
Isn't that good?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.950
So try using as little keywords as possible and try searching in different boards.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.450
This one isn't bad.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.670
Often on dribble,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.200
designers post the screen off the full page,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.360
which you can see in the attachment right here.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.950
This where you can see the full page in more detail.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.950
I'm just going to save the entire page.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:38.470
This one is similar to a Sana,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.840
but here are like this overlapping interface elements.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140
Asana had just illustrations.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.830
This is nice because it gives more idea with product.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.100
Plus,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.390
this is more simple to make.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.230
I can't illustrate.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.240
So I have to hire an illustrative,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.830
have want that in my project.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.170
Okay,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.050
let's check other inspiration sides.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.770
I usually spend about an hour gathering inspiration.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.020
It's an important part of the design process,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.670
and if I do this part diligently,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.650
I have much more easier time designing.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.680
And if I don't,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.050
I often need to come back and find more inspiration.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:26.050
Interest is actually where I save random inspirations outside of projects like If I'm

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.500
randomly browsing the Web and I come across to some interesting design,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.240
I will save it on Pinterest to for future in preference.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.910
It's a great place to have your own personal collection.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.280
You can create your like personal board on Pinterest and install their browser extension

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.250
and save screenshots and images from the Web to your private collection.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.900
And then you can come back to this pains later when you're looking for some inspiration for

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.630
your project.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.990
OK,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.450
now I'm gonna look off topic not necessarily for team cooperation websites.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.950
This isn't bad.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:20.950
This section is very lovely.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.150
I like photo overlapping with those graphics.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:33.870
Le Pen Ninja or Lend Book are excellent because we can see life sites which can give us

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.050
ideas on animations and interactions and all that stuff.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.750
I think we have enough.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.550
I now we're going to create a mood board in fig mind plays all those shots in there,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:52.550
so just draw a basic frame in fig ma and a pool or your spring shots on it.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.130
I use dark background because most websites are on white,

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.850
so they will have better visibility on a dark frame.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:17.030
Doesn't really matter how you arrange them here.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.550
You can scatter them as you like,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:28.750
and that's all there is to it.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.430
That's our moon board later will learn how to actually draw inspiration from oldest things

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.180
that we collected and how to use them in project while we're designing it.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.230
Now it's your turn.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.690
Go ahead and collect inspiration for a Web site that is for ride sharing app.
