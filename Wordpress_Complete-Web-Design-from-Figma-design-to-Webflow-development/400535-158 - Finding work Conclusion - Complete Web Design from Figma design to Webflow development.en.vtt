00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
So these are some of the many options you have at your disposal to find freelance work.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.320
I wanted to show your oldest options because sometimes freelancers forget that there are

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.510
more places to find work than just up work.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.620
I haven't covered all of them,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.040
and I couldn't possibly do that.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.420
Jobs often come from unexpected places,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.480
but here's what you should do.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.540
Expose yourself to as many opportunities as possible.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.830
Knock on his money doors as possible.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.770
Like anything else in life you have to try or like as many times as possible.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.870
As Wayne Gretzky put it,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.750
Humans 100% of the shots you don't take all right up next will dive deep into raw pork stew

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.250
ground.
