00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
up next,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.350
we need to add the post body heading.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.790
This is relatively simple.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.060
We just need to drag a rich text element.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.030
Why reach tax?

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.900
Because that's the field type inside CMS.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.330
We need to add this inside a different container.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.910
The image container is wider than the rest,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.840
so we need the same container that we created evolved for the Hatter and drop rich tax

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.650
inside that.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:36.960
All right,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.050
that's better in let's add a bottom margin to the image element to create a separation.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.650
Buying the CMS failed like you do with anything else.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:59.050
And there you go that content from CMS gets loaded.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.660
Now here's a fun part when you to make some style changes to our rich text element,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.800
for example,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.660
match the tax color to what we have in designs.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.750
We decided to go with the darker color in the design,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.820
and also we need some spacing between different paragraphs and different textiles.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.780
Let's start with a collar.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.920
The obvious way would be to give it a class and change the font color.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.930
These does style some off the text,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.920
but not all of it,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.290
especially not the main one.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.940
The paragraph,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.610
the paragraph has its own style,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.500
and it's being overridden by the old paragraphs html attack something that we start early

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.050
on on our home page.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.690
Since reach taxes just a parent element.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.520
That paragraph,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.880
which is a child element,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.480
can override any off the styles from the reach text.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.320
This means we need to style the paragraph directly,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.350
but right now we have no access to it.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.150
Once it's connected to the CMS,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.550
we can select individual elements inside.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.640
We need to disconnect it from the CMS,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850
style it and then connected back.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.090
All right now,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760
elements inside are selectable.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.600
You'll notice that,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.830
unlike other things,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.930
elements inside rich tax have a different styles panel.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.390
There are some set of instructions on it as well,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.200
and if you enter the selector field,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.850
you'll notice you can't type.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.350
You can create a class.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.420
This is because we cannot style an individual element but the type of element.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420
So instead of this particular paragraph that I'm selecting,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.830
we're going to start all paragraph types inside these rich text or all headlines or old

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.610
bullet points or all images and so on.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.700
That's why we only have one option to select an appropriate tack like all paragraphs all

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.930
age for and third step is to enable nest selector This is this little plus I come that we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.730
get underneath the selector Now what this does is lets us choose if we want Teoh style old

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.710
paragraph across the website no matter where they are placed or Onley those paragraphs that

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.370
are nested inside reach text but not any rich tax but these particular reach taxed with the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.820
class that we just created.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.700
So make sure to select this and ah enable the nesting.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.670
Otherwise all paragraphs across the website will be styled.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.350
Now we can change the color.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.980
Perhaps we could also increase bottom margin.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.650
So there's batter separation between paragraphs.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.940
If you connect these back to CMS,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.550
you'll see that the style is being applied to it as well.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:49.760
There are more types off text content inside that miniter style to style.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.890
Then we need to repeat the same process.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.710
Not all of them are showing right now to show them Just edit text directly inside.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.340
Remember,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.400
you have tow unlike it from CMS to be able to add it and style them properly.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.020
For example,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.150
this a quote type of text it's a nice element inside blocks when you want to quote someone

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.910
so we can style them differently,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.950
like make it italic that's more suitable for quotes.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.010
Bigger line,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.950
hide a little more space around.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:40.580
We can't even style the border that the,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:05:04.510
uh we can style images to.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.090
For instance,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.730
the spacing is a little too tied around images.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.970
Just keep one thing in mind.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.740
The image is inside Another thing called figure.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.900
Better to add spacing on that one.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.460
It includes caption inside,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.890
too.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:44.250
Uh uh uh.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.230
We can style bullet points to They are really small right now.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.660
Keep it same size as the paragraph text.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:16.950
Uh,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.380
and be careful when deleting something from the rich text block is going to do with the

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.960
whole thing.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.410
If you have an element selected,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.170
you need to edit it like attacks.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.090
So double click on it to enter inside and then remove tax directly.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.650
Uh,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.910
we got a style age three headings because right now they're white.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.430
I guess we have style than White somewhere on the home page.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:52.330
All right,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.320
We don't have to change everything.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:04.220
Let's connect it back to CMS and see how the rial content looks like And maybe add a bit

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.910
more spacing for H two headings.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:19.410
All right,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.260
let's connect it back and see how it looks.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So that's reached.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.010
Taxed may be a little tricky to understand in the beginning,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.610
but with a little bit of practice,

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.450
you'll get a hang of it.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.040
Unlike regular paragraphs or headlines or textbooks,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.260
reach text can take many sort off content types inside.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.280
Like obviously all the different headlines that we have,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.440
we can put them inside.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.400
We can put images,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.870
videos we can quote,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.520
we can put bullet points and numbers and all that stuff and inside Web flow,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.060
styling,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.270
reach text elements have their own specific instructions that we just went through.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.750
Those instructions are always there inside what flow so and whenever you're trying to style

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.990
rich tax The Web slower always showed that style in the style span.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.460
Also,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.330
no need to memorize them or anything,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.910
but basically the wait goes.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.470
His step one is that you have to give the rich text that class,

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.370
so it has a very specific class,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.750
right?

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.460
You have to style that that particular rich Dec's first right,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:29.270
so you're not able to basically say that every single reach tax on this page in paragraph

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.870
Within all those rich tax feel of,

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.200
ah,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.430
blocks are going to have these sort of specific style instead,

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.960
what you're doing is you're saying that have reached act that has this particular style.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.690
It's a super nice rich text.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:48.330
The paragraphs in those classes will always be like this,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.600
right?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.070
That's what you're doing in reality.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.020
And in the second step,

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.410
you select the appropriate attack.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.990
So when you're for example,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.250
want to style paragraph,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.690
you select all paragraphs,

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.050
right?

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.130
And then in the step three,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.720
you select this nesting option.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.230
Basically,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.600
you're saying that I'm not styling old paragraphs across the website.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.600
I am styling paragraphs that are nested within this class.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.000
Right?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.670
You're saying OK,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.680
this is the class.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.020
And if I'm applying this class to average text than every time that happens,

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.500
all paragraphs inside will be like this.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.280
So that's the reach.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.650
Sex feels how to Stalin how to work with them.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.270
The example that I gave was inside the CMS and inside the block post.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.950
Usually that that this is a place where we use rich tax inside like a blogger or article.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.530
So most of the time we're using it inside the CMS.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.860
However,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.350
that doesn't mean that we cannot use it in other regular static pages.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.440
The whole styling,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.120
everything works exactly the same,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.820
and you can add that to a regular page and style them with exact the same instructions.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.810
So this instructions on how to style rich text has nothing to do with the CMS.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.240
It's just the way rich tax Bork's.
