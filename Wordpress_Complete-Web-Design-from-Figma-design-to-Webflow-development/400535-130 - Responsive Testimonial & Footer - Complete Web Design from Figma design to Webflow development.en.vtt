00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770
the testimonial section is relatively simple for the tablet.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.100
It's good as is.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.160
Just drink that space between the headline and the slider half off.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.950
That should be good.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:36.610
Mobile landscape is pretty good as well.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:55.960
Now in portrait mode,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.190
we need to change the width off.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.600
The testimonial cards obviously will be able to fit only one card at a time.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.460
The width is being set by the slide element.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.040
If we change that from pixel value to 100% then it will be as wide as the parent container

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.040
,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.550
so basically stretching from edge to edge.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:22.880
But what would be nice is to show user that there are more testimonials.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.040
And it's not just one lonely testimonial that is sitting here,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.460
so if we change the way through 90% then that should bring a little part off the next card

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.500
in the visible screen.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.310
That's great,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.210
but the content is a little too narrow,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.350
so let's make some more space for it by shrinking margins and panics.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.040
First,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.630
we can half the margin on the ride,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.750
so more of the car shows from the next,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.960
which means we can increase the width offs.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.050
The slide more than 90% of maybe 95%.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.450
Now for the padding,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.150
30 pixels on all sides look better,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.250
and that's all up.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.790
Next,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.450
the footer,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.970
the food.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.220
Or,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.810
if you remember,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.190
we didn't create from scratch,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.230
we copied it from our previous project.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.380
The best part about reusing your competence across different projects is this.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.590
They are already optimized all those responsive changes we have made to the first project.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.710
They're going to be carried with the competent when you copy them to a different project.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.150
No need to do it again.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.450
Such a time saver,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.840
although we do have to make couple of adjustments because we did change the layout of the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.690
footer like this basic issue.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.380
For example,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.610
probably in previous project,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.160
we had a little different plan for this.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.020
But here,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.640
if you check the desktop version,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.450
columns are distributed equally from edge to edge.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.600
This is a pretty good layout for the tablet as well,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:56.200
so let's reset the style so it's inheriting from the desktop versions now in the mobile

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.730
landscape.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.240
Perhaps we could change the justification back to left.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.650
The columns are a little too scattered apart.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.910
We can go in extra staff and try to align the company column with the subscribe column

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.590
below.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.020
We just need to shrink the with off the logo column and that,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:25.620
and Lyman makes it look nicer inside the mobile portrait.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.680
Let's return that first column with to the original size because their space and that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.440
tagline looks better on two lines.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:44.960
Uh uh Uh huh Uh,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:54.730
subscribe column is now buried on the bottom off the footer.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.630
That's not really the best arrangement.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.580
It would be better if we brought it to the top,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.650
because nobody's gonna bother scrolling all the way down for it.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.870
Now here's how awesome Flex boxes Flak Shell has their own set of settings.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.400
There are some sizing settings that a child can override the General Flex book sizing

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.050
settings,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.450
and also we can override alignment in order.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.730
So if we change the order off our last column,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.350
we can actually make it first.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.100
But we don't want it exactly.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.600
First,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.090
would prefer it came after the logo column,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.180
but not to worry.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.780
We can do that,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.180
too.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.420
We just need to give the local column the same order style,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.080
and you will pop back on top.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.050
And there you go.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.710
When you do this,

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.240
make sure you have a comfort class.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.180
Apply otherwise,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.770
this change will apply to every single footer column,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.150
and that won't give expected results.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.420
I haven't applied anything because we already had come back classes on both of face first

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.450
and last columns alike that checked the responsiveness.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.530
Okay,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.850
we have this overflowing show with the email failed.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:03.770
The fixed with off 267 pixels is too much on the tiny screen.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.630
So instead of fixed,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.120
we can change to maximum with of 267 and change fixed value to 100%.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.950
So it stretches.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.060
Women has space.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:36.440
Excellent.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.070
So looking good.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.070
Now that's it.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.490
The home page is done and it's going to look great.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.530
No matter the device or the spring size in the next section,

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.810
we're going to build a plug,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.260
which is done by a super powerful weapon,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.040
low CMS,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.750
and we're gonna learn all about it.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.950
It's gonna be fun.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.610
Stick around
