00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.105
First, we will publish the website on Web Flow sub-domain.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:10.080
But next I'm going to show you how to publish the website on a real custom domain.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.880
Let's start by a CIO and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.650
some other finishing touches we need to fill out SEO details for all of our pages.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.120
Starting with homepage.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.470
We've already done this before,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.300
so it should be pretty straightforward,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.660
except for the dynamic blog post page that's a little different.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.430
Don't forget the Open Graph settings.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.260
That's for all those social networks,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.625
Facebook, Twitter, and stuff.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:57.040
For the image, it needs an URL.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.120
We can choose an image from the assets panel and get a URL from it.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.525
I'm gonna go with this image,

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:10.370
open image in a new window.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.030
Then just grab the URL and then paste it into the field.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.935
Same thing for the blog page.

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:28.235
I don't have any specific roles on watch.

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.920
You should put on SEO as long as it's not empty.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.550
The rest depends on the business and what message that clients want to send.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.890
A fun part SEO for the dynamic page.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.540
You'll notice an extra link on a dynamic page.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.490
This purple links to add a field.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.280
So the name of the blog posts can be static, right?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.865
The name has to be same as the headline of the blog post page.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:22.100
We can add that headline like this.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.875
There you have it, the name of the blog page.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.150
And if you click this arrows,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.610
you can easily go through different posts.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.510
We can add anything else in front or after this dynamic field.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.290
And inside the meta description we can add a post summary text.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.350
That's another reason why post summaries such a handy field to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.530
have n for the Open Graph image,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.140
we can directly select the image from the CMS.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.860
How great is that? So each post will feature their own main image.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.370
That's all for the SEO.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.235
There are some links we need to connect in the navbar and footer,

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:08.735
for example, the logo.

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:11.105
It's a good practice to link it to the homepage.

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:13.440
It's what people expect.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.170
As for other links, we don't have pages for them,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.715
so we gotta live them as is,

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:26.190
except for the blog which we have already connected.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.950
Let's not forget the footer.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.080
We need to link that logo to the homepage as well.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.940
If you don't see the link settings,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.235
maybe you just have a logo without a link block,

00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:43.220
only link elements can be connected to other pages.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.570
So if you are missing it,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.570
just add a new link block and just drop your image inside.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.430
Don't even have to add a class to edit the settings directly.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.410
Excellent, this a good time to check all the links in

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.320
a preview mode and see how all that looks in different screens.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.480
I love the result. That's a hands-on,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.890
fast and solid website.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.200
All right, before we hit published,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.270
let's go to Project Settings.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.995
We need to upload a favicon,

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.855
just like the way we did last time.

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:25.280
Remember how we did this.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.940
We had to create a favicon and web clip icons in sigma.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.250
And let's copy that from the previous project.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.910
Since we already have the correct sizes and create icon's from that.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.395
When you export this, make sure to remove the background from the frame.

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:38.880
Otherwise it's going to be exported with it and you won't get the rounded corners.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.950
And that's all done. Now we can hit publish on

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.320
the web flow domain will do custom domain layer.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.670
And that's our snazzy Layla website,

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.915
like check everything out,

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:20.310
make sure it's working properly.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.240
Up next we're going to test forums and see how

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.850
form submissions are managed on Web Flow. Stick around.
