00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
each time.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.010
Face has a personality.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.380
Some are fun and playful,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.700
summer streaked and blonde,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.680
and some feel academic and fancy.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.640
The personality of a typeface is as important as choosing the right outfit for the right

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.290
occasion.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.020
You don't want to be wearing cargo shorts on a date.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.150
In offensive restaurant,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.760
for example,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.090
a typeface called Proxima Soft would be very suitable for a winter holiday page but would

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.510
be completely out of place on a page that sells luxury office space.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.750
Why is this the case?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.020
Because Proxima Soft has a casual and friendly personality,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.570
just like the name Heene's.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.870
The ladders are soft and rounded.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.400
They look sort of like they were made off snow.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.630
It would be suitable for websites that are related to holy days or Children.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.510
Casual food,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.560
maybe for websites that want to feel friendly and approachable.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.440
Why doesn't work for the luxury of real estate website?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.420
For starters,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.870
the photo tells us a lot.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.100
You see that streak rectangular architecture er,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.900
that is already dictating the mood off this composition.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.950
It's asking for some something streaked and straight,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.260
but more importantly,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.550
eats the context.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.270
Luxury is the key ward,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.920
and there's nothing luxury about Proxima Nova Soft.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.730
On the other hand,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.110
a typeface called Adoni would be an excellent fit for this page.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.150
It's a classic looking typeface.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.360
It looks serious,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.220
straight and fancy,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.350
yet modern.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.950
Exactly the words you would use to describe luxury office space.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.340
But how can we tell What's the personality of the typeface?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.870
Actually,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.850
it's not that difficult.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.460
There are certain classifications that each typeface falls under.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.500
Those already tell a lot of story about the time Let's go through them in our next lesson.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.890
And after that,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.750
let's do a small exercise to practise tiefest prototype phase personalities.
