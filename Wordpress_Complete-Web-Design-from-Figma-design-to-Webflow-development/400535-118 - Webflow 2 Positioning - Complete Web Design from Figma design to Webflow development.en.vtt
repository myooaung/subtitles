00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
Welcome back in this video.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.150
We're going to take care of the arrows on our slider in order to put them on the bottom

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.620
right corner off our slider.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.160
Like we have in the designs,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.980
we need to learn a new concept.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.750
This concept is called Position.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.390
Position is a CSS style that gives us a tremendous amount of control on our objects.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.470
This style can be changed from here.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.640
We have five different position values.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.840
Static relative,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.640
absolute fixed and sticky.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.850
Let's go through each one,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.560
have organized five cards here and one by one will apply to them different position

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.350
settings to see what happens to them.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.230
Static or also called auto is the default position off almost all objects elements that are

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.910
static behave the way we already are familiar with it,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
Like a war document flowing from one after the other.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.010
Things get a bit more interesting from relative relative object is position relative to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.810
itself.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.280
I know this has nothing to you.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.410
Let me demonstrate.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.250
I'm going to apply relative to this box and nothing happens.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.060
Very uneventful by one thing did happen.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.850
The position settings now have a few more controls.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.950
We get this similar controls like we have with spacing.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.350
We can adjust those values and the box is going to move.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.960
We're basically giving the box top margin of 100 pixels.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.560
It works in a quite similar way,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.850
with one exception,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.810
and you'll see this exception when I show you what happens when you added margin.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.030
Instead of this relative positioning,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.200
you see the margin has altered the flow off the page.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.800
The height of the parent container was increased because that margin needs to fit into that

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.460
space.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.350
But when you use relative positioning,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.850
the flow of document is not touched at all.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.160
You can move the object anywhere you like,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.520
but in the flow off the document,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.360
it's only going to occupy that.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.670
Its original slot.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.560
This is a power of relative position.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.980
We have completely moved it out of its own place,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.750
but the cards that are nested inside of Flex box haven't moved at all.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.370
They act like the red card is still there Now.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.850
As for absolute position,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.730
absolutely.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.960
Position Object is removed from the floor off the document,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.280
and it sits on a new layer,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.760
sort of like objects inside Sigma in figure,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.180
all elements are sort of absolutely position.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.060
They all exist on their own layer.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.270
Absolute positioning is often what we use when we need toe overlap elements or put them on

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.250
top of each other.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.610
Now,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.450
an important scenting for absolute positioning is here.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.310
It tells us,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.550
what is this object positioned relative to?

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.360
We have the same field for the relative element,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.230
but that one always says itself,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.920
because that's what relative does.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.110
It's always positioned relative to itself,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.350
and that can be altered.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.410
But the absolute element can it can be relative toe any off its parent elements.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.350
The beginning you'll see that it's usually relative to the body element,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.850
which means relative to the entire page.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.430
For example,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.900
if we set the left position value to zero,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.200
it's going to be positioned zero pixels from the left.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.530
Ach off the body.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.980
Right now,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.600
it's not exactly on the edge because this has a 15 pixel margin on the sides.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.240
If we give it 100 pixel left position,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.950
it's going to move 100 pixels from badge.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.720
And if we give it a zero,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.650
pick some top marching that it's going to move all the way to the top of the page,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.880
and that ping container is going to look like the green box isn't really there.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.670
But if we check,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.710
the Navigator will see that the absolute box is still part of the container.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.190
As I sat obsolete Element can be relative toe any off its parents if we choose to do so now

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.450
to choose the parent,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.160
there is a little trick we have to dio.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.150
We have to change the position off that parent to anything but static.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.960
For example,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.240
if we want the green car to be positioned relative to the ping container,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.060
then we have to change the position of the container to something but static.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.510
Usually we change it to relative because that's the easiest way that doesn't alter the flow

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.250
off document.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.810
The instant you change the parent elements position that obsolete position Green Box jumps

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.290
back to the ping container and positions itself around that container.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.440
If you check the settings now,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.150
you'll see that it says relative to parent container.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.140
So since we have zero picks up from top,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.570
it is positioned on the top left corner,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.410
and as we change this value,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.080
it will move relative to the parent container.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.440
Now,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.360
if we instead wanted green box to be positioned relative to some other parent container,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.990
for example,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.560
the grand parent container will need to change the position from static to something else

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.150
on that grand parent container.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.450
But there is one important rule.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.150
It's going to position itself relative to the very first parent element that doesn't have a

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.130
static position.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.790
So right now,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.720
nothing happened when we change the position off the grand parent container because the

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.960
pink parent container steel has a non static position so that green box will continue to be

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.350
relative to that pink.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.950
And if we change the position off the parent containers to static,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.550
then this will happen now is it shows here the green boxes relative to the grand parent

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.150
container.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.170
What floor has some useful position percents right here?

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.720
For an absolute element,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.630
this is a very handy,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.400
quick way to change the positions.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.580
Left top corner,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.250
right top coronary top full,

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.610
bottom four and so on.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.730
You can see that as you change this values below update with it,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.950
it's easier to align things visually like that.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.890
Instead of needing to calculate on how many pixels should you put on all far sites up next

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.110
is fixed position.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.470
Fixed elements are positioned relative to the view port,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.930
meaning to the visible part of the page.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.230
At any given point,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.870
If we choose one of the presets,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.380
it will be fixed accordingly.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.140
As you can see,

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.480
the fixed element is exactly that fixed.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.540
It's sort of like an absolute object yanked outside of the document flow,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.070
not affecting other elements.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.550
Sitting on a whole new lair.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.070
And unlike obsolete object,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.150
it's fixed relative to the visible screen.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.350
No matter where you scroll it,

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.630
it will remain fixed.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.640
This position is often used for navigation bars.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.790
You know how many websites have now bar that is always fixed on top of the page as you

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.420
scroll,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.250
that's using fixed position.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.380
Finally,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.730
we have stick a position,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.890
which is a little tricky.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.370
What sticky does is that it sort of acts as a fixed element,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.150
but Onley within its parent container easier to show than explain.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.230
So right now nothing happens.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.500
It just acts like a regular static element because two conditions need to be met for you to

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.230
work for.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.770
His parent needs to be totally now,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.160
so there's space for it to scroll inside.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.940
Otherwise,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.800
there's no point.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.850
So let's make the container a bit taller.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:55.260
Second condition.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.990
We need to put some custom value,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.490
usually in the top position.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.290
For example,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.450
we can put zero,

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.450
and now you'll see that it works.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:11.160
What happens is that it's fixed on the screen while we're scrolling through the parent

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.850
container.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.540
Once the sticky element is the bottom off the parent container,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.990
it doesn't scroll past it.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.990
What top value does is that it tells from what point to stick.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.040
In this case,

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.200
it sticks the moment.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.130
Sticky element is zero pixels from the View port.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.150
If we put something like 30 pixels,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.620
then it's going to stake the moment.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:37.970
It's 30 pixels from the top edge of the screen for the things that's grow horizontally and

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.670
need to stick horizontally.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.840
Then,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.250
instead of top position,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.310
we would use left or right position value.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.020
I'm not going to demonstrate this one because we wouldn't need that very,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.050
very rarely.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.300
So these are all the positions static,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.350
which is the default for almost all elements,

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.290
and it flows naturally with a document reality,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.720
which is sort of like static,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.500
but it can be moved from its place without altering the document flow and moving any nearby

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.200
elements.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.030
Absolute,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.270
which is the wild positioning off the group.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.570
It gets yanked out of the document flow and his position relative to the first parent that

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.660
doesn't have a static position fixed,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.140
which is just like the absolute.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.900
But it's relative to the view port getting fixed to the visible screen mainly used for

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.900
navigation bars and sticky,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.060
which is sort of like fixed but on steroids,

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.440
fixing Onley within the boundaries off its parent container.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.090
All right,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.750
that's the general idea of positioning.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.480
In the next video,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.450
we'll take this knowledge and apply to the arrows on our testimonial slider stick around.
