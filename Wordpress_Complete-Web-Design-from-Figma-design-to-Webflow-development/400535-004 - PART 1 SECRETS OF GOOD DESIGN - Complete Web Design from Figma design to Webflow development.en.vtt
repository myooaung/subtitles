00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
I haven't started in in our school.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.550
I don't think I've been being inside one.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.760
My favorite subject in school was mathematics,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.280
and I didn't like to draw.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.090
Never in my life I would ever consider becoming a designer.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.350
My friend and business partner at the time was a graphic designer.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.850
Hey,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.670
went to an art school and then was a regular gaps for graphic designer.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.400
And one day I discovered that he didn't know how to draw.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.250
You couldn't drop and give him a strange low.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.420
What do you mean?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.920
You control your A graphic designer,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.450
right?

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.690
It was like That's fun,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.150
isn't it?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.990
Explains them to be a designer,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.790
you don't have to know how to draw.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.650
You don't have to have some innate talent for creativity or be a flamboyant artist.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.190
Design has rules and techniques and guidelines,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.050
and you just need to learn how to follow them.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.950
I was shocked.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.850
I thought Wait a second.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.010
Like I felt like I just discovered some amazing secret.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.180
This world has been hiding from me.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.750
And in this part of the course,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.370
this is exactly what I want to take you.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.800
All those little tricks and guidelines that makes something look so designed and I want to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.100
teach you and show you how simple it is to turn something that is gonna just random content

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.250
and turn it into a beautiful design competition.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.820
I will give you assignments and practice exercises so you can get your hands dirty.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.100
We'll learn how to use a design tool called Fig MMA.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.380
It's a simple two,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.530
and we're going to learn it in a step by step manner,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.650
so we're not gonna turn it inside out.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.450
We'll learn new features as we go and as we practiced for different designs,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.200
and as a matter of fact,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.340
design isn't really in the tool.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.850
You don't become a graphic designer or a Web designer just by learning photo shop,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.520
our sketch or whatever it's designing some mental scale.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.140
In reality,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.470
it's not that creativity that people really think about.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.090
It's obviously there is a lot of creative part inside,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.980
but often it's a mental skin,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.710
and the way you're looking at things sort of like the way the car mechanic looks at the car

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.340
and here's the engine off the car and then understands just by looking at something,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.760
and just by hearing the sound.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.410
Where to?

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.250
Tighten up the screws on where to listen.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.180
Listen them up going to teach you this exact design scale so you can take a blank canvas

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.010
and create something very attractive out of it.
