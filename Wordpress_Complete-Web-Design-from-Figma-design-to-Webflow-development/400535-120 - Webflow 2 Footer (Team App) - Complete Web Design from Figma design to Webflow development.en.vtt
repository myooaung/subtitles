00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome back in this video,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.240
we're going to build a final section off the home page,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.140
which is the footer.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.040
We're not going to build it from scratch.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.510
We're going to use Web Close,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.090
Amazing Copy Paste Future.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.650
Basically,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.220
we're going to copy the entire foot or from our previous chat up project and paste it in

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.450
these current project.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.040
This is a handy future.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.050
It's lets you reuse competence across your projects,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.020
and also it lets you copy different elements or components from other people's work flow

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.700
projects.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.820
For instance,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.110
where Flo has library off showcase projects where other weapon designers can showcase the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.950
projects they've made often if the author allows it,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.870
you can clone the project and copy any components.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.650
From there,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.450
you can either copy entire page or call P bits and pieces.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.210
You'll find people sharing hear things like you.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.630
I ke.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.050
It's a wire frame kids,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.360
you know,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240
like that y friend kit that we used in fig.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.470
My interfaces like that can be found here as well.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.280
You will have to make kids your own and then copy paste any elements and confidence as you

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.750
like.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.310
All right,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.070
so let's see how this copy pays for it.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.710
Once you have a project within your account,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.060
open both of the projects in the designer.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.220
Select the element you want to copy in our case.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.890
Footer section with everything that's inside,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.240
hit control C or command See,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.600
and then go to the current project and select where you want to paste it.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.240
In our case,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.740
we have to select body.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.850
So it pays right there on and not inside some other section.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.110
Then he'd control be.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.250
And there you go.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.580
Now the entire footer has been duplicated in our current project.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.170
We can edit everything about this putter without affecting the other previous original

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.770
project.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.510
All the styles have been carried with it.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.280
A new classes have been created when you copy classes that have the same name than wet

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.750
floor is going to rename these conflicting class just like it says in this message.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.750
For example,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.600
that class name section we already having our current project.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.760
So what floor gave a different name to our duplicate section?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.500
Another thing.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.530
You'll notice that once you put paste the footer it doesn't look the same eyes,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.850
the original because some off the styles are being inherited for example,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.340
that tax phone wasn't carried.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.640
It's showing our website phone for this project,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.450
which is cabin.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.310
The phone wasn't carried because it is inheriting style from the body.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.950
In reality,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.390
this is exactly what we want.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.790
We don't want the front from that project.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.590
We want the want to be what's inside our project.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.020
All right,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.250
now this style this footer and make it look like our designs.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.200
I start with a duplicate classes section and container and switch them to our existing

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.850
classes.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:52.990
Any extra classes that we don't need,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.890
we actually can get rid off and clean up inside our website.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.930
We can do that from here quick cleanup and wept.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.220
Flow will show us older classes were not currently using on our page and just remove all of

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.650
them.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.860
And if we're not using,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.050
that means we don't need them.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.630
Next,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.510
let's create a combo class for the floater section and change the background color.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:28.020
Also,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.420
let's change the spacing on the footer section because it's a little different from the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.450
usual section.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:48.450
Uh,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.300
now,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.920
let's add it.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.530
The voter links the color is wide with 60% opacity.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:22.320
Uh uh uh And we also have to change the harbor color to a different blue.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.400
Excellent.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.470
Now the logo,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.610
which is pretty easy.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:43.040
Next Footer headlines.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.480
This one is a little more interesting.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.380
It doesn't have a class like Footer links.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.780
That's because in the previous project we didn't have a class for these footer headlines

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.420
with Styled in H three Tag instead.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.810
So when we copied the footer,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.870
what floor just applied H three attack from the current project?

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.440
We're going to do the same in style,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.750
that H three tack.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.280
We can,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.690
of course,

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.720
create a new class or change the tack to something like H two,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.950
h four or whatever.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.950
But styling age three cents Pretty good.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:27.500
There's an extra space on top off the headline.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.400
As you can see,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.040
Let's get rid of that space.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:47.480
All right,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.790
So far,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.480
so good.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.330
We have to fix the margin on the testimonial section.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.830
You see how the arrow is too close to the footer.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.790
That's because the arrow is absolute element ignored.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.750
That 80 pixel margin that's on the section and goes on top of it.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.810
Don't forget to create a new combo class,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.280
or you will change all other sections to it.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.920
already has one comfort class to it,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.650
but it's okay.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.240
We can have multiple comfort classes.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.270
Usually it's not recommended because it can get a little confusing.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.080
But in this case,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.250
it's not that big of a deal.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:31.250
Let's compensate for that extra padding and finally just update the content.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.250
-

00:06:31.250 --> 00:07:27.950
Uh

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.950
,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.610
that's all done.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.830
And we have one thing left the female form.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.650
We're going to do that in the next video.
