00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
in this video,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.040
we're going to build the now bar.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.210
If you remember,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.130
Navigation bar is a pre made competent in what flow,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.750
which we can drag right on the campus from here.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.070
And we can start as we want.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.740
It is,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.040
ah,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.190
hidden wet floor trick press command or control E.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.630
You'll get this quick find bar here can search all the elements and find assets and much

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.110
more.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.020
You can search now,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.850
bar and drag it direct to the page,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.250
or just hit and turn will insert automatically.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.330
Okay,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.210
so what do we need to do with the NAB?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.970
Our first thing that I notice is the container size now bar is using a default container

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.820
with off 950 pixels or something like that.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.440
If you remember last time,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.880
we have used a different container,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.250
but what is the container size we want to use?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.850
That's quite simple to find out which is new to measure the container in fig MMA,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.320
which is exactly that,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.220
a full with off our grid dro rectangle over it and see what's the weight off that rectangle

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.220
.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.270
That's 1000 and 160 pixels.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.010
Now what do we need to do in Web flow.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.840
We just need to take the container and give it a new Macs with size.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.150
Why we're giving it max with and not the regular with because regular with isn't responsive

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.150
.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.180
We wanted to shrink when screen shrinks and a regular with will keep it at 1160 pixel.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.820
So no matter the screen size and there we have it,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.550
we have a new CSS down in container that has Maxwell it off 1160 pixels.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.560
Next,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.430
we need to change the background,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.070
are now barring the design is transparent.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.360
That's is it to change.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.650
Select entire now bar not just the container and change the color too transparent.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.430
Okay,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.930
now it's at the logo.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.410
We need to export it from FIG.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.050
My first,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.090
we're going to export it as SVG file because for vector based images,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.960
it's the best file.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.540
Four month.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.790
It's a small file size,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.140
and it never loses quality.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.650
No matter how much you stretch it.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.070
To insert the logo inside the brand box,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.350
we need to first drop that image element.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.030
Did you see what I did here?

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.690
Quick find,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.550
then search for image and because I had brand element selected a drop right inside when I

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.310
had enter.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:20.860
Next let's style the links,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.320
but first we need to add the phone toe our project.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.330
We're using a Google phone called Cabin.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.580
It's not inside the list off funds here,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.530
so we have to add the phone from the project settings.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.010
We can access that page from this link here.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.150
It will take you exactly to the right place.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.160
I think we're using most of the phone salad,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.360
so let's adul of it and done.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.000
Now we can go back to the designer and start building or designing.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.760
If you kept the designer to have open,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.620
make sure to refresh it after yet phone so the phone shows up in the drop down.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.000
Now the obvious way to apply a phone to something is by selecting the element and changing

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.570
the front.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.150
But this is not utilising the full power off HTML and CSS.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.570
If we apply a phone style on something high level than it will be inherited by all of the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.050
Children,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.160
the highs element in the hierarchies,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.530
the body we can access body from the navigator Once you have body selected,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.550
go to the selector field and from the drop down select body.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.170
When you select the body tag,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.900
you'll see some off.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.350
The phone styles are in blue.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.920
That means some styles have already been applied to it By default,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.590
we can change the phone to cap in here now.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.700
Every new element had in paragraph tax will all be cabin by default until we override them

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.700
.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.820
Why is this approach the period to changing phones directly on each element while first

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.630
saves time?

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.390
But second,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.120
just by changing on the body attack,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.950
we can edit the fund on the entire website with a couple of clicks.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.680
That's it.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.050
Now Naville links are inheriting phone from the body attack.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.050
You can even click on this orange link,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.040
and it will tell you that it's inheriting the style from the body tag.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.110
Now let's style rest of the properties on the links change the color to white.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.850
From here,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.490
the other links were in style.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.190
Why's that?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.160
Because we don't have a style class,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.280
apply to them by default by changing the car on the 1st 1 weapon created a new style glass

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.360
automatically and called it a knave link.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.680
Now we can take that class and apply it on other to,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.750
so all the changes supply to all of them.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.640
We have five not links in the design,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.750
and one of them is a button.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:43.880
Let's change.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.640
The size is off the links that to match the sides off the button.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.730
If we select one off them and check the spacing properties,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.540
you'll see that their sizes are determined by paddock.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.270
If we change this padding values to match the button in our designs,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.450
then we'll get the matching size.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.950
The padding off the button in the designs is 12 vertically and 20 horizontally.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:17.090
That style the last link to turn it into a button.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.910
We just need to add a background and round the corners,

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.300
but we cannot just style it right off the bat country.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.200
He has the same class as others,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.180
so it's going to add it.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.150
All the links.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.300
What do we do?

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.500
That combo class,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.170
Of course.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.350
Go to the selector feel and type a new name next to the knave ling that's going to give it

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.350
a combo class.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.060
CSS is in case sensitive,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.510
so it doesn't matter if you use upper case or lower case.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.960
I prefer using lower case to save time where Flo capitalizes automatically.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.470
I suggest using lower case.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.510
It's faster to type and also you'll see difference between styles that were created

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.440
automatically by weapon low and those that you created manually.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.960
All right,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.570
so what are the properties of our button?

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.400
It had a white background,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.550
which 1% opacity and four pixel rounded corners.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.580
This a for Alfa is how you can set the transparency on a color for 20.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.350
And there you go.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.250
The rounded corners have to be apply from here under border radius.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.670
Excellent.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.330
Let's fix the spacing now.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.380
Links in our designs are 30 pixel From that top edge,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.470
we can create this in weapons in two ways,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.300
either by adding 30 pixel margin on top of the container or ending a 30 pixel padding to

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.350
the knob are itself.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.930
The result is the same thing,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.080
but 2nd 1 is better.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.360
Why?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.990
Because container is a class that we're going to reuse elsewhere,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.490
so it's best to keep it intact Now.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.110
Bar class,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.790
on the other hand,

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.900
is going to be used on Lee in the now bar so we can safely style it as we want as you can

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.090
see Logo Reason center.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.740
It's barely noticeable if you don't see that boundaries of the container,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.630
but we can't ignore such details.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.160
We want our websites to look pristine,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.170
a work of art.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.420
So how do we center the logo in the middle?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.160
Anytime you need to move or positions something always start by thinking margins and

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.350
patting these properties will cover majority of cases.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.870
We can just add a top margin on top of the law.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.750
Go and that's it.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:20.050
I'm just measuring with an eye here.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:26.680
Our navigation wings don't have any hover effects on them right now.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.880
This makes the nab our dad and not very fun to interact with.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.800
Last time we added an underlying border to the links.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.450
This time we can do something different.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.340
Something simpler,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.740
like change of color.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.890
Here is one of the simplest,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.570
quickest yet effective holler effect you can used on many different interactive elements.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.350
Just change the opacity on hover.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.710
How do we apply the hover effect Teoh elements from hover state,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.850
which can be accessed right here?

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:59.030
Let's change their passage to 80% and,

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.350
uh,

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:08.090
the simple effect works on the button to let's add a transition effect so the hover changes

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.140
nice and smooth.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.590
This needs to be added on a regular state,

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:12.460
not the hover state,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.880
but it will affect the holler.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.200
You'd expect that it's inevitable inside holler effect,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.990
but it's not.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.160
That's how CSS works in this case.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.050
There is probably logic behind it.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:28.700
Let's test the desktop responsiveness,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.860
not the Mobil's will do that.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.550
In the end,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.730
the number is glued to the edges when we shrink the screen,

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.550
so we need to add some padding to it.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:44.030
There.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.650
That's better.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.510
And that's it.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:45.730
Not.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.450
Bar is looking good will finish their hero section in the next video stick around.
