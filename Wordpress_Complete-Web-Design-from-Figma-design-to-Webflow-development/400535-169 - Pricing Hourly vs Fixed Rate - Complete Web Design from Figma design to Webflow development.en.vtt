00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
So let's compare our leave vs fixed rates.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.550
Both of these have their own benefits and drawbacks.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.140
The good thing about charging hourly rate is that it's very simple.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.780
You don't really have to twist your brain on calculating how much you should price a

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.910
certain project.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.990
Just give a rate and be done with it.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.690
No need to negotiate every time you have more work from the same client.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.450
Noted to worry about revisions getting out of hand,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.650
More revisions means more money for you.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.350
Meetings and communication can take a lot of time.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.240
Some kinds might want Skype meetings regularly,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.320
but if you build them for that as well and you should,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.290
then they will make sure that not to waste your time.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.990
And if they do,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.430
at least you'll get paid for it.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.820
The drawbacks off hourly rate is that it says nothing for most clients,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.860
for example,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.900
$100 per hour.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.900
Is that expensive?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.750
Or is that cheap?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.360
Who knows?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060
If you're done in three hours,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.960
then it's cheap.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.590
But if you need 80 hours than it's expensive,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.170
also,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.450
clients will have an emotional reaction to certain hourly rates.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.980
They will find certain rates too expensive Even if the final price is the same,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.620
they might be fined paying five k for the website.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.800
But if you tell them 100 bucks an hour,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.750
they might freak out is harder for clients to decide,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.950
because hourly rate makes it uncertain.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.820
How much will be.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.150
The final bill is,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.490
you get more efficient and fast at your job.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.950
You make less per project.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.760
Benefits of fixed rate is that it's easier to sell.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.200
Clients see a clear number,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.680
and they feel safer with it.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.890
As you get more efficient,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.950
you make more money,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.940
so it gives you a chance to make a lot more money per hour without looking too expensive.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.390
No limit on how high you can charge,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.940
whereas an hourly rate there are mental limits.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.550
For example,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.250
300 bucks per hour is going to be a mental limit for most clients.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.270
The best thing about fixed rate is that revisions can get out of hand if not clearly

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.950
defined,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.140
for example,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.290
to free revisions.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.030
And after that,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.930
applying a certain hourly rate.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.070
And when your client asked for 1/3 revision,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.410
then you'll start charging them.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.510
This sometimes can be uncomfortable to talk about.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.380
It's quite uncomfortable for me.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
But I learned my lesson when I ended up earning a minimum wage on one of the projects

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.550
because of endless revisions.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.750
Another drawback.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.600
Calculating is a pain you'll need to put extra work in calculating to clearly define

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.550
exactly how long it will take you to finish the project and make sure to put a profitable

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.400
price on it.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.030
It involves a lot of guesswork,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.380
and until you learn all your lessons the hard way,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.890
you end up losing some money.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.450
So which one should you choose?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.380
Just like with amounts,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.810
It's a good idea to go,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.820
case by case inclined by clan,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.590
for example,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.310
way the studios and agencies.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.990
It's the best approach would be probably going with hourly rates and when it comes to final

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.360
clients than probably going with fixed rates and flat rates because fixed rates are a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.190
little trickier to navigate.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.050
In the beginning,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.770
it's okay to go for hourly rates for everyone.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.950
I myself have a mixed bag of burritos.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.550
I started off with a flat rate,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.710
but then soon after,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.160
I realized I was losing money because I was in setting estimates properly and I was losing

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.360
money on her visions.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.020
Then I switched the hourly rate,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.220
which was great,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.940
and I kept for a long time with hourly rate because it was simple for me.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.550
I love the simplicity off it.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.010
And then right now I have sort of both with my long term clients,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.850
I do hourly rate and then with new ones,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.290
I do fix rate,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.360
but with more long term clients.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.660
I do hourly because I do a lot of different type of work like you.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.300
I designed,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.840
for example,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.930
for mobile APS,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.740
and those port projects can get monstrously big and they're weird,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.730
and it's impossible to sort of put a flat rate on it.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.500
So I just,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.950
you know,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.570
use hourly because it makes it simple and makes it easy to Bill.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.190
And one final criteria to consider is to choose whatever you feel comfortable with,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.210
because at the end of the day it's your work,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.160
and you have to do this every day,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.420
and it's important to make every aspect as many aspect off your Warrick enjoyable as

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.050
possible.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.630
And if something gives you exactly like it did for me,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.970
then it's OK to sacrifice some money for peace of mind and comfort.
