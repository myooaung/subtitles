00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
in this video,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.190
we're going to build the section.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.740
The layout is very similar to previous section that we already did.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.610
So why not just duplicated and take it from that?

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.060
So,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.660
like the entire section And just do the copy paste control C Control May will drop one

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.450
after the other.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.000
The order of the continent is reversed.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.230
We can change that by dragging the image element on top,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.950
and this will place image first.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.920
This image has a negative margin applied to it,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.080
but this time we don't need it to remove that.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.510
We need to remove that class because we can't make any added to the margin itself that's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.100
going to affect the previous image.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.650
And now let's replace it with our own image.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.630
He's down.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.950
We're going to explore that J.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.220
Packed because we don't have transparent background.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.640
And J.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.650
Paige is always better option than PNG in terms self file size.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.220
But still,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:18.780
we're going to compress it in our image compressor that the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:42.680
let's replace the content.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:54.450
Uh,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.250
and there we go.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.250
Remove the overflow combo class from the section.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.450
We don't need that anymore.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.650
Let's check the responsiveness.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.300
Okay?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.070
We need some spacing between the two.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.050
Let's have a margin to the image.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.130
Okay,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.300
so what's going on here?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.550
The content was pushed to the right and off the page,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.270
the images supposed to shrink,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.190
but it doesn't.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.750
That's another reason why it's best to drop images inside a did block,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.150
especially when dealing with a flex box.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.100
I think we've learned our lesson by in house,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.420
so let's wrap it inside.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.050
Did block.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.260
When I said wrap something inside the deadlock,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.090
it basically means to place it inside.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.550
It'd block at a new did block moving on top and dragged the image inside.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:01.410
Create a new class and give it a 60 pixel margin and that,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.560
this time images shrinking properly.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.080
Actually,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.390
it's not.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.450
The image about the image rapper is shrinking properly,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.450
and image element obeys the boundaries off its parent.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.690
The next section is very simple.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.250
Duplicate this new section,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.850
change the order inside the flax box and replace the content,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:29.780
although in this case we need the margin on the other side.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.750
Create a combat class for the image rapper element.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.650
Apply zero on the right and 60 on the left.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.650
-

00:03:39.650 --> 00:04:14.780
Excellent

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.780
.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.370
The sections are looking great in the next video,

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.650
we're going to build the testimonial section that's going to be fine.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.250
Stick around
