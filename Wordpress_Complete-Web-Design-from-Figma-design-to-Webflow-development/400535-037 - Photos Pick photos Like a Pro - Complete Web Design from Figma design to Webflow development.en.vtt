00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
all these photo techniques are going to be useless if you don't know how to choose the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.660
right photos for your designs.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.570
In this lesson,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.280
I'm going to teach you how to pick photos like a pro.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.830
The photos that you'll be using for your projects are called stock photos,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.120
which you download from free stock sites like unspool,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.550
ash and paid ones like I stock.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.130
Now the big chunk off stock photos.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.230
Airplane Terrible.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
I'm sure you have visited websites that use photos like this.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.870
What exactly is the problem with this photo?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.250
Models are looking good.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.770
They are dressed well.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.050
They're smiling.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.610
The photos,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.210
good quality and taken in professional setting.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.060
Everything on paper seems correct,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.620
but the photos still lame.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.660
Why's that?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.270
Because it's clearly fake.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.290
It is clear that these aren't actual business people.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.350
It's models doing a silly pose with fake smiles on them.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.610
Now all professional photos are made like this,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.300
and model that is acting a specific role in the photo wearing clothes is that's not theirs

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.300
,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.080
portraying a specific emotion and getting paid for it.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.070
That's fine,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.750
but if the photo is done well,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.610
we shouldn't be able to tell what's happening In reality,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.130
I think of it like movies.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.830
We know that this are actors.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.100
We know that they're not actually standing on a ship in 1912 they're wearing costumes and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.040
acting a scene.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.850
But when the movies made well,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.980
we can't tell.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.430
We forget that it's actually fake and that these people are just pretending the same is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.240
happening here.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.010
They're wearing costumes and pretending.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.650
But unlike good actors,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.970
this guy suck it.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.520
Do you know what happens when you use a photo that looks fake?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.820
You're sending a very bad message to your audience.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.450
If the photo is fake and pretending,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.540
then the website is going to feel fake and pretending No real people behind this website.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.270
If I call them or email,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.780
I'm not gonna get a response from real people or worse.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.390
It might even be a scam website.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.940
It takes a little practice to tell good stock photos from bad ones,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.250
but here are three questions to ask yourself when you're looking at photos.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.580
He's the scene.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.090
Rio.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870
Would something like this happening a real life scenario?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.860
So would people who work in the office stand in front of a camera and hold hands like this

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.860
.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.300
If you have ever worked in the corporate office,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.180
you know that last thing you want to do is the whole hands with your co workers and stand

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.350
in front of a camera.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.150
So the answer is clearly no fake for these photo.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.930
For example,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.980
what do you think?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.350
Is this seen real?

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.860
Obviously not.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.810
For starters,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.550
the doodle in the glass is a complete gibberish.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.150
It's random charge and arrows.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.430
It makes no sense.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.050
And what's with that report?

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.170
It?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.420
It's such a cliche way to describe an office seen this foot,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.140
on the other hand,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.450
is a different story.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.970
It looks like a realistic meeting,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.610
and people are wearing clothes that you'd actually seen modern offices.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.050
Today.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.420
They're talking with each other,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.110
which is what happens in meetings,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.830
not holding hands and staring at a glass board with nonsense doodles on them.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.900
Fake second way to tell a bad stock photos by cheesy fake emotions.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.340
This doesn't look like a genuine human emotion of excitement.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.010
Neither is the scene anywhere close to real world.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.780
In this photo,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.550
have you ever held fake money in one hand and a magnifying glass in another?

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.200
Oh,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.960
this guy was just so excited about some fake good news on his fake leapt up.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.550
Nice try,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.950
buddy,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.300
acting out genuine human emotions in front of a camera in a photo studio.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.350
It's a difficult thing.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.480
That's why so many of these models are doing a terrible job at it.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.050
Don't reward their poor ward by using their photos in your project.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.870
And also don't ruin your designs.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.480
But such photos It's not difficult to tell if acting looks genuine.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.880
This is what a genuine excitement looks like.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.110
Not this even subtle emotions,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.160
like a regular smile,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.380
can look very unnatural.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.850
And fate like this photo,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.880
and when it's done right,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.650
it looks genuine and inviting.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.370
Ask yourself if the emotions filled,

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.670
really,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.850
you'll probably be able to tell quite easily.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.450
Besides what models are doing inside the photo,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.000
you can also easily tell a bad stock photo from a good one by paying attention to the set

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.240
design by set,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.320
I mean everything.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.430
Besides the model where the photo was taken,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.520
objects in the shot,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.100
even closing the model is wearing a lot of stock.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.550
Photos are often quite old.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.050
They have been taken ages ago but are still being sold and used on websites.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.840
You really don't want to use a decade old photo for a modern technology startup website.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.640
By paying attention to clothing,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.180
you can easily identify dated photos.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.410
You don't have to be a fashionistas for this.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.920
Use your common sense.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.950
It's not difficult to tell that no girl of her age would wear something like this today.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.700
This doesn't actually mean that photo was taken a long time ago.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.360
Sometimes photos are new,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.850
but photographers have reused same wardrobe photo studio,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.300
save their caution from the chutes,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300
and they reuse them with other models.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.360
And new scenarios years later,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.170
Closes that Don't Fit are a clear indicator that the scene is faith,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.460
even if it was modern,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.950
like these poor girl here,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.770
Photo studios will also try to use neutral closing that can be reused two years down the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.450
road so they don't have to buy new order of every year.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.100
So you'll see this very blend closing,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.760
devoid of any personality,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.480
and that's another indicator to.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.530
But I think these photo has another clear tell that computer screen in well designed sets

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.210
like here,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.410
you'll see people wearing modern clothing and a lot of times quite suitable for their

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.170
personality.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.450
They look like real people.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.320
Id like a computer simulation.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.440
Pay attention to the objects in the set.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.860
Ask yourself if they look realistic,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.480
like this magnifying glass and fake money.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.760
Nothing says fake better than fake money and stay away from everything.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.470
Abstract,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.200
for example,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.170
Lightbulbs.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.580
God,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.850
I hate lightbulbs.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.090
People love to use a freakin lightbulb to represent things like Dion.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.830
Creativity or thinking it's over years makes me nauseous when I see it.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.320
Once,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.600
I was working on a very premium website,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.200
and as a suggestion,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.070
my client send me a light bulb to use as a background for a website and nearly barfed on

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.950
the computer screen.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.250
Abstract objects are generally a bad idea.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.580
Most of them look exactly that abstract,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.420
confusing and often cliche is they're overused.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.860
Your design should given audience sense of understanding inauthenticity.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.900
Anything abstract will do the opposite.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.020
Off this cliche.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.860
Puzzle pieces and clouds over people's hats
