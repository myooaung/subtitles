00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
understanding the typeface categories will make it easier for you to choose the right type

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.550
.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.080
Face right phoned for your projects because a lot of personality e sort of dependent on the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.180
category,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.320
the overall general category that they belong to.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.900
First of all,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.750
most of the typefaces fall under these two camps serif or sans serif.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.550
The difference is super simple.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.060
Those tails on the latter are cold.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.620
Sarris in French sons means without So Sand Saref means without sorry.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.540
Easy is that besides these two broad categories,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.220
we have two more display,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.640
sometimes called decorative and script.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.110
Let's go over each one.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.240
Served typefaces have three distinctive styles.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.900
Within them.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.950
They saw old style.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.990
The old style is the most popular style in Serra phones.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.330
It's a classics traditional typeface that goes way back.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.600
This is the most commonly used style in print,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350
and most books will be sat in this type pace.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.800
However,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.490
in Web design,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.460
old style several phones are starting to appear only now.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.990
Print material has higher definition in general than screen tiny service and letters are

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.900
harder to see on the screen due to lower resolutions and screwing flickering.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.270
This was the main reason why sans serif fonts became the dominant style in digital design,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.260
although today a screen start becoming higher and higher resolution,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.910
several phones are making a comeback,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.050
especially in blocks and Internet magazines.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.070
Old style typeface,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.160
just like the name says,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.850
has a very classic personality.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.400
They can be used for websites that want to show refined and classical Luke,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.080
for example,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.260
upscale restaurants,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.150
musical instruments,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.910
law firms,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.530
etcetera.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.430
But it can also be quite neutral and used for non classical websites,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.080
especially four paragraph tax,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.060
as it or for his great readability,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.730
modern serif typefaces can be quite similar to the old star.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.570
The best way to tell if the funding Modern is by the Flat Saref,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.330
as you can see,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.900
also has a slanted terry.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.740
But Modern has it flat.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.350
Another very distinctive characteristic is the dramatic contrast between fix and fence

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.150
notice how first lag on the Army's seen as a hair,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.780
but the second is stickers up Paul.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.640
Modern types are frequently used for fashion on all the things off luxury.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.560
Although they're not limited to this,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.390
it can be used for anything where you want to portray serious modern and refined

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.410
personality in the previous example,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.220
I have used exactly the modern serif type called Adoni.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.870
However,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.660
I would reserve modern typefaces,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.780
Onley for headlines and big tax.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.710
That's usually the main purpose they are made for.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.990
Andy.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.750
Don't have a good readability for long texts.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.870
You would have want to read an entire block post Britain in your Knicks.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.620
Slapped I faces are boxes.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.580
Serves are flat,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.490
and they don't have thick and thin contrast.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.660
Like the other two,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.550
slap phones are suitable for anything that feels mechanical or strong,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.480
just like modern style.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.850
It's not good for paragraphs.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.650
Reserve it for headlines only.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.340
Sensory family is going to be the main type that you'll end up using.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.350
In most projects,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.010
it's the most versatile.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.510
It can fit a design with a wide range of personality.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.440
It's the safest bat out of all the styles.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.450
It can work perfectly in both for small paragraph tax and big display text like headlines.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.300
There are a few different styles within sensor,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.000
a family like grotesque Joma trick and humanistic.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But I'm not going to go over them in detail because there is not that off a significant

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.230
distinction between them.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.670
For me to attribute a dominant personality with each one.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.760
You already have a lot of information on your plate,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.430
So let's save your brain power for most important stuff.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.000
When it comes to San Sarah phones,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.310
they had to be judged individually because they can cover a huge range of personalities

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.690
from playful and solved.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.640
Too Serious and conservative have broken down served styles because they can be unified

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.030
much more easily into a useful category.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.690
Like almost every old style,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.420
Sara will have the same classic traditional personality.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.170
If I really have to generalize the personality of son Serra phones,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.890
then I would say they have mostly modern,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.340
serious and neutral field display or decorative typefaces are usually the ones that have

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.240
the strongest personality to that.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.270
But this doesn't mean it's a good thing.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.080
On the contrary,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.090
they have a potential to be quite silly.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.800
Their personality can range anywhere from the type that looks like a writing on a

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.120
chalkboard to something that can be quite elegant.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.950
Most of the time,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.360
you would want to stay away from thes typefaces because of their unforgiving personality.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.970
But sometimes they do come in more neutral and elegant styles,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.830
and they can be quite handsome.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.570
Nevertheless,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.450
no matter how neutral it looks,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.480
you never want to use it for paragraph.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.550
Text on Lee for big headlines,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.700
script typefaces are based on handwriting,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.830
just like display very readily.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.240
You're going to use scripts style,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.170
although there can be times when they come in.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.780
Quite handy.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.030
Say,

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.400
if you were to design a website for a child care.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.140
A playful 100 Taipei's can give the side a nice personality,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.850
but only for headline text.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.120
Same as displayed.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.450
Don't use scripts style for paragraph text.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.910
Most typefaces have been designed with the specific intention.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.690
The designer had an intention and the destination for this typeface,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.740
and usually they will put it inside the description or,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.980
you know,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.460
fun.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.100
Whatever the menu it comes with,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.270
depending where you get the typeface and you will have the sort of description of where you

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.870
can use that.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.650
Here's a pro tip.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.350
If the description off the typeface,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.500
as that was meant for general used and that means it's safe to use for paragraphs and

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.510
longer tax.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.530
But if it says it was displayed right,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.700
it was meant for display.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.160
Then that means,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.750
even if it was not under display,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.360
category.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.860
That means the designers intention was to use it for big headlines.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.410
So never use it for something like paragraphs or big long tax because they're just not

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.600
going to be suitable for it.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.120
For example,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.700
this a Google phone called Railway It's quite popular.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.310
The about section says that the typeface is intended for headlines and large tax.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.570
But many Web designers have been using it for paragraph tax,

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.230
making thousands off websites and themes and templates with poor paragraph readability this

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.550
who could have been avoided if they had just read the manual?

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.810
So many Web designers haven't had the design training at all.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.000
Learning this guy guidelines and following them will definitely give you an edge over those

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.000
,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.150
even if they have years of experience.
