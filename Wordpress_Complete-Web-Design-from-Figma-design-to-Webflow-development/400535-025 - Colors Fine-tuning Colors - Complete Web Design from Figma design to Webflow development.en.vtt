00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Let's take it up a notch and make a color proud of you.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.050
You have already learned how to simple colors from the world around you.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.230
Now let's learn how to fine tune those collar samples.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.370
Ability to find tomb colors is a very handy skill,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.740
and we'll let you nail those designs.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.770
A good chunk of design magic is in color,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.570
so we want to make sure that you learn all the secrets and become very confident when

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.690
working with collars.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.350
Let me show you how and why we find tomb collars.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.690
This is a gorgeous photo.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.750
I like the color contrast between the bird and the background.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.290
I say bird because I have no idea which birth this is.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.280
Is it a hawk and eagle?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.120
A falcon?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.680
No idea.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.550
Let's simple these two collars.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.400
But do you notice how the collars,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.520
especially the brown,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.070
don't really hit the mark?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.680
These colors look dull compared to the image.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.330
The thing is,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.800
feathers don't have a uniform color.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.040
Some parts are lied.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.950
Some parts star.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.560
The light reflects also differently on different parts.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.850
So all these gives a different perception than sampling a color from a single spot.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.470
But the colors on the bird are lighter,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.290
more vibrant and overall look more exciting.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.750
This is what we can do to make the best out of our color in vig Ma or any other designed

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.210
self fair.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.800
For that matter,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.610
we have this color picker tool alerts learn how to work this thing real quick.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.950
This year is a color spectrum on this packed room,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.310
we peak asks you.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.250
A hue is the main ingredient that makes the collar.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.930
As you can see,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.440
the hue for this collar is right here,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.150
where the slider handle is on the spectrum.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.700
Two other ingredients that make up our color are the brightness in saturation.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.450
Brightness is the vertical axis.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.260
On this map.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.920
It is exactly what it says.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.610
How bright the cholera is is remove off vertically on the map.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.090
Brighter,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.160
the color gets.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.410
And as we move down,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.690
the darker the color gets.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.550
You can think of this like the way how much light falls on the color.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.080
During a sunny summer day,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.970
you can see a collar a specific you fully as there is a lot of light falling on it.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.770
But at night,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.210
in your room with the lights,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.450
all when it's pitch black and you don't see anything than everything is black,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.290
even the brightest red color.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.860
That's why the bottom circle is completely black.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.550
On this scale,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.610
0% light means we don't see.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.000
Not the saturation is the horizontal axis on this map.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.070
It's that intensity off this particular Hugh in the color.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.410
As you move to the right,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.760
the saturation increases and the collar becomes more intense.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.950
And as you move towards the left,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.420
we call this de saturation than the hue starts to fade away until it's completely removed

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.350
from our collar.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.530
Then we got a grayscale at black and white.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.620
Photo is a fully saturated photo on this color picker.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.130
There's drop down that lets you switch between different color management systems by

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.120
default.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.590
It's hacks,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.790
meaning hexi decimal code.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.750
Change this to HSB.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.020
HSB means exactly what I just talked about hue,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.850
saturation and brightness.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.540
All three values can be seen right here.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.700
1st 1 issue second saturation in the thirties.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.390
Brightness.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.170
The last percentage values the opacity.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.650
Let's go back door Burt to fine tune the color.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.620
We keep the qs today's and play with saturation and brightness.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.740
It's important to keep the same hue value otherwise,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.100
to get completely different color that won't match the original image anymore.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.410
First,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.270
I'm going to increase the brightness because it's too dark.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.070
The brightness value before was 78.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.380
End up increased it.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.440
It's 95 the scale both on brightness and saturation and goes from zero to home,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.070
100 like percentage.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.750
And now decrease the saturation just a little bit.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.550
And we'll get a result like this.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.600
This is more like it.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.790
It feels closer to the collar off the bird than the original.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.750
The same thing we can do with the blue.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.020
It's a bit dark.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.440
I'm just going to increase the brightness a little bit,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.200
and that's it.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.610
This way.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.930
Both colors are vibrant and bright.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.790
Such an improvement of what we had before This is more suitable for today's Web design.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.170
Look,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.940
these are exciting colors that contras with each other very well and overall looks fresh

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.520
and modern
