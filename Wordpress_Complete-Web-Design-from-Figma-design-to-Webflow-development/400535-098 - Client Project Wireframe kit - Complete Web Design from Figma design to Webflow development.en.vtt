00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
There are several ways we can create wire frames there,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.750
like third party applications that create wire frames like balsamic mall cops and whimsical

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.930
that I've used in the past.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.650
Some designers just use pen and paper and sketch the wire frames like that.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.720
I do that,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.450
but only for my brainstorming process under shared with my clients.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.840
The best tools for us is still fig MMA.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.700
That's what I used the states.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.190
It just easier to create wire frames their and share it with the client.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.610
The collaboration part off it and the commenting makes it easy for them to give comments.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.000
And also we can share the access to the file with our clients,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.330
and they can fill out the content right inside Fig MMA.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.050
The best way to create wire frames inside Fig Mayes by using wire frame kits,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.900
which are pre made ready to use by competent libraries.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.300
And we can drag them right from the competence panel and then put them on the page and sort

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.360
of start building the entire page like a Lego structure.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.840
There are a lot of wire frame kids available online,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.150
often for free,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.750
but I was very happy with what I found.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.400
So I decided to create one for you,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.470
a simple and easy to use kid based on what I use myself.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.850
And you can make this wire frame kid your own and use it in your future projects for

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.350
yourself.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.310
Here's how this kid Bork's from the confidence panel.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.540
We're going to drag pre made components that we need their organized like this.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.950
Inside the competence panel,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.160
we have buttons.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.680
We have inputs like different types of form fields,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340
and we have placeholders like in Avatar,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.920
and we'll build our wire frame using this competence.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.660
Besides these elements,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.830
I have also added,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.320
I can't do this are free material design icons by Google.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.560
They're figure companies to you can drag them,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.040
recite,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.450
change colors and so on.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.070
Their competence panel has the search option,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.160
which is very handy.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.300
Thes will search through all the components that are in the file,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.200
including Aiken,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.800
since they have regular components to I've also created text and color styles.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.690
For example,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.780
when we need a headline for our hero section,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.480
well,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.390
add a new text the usual way.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.720
We get tax and from the textiles will select heading one or any other heading style when we

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.150
need a paragraph will again at a new text and choose a paragraph style instead.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.840
I have also added color style,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.950
so we can instantly give something a color without us warring and testing it out and,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.120
you know,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.020
coming up with different color versions.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.760
Primarily,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.400
we will use these blacks and greys this a nice neutral color palette that's great for wire

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.940
frames.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.330
I like wire frames that look faded,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.880
deliberately looking like it's lacking color,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.650
sort of like a coloring book.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.890
And for clients to understand that this is not a design speaking off way,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.030
too.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.780
When you share wire friends with your clients,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.500
make sure you explain your process and explain what wire frames are.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.000
Often they're not gonna know what wire frames are.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.390
And I've head once a moment when one of my clients thought that these wire frames were

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.850
final designs and he wasn't very happy with it.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.460
If you can imagine the master competence and styles that have created,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.430
you can see them on competence page.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.220
If you want to make any edits and changes,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.100
you can added this master instances.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.720
From here,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.060
you can also build and add more components.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.760
If you like it,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.790
make this wire frame kid your own and have it as your go to template for your future

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.460
projects.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.650
It will make your wife framing stage smooth and speedy.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.970
One note about Aikens.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.420
If searching from the competence panel doesn't give you any results,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.260
take a look at here to see what's available.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.550
The names off this Aikens might not be as intuitive.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.110
For example,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.370
this trash can I can is named delete,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.250
and searching Trash won't bring any results.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:04.260
So open that wire frame kids file and make sure that you have the copy off file in your

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.780
account.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.880
Now we're ready to start wire framing.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.450
We'll get to it in the upcoming video stick around.
