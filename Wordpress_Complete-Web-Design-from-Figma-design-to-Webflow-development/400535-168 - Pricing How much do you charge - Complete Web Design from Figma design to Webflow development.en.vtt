00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
welcome to the scary topic for most freelancers pricing.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.620
How much do you charge?

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.760
Being confused about pricing in the beginning is all right.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.590
I was quite confused when I started off as well.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.860
I remember my very first lending page project that I did.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.680
I charged $200 he was.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.010
It was quite a lot of for it actually was lending page design and build.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.550
I wrote the copy and content for the lending page.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.520
It was marketing Project Teoh.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.190
I did Facebook ads,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.460
and I built designed Facebook banners and advertisements as well,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.110
indeed,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.740
everything for $200.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.250
Then I upgraded to hourly rate and it was $20 per hour.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.090
And that was already a descent upgrade for me because at that rate I was able to support

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.790
myself fully by Ferland Sink for England,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.290
seeing basically full time.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.290
Then I have graded to third dollars per hour,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.420
which was my rate for quite some time.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.470
Then I doubled to $60 per hour,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.800
and now I mainly charge flat rate and about,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.420
on average,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.270
$5000 for a design and build off a website upgrading from 30 to $60 per hour was one of the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.160
most emotionally challenging things to do for me as I felt so guilty,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.480
especially when I had to tell my existing clients that I was going to double the rate that

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.750
I would.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.300
They were already working with me for some time.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.050
Rationally,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.530
I knew that it made sense.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.580
But emotionally I was sweating from anxiety later than I realized that I was running to

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.050
false beliefs in my head.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.540
First,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.700
I was projecting my own money issues under clients instead of seeing it from their

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.260
perspective,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.860
always looking at it from my own,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.610
comparing it to my own money spending habits,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.460
feeling guilty because I myself would find it difficult to pay $60 per hour for anything

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.450
second thinking that price that I charges in direct relation to the level of my skill.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.750
So if I charge double the amount now,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.470
I should be twice a skilled and you might think,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.610
But isn't that true?

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.910
Shouldn't hire prize mean better skill?

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.800
Actually,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.620
not at all.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.210
Here's the most important truth about pricing.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.550
How much you charge depends on who's buying.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.160
There is this amazing business coach for creative people.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.190
His name is Christo and I was once watching his lecture on pricing,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.510
and it just blew my mind.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.080
I realized how much I didn't know about my own pricing.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.490
Imagine a scenario to potential clients.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.190
Approach you.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.550
They both won a very similar website,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.160
same amount of pages,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.550
same functionality,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.780
something that is going to take same amount of time for you to design and develop.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.250
So obviously you give them the same rate.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.750
But this clients couldn't be more different.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.920
1st 1 is an independent accountant,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.980
a small guy.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.790
The 2nd 1 is a large law,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.350
for that makes millions of dollars per year.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.930
What do you think is a website worth the same for them?

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.990
Absolutely not.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.170
A new website might bring more business for both of these clients,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.280
but more business for their counted might mean extra 1000 bucks per month.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.400
And for the law firm,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.950
that might mean extra 100,000 per month.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.940
Same websites,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.400
same amount of effort from you,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.050
but huge difference in value based on declined.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.060
So whatever rate you give this to clients,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.290
probably it's too expensive for the accountant and ridiculously chip for the law,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.950
for you'll end up losing both of the prospects you might think well at these Low firm will

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.340
be excited about getting such a cheap price,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.980
but they won't be paying $5000 for a website that might bring them extra.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.050
One million per year seems unrealistic.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.930
It's too small off a number.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.390
They won't trust your work.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.430
But if you adjusted your prices,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.850
Beijing whose decline?

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.170
Let's say hypothetically,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.470
offering 2000 for the accountant and 20 K for the law firm.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.300
You might end up lending both of these jobs because prices would sound reasonable for

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.050
either off them.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.150
Steve Jobs paid 100,000 for the next logo.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.000
Our logos worth 100 k for him it waas for a small start up.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.300
It wouldn't be so.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.030
How much website costs depends on two things.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.950
First,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.070
who's paying?

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.220
And second,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.370
what's the value that they expect to gain out of it?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.710
Expected value is an important factor to consider as well.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.450
Imagine the same scenario with a big little firm,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.790
but this time they don't need a website to generate new business for themselves.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.610
They just need a website with a couple of pages and a contact information.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.700
Now that's a different story.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.830
They're not planning to getting a lot of value out of it,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.220
so 20 K might sound too much to pay.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.950
They're probably going to pay more than the independent accountant,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.970
but not as much as the 20 k So to determine the right prize to charge for the website,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.050
you have to first understand who's your client and then understand what's the value?

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.900
Do they plan on gaining out of it?

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.070
The value will depend on each project,

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.690
and you can find out by asking several questions like What's the goal off the website in

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.230
what do they hope to gain out of it?

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.250
As for clients,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.950
we can divide them in four categories.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.470
A private client is somebody who is paying for the project from their own pocket.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.780
So this can be independent professionals like us freelancers,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.740
consultants or startups that don't have funding.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.290
These guys,

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.390
I would say they max out at $2000 but if there is a lot of value to be gained from the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.970
website,

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.950
then they can go higher when he comes to hourly rates.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.190
It's a bit more confusing for the clients to understand if something is cheaper,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.630
expensive because if you don't know how much something is going to take.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.670
You don't know if,

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.220
for example,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.330
$50 per hour is expensive or cheap if it takes 23 hours pretty cheap.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.030
But if it takes,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.180
you know,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.270
102 100 hours pretty expensive.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.190
What happens with hourly rates is that clients usually use their own experience and

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.380
preconceived ideas about if something is cheaper,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.250
expensive based don't how much it costs per hour,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.460
and they use a their own cultural kind of reference wherever they live.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.060
How much different services that they pay for and compared to that in my rule with hourly

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.940
rates is that never go below $20 per hour because most of your clients they will come from

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.070
developed countries and in developed countries.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.400
Anything below $20 per hour comes very close to a minimum wage and minimum wage is

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.700
something that you know,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.890
Janet Terri's going going to get paid your offering highly skilled services,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.400
and you shouldn't be paid as at a minimum wage.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.600
And if you price yourself like a janitor,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.140
then you're gonna look like a janitor and you're going to scare away any decent clients

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.450
because nobody wants their website to be built by a genter.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.290
Then you have studios and agencies like creative studios,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.370
design agencies,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.990
active companies and all that.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.400
These are usually going to be small and medium sized agencies and studios because large

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.900
ones most of the time they have their own full time staff and they don't engage.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.310
And they don't have a need to engage freelancers when working with agencies.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.780
Usually,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.210
hourly rate is the best way to co for two reasons.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.870
First,

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.120
it just employer.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.470
You don't have to re negotiate every time on every new project.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.880
And second,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.670
because of the revisions and projects going a little kind of scope of the projects

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.200
basically getting bigger and bigger.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.180
And you needed to do a bit more work.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.290
Because what happens is that when you design something and build something right,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.660
you how are you gonna have staff inside the agency,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.530
give you feedback?

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.520
Then you would have to do the revisions and they're gonna send it to the client,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.490
and then clients will have their own comments.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.240
And in Royal,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.490
they're owned changes that their own changes that they want to make,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.200
and then you're gonna have to then do it another round of revisions on a fixed rate.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.350
A studio itself doesn't have to worry about this provision,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.800
so they're gonna pile all of it on you.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.790
But if they are paying you per hour now,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.480
they're gonna have to be a bit more mindful and a bit more cautious of how much revisions

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.670
you are doing because that's coming out off their payment that they get from their final

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.200
client.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.180
And usually when they work with the final clients they don't work for.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.500
Hourly based companies don't usually work compare hourly berry base,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.310
but they work per project.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.070
So they're gonna charge a flat rate to the final client,

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:13.800
and they need to make sure that whatever it costs them doesn't go too much out of hand,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.950
and when they're paying you flat rate,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.090
then they don't care.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.410
And the you can just seen a work on it as much as much as much as they want.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.740
In terms of our liberate,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.900
it really depends on what type of clients they themselves for.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.610
A quick typically,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:34.790
I would say they're going between $20 to a $17 per hour there never gonna go,

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.550
I think,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.650
above $17 per hour then,

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.220
in that case for them,

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.320
it's gonna make sense to hire full time employees and squeeze as much as possible from them

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.320
,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.220
right?

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.050
And,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.440
um,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.360
also depends on the country that they're located in on maybe City,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.910
even they're located in.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.400
And if they're working with the local clients or the online clients themselves,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.250
because if they're working with the local clients and you can probably easily find this out

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.250
,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.200
then that means that if you're gonna be charging more right,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.420
because with the local clients,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.780
the prices are usually higher because you have a very limited number off agencies and

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.640
studios in the city and you are meeting your clients.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.920
And things are a bit more sort of phone,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.660
a higher up level rather than online.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.300
Because you know,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.190
big corporations,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.950
they're not going to hire an online agency.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.970
They're gonna hire somebody who is local,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.950
somebody they can meet and somebody they consume if things sue if things go wrong.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.790
If you're negotiating with studios,

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:38.750
don't be afraid to go lower than your usual rate because the constant flow off work in the

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:44.160
cutting down or non billable hours totally justifies the discount that you're going to give

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.850
them when working with direct final clients,

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.140
you actually have to do proposals,

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.350
right?

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.550
You have to send proposals or contracts and negotiate and interviews and things like that.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.300
But when working with ah studio,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.370
you just do that once,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:09:59.850
right?

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.810
And,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.390
uh,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.670
then they every single new project that comes your way.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:10.160
You don't have to go through all this process of negotiating and interviewing or all that

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.050
stuff because the agency and the studio is doing that with the final client themselves.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.690
So you get Teoh,

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.350
you get the project that is already ready to go and ready to build.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.150
Then you have small and medium sized businesses.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.640
Usually,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.530
this are medium size businesses that are making money or start ups that have funding.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:37.270
These guys would usually go probably from 2000 and up until maxing out,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.850
maybe a 10 15,000.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.960
And finally,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.910
you have large companies with a lot of employees that make a lot of money,

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.830
and these guys probably start that 15 K and up.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.960
But you don't have to worry about this guys because they don't really work with freelancers

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:54.960
.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.200
They like to hire companies and studios,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.010
especially local ones.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.790
So now.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.770
No need to worry about them because I don't have never worked with them.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.150
And I don't know freelancers who end up working with large companies.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.210
Let's recap.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.920
So we prize based on who our client is more valuable.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.050
The website for them,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.760
mawr.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.750
We charge for it.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.920
To understand what our clients are,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.540
we need to find out more about them.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.710
Where they pays,

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.840
what do they hope to gain out of the bar upside?

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.950
Do they need a website for themselves or their an agency and then propose the price

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.690
accordingly?
