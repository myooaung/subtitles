00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
the scores has six parts.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.530
In Part one,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.910
you will learn secrets off good design in part to your practice design on riel projects.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.550
In Part three,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.410
you'll learn Web flow by building a company's homepage,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.440
in part for we're going to do a client project from start to finish.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.450
I'm going to take you through the same process that I go through with each client.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.750
We're going to start by wire framing,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.800
then designing the website in Fig MMA than taking the whole thing and designing and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.110
building inside breath flow with the blawg and finally publishing and delivering it to the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.570
client.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.410
In Part five,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.930
you'll learn the secrets off.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.280
Making money for Lansing in Part six has several advanced tutorials,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.120
both in design and west flow.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.140
In the problem video,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.720
I mentioned wasteful first,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.140
but we actually going to start this course with the design because every good website

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.230
project starts with the design first,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.880
just like any great building.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.150
Always start with the architectural plans first,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.050
and then comes the construction.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.590
Since we start working with wet floor,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.200
only the third part of the scores.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.260
I wanted Teoh give you a little taste before we go on,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.290
So go ahead and open up in Web floor so we can take it for a quick spin.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.680
You should already have that wet floor account from the previous lesson.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.250
If not,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.540
goto Web flow dot com and sign up.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.380
Use Google Chrome or safari.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.850
The Web flow designer works the best in there.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.420
After you sign up,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.800
you'll get to some version off this page.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.070
Or,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.090
if you're on a dashboard,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.450
click New Project Button and choose Blank site.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.640
As a first time user,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.340
you'll get this on boarding pop up.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.580
You don't need to go through it,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.000
but you can if you want to.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.600
This is where the magic happens.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.360
As you can see,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.730
it has a very photo shop.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.550
Ask Look,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.570
the website is built right in here on the left.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.750
We have a navigator.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.440
He shows the structure of the page and all objects on it.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.120
Right now,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.460
there's only one object.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.650
The body from the plus I can We can add new elements.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.900
Let's add a container,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.250
which we can simply drag on the campus.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.400
Also,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:22.250
let's add a heading in a paragraph inside and ride something in it.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:33.910
Let's center the text.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.250
We can do that by selecting the container and pressing center alignment under typography,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.030
and we're going to add some spacing to move the tax in the middle of the screen.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.640
Keep the container selected and with your mouse,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.050
drag this top padding handle.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:03:03.150
You can toggle a preview mode to see how your page looks like in real time.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.960
If you go to code export on top of the toolbar,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.330
you're going to see the actual code that wet floor wrote for us.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.870
HTML shows the objects that we have added,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.500
like the container heading in a paragraph.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.800
And inside CSS,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.040
you will see the style changes that we have made,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.350
the top petting and the center alignment.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.790
We could export this goat and hosted anywhere else.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.650
The page would work perfectly outside of white clover to,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.360
but we're not going to do that.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.090
In this course.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.750
The best option is to publish our page on West Flow,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.850
so go to publish and click publish to selected domains.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.440
Once it's done,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.820
click the link to open the life site until would buy the hosting.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.560
You get this made in West Flow batch.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.530
Besides that,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.490
that's how the actual life page looks like your first ever webpage built from scratch,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.770
ugly and useless but still webpage without knowing how to design all our websites would

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.550
look as unappealing as this one,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.150
even if we were pro West flow designers.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.800
The design skill always comes first,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.580
so we're going to put the weapon low aside for now and learn and practice good design and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.680
then in part three,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.010
come back toe wet flow so we can make the magic happen and be design and build beautiful

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.590
websites.
