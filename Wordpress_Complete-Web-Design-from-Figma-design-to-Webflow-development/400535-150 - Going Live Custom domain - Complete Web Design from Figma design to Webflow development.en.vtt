00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
All right,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.360
So in this video,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.910
I'm going to show you how to connect your website to a custom domain.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.890
For that,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.950
we're going to need to add a hosting plan to our weapon project.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.950
So that's requires payments.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.230
So you don't have to go through this tutorial to kind of publish your website on a custom

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.550
domain.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.930
You've already published it on our work clothes domain,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.870
and that's enough.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.590
But with real clients and really projects,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.730
obviously you have to do that when you would have to publish your project and your website

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.550
on a real domain,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.790
and I will demonstrated how to do it here.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.980
I'm paying for the hosting plan and for the domain purchase,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.310
right,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.390
But you don't have to do it.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.440
And once you already doing the rial projects and you want to publish them,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.830
then you know where to come and where to see the tutorial on how it's done.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.450
It's quite simple and straightforward,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.410
and I'm going to show you how it's not right here.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.030
So first thing what we need to do is go to the project settings inside the settings,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.750
willing to go through the hosting tap,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.860
and here we're going to and hosting plan.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.330
The custom domains are here,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.230
as you can see,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.020
but they're not enabled until we at the hosting.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.910
And we have to add the CMS hosting because you can see already The basic plan is disabled

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.880
because the project that this team at website project has a CMS right the block on it.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.020
So that's why we have to choose the CMS hosting hosting which,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.360
uh,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.450
he's $16 per month and you'll leave paid annually and it's,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.900
ah,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.250
$20 per month You've paid per month,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.170
which what I'm going to do in this case,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.050
I'm going to choose the Monterey bailing.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.930
There's also this notification about the client billing,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.190
which the very cool future in Web flow.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.730
It means you can directly send an invoice to your client.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.830
Your client will provide their own credit card details that will pray for pay for this

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.300
hosting,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.950
Not you,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.150
and you are have an option to actually make a little money on it,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.540
and you can charge extra and put like extra per month.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.410
For example,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.800
if you offer your clients of service to like a maintenance fee or something like that,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.070
let's say you want Teoh charge maybe $50 per month and you can keep the $30 in.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.940
Then charge your clients The whole price.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.270
$50 then went flow will take their cot in their hosting plant.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.150
More about this later in the part.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.430
What about the freelancing?

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.160
I talk about the future and I'll explain benefits off it and all that stuff.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.780
For now,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.660
we're just gonna skip that step in.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.750
Just pay.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.750
At least I'm gonna paid myself here.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.970
Once the payment is gone through,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.770
we get to this page.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.250
Now it says that CMS hosting is the current plan,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.160
and then you can see under custom domain,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.550
and we have an option to actually at new dominates,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.000
which we need to buy.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.980
We don't have a domain yet,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.510
so go to go,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.390
daddy dot com.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.840
Go,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.130
Daddy,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.350
is where I buy my dominance.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.750
Usually it's simple.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.630
It's straightforward.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.920
It's probably one of the biggest ones out there.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.780
Hold the dummies that are dot com They're available there,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.850
but country specific domains like let's say dot de for Germany.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.780
Or that he asked for Spain.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.820
It's not on Go Daddy.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.170
Usually I don't think there are guarded,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.910
but I might be wrong,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.950
but usually they're on a country specific websites.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.400
Ah,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.440
that sell country specific domains,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.080
so you would have to purchase them there.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.350
But the tutorial that I'm going to show you and how to connect them they work exactly the

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.490
more or less the same way on any off those domain websites.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.570
Seems like I'm getting a very good discount.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.530
85 cents for the first year.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.080
Not better.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.950
All go.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.970
That is very good with discounts off.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.050
That's one reason why it's a good place to buy them because they do have this crazy

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.110
discounts when they give you,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.330
like,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.120
first year for,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.330
like,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.650
30 dirty chip head to card.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:02.180
Continue to cart right here.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.470
Oh,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.800
go That he's going to try to Upsell do some different stuff like privacy protection,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.710
which we don't need.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.880
No,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.440
thanks.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.900
Um,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.420
some website designer.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.710
We don't need that either.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.650
Thanks,

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.350
e mails continue to card.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.810
And here go.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.910
That is going to try Teoh instantly Upsell and sell your five year contract right away.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:38.680
I usually changes to one year now the price went back to the normal and I'm going to choose

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:47.600
a papal option for the payment and they're the domain is done.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.760
Now we need to go back.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:58.200
Teoh Web flow again under hosting tap and had our new custom domain where Flo is going,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.350
going to detect that we are using Go Daddy for our domain in what they offer here is that

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.050
they have this ability to connect domain automatically,

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.460
which is cool future.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.060
It makes things much easier.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.270
So if your domain is on,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.770
go go,

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.000
daddy.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.190
That's one reason why I usually use Go Daddy,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.250
because Whipple has this automatic connection,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.260
and they also I think the only other automatic connection that they use with maybe Google

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.890
domains.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.530
But Google domains is not available in every single country,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.610
so and you can connect automatically when you have an access to the domain and go Daddy's

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.720
account because it's gonna ask you to sign in into your account.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.850
And if you're signing that is going to do the connection and every setting change that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.250
needs to be changed for the domain automatically,

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.350
you don't have to worry about it.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.460
But in this case,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.760
I'm going to do it manually.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.870
Eso Aiken demonstrate how it actually works because it's going to be similar,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.920
Teoh every other website where you're going.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.550
Teoh changed settings to connect the custom domain.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.350
So we're gonna go with the connect manually.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.850
Yeah,

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.310
this is a message saying that because we're adding a new domain.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.200
The sub domain indexing has been disabled.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.470
That means that it's basically something to do with the CEO.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.680
So we don't have one website connected to two very different domains and because that's

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.050
something is not allowed by Google,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.160
and that's why it automatically d stable.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.250
Stay indexing for that temporary domain that we have used from Wetklo.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.130
So just click,

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.650
OK,

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.440
all right,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.970
Now we get this to kind of instructions on what we need to do once reaches our domain,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.310
we have this flow course dot com which is the naked domain and then one we chase with the

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.860
www Lifelock course that calm and Web slow gives us these values that we have to add inside

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.770
DNs setting so far domain provider.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.760
So what we need to do is we need to go back to go,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.100
Daddy inside Go,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.650
Daddy,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.450
It's under products,

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:06.330
my products and here it's gonna show us all the websites that we have all the domains we

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.350
have not websites,

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.230
right?

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.270
So if the course not come here and then we have to choose DNS.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.490
And it's usually the same thing in every other website.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.700
Domain providers.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.520
It's always called either DNS only in its management or something based DNS editor.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.240
Whatever it is,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.850
basically the keyboard is DNs.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.130
That's where you want to go.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:34.820
And you get to these sort off weird sheet off different records at our DNS record that look

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.500
complicated.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.720
But they're quite simple.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.650
And what we need to do here is added this a record and a C name record.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.020
As you can see,

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.810
we have to choose this a type,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.310
right?

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.730
The name is at and then value is this I p address that is provided by go Daddy.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:56.650
So we have to copy that I p address and then we're going to edit one that has a net.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.220
If you're the unis kind of record,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.770
she it doesn't have an ad.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.970
You have to just create anyone,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.500
and that's it.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.070
But if it already has thes X record with an at symbol,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.640
which is an A record right and both have to match,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.700
so if it's on a record and has an ad because,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.250
as you can see,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.330
there is some other records with a net like an s or S O a.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.300
So don't worry about those.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.920
But if there is an a record and it says next to it at then you have to edit that one.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.650
If you don't see anything like that,

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.070
you just need to add a new one.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.840
In this case,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.750
go that it was showing us that we have one.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.050
So I'm just going to edit it.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:35.260
So hostess at and points to the I p address by wet flow Everything else you can just leave

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.750
the same.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:42.880
So that's one a record we need the second a record because we don't have an option that you

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.070
at the 2nd 1 there.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:56.140
So add from here and under the type we're gonna choose an A type host again at and points

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:04.670
to this time a second i p address from Web flow and points it here TL You can believe it is

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:09.670
this safe that's done that a records are done Now we need to add it.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:16.210
The sea name record for a www so copy the value from Web slow and added,

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.520
if you don't have it.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.710
You just need to add the new one.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.160
That's it.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.450
Just like we did the last time I had any record and to see name instead of a record.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.400
All right,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:27.780
that's it.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.890
Now the DNS settings for the domain have been edited.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.400
Now we can check the status right on wet floor and where florals check if everything is

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.830
connected.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.300
Well,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.010
as you can see,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.680
it is for the first domain.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.530
Let check the status for the 2nd 1 There you go.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.060
2nd 1 is connected as well.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.420
This one actually was super fast.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.150
It doesn't usually happen this fast,

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.730
I guess,

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.010
because it was a new domain.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.180
Also gold.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.690
It is quite fast updating this.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.330
DNS records some other websites.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.680
They're quite slow,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.650
and usually they might take up to 48 hours to update the records.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.020
So don't freak out.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.020
And don't worry if it doesn't work right away,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.450
just wait 48 hours,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:14.800
24 hours or 48 hours really depends on the Deanna's provider who is providing this because

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:14.800
,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.070
you know,

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.110
some of my clients they use a very local obscure DNS providers,

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.800
and they update like every every once in a day.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.630
She doesn't work any 15.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.650
Or if one day goes by two days go by,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.890
it still doesn't work.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.820
Then you would have to contact the DNS provider themselves.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:38.970
Because sometimes what happens is that website might be on go Daddy s o.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.460
The person might buy the domain in one place,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.480
but then move the DNS management.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.330
So those records that we just added,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.570
they might move it somewhere else with some different company or a different service or

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.410
something like that.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.240
So we knew talked to the client.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.890
Just make sure to ask them,

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.250
You know,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.870
I usually don't even do this.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.990
I sometimes give these details to my clients because if they have a domain and if they have

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.450
the DNS editor or whatever,

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.900
that means they already know how to do this or they've been doing where they somehow are.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.400
Whatever.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.550
But if they don't have it,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.450
then I could sort of do the whole thing for them.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.340
Now we have to choose a default.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.350
We can use one off this versions.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.030
Either one with the www or one without.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.750
It is a default version of our website.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:30.590
So if somebody just types in wet flow course dot com they will be redirected to www Web

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.760
flow.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.020
Of course,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:31.470
that come.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.760
This is usually the version I like to do,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.650
which is keep the www s the default and main version.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:43.550
So everything cannot comes and redirects to these main you can do it reverses.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.070
Well,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.640
I don't know if there is ever some specific preference.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.610
I think Www always is the best option to just keep it as the default domain.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.170
And one last step.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.550
We have to publish it.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.120
Yeah,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.330
this Now it's not publisher.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:57.830
If you check it.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.840
Don't forget this last half use always have to publish from here,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.620
and then it's going to be available.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.200
So we're gonna do select this workflow sub domain and select our new domain and published

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.250
to select the domains.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.950
And don't Let's Chuck.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:24.460
Ah website is now published on a custom domain where flo course dot com Inside the general

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.110
settings,

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.670
there is sometimes wet floor keeps the branding right.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.080
The badge was right now automatically removed,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.320
but sometimes it might be there.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.910
And also there is this another Brendan with insight HTML So you can change this kind of

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.920
disabled this workflow branding from here both in HTML or the website and again published

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.550
one more time.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:50.730
And also we can actually unpublished this second weapon or that septum it.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:51.600
We don't need that anymore,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.660
since we already have it on our main domain and that's it.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.180
That's how you publish a website in wet floor on a custom.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.950
Don't make it easy peasy.
