00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Here's a fun exercise on type personalities.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.700
I have wrote out seven different phrases in this fig.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.505
Matthias, go ahead and get to this fig, my file.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:11.085
You'll see the resources of this video.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:15.810
I want you to choose the type based for each phrase that you think is suitable for it.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.000
You can use either fonts that are installed on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.745
your computer or Google phones that come with FISMA.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.135
Google phones is a great repository of a lot of free,

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.235
beautifully designed fats when you click the font selector.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.540
In fact, I will give you choices of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.735
both the fonts that are installed on your computer and the Google Fonts.

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:37.340
Choosing fonts right from this drop down is not very useful because it doesn't give you,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.315
give us a visual display of how the font actually looks.

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:45.155
What we can do instead is to go and fonts dot

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:49.340
google.com and find the right type face there.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.265
So for example, for the fitness coach,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.955
I would look for a typeface that is strong and bold,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.860
possibly something that looks good in

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.130
all caps because that's how fitness associates to me,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.635
its muscles, rectangular shapes,

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.990
not round, smooth shapes, right?

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.300
First I'm going to type out my phrase and hear

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.425
fitness coach in capital letters because that's the style on to check.

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:16.115
This makes looking for the right font much, much easier.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:19.415
I can instantly see how my text looks like.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:21.890
Now I'm going to refine my search results.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.304
We have different typeface category's,

00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:27.260
quite similar to what we previously discussed.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.230
The handwriting category is the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.440
same as the script category that I've explained in my lesson.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.945
It's just a different way to call the same thing.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:39.740
And we have this extra category called monospace. Here.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.045
Monospace funds are those where each letter occupies the same width.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:45.650
Look at the letter I, for example,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.390
it's the same width as the letter T. But in most other fonts, that's not the case.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.115
T is almost always wider than that.

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:56.705
I wanna spaced fonts are generally used for typesetting computer code.

00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:02.900
It gives a lot of readability in distinguishes characters from each other which encode

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.960
obviously super important to make sure that i

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.635
is not mistaken with L and O is not mistaken with 0.

00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:13.370
Anyways, monospaced typefaces and what I want for a fitness coach.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.815
So I am going to deselect it.

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:20.330
Now there are one handwritten typeface because they don't display seriousness,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.105
strictness, and power that I want,

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:26.600
nor I want classic looking serif fonts for that matter.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.365
Okay, so san-serif and display categories are a good place to start.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.230
I'm also going to adjust one more filter,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.550
which is the thickness.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.075
As I mentioned, I want it to be bold and powerful looking.

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:39.980
So I'm going to increase the thickness.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.860
Uh, let all this webshop typefaces that has

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.045
heavier style options inside like bald or extra bold.

00:02:47.045 --> 00:02:48.470
Right now as we can see,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.600
I have a lot of good options that are quite suitable for fitness coach.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.120
Look, Monserrat is excellent option.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.065
It's heavy, strong, bulky looking just like muscles.

00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:03.365
Like how balanced and symmetrical is each ladder.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:06.410
Some of the other options are in a bad choice either,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.555
but this are quite great match.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.010
Before I choose this,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.185
remember what we need to do first.

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:15.830
Exactly. We need to read the manual of this typeface.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.770
Let's make sure that the designer didn't intend

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.445
this typeface for something at conflicts with fitness coaching.

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:27.830
So it says it was inspired by urban topography that's pretty suitable for us.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.685
It even mentions the keywords like work and dedication.

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:33.650
Well, isn't that just great?

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.165
Work and dedication is directly relatable to fitness coaching done.

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:39.110
That's our font.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.260
So now we can apply this one to our phrase in FISMA.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.930
And just to note fema files that I shared with you,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.170
they're supposed to duplicate automatically so you get a copy of it in your account.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.340
But if they don't,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.840
don't forget to go to this,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.810
a little drop-down By the name and then choose duplicated into your drafts.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.160
If it's already editable,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.470
that means it automatically already duplicate it.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.900
But if it's not, if you're trying to select something and if you

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.885
see that it's not selecting or it's not editing,

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:13.210
that means that it's your editing my,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.575
you are basically seeing my original file in a view only mode.

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:19.000
So from that font selector,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.730
I'm going to psych Montserrat. As a default.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.990
It will be in regular style,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.850
but I wanted bold a thick,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.490
so I am going to select its boulders form,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.005
which is called Black.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.910
Also I wanted to be uppercase.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.185
Of course I can type it out one more time with my caps lock on.

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:37.515
But there is an easier way to do this.

00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:41.510
This link here opens up advanced type options. In there.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.730
We can select uppercase this way,

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.610
no matter how I typed my tax caps or not,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.290
it will display an uppercase.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.590
This is also where you have underlying option if you need it.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.180
In this box, I want you to explain your thought process on why you chose the font.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.330
So in my case, I would write what I already described.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.620
Don't skip this last step.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.820
To become a designer,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.200
you have to start thinking like a designer to actually have a deeper understanding of

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.610
every stamp and design decision that you make in actually clients,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.160
your clients will definitely appreciate this.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.825
I remember they always did.

00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:35.840
I would send this email with step-by-step of

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.270
major design decisions that I would make about typefaces are fonts and things like that.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.505
In the beginning I like doing it,

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:45.589
but then I got, kind of got lazy.

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:49.850
And when I didn't write this descriptions of my thought process behind it,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.700
revisions increased because now they didn't trust what I made a choice.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.980
They wanted to review and change fonts or change colors or things like that,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.620
because they thought I just picked them out of nowhere.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.015
So definitely practice this.

00:06:05.015 --> 00:06:07.550
And then when you work with your clients,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.830
show them how much DOT process has been put behind the scenes.
