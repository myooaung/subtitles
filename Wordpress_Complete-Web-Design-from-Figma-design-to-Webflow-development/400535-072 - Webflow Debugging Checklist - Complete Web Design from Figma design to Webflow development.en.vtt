00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
So what do you do when you experience now sort of a bargain Web Flow?

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.025
Wearing something is just doesn't look like the way you expect it to do.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:17.070
In most cases, this issues aren't actually bugs within the web flow designers

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.550
sometimes the might look like a bug

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.615
because you try use things like everything is working correctly and there's like all,

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.765
you know, there is some something with web law

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:32.925
or there is an issue with a web flow or maybe something with a browser.

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:37.860
But most often those are just styles that you are applying inside web flow.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.665
And they're just not behaving the way you expect them to behave.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:49.640
And I sort of have my own checklist that I'd go through when I'm trying to,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.950
let's call this add debug,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:01.370
how to find out what's causing the issue and have greater this checklist.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.785
I'm going to link this checklist so you can have,

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:08.240
and it's sort of like a few steps you go through when you're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.085
experiencing some issue in there, we'll help you.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:16.055
I'd say about 80% of the time.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.860
And they will put you in

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.760
direct direction to find out what's causing an issue and how to fix it.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.875
But there are obviously some of the cases that are not going to fit this template

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:33.005
and you will need to dig a bit deeper.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.715
But majority of cases these track los is going to cover.

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:42.050
So I have some issues here on this page

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.610
that I've created and let's go with a trackless MIT how this works actually and this,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.370
most of the issues that likelihood,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.960
all of the issues that upgraded here,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.585
they are something that I often see

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.825
from my students when they're asking the questions like what's going on.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.600
And somehow I'm trying to fix something and it's not working

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
out and they're very common issues that are coming from the students.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.910
So I just grabbed stores, common issues,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.380
sand applied this checklist,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.800
do it to show you how it will work.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.870
Now and the number one thing,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.815
step wining the checklist I have if it's a spacing issue,

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:17.420
this is on the border spacing issue.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.890
The step one enable x-ray mode and hover over different elements to find it.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.210
The space is coming from some elements, margin or padding.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.000
So in this case we have a spacing issue here,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.470
right there is this extra white-space.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.535
We don't know what is it coming from and what we're trying to find out and here as y.

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:38.660
So there is this extreme mode right here in the Canvas settings.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.015
You can enable x-ray mode.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.265
And in the x-ray mode,

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.920
you, when you hover on elements,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.935
it will show you padding and margin of that particular element when it's green.

00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:55.220
That's padding, or when it's blue.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.500
Let's see that one right there,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.360
those dashed angled lines on the side on the bottom of it,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.250
that means it has a padding.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.440
So in this case, a heading has the bottom padding right here.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.950
And in this case,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.770
a hero section has padding.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.550
Sorry.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.854
So they're heading.

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:23.375
Heading has the margin and the heroes action has the padding.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:28.820
And what I'd like to do is actually to hover over inside the navigator.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.000
Because in the navigator you'll be able to cover all the elements.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.270
Whereas on the canvas sometimes you will miss like a parent because they

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.415
are very neatly wrapped around some analog element.

00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:45.950
So what you can do inside the navigator is click this icon to expand all of it.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.845
If you press wide-scale lab six,

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:52.370
if you're pressing and it's going to expand all your elements.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.305
And then wherever you are,

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.030
you don't have to go all the way Barnum, right?

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.100
So wherever you are, find that element,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:07.970
then start hovering over and see where it picks up and where that space gets highlighted.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.350
So in this case,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.435
heading two has a margin on the top,

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:18.395
and that is causing that whitespace issue.

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:21.635
So now you can go to that thing and you can see that it's correct.

00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:24.080
There is a two pixel margin on the top.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.640
And even though the section itself doesn't have that margin,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.665
has 0 margin somehow,

00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:33.920
the way HTML works in this case,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.045
the heading is causing these extra margin.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:41.090
Instead of it adding the space inside.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.640
So this is why this x-ray mode is really nice and neat

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.280
and we'll show you where that space is coming from.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.125
If it's coming from margin our panel.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:52.010
So obviously if you change this to 0, they will go away.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.540
Same thing now with the bottom right,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.620
this little gap here.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.560
So we go continue. And there you go.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.180
We have a paragraph that has this bottom padding,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.515
which she's sorry, again, bottom margin.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:12.410
And it's a default value that all paragraphs have in my case in here,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.325
probably in all the cases because it's attacked.

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:20.330
Change it to 0, and there you go.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.610
Now all that space is gone.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:32.420
So now that was an issue where step one works because it's spacing issue.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.800
Now.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.305
Sometimes it is a spacing issue,

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.345
but it's not going to work.

00:05:38.345 --> 00:05:39.800
So for example here,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.060
again, it's a spacing issue.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.170
We have this paragraph.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.775
This is something actually happens frequently with my students.

00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:52.820
They send me their version of the site that they're working on and they

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.430
will have odd spacing gone

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.510
paragraphs and tags and they don't understand where the hell is this coming from.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.490
So if you do the x-ray here,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.035
you're not gonna get anything.

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:06.410
So I'm not going to even bother to go through the hall.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.075
You're not gonna get this space filled up as a margin or a padding.

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:12.650
So step one doesn't work.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.330
We have to go to step two.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.570
Now in the step two, we have removed the class from

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.695
this spec to see if the issue disappears.

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.860
If it does then skip to step six.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.600
So in our case,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.380
I think it's quite easily easy to identify what's the

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.400
who's the suspect dot this issue which would be the paragraph sometimes.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.155
So it looks like it, but they're not.

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:37.790
We have steps for that too.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.845
So paragraph is this aspect.

00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:45.110
So what we're going to do is we're not going to try to find out what's here,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.640
what is the cloud?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.680
What is that star that can be causing this it.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.180
So we're not gonna do that.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.910
We're going to remove that class,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.715
temporarily, remove class, and bear it was fixed.

00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:03.530
So now we know a 100% that this class is causing this issue.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:12.380
So I'm just going to hit undo with Control Z or Command Z or by doing this here and do.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.050
And so we know it's this class,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.115
which means it's one of the styles within this panel,

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:24.425
either blue styles or orange tiles usually is going to the ones that are highlighted blue

00:07:24.425 --> 00:07:30.875
because they are the ones that are being directly in,

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:33.110
directly affecting this element.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.780
So in my step it says,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.115
if it does then skip to step six,

00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:40.880
and let's go to step six. What does the say?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.520
Once you identify the class that's causing the issue,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.680
put the class back on the element.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.940
We did that and start resetting each style that is in blue color.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.360
You shouldn't be able to find a particular style that is causing the issue.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.035
And he got so what we'll do now is we don't know what is it.

00:07:57.035 --> 00:07:58.595
I don't even understand how,

00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:01.715
let's say web law or HTML and CSS, more absorbed.

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:07.505
I'm just going to blindly go and remove all of these I don't even have to understand.

00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:12.485
Without even understanding this will tell me which style is causing the issue.

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:15.770
So I'll go reset.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.160
I'll go reset. Nothing.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.270
It's not fixing. And I'm going to just use that shortcut here,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.415
which is option click in my case,

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:28.605
probably ultimately on Windows computers.

00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:32.270
And I'll just continue doing this.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.945
Alright, still nothing.

00:08:34.945 --> 00:08:36.820
There is another blue here.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.735
Bam.

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:38.560
Alright.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.325
So now we know we're going to do.

00:08:42.325 --> 00:08:48.170
Now we know it's exactly have the style that is causing the issue.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.290
And let's see height 160 pixels.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.220
So even if you don't understand why this is causing,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.800
and it seems like it's a correct thing.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:06.985
You can play with an r value most often you will get at why this is causing it.

00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.400
But if not, just change it,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.115
when you do the reset,

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:17.510
it will also tell you the clue of what's the correct value that doesn't cause this issue.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.130
So if I reset this,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.940
now we see, okay, it says 161%.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.660
Okay? So in my case,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.420
in this case is 160 pixels.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.400
So it seems like this pixel,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.140
it being pixel causing that issue,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.704
which is true in this case because percentage of a line-height is calculated,

00:09:38.704 --> 00:09:47.060
a 160% means a 160 of the height font size is relative to the font size,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:53.705
but a 160 pixels is not a relative and absolute value, which means.

00:09:53.705 --> 00:09:57.590
That space here, that space has to be a 160 pixels.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:03.365
That's why it's so, so you can just change it to 160%, right?

00:10:03.365 --> 00:10:05.300
And that's fixed.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:12.365
Know, sometimes lets go to another issue.

00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:18.470
So we have this issue where this was actually submitted by one of my students.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:24.185
I remember the issue here is that these buttons are not aligned to the left.

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:32.870
And we go through all these methods and see how the x-ray mode,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.315
nothing is going to come up.

00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:38.780
And if we go with, okay,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.220
so for example, this is the button we are suspecting that it's a button is causing this.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.850
So we do this method from the step two,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.170
which is removed our class.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.450
So we remove those two clauses here,

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.710
one combo class, right?

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.570
So we remove one of them.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.510
Okay? Nothing will remove another one.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.070
Steel nothing.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.580
Ok.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.020
So when I do this,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.805
I usually return them.

00:11:01.805 --> 00:11:04.580
So we know it's not the button itself.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.515
So what does the step three say?

00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:10.010
Seems removing a class on the suspect element didn't help.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.145
That means the issue is coming from some other elements.

00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:17.330
Start by removing classes from the direct parent, then parents,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.560
parent all the way,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.315
including the body element until you remove the class that makes these should disappear.

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:25.160
If you find a buggy cluster,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.825
then skip two step sex.

00:11:26.825 --> 00:11:28.730
So again, we're doing the same thing,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.180
which is we need to find the class on one of

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.380
the parents or whatever the element that's causing this, and remove it.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.035
And once we remove it, we will see that it's going to fix it.

00:11:39.035 --> 00:11:40.730
And then even within that class,

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.265
we'll find the style that is causing the issue.

00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:47.930
So we know it's not that element itself.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.450
So we have to go to the parent.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.050
So easy way to go through that parent of something

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.160
is to look at the side navigation bar here.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.830
Do you have a button? Button is selected and now tells you or shows you

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:09.380
the hierarchy of where the button is sitting in that hierarchy of decreased.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.775
So it's like a family tree.

00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:15.725
So the first parent is the blog than a grandparent is flexbox,

00:12:15.725 --> 00:12:19.025
great-grandparent container and so on until the body.

00:12:19.025 --> 00:12:22.340
So we start with the first parent which is diblock.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.450
Alright, and we'll try to remove class.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:32.750
Okay, nothing. It's not definitely not this diblock class.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:37.220
So I do undo so we can return it back.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.260
So now we go to this next parent which is flexbox.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.460
So we try and the flux box,

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.335
we have two classes here.

00:12:44.335 --> 00:12:47.980
Remove one nothing, remove another one.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.590
Let's see, still nothing.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.775
So let's undo this toward it back.

00:12:54.775 --> 00:12:59.814
Now next parent container.

00:12:59.814 --> 00:13:01.645
Let's see.

00:13:01.645 --> 00:13:02.890
Remove.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.360
There you go.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.560
So it is the container class that is causing the issue.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.620
So whatever the step was here, right,

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.310
skipped a step six and go to the steps, takes Step six,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.615
which is to reset all the classes that are in blue,

00:13:19.615 --> 00:13:23.425
start to gain option.

00:13:23.425 --> 00:13:30.370
And quakes. Nothing, nothing. Oh, there you go.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.825
So I'll just return all of those other classes back.

00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:35.980
And now let's see.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.740
So a line when we're sad,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:45.530
it goes to Ireland to the left and we need on the center.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.830
So for some reason,

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.125
and you don't have to understand this at this moment.

00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:53.080
You all, at some point understand most of the issues

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.990
why they are causing and but often you'll see,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.310
okay, so I just need to set this to the left alignment and problem is fixed.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.200
And the reason why this is happening,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.615
just to give you an idea, if you're curious,

00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:11.450
it's because container has text alignment center,

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.850
which means whatever taxed element is

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.110
inside container and doesn't have to be directly, right?

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.690
It doesn't have to be directly.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.320
It can be any of the grandchildren inside,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.100
and it will inherit this value.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.000
And that means that all the tax start texts,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.650
elements that are texts like will be centered.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.235
Yeah, Robbie, center.

00:14:40.235 --> 00:14:42.650
Now why is that applying to the button?

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.130
Because buttons are inline block.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.645
Inline-block behaves like sort of like a text,

00:14:50.645 --> 00:14:55.940
which means it's not a block level which spreads from one edge to another.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.190
Meets inline block which has the border, it's edge off.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.795
It is defined either by the width or by the content inside.

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:09.095
In the dual behaves sort of like taxed.

00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:12.170
And that's why you are able to put to

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.460
inline-block talent of elements like button and share the one button here

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.610
next to each other because they do behaves sort of like tests and they are

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.080
allowed to go on the same line in Enlighten means in the same light.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.845
And so issues is to fix here right, left alone oranges.

00:15:30.845 --> 00:15:39.395
And we were studying this on diblock cylinder container and reset it.

00:15:39.395 --> 00:15:40.895
You should fix.

00:15:40.895 --> 00:15:49.909
So that's and I believe I only have one last issue left that will cover other instances.

00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:54.185
So we have recovered steps

00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:57.560
three and issue isn't the issue isn't coming

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.775
from any of the parents than it might become in cramped children or siblings.

00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:03.590
And this is the case,

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.240
for example, with this element.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.060
So we have this, imagine it's not growing, it's very small.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.165
We wanted to fill up most of this space, but it's not happening.

00:16:11.165 --> 00:16:13.550
Now we start with an image with them, okay, images,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.070
a very small probability issues from the image and

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.905
we start with the same process and removing the class.

00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:20.660
This image doesn't even have a class,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.850
so you can be that image.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:29.570
In this case, sometimes there is one instance and this can be from the settings.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.800
So unlike most stuff other elements,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.605
he image elements to they have an extra place

00:16:36.605 --> 00:16:40.490
where you can mess with how they are displayed.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.790
Then you have this width and height settings inside image settings.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.935
So that's one thing can be edited without you editing any of their stats.

00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:50.450
So in our case,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.880
it's not that it's not the class.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.715
Then we go to our parent.

00:16:55.715 --> 00:17:01.850
And I'm not going to go through all of that because it's not fare so well,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:08.420
we're going to do, is we're going to check as these shows children or siblings.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.635
So image this is not going to show us I,

00:17:12.635 --> 00:17:14.210
neither children or siblings.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:20.105
So we have to use their Navigator to see what the children or siblings after element.

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:23.825
In our case image doesn't have many children.

00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:26.014
A doesn't have any siblings.

00:17:26.014 --> 00:17:30.170
The one lonely single child of a right block.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.960
So seeings image doesn't have,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.970
it, doesn't have children or siblings.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.160
What you're going to do is you're gonna go to the parent

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.470
and then check the siblings off their parents.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:46.265
So parodies right block and the sibling is left block.

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:51.230
And so what you do here is you're

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.955
all removed the classes from black block because that's the sibling off the parent.

00:17:55.955 --> 00:18:01.250
So we'll see if that fixes the issue, which it does.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:07.580
So we know now that it's a class that is causing an issue.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.100
When you go through this comma class,

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.715
you will see there is none of the styles are in blue.

00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:17.280
So what does our checklist say about that?

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.600
Once you identify the class that's causing the issue,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.615
put the glass back on the element are start with, okay.

00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:30.890
So we did this without no blue pluses.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.070
So what we need to do if resetting blues styles,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.735
we go to the steps happen.

00:18:35.735 --> 00:18:40.400
If resetting boost styles didn't help or there are no blue styles,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.390
then start resetting the styles in orange color.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.160
Because the orange colored,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.215
the styles that are in orange day are also changing something about the element.

00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:54.050
Although they are not directly resettable,

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.710
because they are being inherited somewhere from the combo class,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.990
somewhere from the parent and so on.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.970
Often this is the case when you're working with responsive versions here,

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.350
most of the things are in orange because they are being inherited from the desktop.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.460
So this is the method that you will usually want to do

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.750
a year in the responsive where you don't see any of the blue,

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.895
so you have to start resetting.

00:19:19.895 --> 00:19:23.510
The orange starts now resetting here,

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.040
there is an option to reset.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.705
So what you have to do it,

00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:29.090
find out what would be the default value

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.225
and just change it manually to that default value.

00:19:32.225 --> 00:19:34.850
So with the margins and paddocks, it's easier.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.440
You know, it's always 0,

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.900
you just change it to 0.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.095
And you see this is not gonna do anything.

00:19:42.095 --> 00:19:45.785
Then you go to that width setting, side settings.

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:46.880
Here it's a bit different.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.805
Each one has a different sort of default value.

00:19:49.805 --> 00:19:50.945
You'll see that week.

00:19:50.945 --> 00:19:54.200
And height they have auto as their defaults.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.760
But minimum.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.250
Has, and you can check since this is

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.560
filled up and you don't know what's the default for a minimum.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.110
You can check this based on the minimum height.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.610
It has 0 pixel.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.080
So 0 pixel is the default of minimum height and width,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.970
or you can change to 0.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.695
And now that's the issue.

00:20:12.695 --> 00:20:19.490
Now we know that issue was coming from minimum width y.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.990
Okay, now we're going to understand,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.465
so it has a minimum width of 800 pixels,

00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:27.365
which means it's being persistently stretching.

00:20:27.365 --> 00:20:29.645
Beyond that it needs to,

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:33.860
and it's pushing the Imagine image doesn't have any space for it to grow.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.080
Though that's why to fix this issue,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.165
then you start shrinking this a better size.

00:20:40.165 --> 00:20:44.755
So image has space to Rome and that's it.

00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:54.040
So this is the mold issues that I'm demonstrating here and shows most of the issues.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.620
There is one more step that I didn't cover and

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.245
this is usually when you're dealing with something like

00:20:59.245 --> 00:21:08.440
a navbar or some components that are coming from the where clause elements panel.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.480
And if you go through all of the steps and you did this and he did the orange reset,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.910
you did everything, it's still not working.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.345
Then there is one last step you'll want to do and in which he's,

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:24.500
you add that element or a component from scratch.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.179
For example, if you are experiencing an issue where the now buried you did everything,

00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:32.165
all the steps that we've done and still nothing.

00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:39.289
Then what you'll do is you'll add a completely brand new.

00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:42.950
Whereas the navbar nav bar.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:51.140
And you sort of position it in the same place where that number is supposed to be,

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.560
and you start checking.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.960
This noun is completely new.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.240
Navbar has the same issues are not.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.740
So you will see if the completely barren new number has the same issues,

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.740
then he issue cannot be width than r bar.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.740
That means it's some other power parent element or

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.905
something about the bodies sometimes, yeah.

00:22:12.905 --> 00:22:17.660
Styles can be changed on the body element here or from there.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.145
Buddy elements tag.

00:22:19.145 --> 00:22:23.750
And that's going to cause some issues down the line or some parent and you know,

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.915
or if you see that the issue

00:22:26.915 --> 00:22:30.530
is not happening with

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.580
the navbar and then you start recreating that navbar step-by-step in,

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.660
you check every time to make sure that you

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:43.145
you identified the moment you make some change here to match your new,

00:22:43.145 --> 00:22:45.635
though older, not bother styled now bar.

00:22:45.635 --> 00:22:53.615
And you identify which one of the classes made the mistake and causing the issue.

00:22:53.615 --> 00:22:58.970
And often you'll see that it's not going to be from the styles and it can be from things

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:05.720
like setting or things like the navigator where something is missing,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.040
maybe an icon is missing and maybe one of these elements is missing from there.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.500
But at least we will be able to,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.310
even if you don't identify what's exactly causing the issue,

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.010
you will be able to get unstuck.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.290
So you're not wasting your time.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.580
You'll be able to okay.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.440
You know, and I'm just going to start from scratch.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.885
I have this old one here and I'll start applying

00:23:26.885 --> 00:23:31.010
the same content than the same style and our recreated and

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:38.675
just check step-by-step to make sure that I don't go too far before making a mistake.

00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:40.250
That's it.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.040
That's all there is saying these,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:50.060
we'll help you with a lot of your issues and will save you a lot of time and headache.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.785
So I'll go through the checklist.

00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:56.640
Hopefully, most of your issues will be identified using the checklist.
