00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
all right,

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.030
so let's start with a hero section will go one by one for each device and optimize the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.580
style.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.010
First,

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.920
the tablet for you.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.620
What issues can we identify here we have the image that is shrinking too much because off

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.750
not enough space,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.430
the content on the left has a minimum weight.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.170
If you remember,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.250
so that means images taking the hit.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.400
Then we have a nap.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.450
Bar that needs fixing will have to see if we can actually fit our regular links in here.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.900
If not,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.250
will keep the hamburger menu and style it.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.580
The hero section is way to stretch for two reasons.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.880
First,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.270
because off 100 VH we have applied to that section and second,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.950
because off that similar 20 VH petting,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.270
let's see if we can fit the navigation links.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.150
So how do we disable that hamburger icon and show the navigation legs?

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.740
We can do that from now.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.650
Bar statics.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.250
Click anywhere on the now bar and go to statics.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.060
As you can see it,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.910
says Menu Aiken for tablet and below.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.950
If we move the slider towards the smart bones that will disable these from the tablet view

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.740
as a general rule for user experience.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.310
Showing links is much better approach than not showing them for obvious reasons.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.520
It's easier to find and navigate real estate on tablets and mobile devices is very

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.230
important.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.940
The spacing on these devices have to be much smaller than what we would do on a desktop.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.760
So let's remove that large padding that is supplied to the section instead of VH.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.130
This time,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.990
we're going to use regular pixels because it will give us more predictable looks.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:49.020
A 92 pixels all right.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.250
The overall spacing for the hero is pretty good,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.390
and we don't have bloated spacing.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.000
That's good.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.570
So what to do with a hero image?

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.650
It's still quite small in comparison.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.870
The left content is too large,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.100
and it's pushing the image on desktop.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.370
We had not real estate to be able to use such large headline,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.100
but here we don't so we can start shrinking.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.950
The size is in the Left Bloc,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.950
-

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:54.350
Uh

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.350
,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.680
so we did shrink the content,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.180
But the image is not growing.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.850
Why's that?

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.860
Because we have minimum with settings apply to the left Bloc.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.030
And even though content is shrinking,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.820
the box itself isn't so.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.240
Let's change this minimum with all right,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.300
that looks pretty good.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:30.730
Let's test the fluidity off this layout by re sizing our canvas great and flows really well

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.770
in the entire page.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.500
So the tablet they are for hero section is done.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.550
All changes that we made has not been reflected back onto our desktop.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.350
It's still the way we left it.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.880
Now let's move to mobile abuse.
