00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Sometimes freelancers get suspended or banned from a poor for doing something that is

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.870
against their terms and conditions.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.130
So I'm going to give you some tapes to make sure that you don't find yourself in a very

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.940
kind of tricky situation with them trying to get paid outside of a porky's against their

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.950
terms and conditions,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.520
And if they suspect that you've been trying to do that,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.730
they will most likely bend your account.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.210
This reason is plain and simple.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.440
A port makes money on transactions and payment transactions that happens between you and

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.020
the client.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.080
And if you try to take those payments outside off the platform,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.580
then they don't make money and you piss them off.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.950
You can find more information about this in their terms and conditions and the clauses

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.420
called circumvention that circumcision,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.370
and you can find out more about it.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.110
They supplies not just a current project that you get from the client,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.680
but also all the subsequent club projects that come from the same client.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.050
There they have that 24 month not circumvention period.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.250
So the moment you start working with clients,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.340
there is 24 hour period where you have to keep the relationship on up pork from that client

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.500
and get paid on outwork.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.800
So there are sort of triggers in your communication that can raise the red flag.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.590
So because the messaging happens using up for US messaging platform,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.900
right,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.180
So in if in this messaging you discuss things like paying near this R,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.660
this would be the red flag trigger words that instantly kind of triggered this suspension

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.510
automatically.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.880
If you mentioned things like pay a near PayPal bank transfers,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.800
I bands anything that is kinda can be,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.940
ah,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.420
sort of associate ID that you're trying to get paid outside.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.560
And it doesn't matter even if the client is sort of initiating the discussion,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.880
and they want you to get paid outside if he agreed to it,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.760
or if you are the one.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.660
If you kind of mentioned something like yes or whatever,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.030
then you will get suspended,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.900
even if they ask you for it to make sure that if,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.780
uh if a client asks you that,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.240
you know what,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.540
let's take this outside,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.440
say no.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.850
You want to keep things on up work Now most of the suspicions happen automatically.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.250
It's just if you mentioned something that AI gets amino trigger than all that stuff.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.000
But sometimes maybe you mentioned PayPal not because you wanted to get paid outside,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.040
but maybe you're giving an example.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.690
Was that PayPal's website maybe are trying to deal design a website that is for the banking

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.690
.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.650
Or maybe you're designing some e wallet or something that is related to financing.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.660
But then it's OK,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.340
because if you get automatically suspended,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.250
then you can appeal,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.130
and then a human being will take.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.050
Take a look at your communication and if they are convinced that you are not trying to get

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.640
paid outside,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.720
but you were kind of discussing this was part of the project that is going to be OK and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.600
they will lift the ban naturally.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.250
If you are discussing this on Skype call or a video call that is not part of up pork,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.560
right?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.400
You know it's impossible for ah,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.660
upward to find out.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.630
But I do have some good reasons for you.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.800
Teoh stay actually on a park at the end of the day.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.860
Op work is a good thing.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.350
It enables so many freelancers to find work.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.630
We all want up work to make money and not go out of business.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.650
And if most of us move relationship out off up work one day,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.720
they'll just go out of business afterwards.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.380
Decreasing commission rate makes it worthwhile after $500 commission slashes in half from

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.750
20 to 10%.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.600
10% isn't that big?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.000
You didn t,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.520
for example,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.740
takes at least 50% of what I make here.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.260
So up work isn't that bat.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.640
And after 10-K earning it slashes again to 5% feet.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.390
That's nothing,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.850
really.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.880
If you got paid through PayPal or credit cards,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.970
you still lose 23% in transaction face.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.220
And if you'd have to deal with currency convergent on top of that,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.050
then you definitely end up losing up to 5% anyways.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.510
Finally,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.380
not having to deal with billing is awesome.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.190
Your clients get charged automatically.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.250
You never have to deal with invoicing and chasing payments.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.620
That saves a lot of time and hassle because as a freelancer,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.050
sometimes there are cases where you do have to chase the pie clients to pay you on time.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.120
But without pork,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.320
it's nice because Derek,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.770
it's credit card gets automatically charged.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.600
And if their credit cards and more confined in the you know,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.550
if the client gets suspended on up work,

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.040
so you know about it as well.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.040
That saves a lot of time and hassle now.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.560
Second reason why freelancers get suspended on our poor Casey if they're sending a lot of

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.980
proposals but not getting awarded a lot of jobs.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.440
Basically,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.580
this happens when you're spamming and sending sway too many proposals without actually

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.590
going through them and kind of deliberately thinking,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.760
When are you applying and exactly applying to where you want?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.810
No one really knows exactly what's the percentage off,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.070
you know,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.050
success rate that you have to get hired.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.200
But there's this rumor that you have to get hired every 20 proposals that you send,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.820
I think.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.360
But it's a room ourselves.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.490
Me,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.950
my name might might not be real.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.120
Might be less might be more.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.830
But if you applied the tips that you've learned in the section,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.250
then that should never happen.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.140
Don't put any skills on your profile that you don't have upwards sometimes does of random

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.000
scale checkoff are freelancers,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.830
and they do the sort of aural tests,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.370
and they do an interview with a freelancer to make sure whatever they put under their

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.320
skills is true.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.660
Once,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.950
actually,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.850
my account was frozen because of this skill check.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.610
They sort of initiated the skill trick on my account.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.050
And I had an interview with a customer service person,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.580
and they were kind of quizzing me on HTML and CSS and ah,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.210
it was strange because I never put HTML and CSS.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.900
That's my skills.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.450
But I guess because I was under a Web design category,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.200
they assumed that I'm you know,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.420
I seem supposed to know HTML CIA says,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.610
Even though I never claimed that,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.250
I knew that.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.400
Luckily I was able to appeal and explain to them that I don't need HTML and CSS to do my

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.180
job and that I never claimed that I knew it and they understood and they unfroze my account

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.180
.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.560
But if I had them in my skills,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.240
and I would have been totally screwed,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.560
the thing is because up work is such a big platform,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.930
and there's so many people in so much money is moving there sort of attracts bad actors as

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.150
well.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.200
We're trying to game the system and opening fraudulent accounts and doing engaging in some

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.270
different scam activities so up work,

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.730
is very diligent about it and is clamping down in many different accounts to make sure that

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.670
people who are there,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.780
they claim where they are.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.510
And they claim that they know skills and they can perform what they kind of promised to the

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.010
client.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.300
So make sure that whatever you put on a pork,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.560
everything is true and authentic thing and you're not trying.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.900
Teoh sort of came the system because they do have they don't have a big tolerance.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.190
So even if something is like,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.530
you know,

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.240
shake it,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.650
just remove anything that is not 100% truth.
