00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
Usually my website project starts by client emailing me a one paragraph of description of

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.300
what they want.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.330
And usually it goes like,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.560
Oh,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.760
hey,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.450
Vacco.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.750
We would like website for our app on,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.790
but we don't have screens or content or anything else.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.910
Yet it's very difficult to create an entire website out off.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.860
No content,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.900
no project brief and no app screens or no brio,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.510
valuable information that I can use for the website that's realign.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.960
That's how things work usually,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.480
and you don't get a perfect project with all the content and photos and app screens or

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.350
whatever ready for you to start designing.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.890
In the beginning,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.690
I didn't have ah,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.270
process on my plan was to just wing it and just get going with the project and see where it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.670
goes.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.250
This was a terrible idea for three reasons.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.170
First I would get stuck.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.310
I would be staring at the screen without having any idea what to do and what to design and

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.660
thinking.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.790
I just had a creative block or something like that.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.410
But no wonder.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.250
How can you design something when there is nothing to be designed?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.590
The second problem was big for me cause I would spend a lot of time designing something and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.470
creating and at least getting to liking a page or maybe have a page.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.770
And I would send this result to my client to sort of agree on the creative direction and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.150
look and feel that I was going towards.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.720
And then often I would get a complete rejection and that there would be like,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.890
you know,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.070
no,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.980
we don't like this style.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.380
We want something more like this.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.080
This was very frustrating for me in the beginning,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.080
because I get a little kind of agitated Ted and I'll start telling myself All these guys

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.200
don't know what they're talking about.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.890
They don't have a good design taste and just bullshitting myself.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.540
Just say Okay,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.930
fine.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.180
And just get back to work.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.050
And Crumpley Bork on a new look.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.890
The third problem was this.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.220
Start my work and get to some sort of final results with,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.590
you know,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.650
going through different iterations and finally agreeing on design.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.040
But often the dummy.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.860
The content was dummy content inside,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.410
so that tax was dummy content.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.580
No photos were sometimes really,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.760
because maybe I needed photo.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.330
So far,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.670
users for testimonials or reviews or photo self team members or something like that.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.550
And they're not to give my client toe homework,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.050
too,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.350
you know,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.820
provide me and write and gather all that content that I need it.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.820
But often client would come back with a different structure for their content.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.930
So,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.560
for example,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.660
if I designed a section with three columns,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.460
the client would come back with a copy for two or maybe five columns.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.450
But this sort of content is optimal.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.540
If we have three or four columns for two,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.970
it's just not very nice.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.880
And for five,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.210
it's just too much content to fit in one row.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.070
This was absolutely not my client's fault.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.330
It was mine because I'm gonna have a process.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.910
I didn't have a proper design or project process to go through now,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.840
which is winging it.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.130
But the moment I figured this one out and created a proper design process and in project

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.130
process for me,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.010
things have changed dramatically.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.030
It's the project just moved smoother and nicer.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.330
Ah,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.450
faster,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.080
last situations to go through and this is funny.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.800
But designing actually became easier in the past.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.000
I was just trying to take the whole project in one go in,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.690
just like stuffing myself with a full frickin Brito in one go,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.960
and it was too much to handle.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.030
I was in guiding my clients through different steps that we had to go through in my plan

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.380
was just,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.670
you know,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.010
going to the room,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.310
locked myself and then one week later emerged with this brilliantly well designed website

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.770
and then just hope and pray that clients loved it.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.870
So here's a three step process that great designers go through before they even pain the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.650
first pixel.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.240
The first step is to define a project brief.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.240
It's a short description of goals and details of the project.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.380
The project Brave asks important questions like What is the goal of the website and who is

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.940
it for?

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.470
An answer to these questions will align both you and your client on the same page,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.750
making sure that everyone has had it towards the same direction.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.430
The second step is creating a mood board and getting your clients feedback on it.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.330
This is something we already know how to do,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.010
and we've done it to gather inspiration for ourselves.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.680
But if we share this boot bored with our clients than we can get more benefit from it By

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.090
sharing a mood board with your client,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.210
you can nail down a taste and a look and feel off your project because there is many

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.250
different styles that you can go with,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.470
right,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.080
you can go a bit more photography having for your website you can buy but go a bit more.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.440
Illustration heavy,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.610
a bit more colorful,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.310
less color for right.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.830
So there is many different avenues you can take with with your project and your designs.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.150
And often clients have very specific tastes.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.340
So you don't want to find out some information because they do have a hard time explaining

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.750
themselves and they don't know you're the designer and you have access to all the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.940
inspiration in the world.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.380
You know,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.240
these websites like cripple our interests and lap I lend book and you go there and you find

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.850
inspiration.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.620
You gather this and you work this so you have access to these sort of inspiration.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.440
But they don't that websites they don't see that might not be that much.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.190
They're busy with doing other things right,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.570
and by sharing this information to them,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.410
you can nail down and kind of meat on the same page off the look and feel,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.730
because if you don't that what you're doing is you have to go through reiterations until

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.440
you get to their sort of taste and that just so much more work to do,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.780
right?

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.880
Why would I go through different iterations to finally nail down the taste in Just general

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.880
,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.550
look and feel off the site where we can just grab examples from other websites and other

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.340
inspiration and show them OK,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.950
which one do you like this for this?

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.550
The third step of this process is to create wire frames.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.860
Wire frames are sort of a rough sketch off the site.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.640
A skeleton.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.780
We don't worry about colorist or typography or any need a greedy of design.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.220
This is,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.770
for example,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.910
or wire frame off YouTube.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.270
It shows what goes where and what's the content.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.040
Very simple.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.680
Not much design going on that it looks like a child wrote,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.630
but wine framing has a huge benefit because you are able to discuss with your client.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.880
A very important part of that website wants the content because design always has to

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.300
accommodate the content because design off our small to line paragraph is going to be very

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.720
different from a design off a 5000 ward document,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.150
right?

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.660
So you have to nail down the content.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.290
What sorts off photos for software does the buttons go and everything,

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.650
And doing this during the design process going through the situations during the design

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.440
process is just much more work and more wasteful because you have to worry about every

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.590
single pixel on caller and shades off different colors and shadows and all that stuff,

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.150
which is absolutely unimportant when discussing the content and when content changes and a

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.420
structure changes,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.850
then you have to dump everything that you designed already waste your time and then start

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.050
over from scratch.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.430
But during the wire framing,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.030
it's very simple because there's not much to design.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.760
You don't have to worry about making everything aligned or pixel perfect,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.050
right,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.030
and you don't get frustrated if Climb decides that they want to restructure the entire

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.740
content off the page keeps everyone happy and on the same direction to the final goal.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.240
So the three stages of good design process our project brief would boarding and we're

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.040
framing at the end of each stage.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.550
You have to share the results with your client and agree with them and sign that off,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.670
cause if you don't do that,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.090
then sort of bits the purpose you need to get the feedback off the client to make sure that

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.870
you're not going to a wrong direction when you keep your clients in the loo.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.440
First of all,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.010
they feel like they're in control of the project and they love that idea.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.570
They want to know how things are going.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.780
Second always shows you you're you're a professional,

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.570
that you have a project process going on,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.010
and they know they understand that they are.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.760
They are in the great hats.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.730
And once you finalize all those three steps,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.310
that's when you move to the design process and design results that you produce are going to

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.940
be much more appreciated and like by our clients because they were part off the process.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.530
And this is exactly what we're going to do in the upcoming lessons.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.130
Stick around
