00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
we know how to gather inspiration for our projects,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.240
and now we're going to learn how to use that inspiration for our designs.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.140
As I mentioned before,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.890
there are three stages to the mimic method,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.340
which is copying remix in the final stage,

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.950
creating in this lesson we're going to practice 1st 1 the copying.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.350
You're going to fully recreate figments home page.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.530
Your objective is to match their design as closely as possible pixel by pixel.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.230
By doing so,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.430
you'll gain valuable hands on experience.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.500
Your practice designing very common website elements such as navigation bars and different

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.260
companies and food and all that in Dool that while you don't have to worry about colors and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.120
typefaces and phones and layouts and old,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.650
that's all the designs stuff because you're just,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.830
you know,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.210
coping what's already there,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.650
one small step at a time,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.000
just like learning how to cook or play guitar.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.510
Okay,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.430
so opened the figment.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.810
Filing to this video.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.350
Here you'll find the screenshot of figments home page.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.620
It's not a full home page of removed.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.850
Some of the sections took keep things simple,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.140
and it might not be the current version off their actual homepage,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.740
but That's okay.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.820
We don't care about that.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.010
It's,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.300
Ah,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.050
pretty simple and timeless design,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.160
so it's perfect for this assignment.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.950
On the right,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.400
there is a blank frame where you will recreate this exact home page.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.590
When you work on this assignment,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.280
I want you to notice all those design principles that you've learned so far.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.850
Notice.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.240
How are they using hierarchy and contrast?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.400
How are alignments made notice,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.850
things that you think they've done well and those that you think might be improved with

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.800
what you have practicing phlegm already.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.570
You know enough to complete this task,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.620
although I'll get things started and demonstrate some of the parts.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.040
First,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.350
let's prepare some guide so we know where to align our objects.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.670
It doesn't look like they're using a strict greed here on their website or in place.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.540
I couldn't figure it out,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.550
but I don't think they are,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.580
so we're going to have to draw guides manually.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.480
This is quite simple.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.100
In fig MMA.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.820
In the main,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.450
you search for the ruler so you can enable it.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.600
Once you click on it,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.450
you'll get this vertical and horizontal ruler on the page to draw a horizontal guide.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.180
Click and direct from the horizontal ruler and you'll get this horse and for guide,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
which you can position anywhere on the page or on the frame.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.350
And the same thing goes for the vertical guide.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.600
Now where do we draw this?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.020
Guides on this frame,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.470
I have included the screenshot off the home page.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.060
It's hidden now,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.070
if you enable it.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.160
You can use this as your helper when comparing your design with original.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.660
While you have this enabled draw the guides on the edges off,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.000
some off their elements.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.550
Or you can define the container where the Havel their content put together.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:52.760
That should be enough for now to delete a guy just selected,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.590
and he till it you can hide the screen shut now.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.460
Next,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.650
let's paint the background.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:10.610
Let's insert the hero image.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.460
I have actually saved all the image assets in this file so you can easily insert them in

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.170
your design.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.950
They are inside this confident stab competence and Sigmar elements that we can create and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.260
reuse later this sicko future and we will talk about it more in more detail in a later

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.630
lesson.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.420
But for now,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.800
all you need the competence for is to grab the image assets.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.750
You can also find these images in the competence page.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.090
This is actually where Fig Mayes grabbing their competence from.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.910
So if you do it,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.250
something here is going to disappear from the competence panel as well.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.470
So find the hero shot and drag it onto the page,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.550
the same thing you can do with every other image,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.550
including the logo.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.450
Now let's insert the text.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:07.840
The typeface that they're using is a paid phone.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.290
So instead I found a free alternative on Google phones that looks sort of similar.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.760
It's called Carla.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.220
It's not an exact match,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.850
but a pretty decent substitute.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:39.550
They're using a bold style for the headline Let's add the paragraph underneath.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:50.850
It looks like it's 18 pixels in size and a little extra on the line height.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:12.130
Now,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.780
lads at the button buttons are just rectangles with text in its,

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.410
so we draw a rectangle.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.470
I'm going to enable the screenshot guy to draw the rectangle over it and just simple that

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.650
color from the button.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:34.930
Their buttons have rounded corners to do the same.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.100
We can change corner radios off our rectangle from the properties panel Natural.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.530
How many big cells they are using.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.070
So we're gonna have to do that by I four.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.480
Seems like a good match.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.020
Lastly,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.660
we need to add the button text.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.750
It seems like the text size is Seimas The paragraph.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:06:02.430
We just have to center,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.850
align the tax and also aligned attacks with the rectangle from the alignment panel.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.090
Okay,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.220
there is just one more thing.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.720
I'm going to show you how to do,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.380
and the rest is up to you.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.350
We haven't had a chance to design a filled like this yet with the border as usual,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.710
this is just direct and go without a field color of but with the border in fig MMA,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.980
that's called a stroke,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.850
which you can add to indirect angle from the stroke settings on the properties pound.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:39.690
Remove the field off the rectangle by clicking minus Aiken on the field,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.150
or just change it to white.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:50.550
Changing the color of the stroke happens just like anything else,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:57.500
and you can change the thickness from here if you need to.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.080
And that's all.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.440
Now you know everything you need on one last thing.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.370
This section right here has longer text.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.650
I have included this text in the page here,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.850
so you don't have to type them out manually.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.830
That's it.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.390
Have fun
