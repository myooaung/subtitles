00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
some of your clients will have an experience with Web slow,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.380
and they will want the website directly build inside it and there will be looking for what

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.930
floor designer specifically.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.310
But for others that will not might not be even familiar with Web slow.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.740
So you will have Teoh sort of convince them to use Web ploys.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.650
The platform thes glands can be split in two types.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.000
Those who don't have any requirement where you're going to build the website in second.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.430
Those who have some sort of preference towards particular platform.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.090
Usually that being WordPress,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.640
selling Weppler to those who don't have a particular requirement or preference where you're

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.750
going to build it really doesn't need that much convincing.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.340
Most of my clients are like that and they usually just trust my expertise on where I'm

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.450
going to build the website.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.350
The only thing that might need a bit of convincing is the hosting costs off web flow

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.490
because so there is the hosting off.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.940
Each website basically has a hosting right and you have to pay for each websites hosting,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.010
which is usually $15 per month for a regular static website in $20 per month.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.310
for the websites that have a CMS on it.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.420
But the one thing is important to note is that hosting costs money on other options as

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.660
wrong,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.120
even if its board press portrays itself is free.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.390
But the hosting is paid,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.660
so the website has to live somewhere and this is something you will need to explain to some

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.310
of the clients.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.860
For example,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.560
I myself,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.860
when I was running a business,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.450
I didn't know much about where design or development.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.380
And I thought our company website just magically lived in the cloud.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.050
So you might need to explain.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.300
Head appeared of it how this is going to work,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.090
that the website This has to be hosted somewhere and we have to pay that company to hosts

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.330
the website for us on their servers.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.560
So,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.100
for example,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.350
let's take blue Host as an example,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.380
which is one of the biggest and most popular hosting providers.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.260
Their prices started $5 per month that website rulers sometimes advertise three year in

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.780
advance plants and they will tell you in less than $5 per month.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.830
So I'm taking one year in advance,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.170
right?

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.500
If you buy the entire one,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.590
your package then comes down to I think the minimum is the $5 per month and if we use the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.460
same kind of approach on Web flow and if we buy any old price,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.540
this is what I usually do.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.100
I just buy,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.370
you know,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.960
in your prices for its website and then the price comes down to $12 month,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.000
so they give you a little discount on it so you can see that already shrinks.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.700
The difference between well flows 12 month and then something else and other alternatives

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.050
that could usually will be around at least $5 per month.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.220
Now where actually the pricing on private hosting really comes down and makes it really

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.500
cheap.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.220
Her website is when you're hosting multiple websites because regular,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.950
private hosting providers,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.040
they also key view the price that I gave you right now,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.850
it was only for one website hosting,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.350
but with this very small kind of price increases going to $3 per month increase.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.390
Now they give you a different plan which lets you host unlimited amount of websites,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.140
obviously limited,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.210
based on how much bend with and how much storage you're gonna get there,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.480
but they don't usually limit you.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.980
How many websites who can host on your one single plan with them,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.580
and so you can just build any as many websites as you want.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.390
And that's where the price is really come down her website.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.820
But issue is that regular clients can't really use with these benefit because regular

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.730
crimes usually have one business and they need one website,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.400
right,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.930
so they're not never going to benefit out off hosting 100 different websites on one single

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.370
plan because they don't need 100 different websites.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.530
They just have one website,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.890
right,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.180
and I mean website because and of course,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.660
we can have even on Web floor.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.920
We can have one website we will put pay only one plan,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.020
but we can have,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.260
you know,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.690
it can have 1000 pages.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.660
That's a different story.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.220
I'm talking about different websites on different Web addresses and things like that,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.550
right,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.410
So that's the big kind of money saver on private hosting Now,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.010
for example,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.570
if I was workers developer,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.490
what I could do is have my own account right on one hosting plan and then every website

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.220
that I feel for all of my clients,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.250
I would host them they're right.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.650
So per website.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.010
Now you know the price would come down very,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.780
very chip,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.150
right?

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.580
Because I'm just I just have one account,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.790
one hosting plan,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.500
and then every website is going there.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.750
And then what I can do is I can charge to my clients are annual hosting costs or management

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.630
fees for H website.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.190
And then I would pocket the difference.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.160
And that's what obviously,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.610
a lot of what developers dio but that then ends up as a similar price to declined at the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.450
end of the day.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.190
So for the client,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.450
they don't really have a lot of options because no Web developer is going to pass up on

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.720
that very good opportunity to make extra money and offer completely free hosting right,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.940
because they would still have to,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.310
you know,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.990
pay for it and all that stuff.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.180
So why would they offer it for free now for other important benefits on Web?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.840
So you get what's called a managed hosting manage.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.120
Hosting means that they do a lot in the background for you,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.140
things that you or your client never has to worry about,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.880
like automated backups,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.910
security,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.460
malware,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.500
scanning and removal server side software updates,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.790
performance improvements and much more that I don't understand and I don't care about as

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.250
long as it's taken care off.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.070
Security Maintenance is a big issue with servers.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.330
I once had award per side,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.090
which I self hosted on a chip server one day,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.260
some malware gatting and turned my side upside down.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.740
The site was going on and office constantly.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.850
The malware was using all my server band ways.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.500
I couldn't figure out how to remove the damn thing.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.900
It was my personal side,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.250
so I just decided to take the whole thing down and cancel the hosting.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.800
And if that's not enough for the difference than this is a typical trip is hosting Plans

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.270
usually give you a server space in one single location.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.940
A computer called the Server where your website lives.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.090
If I'm in Australia and the servers in the US than a website,

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.570
content needs to travel through cables all the way from us to Australia.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.050
This makes a side load like a snail,

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.280
but what flows Hosting comes with what's called Cdn Content Delivery network with wet floor

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.280
,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.770
your side loads from the nearest server to the user.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.530
So if a user is in Japan.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.230
The website will load from a nearby server in Tokyo,

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.560
not from California.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.230
Off course where floors in the only hosting toe offer that.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.450
But moment you add city and future on regular servers.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.600
Pricing starts to rise and come quite close to a Web for pricing.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.430
If that's not enough,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.900
what PLO hosting has one more trick up their sleeve?

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.010
This a benefit that regular managed service don't have?

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.760
You see regular service need to be ready for anything.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.210
Users may install WordPress,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.790
Jundallah,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.280
Drew Paul or even all three of these systems and run them all at once.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.290
Thes poses no problems for the sever,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.330
but it does mean that it cannot be fully optimized to run just one particular system really

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.750
well.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.470
By workflow,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.040
servers need to run only one system Web flow,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.020
so it's highly fine tuned to run on,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.800
Lee wept Flow.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.860
Now off course,

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.970
there are comparable hosting providers that match all workflow.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.430
Benefits that specialize in single platform are managed and include city and features,

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.350
but they end up more expensive than wet flow.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.200
For example,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.160
WP Engine,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.880
a popular provider of specialized WordPress hosting that has all the same similar futures

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.130
that wet floor offers starts at $35 per month.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.890
So there you have it when compared to one website versus one website hosting.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.350
The prices come very similar or sometimes even more expensive on the other side.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.000
If you're using the very same futures,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.550
that kind of work flow offers.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.740
And at the end of the day,

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.350
if a website cannot bring more value to your client than $20 per month,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.650
then what's the point of that website anyways?

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:22.100
Second type of clients will have preferences to specific flat from usually ward press now,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.100
because before you make the case and try to convince them to use reptile,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.960
you have to understand what is the reasoning behind them.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.170
How do they how did they came to the conclusion that they need to use war?

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:41.790
Press Israel platform because sometimes there is a specific future or a requirement that

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.370
they have.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.840
Your clients might have that wet flow is not able to meet,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.460
for example,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.500
if the team has been using some WordPress plugging for their past website,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.240
probably because they had them mean a website on the WordPress and they were using some

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.210
specific plugging.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:03.030
Let's say you're working with a dental clinic and they are using a specific work press

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.920
plugging for their appointments like,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.190
you know,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.100
booking appointments,

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.280
you know,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.410
like calendars.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:08.720
And then,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:08.970
you know,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.190
users go on the website,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.000
there's calendar,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.290
and then they book an appointment.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.980
Something like that,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.280
right?

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.750
And they're being using this visit,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.720
particular plugging.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.230
And maybe they really want that plug in,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.140
because maybe the staff is used to it.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.530
Or maybe it's plugging somehow in their kind of business process,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.180
or some integrating with other applications that they are using themselves,

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:28.470
maybe,

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.290
or some other scare am or something like that.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.900
In that case,

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.580
right,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.890
they really need to see no 100% cape with that plug in.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.450
You are not able Teoh,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:46.020
because if that blogging is wet flow specific WordPress specific than there is nothing you

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.070
can do about it now.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.760
Obviously,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.720
there are a lot of white alternatives and appointment booking applications and third part

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.420
party applications that are not platform specific,

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.680
and most of the really good ones and most of the great third Party applications are like

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:00.850
that.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.210
They're not platform specific.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:08.260
They're kind of codes that you can install on any website and you could find alternative.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:14.110
But if they really want to stick to exactly that plug in because they for some reason then

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.650
there is nothing you can do about it.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.830
And their only option is to go with WordPress platform and that's it.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:26.130
So you have to find out ive very some requirement that it needs to be met that they need to

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.560
meet.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.340
And if you cannot fulfill it with buffalo,

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.670
then you have Teoh pass on that client.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.470
And if you didn't find any requirement that weapon can't meet,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.600
then tell them that you have a better solution for them than more.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.450
Press and give them three big wet floor benefits.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.620
First,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.700
the painless and high performance wet flow hosting all those points have mentioned earlier

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:48.700
.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.460
The Cdn.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.580
Better security faster Last hassle cheaper.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.430
Second,

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.020
how quickly you can build,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.030
iterated and deliver their Web site.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.580
The Web flow designer.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.730
The coding.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.380
A website from scratch takes way more time and third benefit wept Flow editor.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.930
That's a big one for clients.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.940
WordPress and other CMS are confusing for most people.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.990
Their ugly,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.600
they're clunky and slow.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.350
They're not very enjoyable to use you have to go into the back office and added content

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.150
from there.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.010
But what Flows editor is right on the life site.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.850
Clients can just go in the life website and start editing content right there and then.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.470
And that's how,

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:30.300
actually make the case for Web flow with your clients not much to actually sell.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.240
It's quite simple and straightforward.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:39.230
I myself actually rarely need to make a case for these because most of my clients ah,

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.230
they trust my expertise.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:46.240
They're not very concerned where I'm going to build because they're businessman and

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.730
enterpreneurs and often even buy pork with teams that are kinda tacky.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.890
Development teams and even they are not very concerned where I build it,

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.070
as long as it's efficient for me and I produce it.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.860
And I can iterated really well because I am the one in reality who is building a website,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.750
and I'm the one who's gonna be editing that website and all that stuff.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.940
So it has to be fast and efficient for them that I can,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.200
you know,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.310
make it really easy and they ask me,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.220
You know how much that is going to cost them?

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.030
Tell them the prize,

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.980
and they say OK,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.960
but in those cases where definitely workflow seems like the best option for them and there

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.870
is no limitation and you,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.740
But for some reason,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.630
maybe you still face resistance from your clients,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.550
maybe about the prize or something else,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.150
then all these benefits that I described are enough to seal the deal.
