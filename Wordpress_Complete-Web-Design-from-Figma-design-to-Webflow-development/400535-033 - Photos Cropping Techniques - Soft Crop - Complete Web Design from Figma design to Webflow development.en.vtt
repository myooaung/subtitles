00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
another type of cropping is called a soft crop.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.360
Soft group doesn't have a hard edge.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.700
The image gradually fades away.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.770
This is usually done by adding a fading overlay on top of the image.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.420
When it's the same color as the canvas,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.510
especially white,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.340
it looks like the images just from,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.530
you know,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.450
fading away.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.700
It feels natural now.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.250
We have an excellent space on the left where we can add our content.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.780
The result looks fantastic.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.110
The content is laid out on the white part of the composition,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.030
this gear said,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.200
a healthy amount of breathing space.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.490
The content is airy and free.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.280
It's natural.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.550
Merging with a background image without blocking gate and creating extra noise.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.790
Are we using the design concepts that we've learned so far?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.690
You bet we are.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.400
There is a clear focal point,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.360
which is the mountain peak emerging from the clouds.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.680
The rest of the content is arranged with a proper visual hierarchy,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.000
starting with a large and bold headline.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150
And there is a clear greed and alignment.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.920
This is a very simple yet super powerful trick.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.250
It's one of my favorite go to techniques when I'm working with images,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.390
desktop and laptop screens are quite wide,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.440
yet sometimes you find the perfect image.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.340
But it's vertical,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.450
not a good solution to use it as a background for a widescreen section like this.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.980
Most of the images oddly cropped and loses its meaning.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.150
It's too confusing and easy to look at,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.350
and there is practically no space to lay out our content.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.550
Nearly never,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.950
ever.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.170
You want to place a vertical images background for a full width section with a self crop,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.750
we have a total different result.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.310
The photo maintains all its important aspects,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.530
and we have a perfect space to place.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.470
The content on this layout has a clear focal point,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.190
which is the guy,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.000
obviously,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.850
and the content has great readability because it's on a white background.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.950
If I use the vertical images of full with background,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.750
I get a very chaotic result.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.120
The content is merging with a focal point off the image.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.660
There is not enough visibility for the tags.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.570
It's hard to read,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.430
and the whole thing is just very noisy with a soft crop.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.130
On the other hand,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.820
we give each piece off this composition its own space,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.600
giving us a nice,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.460
clean look with high visibility photos that I have a uniform black background is even

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.550
easier to work with.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.400
Just simple.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.680
The color from the very,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.030
very last picks on the edge of the image.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.850
Fill the space with that color.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.720
Arrange the image in the position that is the most suitable,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.760
and you get easily out with a lot of space to place your content beautifully,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.090
extending the edge off.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.340
This image like this can work on other colors besides black,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.470
but admits in an extra fix on an image like this,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.850
if we feel the space using this method,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.630
we'll get a result like this.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.550
There's a strict separation between the image and the background,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.320
which is an evident floor,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.610
and we never want to have a design with evident flaws like this.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.050
Hopefully,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.840
you can see that hard edge between the sand and the background color,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.020
maybe on your computer.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.460
Because of the video compression,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.390
it might be blurring out that hard edge,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.300
but it's there.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.570
This happens because really,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.400
life objects are never single color and not even unit for objects like sand.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.430
So when we simple a single color from the object,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.220
it's only that one single collar one way to fix this is by applying that same Grady and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.730
fade.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.550
And in this case,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.660
instead of using wide,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.780
we will simple this exact color from the image and done now the Senate smoothly and natural

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.780
,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.650
emerging with that background color.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.550
On the green side,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.780
though,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.210
there is a lot of texture and more color makes,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.080
so the result doesn't look as natural.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080
It's not bad at all.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.450
It can be used just fine,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.600
although unlike other three examples here,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.250
the green appears is a Grady int overlay over the image.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.620
It's more like a fading curtain on top of damage,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.580
which is perfectly fine thing to do,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.950
and you can definitely use it.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.370
However,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.290
there's one trick that I use in such cases,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.200
which gives us more pleasing look like Michelle you.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.350
If our images and wide enough to fill in the entire frame,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.320
we can take the part off the image that is simple,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.020
without any complicated shapes and stretch it to field of remaining space,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.170
it's important to stretch only that part of the image instead of stretching the whole thing

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.170
.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.020
That part that it's simple,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.380
doesn't have a lot of details and isn't in focus this way,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.390
the important part of the images crisp with its original proportions.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.340
You can't do this with old photos only if the photo has already blurry background that can

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.070
afford extra stretch at the copy,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.040
and we have a very good looking section that feels natural and the content is easy to read

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.290
and the whole section is really well balanced.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.710
This is our simple and fun design can be small tricks that give you great results.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.240
The knowledge off the streets is what designers get paid good money for.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.050
My clients usually refer to this as magic,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.610
and they will tell me,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.160
Overcoat,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.250
we need a new design for these page.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.020
Can you do your magic?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.130
But it's not magic,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.790
it's science.
