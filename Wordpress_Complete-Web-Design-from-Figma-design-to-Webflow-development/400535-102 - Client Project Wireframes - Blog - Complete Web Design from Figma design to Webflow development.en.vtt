00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
every blow admits a page where users can browse all the block post in one place.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.090
So that's what we're going to do in this video.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.700
Create wire frames for the blocks homepage.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.090
My favorite designed for the Blawg is agreed layout something like in this example.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.020
But in our case,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.750
we're going to do a bit simpler.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.370
We don't need to look for inspiration.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.250
We actually have something in our mood board that we can use.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.620
This sort of card layout would be perfect for our block page.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.100
Each blood card would have a cover photo,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.860
a headline,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.530
a few lines from the post and author details.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.130
So first,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.460
let's prepare the page.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.450
Let's duplicate the post page and work it from there.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.360
We can keep the navigation bar and the footer the rest.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.750
We can get rid off and let's enable the grid.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.970
First we can put a headline and a sub had we can name me to blawg or latest posts or

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.850
something like that.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:28.720
Now let's create a

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.250
bloke Post card.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.180
Three cards in one row should be their best layout.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.740
I think.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.550
Let's give it a color from our wire frame color palette.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.600
Next,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.140
we need a thumbnail image,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.550
which we can track from the assets tab,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:02:03.550
then a headline and few lines from the block post itself.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.150
Heading three style should be good for the headlines,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:26.850
Uh,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.100
and for the tax I'm going to go with Caption paragraph seems to be too big.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.690
One advice.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.550
Keep with wire frame kid styles.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.350
You want to limit your design decisions at this stage as much as possible.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:55.890
The goal is to concentrate on the structure and content inside the advanced type.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.530
There is the setting for re sizing off the tax block.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.500
Grow vertically,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.640
makes it behave like a paragraph keeps the with fix,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.930
but it grows vertically on new lines.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.920
If you choose grow horizontally,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.510
then it's going to be exactly that.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.610
Keep the high fixed and grow tax infinitely on a single line.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.250
Make a mental note of the settings.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.450
They come in quite handy.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.920
That's looking decent enough.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.850
Now let's add the author and dating for just like on the post page

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:53.930
or good.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.030
Just one last thing lights around the corners like we did with testimonial carts.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.450
Actually,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.760
we shouldn't be worrying about rounding the corners that should be left for the design face

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.760
.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.860
But what the how we've already done it on testimonial cards.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.350
So might as well do it here.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.380
That's rounding the background rectangle.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.610
Now.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.550
How do we around the image placeholder?

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.060
If we do it the regular way,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.250
then that's going to round old four corners.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.640
But we don't want that bottom corners to be rounded.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.450
It looks odd.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.170
We have an option here to round independent corners,

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.080
but if we click on it,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.840
nothing happens.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.440
It's not working because we're trying to add it.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.990
A competent and changing independent corners on the company.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.210
It is not possible if we detach it,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.950
then we will be able to change it.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.820
Hate on the top corners and zero in the bottom ones.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:53.660
Now let's group the whole thing and then duplicated to create a grid.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:08.500
And there we go.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.450
I'm not putting individual content examples for each card,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.270
not really necessary at this stage.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.900
However,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.660
in the designs we will,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.280
because when presenting designs,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.310
it's important to make the work look impressive and as close to reality as possible,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.450
so that clients can envision the final result much better.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.250
One last thing we need to add his pagination.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.200
You know those page numbers at the end off the greed so users can go to the next page with

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.750
rap floor.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.730
The best way to create imagination is to have next and previous buttons,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.050
so we're going to drag one off the buttons from the assets staff.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:52.200
Change the color to something more subtle.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.010
Keep in mind changing their color on the entire company itself.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.990
It's not gonna work.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.850
You have to select the background rectangle and change the color of that shrink the height

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.550
of the button and that's it.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:12.750
Bring the foot or up and cut the extra space off the frame,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:20.330
By the way,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.730
when shrinking the entire frame,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.740
sometimes it might resize the contents.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.300
That has to do with constraint settings off each element on the frame.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.750
I won't go into details right now,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.800
but if that happens,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.320
just hold control or command while re sizing the frame,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.450
and it won't do that.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.940
All right,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.340
all the wire frames aren't down.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.660
We can share this with our client in two ways.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.550
Either we can share it from a presentation mode which will open each page individually and

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.640
to go through pages.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.250
We can just click the left and right arrow.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:58.430
Another way to share is to share the file itself with white frames.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.930
I per fair sharing the file because their wife frames working progress sketches.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.820
So feels more suitable like that.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.070
The designs I'd like to share in a presentation mood.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.050
So it's closer to the final experience off a website.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.220
Okay,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.080
that's it for wire frames up next.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.030
We're going to get started with designs.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.730
Stick around.
