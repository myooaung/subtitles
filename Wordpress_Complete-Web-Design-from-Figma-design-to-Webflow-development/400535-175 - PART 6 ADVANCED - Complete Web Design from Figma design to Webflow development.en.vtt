00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
congratulations.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.970
You went through the main part of this course.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.170
All upcoming videos are advanced that you don't right away.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.800
Need to start your freelance Web design career.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.510
I really hope you've enjoyed the ride.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.230
I realized this course was a handful,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.080
and you learned everything from good designed to wet flow development of successful

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.780
freelancing.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.750
Feel free to revisit some of the lessons from time to time.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.950
They will stick better and you will get even more practice.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.360
My recommendation for your next steps would be to put in some independent practice outside

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.180
of this course,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.170
you can pick a topic or a product that inspires you and build that website for it,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.090
or even a better option would be to take on rial projects.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.570
You can look for projects within your network between your friends,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.600
family work,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.800
colleagues and so on,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.440
and you can take on paid or free projects.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.190
Or you can right away start looking for riel projects and real jobs on up work and other

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.360
freelancing platforms.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.290
And while you do that,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.470
you can go through this advanced lessons at your own pace to keep improving your scales and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.250
keep fueling your enthusiasm.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.230
The tutorials in the section are both design and wept.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.110
Flow related,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.980
for example,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.640
that Photoshopped tutorial on how to cut out an object from the background,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.150
something that we discussed in the design part of this course.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.730
But we never actually went through it as a practice because it was a photo shop tutorial

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.840
and a bit more advanced.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.290
That's why I put it inside this advanced part of the section,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.430
or custom code and bad,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.240
which is for wet floor ride to em bad.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.420
Some third party applications like the commenting,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.880
plugging,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.640
which we're going to do for that website that we've already for the last project that we

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.130
built.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.630
And on the block where we're going,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.610
Teoh insert the custom code for commenting.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.310
Those and some more video tutorials in advance section have fun.
