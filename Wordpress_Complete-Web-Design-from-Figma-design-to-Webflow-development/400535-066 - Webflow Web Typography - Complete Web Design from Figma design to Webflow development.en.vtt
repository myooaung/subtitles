00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Now let's style the text.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.735
Font styles are applied from here,

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:05.580
which you are quite familiar with.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.010
Firstname we need to do is to choose font.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.720
But unlike sigma, here,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.475
we have limited selection of pots,

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:14.580
are typefaces, Poppins and rubato R unlisted.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.520
This means we need to add these funds from Project Settings.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.805
Project settings is a different place from the designer.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.685
And we can access Fanta settings of

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:30.000
this project from this link or from the hamburger menu,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.790
go to the Project Settings and then go under the Fonts tab.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.540
Workflow gives us three options to add funds.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.660
First, Google fonts, which lists all the Google fonts.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.310
And to add them,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.470
we have to select and then add them one by one.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.390
We cannot add all of them at the same time.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.735
Also, Adobe fonts or type Typekit In a similar way.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:52.940
This, as I mentioned in the topography lesson,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.715
needs a subscription to Adobe's Creative Cloud.

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:57.320
Once you have that subscription,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.410
then you can connect this with your account on web law,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.210
and then you can pull funds from there.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.035
And also we can manually add custom fonts just by uploading them.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:08.300
In our case, we need Google fonts.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.235
So we're just going to find Poppins.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.770
And once you find that is selected and you'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.110
be asked which variants you want to include.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.045
These numbers are font weights.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:25.370
Css uses numerical values to represent different font weights instead of like naming.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.395
And this is how it's commonly mapped.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:31.640
Sigma can actually show this numerical values to inside fig ma,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.140
there is this tab called code.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.045
This can show a CSS values for many of our elements.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.495
This code isn't really a production ready code like pathogen rates,

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:49.385
but it's useful in cases like this.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.490
And there are font weight. We can see that our heading is 600.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.710
Let's check what other phone which we are using.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.850
So we have six hundred and five hundred and normal for

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.285
puppets And we have normal and 500 for rubato.

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:15.969
We could of course, add all the weight variation,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.200
but it's a good practice to not add to add them because the web law has to then

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.180
load them and sorta of applaud this fonts to the website.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.675
And this is going to add the extra time to the page loading.

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:31.210
Italics are separated versions for each weight.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.030
As you can see, we haven't used any it Alex in our design,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.790
but we should still edit for regular in both weights.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.535
And done. It shows here what bonds and font styles we have added to our project.

00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:49.160
Now, the same thing for rubato.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.605
Let's also include bought 700.

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:55.585
It's an important way for paragraph tags,

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:57.835
even if we haven't used it yet.

00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:01.165
In case if you still have the designer open,

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:03.280
it's not gonna show the newer fonts right away.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.380
So refresh, refresh the designer.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.535
And there now we have Poppins and rubato inside.

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:15.760
You'll see that the weights that we have added there inside and enable,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.085
but those that we haven't added our disabled.

00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:20.155
Okay, so let's start our text.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:25.010
Semi Bolt was our heading regular for the paragraph and medium for the button.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.610
Now for the sizes and line-height,

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.340
font-size for our heading is 75 pixels.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.880
By flow doesn't automatically adjusts line height to default,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.370
so it inherits values from the parent elements,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.750
so we have to add it manually.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.310
And now we can do the same thing for the paragraph and the button text.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.700
Well, I changed the colors. This is quite straight forward.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.250
Just make sure to not confuse these two colours.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.370
One is font color and down below is a background color.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.370
We want to change the color in the typography section,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.290
but the background color for the button.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.560
And that's our topography controls that are,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.120
are other things we can do with typography,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.875
but we'll leave those for later.

00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.835
So to recap, adding fonts into web flow projects happens from the project settings.

00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:03.985
We can easily add Google Fonts directly from the drop down,

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:06.640
we have to choose specific font weights that we need.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.550
This font weights are represented in numbers which we can either look

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.745
up online or find inside fema under Code tab.

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:15.070
Then we have line heights that we can grab

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.830
the exact value of line-height again from the code stack.
