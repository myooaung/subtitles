00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Every project should start with a project brief,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.030
but it often doesn't a project Brie for a design brief.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.490
It's sort of a plan off the project.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.320
It's sort of a guide,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.720
an agreement between two parties that you're gonna move into a certain direction and you're

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.050
gonna get this certain results.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.760
There are different ways to go through and create project braves,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.580
but I have I am sort of my own way because I don't find an official and kind of industry

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.440
adopter ways to be very useful because they are very big,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.190
too much information in it and very not very sort off relevant Teoh everyday businesses and

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.670
everyday real life scenarios like freelancing on a pork and sending some information to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.290
somebody across the continents and not very useful for small project may be useful for Jack

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.560
Mormons corporations,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.740
and that's how they define the project because it has to go through committees and board of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.550
directors on that sort of stuff.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.020
But when I'm working meeting with small start tops and intra preneurs end smaller companies

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.020
,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.220
they don't need any off that their primary concern is time and money and get to the project

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.440
and get through it as fast as possible.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.290
So for me,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.550
project grief is basically answers to certain questions that I need to know.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.090
And these are questions that I ask on the kickoff meeting.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.690
So I have an initial meeting with my clients and we discuss something there,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.370
and I have some questions prepared for them.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.670
I ask them these questions and they give me answers.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.160
And then at the end of the meeting,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.450
I sort of draw a project brief out of this meeting,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.440
basically answering the same questions on the paper.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.130
Send it to them so they can agree that I didn't misunderstand something or maybe we had a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.120
miscommunication.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.460
The two most important questions that I ask is,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.360
What's the goal of the website and who is it for?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.390
You can't really design a solution to a problem before you know what's the problem is

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.260
trying to solve it into no target audience and who is going to be using this website,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.730
a website for a young crowd in their twenties is going to look a little different than a

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.950
website for corporate managers in their forties and fifties.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.160
For our project,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.200
I already have prepared a design brief,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.270
and it's a template that I created from my own design brief that I use and you can use it

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.320
for your projects.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.640
Take it and save it.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.230
Here's what you can do with it when you get to to a meeting,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.460
a chat or email conversation with your client or an employer,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.750
keep this document by your side and ask these questions to them.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.180
You will later refined this questions and ADM.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.630
Or Or remove some to make it work for you.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.980
Once you're done with a meeting,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.910
filled this out.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.030
You can do this during the meeting or later,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.990
no difference,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.070
then exported as pdf and send it to your client to double check.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.910
If they agree,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.980
this will do two things first.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.330
This is going to be a big help,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.670
actually,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.560
for your client,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.370
because what often happens is that my clients don't know what they want,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.000
and this is something that you wouldn't expect.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.150
But they do know that they want a website,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.160
but often they don't know why exactly.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.740
They want the website what sort of website they want,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.360
and they have many different ideas.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.470
And this is very common with interpreters because a lot of interpreters.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.890
They are in their head and there's just 1,000,000 different ideas just buzzing in their

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.240
hand.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.930
And they're excited about everything.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.870
And they have trouble to structure their idea and structure their mind in a proper way by

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.420
going through these questions and answers and then breeding them this later in the design

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.940
brief format,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.550
you give them the ability to create clarity in their hat.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.580
So both of you,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.750
on the same page.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.290
The second thing that's going to happen is that you will appear more professional.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.010
Thes shows that you know what you're doing,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.180
and I have a specific system in place because of these clients will trust you and your

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.160
designs.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.810
MAWR.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.950
They will have better experience at the end of the day because they will get what they

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.890
actually want it because they trust your designs now.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.850
And they will be happier with the results,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.890
meaning that will share it with their friends,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.200
who are often interpreters themselves,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.870
bringing you more clients and more work.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.210
All right,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.210
so I have already filled out this brief.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.300
Let's imagine that we already had a meeting with our client and we have agreed on this

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.860
brief Our client is a startup that is building a team collaboration platform.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.850
The goal of decides to sign up users for early access.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.000
This means that platform isn't ready yet,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.380
but the company wants to market already and generate interest.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.950
This is a common practice with startups to have websites during their development process

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.720
or whenever they're building their product.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.220
Because that way they can generate some interest because they go around looking for

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.950
investors or try to get P R and media exposures that they always need a website,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.690
often before they even have a product.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.550
The target audience of these website is other startups and teams that have employees

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.550
working from different liquid locations.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.400
Client wants a modern website using photography instead of illustrations and with a clean,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.700
minimalistic look,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.300
the website is going to have a block.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.640
This means we're going to build a CMS and is going to need to collect form submissions.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.210
That's it.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.310
That's how simple the project brief should be.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.400
It's called brave,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.840
isn't it?

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.410
So make it short and sweet
