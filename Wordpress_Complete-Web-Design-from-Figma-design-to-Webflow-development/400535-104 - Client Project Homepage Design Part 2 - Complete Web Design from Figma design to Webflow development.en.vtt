00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.150
And we're back, we're going to design this section now.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.715
We're going to need to find some more carbs for the products so we can showcase it.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:14.160
Just like the last time I'm going to search for

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.580
scarce resources and then import them. Inside fema.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.640
We're going to try different keywords like project or a task or a dashboard.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.610
I've already found this mock up which I'm going to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.205
import insight for sigma and then use that.

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:38.870
If you'd like to use the same thing,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.705
you can check the assets paid,

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:42.605
Scharf have put it there.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:45.380
But also if you want to find something of your own,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.980
you can do that and you can go on our resources page

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.790
like 1 fourth sketch or one form phi sigma that I have included

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.010
in the resources page where you can find

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.590
different free mockups and templates or anything

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.515
like that that you could include as their Product Showcase.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:03.410
Whenever you import the file in sigma

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.480
that has fonts that you do not have on your computer.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.325
You are going to get this sort of blank layout that is missing all the fonts inside.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:17.090
Now that message just Fichman was unable to detect any Hans.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.195
So what you need to do in this case is to replace all the textboxes are text layers.

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:27.740
We a font that is available to you.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.585
There is a one easy way to do this which is search in this menu

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:37.850
taxed and select this one which says select all texts layers.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.980
And that's going to select all that x layers that is in this spiral.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.520
But on this page. And once every text Larry selected,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.080
it's gonna look like this.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.820
Where you need to do is go to the text and you're gonna see here it says Mixed Mitch,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.500
Mrs. different fonts probably.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.250
And select something from sigmas.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.280
In this case, we're going to select Roberto and hit enter.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.050
And now all of the text fonts had been replaced and they're stars

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:18.210
like the bold nor or regular dose had been replaced automatically as well.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.565
This meeting screen seems pretty good.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:26.460
We can bring that in and let's use our own blue

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.400
to select contents of a grub hold Control or Command and select with your mouse.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.330
It will do a similar deep select like you do by clicking and holding

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.980
the same k in press shift in case you want to deselect any of the elements.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.280
Yeah,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.160
since this grain is quite wide,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.795
we can move it off the edge.

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:05.340
That's also a pretty good trick.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.390
And I'm going to add a shadow to it to make it more visible.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.430
Here's a tape of foreshadows,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.580
make them subtle, like it doesn't draw any attention to it.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.470
If it draws attention that is too much.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.580
The edges of the screen don't have a good contrast with

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.040
the background wide. There is a nice streak.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.420
Designers using this case,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.125
we can use off-white background instead of a purely white one,

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.495
sort of like what they are using here,

00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:46.850
we can grab this exact off-white color and

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.580
apply on the entire frame as a background fail.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.500
That's a huge improvement.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.750
The edges of the screen are much more clear now.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.620
Let's round the corners.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.955
Now, it's always a better idea to round the corner on interface elements like that.

00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:48.275
It feels more finished.

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:52.410
Pointed corner, sphere like someone gave up halfway through.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.305
You know, it would be nice to do something like this.

00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:59.185
To pop some elements out of the mock-up.

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:03.890
It's going to add more dimension and will make the whole thing much more interesting.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.380
Here's a coffee metric.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.275
You can copy properties more from one object to another one,

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:18.940
like the shadow we're just created.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.550
Just select the property inside the panel.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.445
Click on the edge here to select it properly,

00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:29.350
then control C to copy and pasted on the desired element.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.795
Or you can also create the style out of it

00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:35.270
and save that style and then reuse it on other elements.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.210
Looking at the content.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.900
Yeah.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.010
In all looking fine.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.140
Now let's create a section like this.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.690
Usually the way we've done in other excites,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.385
we had that photo on the edge.

00:10:43.385 --> 00:10:45.755
But these guys, they have it a little different.

00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:49.050
They have a gap on the edge and also in between the sections.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.795
So we can do the similar way.

00:10:50.795 --> 00:10:54.080
We want to find photos that have a bit of free space in it for

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.530
us to place the interface elements like in the inspiration.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.900
A busy picture is not going to work.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.310
Also, what I often like to do is to look for photos from the same author.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.680
When you use photos with different style,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.900
it creates inconsistent Look.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.600
It's an obvious towel that the photos are stuck and

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.750
weren't made as part of one photo shoot for that website.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.325
But the photos from the same contributor will often have very similar look.

00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:20.840
It will have the same style,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.765
same filtering and overall similarity filter it

00:11:23.765 --> 00:11:27.185
using such photos create an amazing consistency on the page.

00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:28.910
In our case, we are unlocked.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:34.055
Their contributor of our hero photo does have other photos that we could potentially use.

00:11:34.055 --> 00:11:37.010
I'm thinking of using this to because they're taken

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.500
in that same scene on that leather couch.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.855
So this Sullivan bigger consistency.

00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:45.990
They're going to feel like we made our own photo shoot for this website.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.420
And now I'm going to take some elements from the mockup itself of

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.440
the product and place them just like inside the inspiration.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.050
Just place them over the photo somewhere.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.150
It's looking pretty neat,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.410
locked out on these photos.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.360
They are not just same style and scene,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.630
but also both models are smiling and looking at each other's direction.
