00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
In this assignment,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.060
you'll practice both overlapping and a bit of repetition in the figment file.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.600
I have prepared one frame with three tax blocks inside your biz,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.000
designing a benefit section for a travel app based on the way I have laid out the text.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.900
I think you can guess that I want you to create this alternating lay out text on one side

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.590
and image on the other side.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.960
But instead of illustrations using regular photography,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.260
and I want you to find photos for each text block.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.350
This way you'll practice finding photos,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.750
too,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.120
for the overlapping style.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.150
I want you to choose one style and use that with all three blocks.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.270
You can either use a photo collage type of overlapping.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.580
This will require you to find several photos for each block.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.950
Or you can use one photo and use a background box behind the photo.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.620
As usual,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.510
use other concepts you have already learnt.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.300
Use decreed,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.270
choose the phones,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.950
create hierarchy and so on.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.110
I'm not going to do an example demonstration this time because you already know how to do

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.010
all of this.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.590
Have fun
