00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
in this video,

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.490
you're going to practice alignment.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.520
You're going to create a very simple design in fig MMA.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.640
It's a follow along video.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.420
So fire up your figment.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.990
Okay,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.070
so we're not going to design anything useful.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.330
The purpose of this exercise is to practice alignment and gain some hands on experience

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.900
with Sigma.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.350
We are going to sketch a hero section off what page?

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.650
Sometimes also called a header or above the fold.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.160
We're not going to do anything fancy.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.740
No images,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.210
no tax,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.420
just bunch of radicals.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.360
Sort of like a doodle.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.350
So what's the first thing we insert when we start any design?

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.410
That's right,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.740
Frank is off.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.730
Showed these in the figment editorial.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.400
We can add a frame by selecting frame to and then selecting one of the presets from the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.320
properties panel.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.650
Let's select the desktop frame next.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.000
We're going to define our creed for this,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.420
Frank.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.010
Why?

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.450
Because we want to structure our websites in a way that it looks neat and organized.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.950
Setting up agreed in Fig Mayes,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.170
very simple greets apply to each frame individually,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.000
so we need to select the frame.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.920
And in the Properties panel we will get an option to add a new layout grade.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.320
Don't forget to select the frame.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.880
Otherwise,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.660
this won't show up by default.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.490
We get this two dimensional grid that divides a framing little squares that are 10 pixel in

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.150
size.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.560
But this is not the grid we want.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.420
What we want is a vertical agreed that divides the page in several columns.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.520
The most widely used layout Great and Web design is 12 column greed.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.760
Why 12 columns?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.810
Because it divides really well.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.110
12 is a multiple off three and four,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.410
so 12 column can be split in half,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.780
with six comes on each side.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.510
He can be split in three,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.640
with each part being for come wide.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.320
Or it can be splitting for with each part being,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.550
you know,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.800
three column wide.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.870
Other layout grids will offer lie assumptions.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.400
For example,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.920
10 or eight Congress can be splitting three equal sizes,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.050
so it's very limiting To apply 12 point greed from the drop down select cones,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.750
ending the count type in 12.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.390
Now let's adjust some spacing before grade.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.590
The counting on the website isn't usually laid out on the edges,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.940
right?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.330
There are margins on the edges off any Web site and the content these sort of laid out in

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.980
the center.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.270
We can apply those margins to our great right here.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.550
Something like Canada for two pixels should be fine.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.340
If we increase the margin,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.750
you can see how columns start to shrink.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.700
One more thing I Lecter.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.430
Just here is the spacing between the Collins.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.770
This is called the gutter.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.660
By default,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.730
it's 20 pixels,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.740
but for me,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.380
it's not enough.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.450
I like to create a bit more step separation between the objects around 30 or 40 pixels.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.770
All right,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.600
this surgery,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.870
I delight you to create the exact same grid with the same values.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.890
This is where we're going to a way out.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.650
Our website content.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.140
The greed is an overlay.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.380
You cannot select it with your mouse,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.950
and we can show or hide the Greek ride.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.650
From here,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.610
there is a shortcut next to it.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.290
It's showing for Mac,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.540
which is controlled G on Windows.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.290
It's probably something else,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.310
but you'll be able to say it if you're on Windows and there,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.690
that's where our design will go next.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.700
I want to give this frame and background color for no particular reason,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.450
just for fun.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.690
How do we do that?

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.390
Remember,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.690
for any object that you want to add it,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.740
you have to first select that Object properties panel instantly up states as you select it

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.740
.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.650
And now we have an option right here to change the background color.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.390
This is a very standard color picker that you'd see on nearly any other design or non

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.430
design application.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.810
Later,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.740
we'll learn color in more detail,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.410
and also I will show you how to work this collar.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.170
Pickler like a pro.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.860
For now,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.970
I'm just going to select a color that I have already saved.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.530
Here.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.410
You can pick any color you prefer or keep it white.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.850
If you would like your background colored and that greed don't have a good contrast,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.020
you can always adjust the color of the grid.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.080
See,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.960
that's much better.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.940
Now let's start laying out some general elements that we would have on a stunner website.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.680
Remember,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.620
we're just doing a super simple wire frame,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.650
so we're going to use just rectangles.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.670
What do we have on top of every website navigation bar,

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.850
which usually contains the logo and some links to a different pages on the side?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.660
Let's draw a rectangle that's going to be our now bar.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.050
You'll hear me sometimes.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.440
Use ah board,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.720
not bar is a short for navigation bar.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.060
Okay,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.380
like being precise,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.410
I'm going to change the height of this rectangle to 72 pixels.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.950
From here,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.340
the H is a value for the height,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.210
and the W is the value for the with.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.960
Here's a quick tip.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.060
If you press your keyboard a rose up and down while being inside this field,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.950
you can increase or decrease values just like that.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.850
And if you hold shift at the same time,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.450
instead of increasing the value by one pixel,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.150
we will increase it by 10 pixels.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.860
Well,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.880
let's give this navigation bar a slightly darker color.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.700
So one more time if we want to edit an object with selected,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.620
and we will have all the properties in the panel right here,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.390
and we can change the field color off this rectangle from here,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.330
I'm going to make it black,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.350
but we'll make it transparent.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.210
The slider here changes the transparency of the collar.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.210
This is commonly called capacity.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.110
You've probably heard this term before.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.810
Also,

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.150
you can set the opacity from thes percentage box.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.520
Let's set it to 20%.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.160
This is a little design tree.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.220
To maintain the same color palette,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.110
you can use black or white overlays that are semi transparent.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.060
As a result,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.230
the background color spreads through it,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.950
and you get a car that is part of the same color palette.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.720
Next,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.550
let's stroll logo on the left side.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.150
We're going to draw a rectangle as that placeholder for the logo.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.690
Here is where the greed starts to come and play.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.520
When we start drawing objects,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.760
we are going to place them with being discreet.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.590
Columns are options are either to fit it in one column to call on three and so on.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.620
For our logo,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.120
we have an option to go for one or two columns.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.550
Let's go with to the Greek makes our decision process much simpler.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.010
We only had to decide between two sizes.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.050
Instead of deciding between hundreds of different pixel sizes.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.860
Is your recites objects.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.580
You will see the smart guides that appear when you're object the lines to the edge off the

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.650
creek column that will help you size them precisely.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.570
And let's change the color.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.750
The color is up to you.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.440
Another thing I want to do is to make this rounded rectangle to do so.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.290
We'll need to change what's called a corner radius I wanted completely rounded.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.840
This value will depend on the dimensions off the rectangle,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.910
so just increase it until it's fully around.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.050
It doesn't matter if you get a very weird value.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.430
That's our placeholder for the logo.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.000
Now we need navigation links.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.900
I'm just going to duplicate this box.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.050
There are a couple of ways you can do that.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.750
The most obvious ways to go control C Control V or Command C Command V on the Mac.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.990
That's going to paste it right on top,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.650
and then you can drag it from there.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.240
But my favorite way to duplicate something is to press out or option on Mac and then

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.950
dragged that object that's going to duplicate the original object.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.080
Let's make this time pixel smaller and fitted into one column,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.750
only to make it look a little more like a link.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.820
Now let's drag a few more of these and align them with columns.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.220
Red.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.490
Quick guides help you it alignment.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.180
However,

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.480
Fig McCann also do that aligning for you first,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.350
we need to select objects were aligning you can just strike a cursor around your objects.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.610
Now we can align.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.950
This objects with one of thes options.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.100
You can probably recognise the shapes from the previous lesson.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.060
The first option will align objects to the left,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.820
and but you know that's not what we want.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.240
We want this option to center objects horizontally and all right.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.050
That's our not bar for the rest of the content.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:02.790
Okay,

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.840
what do we have on our hero section?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.540
Headline?

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.700
Right again,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:19.780
let's duplicate the spread tangle and make it look more like headline after the headline.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.480
We usually have a paragraph explaining the company or the product.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.250
Let's draw a little something that looks like a paragraph,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.410
All right,

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.570
that's our paragraph placeholder and after the paragraph usually have buttons asking us to

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.240
sign up,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.450
learn more and saw.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:44.500
And that's our hero section.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.780
Let's see how it looks without the greed That's it.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.110
A very simple exercise to get you started and comfortable with fig,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.210
MMA and practice beginning steps off Web design.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.020
We created nothing useful,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.330
but we took a very important step.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.140
Jeff Bezos,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.200
the CEO off Amazon,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.060
loves this lacking saying step by step ferociously this is how we're going to approach this

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.060
.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.650
Scores were going to take one step at a time,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.550
leading us to the final goal ferociously.
