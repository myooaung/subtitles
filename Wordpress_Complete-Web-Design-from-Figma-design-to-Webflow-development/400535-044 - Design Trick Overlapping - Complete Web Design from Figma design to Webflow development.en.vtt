00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
here's a little advanced but very cool design trick.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.330
This trick will actually make your designs look very solid.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.250
Beginner designers that usually scared off it and very,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.690
very you'll see amateur work using this trick.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.950
So if you use that,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.250
your work will certainly appear like a pro design,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.650
the trick is to take different elements and overlap them.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.270
Do you see how the hand off the statue is overlapping National Geographic title and also

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.280
the yellow frame?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.190
It makes the design more interesting and adds an extra dimension to the composition.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.150
The execution of this trick is quite simple.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.590
You take two separate elements and overlap them.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.140
It ties to otherwise disconnected elements together,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.880
and it also creates drama in the design.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.570
Something interesting is going on in our eyes now interested to solve the puzzle,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.740
making an old design and tied together rather than just placed on the page randomly.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.930
The trick is very common.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.950
In prison design.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.240
You'll see headlines overlapping with people,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.540
images with each other,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.870
attacks with tags,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.350
you name it in Web design.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.430
It's a bit more measured and less extreme as you see it in print.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.390
As you can see overlaps in These examples are more subtle on the ride.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.090
You have images that are overlapping with each other,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.020
but they don't create any complex overlap with text blocks and on the left text overlaps

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.250
for the background image.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.150
Quite simple.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.270
One reason I love this technique is because you can add to an otherwise bland design and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.970
nice flair of excitement was recently working on his pricing section.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.430
Usually,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.200
products have several pricing plants right,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.790
and that has some wiggle to play with and create an interesting design.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.050
But this one only had one.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.230
My initial design was something like thes,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.180
which looked very bland and boring.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.680
There was no excitement today.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.100
Send felt like it was just randomly put on there.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.610
I've created a new shape and overlapped it behind the box.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.010
Instant improvement.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.790
Now this is a non traditional shape.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.870
If you introduce something like this on the page,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.480
you have to repeat it again.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.550
Remember the repetition technique.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.060
So I used the same shape and overlapping trick on the other places on the page,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.650
which made a pretty good result.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.490
Let's see how we can apply this into practice.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.510
Say we have a section on the page where we want to show some images.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.270
We could arrange this images to something like this,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.480
which is reasonable but a little boring.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.000
Or we can overlap them and create amore.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.260
Interesting visual.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.950
You've seen this sickening 1,000,000 to self times with photo collages.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.750
Well,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.030
okay,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.390
we do have something toe overlapping here about what to do when we want to use only one

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.970
photo.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.500
Simple.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.580
Let's draw box and overlap it with the image.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.570
And now we have an interesting design.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.680
Plus photo doesn't look like it just hanging in there randomly,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.050
but feels like it's laid where it belongs.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.570
The color of the box is important.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.100
In this case.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.950
I have just simple the color from the image.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.190
But in other cases,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.390
this a good opportunity to use brand colorist or repetition technique to repeat the colors

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.450
across the page.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.730
One thing to note.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.600
Overlapping trick.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.460
A lot of times breaks the grid.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.320
That background box isn't aligned to the great overlapping and the create our sword are

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.560
opposite concepts.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.920
Overlapping Trick is intentionally trying to break the alignment and bring some funding.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.980
The composition Breaking the great intentionally is not a crime,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.950
as I've already mentioned the intentional is the keyboard.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.320
Every design decision has to be intentional,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.800
and if it is then breaking and bending the rules,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.950
a little is welcomed.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.630
In this case,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.910
we're actually not messing with agreed that much.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.480
The boxes in the background.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.160
It's sort of part of the background canvass the image tax and other elements sit on that

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.600
canvas,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.820
which in itself doesn't have a great It's the elements that are on it that leave on the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.200
grid.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.550
The same goes for full with background images.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.490
They are part off the cameras and sit on the background layer so they don't need to be

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.450
aligned with the great.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.930
Let's do an exercise so you can practice this overlapping technique.
