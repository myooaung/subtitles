00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
in this assignment,

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.290
I want you to go back to the figment file from the previous assignment,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.180
go over each frame you have designed and fine tune the final color combinations that you

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.620
have used in your design.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.820
Let me show you this on the same example that I've done myself.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.080
This was the final result that I have settled with.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.150
I think it can use some fine tuning,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.800
especially with the dark brown background.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.950
It's a little too dark,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.660
and the transition between the image and the background fell isn't as evident.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.220
It can certainly use some bright ing and up.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.980
Here's a pro tip.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.770
Duplicate your frames when working on a new variation.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.440
Design involves a lot of exploration and provision,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.930
so get in the habit of having a lot of versions off the same screen.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.800
I didn't do this in the beginning for any new variation are just keep on admitting the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.770
original frame.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.570
Sometimes,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.970
after 20 minutes of tweaking and changing things on end out with an option that wasn't

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.470
better than the original version.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.470
But I have no way to compare and going all the way back was too much trouble.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.120
If you don't keep your variations,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.010
changing your mind becomes difficult and you often and settle for a lesser option to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.820
duplicate a frame.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.220
It's done,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.840
as you would expect with any other element and Sigma.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.380
Either select the framing press control,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.950
seeing control V or drag while pressing out or option.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.200
Okay,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.270
select background layer click fail.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.450
Make sure you have H Hezb e collar management selected and not hex or something else.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.190
There you go.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.600
That's much better to make fine tuning simpler for me.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800
I have a personal rule.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.400
I increase or decrease the values in increments of 10.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.280
This is just to limit my options.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.760
Otherwise,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.200
I might spend the list amount of time on comparing 32 brightness with 33 whole shift and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.690
press on up and down arrow keys to increase or decrease values in increments of 10.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.750
That's if fine tuning the headline caller brings any good results most the time.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.510
I have no idea what's going to work when what not design is a lot of playing around and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.540
comparing options.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.020
The brightness is really good soul.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.450
Just play with saturation.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.250
Oh,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.600
that that's beautiful.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330
Let's see the before and after.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.710
Look at that original wasn't bad,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.170
but I've got even better result the taxes easier to read.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.430
On the newer version,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.960
the transition to the image is much more evident,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.350
and headline and background look like they were made for each other.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.050
So much fun.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.290
I love playing with collars.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.430
Design is supposed to be fun,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.610
so go crazy.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.250
Have fun with it.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.140
If you find yourself struggling with something,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.920
post your questions in Q and A and I'll help you out.
