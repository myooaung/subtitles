00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
in this video,

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.940
we're going to come up with wire frames for the block.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.680
Most page,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.770
actually,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.400
after home pages done wire frames for the block post is much simpler because the navigation

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.280
bar is already done the foot or is done.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.750
We just need to come out with the middle.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.300
We haven't done any research for the inspiration for the block and the blood post,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.150
so let's find some examples and see what we can do.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.830
We don't need to create a mood board for these.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.930
Let's quickly look through some examples.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.050
You'll see that most of it it's quite standard lee out anyways,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:48.840
because you can see most modern examples have a similar structure that headline and posted

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.990
tells on top and the cover image and the body tax.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.350
We can do the same layout as well.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:08.450
First,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.070
let's copy the NAB our number.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.120
In most cases,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.550
you want to have the same across the entire site.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:21.630
Now the headline.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.820
It's a common practice to use narrow with for post content.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.990
We've touched this in the good design part.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.780
The thing is,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.870
paragraphs that are too wide are very hard to read because you start losing line breaks a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.730
common maximum width is about 700 to 800 pixels for the body text.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.350
So let's make the content frame to be 700.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.850
They sink was the headline.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.090
Now that headline has an issue with readability.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.950
But since we're creating this center,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.150
content there to keep things same,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.950
let's include the headline in it as well,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.730
underneath the headline Let's put the author off the Post and the date just like other

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.450
examples

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:39.170
that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:56.080
the in many of this example.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.970
So I like how cover image goes beyond their content.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.340
So beyond this frame that we created so we can do the same thing and create maybe 900

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:15.980
pixels for the cover image and for the body,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.470
just insert some dummy text.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.950
Uh,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:51.380
it's nice to finish the post with the author and their details.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.750
We already have it in the top,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.820
but it's a common practice to put the author on the bottom as well and a bit bigger in this

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.240
time,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.370
uh,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:29.400
that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:52.900
that the after the post page website usually have a commenting feature at the end.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.190
Most of this websites they use third party plug ings to manage the commenting like Facebook

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.950
and discuss using third party commenting Plug.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.080
It's is a great idea.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.590
Most users already have either Facebook or discuss,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.850
and they can start commenting without signing up and all that stuff.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.960
That's what I do on websites to I use discuss plugging,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.220
which is a little better than Facebook because it gives the site manager more control over

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.590
commenting and moderating.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.760
We'll also learn how to install this discuss plug in,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.530
which is going to be inside the advanced part of this course.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.260
But for now,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.210
we just need to put a wire frame that looks like a commenting future.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.350
And that's enough for now.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:35.350
Uh,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:58.810
finally,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.890
let's copy the food,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.150
Er,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:15.850
uh,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:30.790
if that's all,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.660
let's have a look at the wire frame from the presentation mode,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:42.330
just select a frame and click the play button looking great.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.020
Now we can share this with a client,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.770
and that's it.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.440
There will be able to enter the presentation mode themselves to from the filing that you

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.560
have shared with them but is another option.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.360
You can also share the prototype directly.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.430
When you share Fig Mullings with your clients.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.120
It's a good idea to explain how things work out to see the comments you've included.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.050
How to get there,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.110
own comments,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.540
how to enter the presentation mode and so on.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.730
Whenever you share anything with their clients,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.290
beat fig,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.240
Molly ings or wet flow or anything,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.010
always guide them through the process and explain and tell them how to make things work.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.380
Don't expect them to figure everything out on their own or this wire frames and fig mus and

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.660
mood boards and wept.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.460
Flows and prototypes might be overwhelming for them.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.840
And if they haven't been doubt dealing with such design process than everything is going to

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.010
be Newell this new tools and they might have hard time figuring out on their own.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.770
So guide them through every step of the process.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.380
Give them small explanations of how to do something.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.250
Maybe screenshot.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.900
Sometimes he meant a little video tutorials who could dio and,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.240
ah,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.530
they're going to love you for this
