00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
and we're back in this video.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.760
We're going to learn the basics.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.810
Off forms inside weapon both Inside Elements panel There is a special section dedicated to

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.660
the forms and form elements.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.980
First step is always to add a form bloc,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.180
which comes with some elements Already.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.400
We can remove any off,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.920
they say,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.720
as we like,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.150
and we can add more elements inside the form block.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.930
Let's have a look.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.650
What is this form block made off?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.990
There are three groups inside for which holds everything that we currently see like the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.810
field and submit button.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.040
Then we have a success message that is hidden at first and only shows up wants the former

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.850
successfully submitted and the error message that only shows up when there was some sort of

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.250
errors when user was trying to submit the form.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.510
If we want to add new elements to the form,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.150
we can drag things like drop downs and check box.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:59.420
Inside the form each form Phil has their own settings.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.140
If you click this gear icon on or double click on the form fail,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.420
it will show the setting for this input filled first item in the satins is the name off the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.990
field.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.170
His name is internal.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.270
It's just what we see inside the database.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.150
Users are not going to see the name.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.280
The label off the field is outside.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.620
It's not in the settings.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.740
It just a regular attacks block that is sitting on top of that filled itself,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.040
which we can add it and start just like we would with any text block.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.670
But if we want more minimalistic,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.340
look where the label is inside the field and not outside of it like we have it in our

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.180
designs,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.550
then we can at this under a placeholder field,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.950
and then we can get rid of the label.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.910
The next setting is text type.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.330
Thes means what sort of taxes accepted inside this field.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.850
Right now,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.530
it's set to email so it will only allow emails,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.030
and anything else will given error.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.700
If you want to collect names and regular attacks than we will set this to plane,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.230
then it will accept any sort of information.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.750
You also have password,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.550
phone and number options underneath.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.810
We have an option to make the filled required and maybe autofocus.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.110
Auto focus means that the field will be selected right off the bat as page loads for a drop

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.360
down select field.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.910
Quick show all settings to added the list off choices that's inside the drop down.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.680
You can add it,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.410
the choice says.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.070
Delete them.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.640
Atmore.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.850
Reorder them basically everything you'd expect.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:48.850
We don't need to drop down for our form so we can get rid of it.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.380
All right,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.420
let's dial our form in our designs.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.020
We made the form to be horizontal,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.370
the field and the button next to each other.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.590
Here they are aligned on top of each other,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.330
so how can we align them next to each other?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.680
While the form block isn't any different than all the other elements on this page,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.750
we can give it classes and style them from the styles panel.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.650
The flex boxes an obvious choice when it comes to horizontal alignment,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.650
make sure to select the form element instead of a form block element.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.420
Because we're trying to align field and the button.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.250
The foreign block holds form success and error messages inside,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.640
so it's going to align these three elements.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.100
This is what's going to happen so one more time.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.050
Select the element named form and then give it a display flex.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.000
Now we can start the field and the button independently.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.630
Our failed is 56 pixels.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.950
Hide has rounded corners and has attacks inside.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:17.770
That is 16 pixels with a great color not to make that placeholder text inside the field

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.680
different color.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.310
You'll see that changing the color doesn't do anything to it.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.260
That's because this text color changes the color off the tax that user actually types

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.850
inside.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.270
You can check this inside the preview mode,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.920
but that's not what we want to change.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:41.830
That was fine as it waas to style the placeholder filled going to the States off the field

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.570
and select placeholder.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.550
Now we can change the color of the placeholder text.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.540
You know,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.720
designs were using the great color about.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.280
We have it set to 70% opacity,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.650
so don't forget that.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.110
Excellent.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.150
Now for the button,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.270
let's give it a class name.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.500
But,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.750
uh uh,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:32.950
the text inside the foreign button can be edited from the settings just like other form

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.600
elements.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.630
This is a little different from other buttons where we can add a text directly by clicking

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.230
through it.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:55.450
Uh uh uh.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:02.720
I want you to pay attention to something here.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.540
You see how the bottom is a little taller than a field,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.240
but the button actually doesn't have a height and has a petting that is only nine pixels.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.990
So why is it so tall?

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.440
That's because off the settings that are given to the parent flax box you see here it says

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.150
stretch.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.470
That means the Flex Children will feel that hide off the flex books until otherwise

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.200
instructed.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.850
If you change that than the hype will change with it.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.410
But you might wonder how come the field has a different height that has to do with a

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.880
default margin that is applied to the field.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.510
That extra 10 picks a margin is stretching the flex box,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.350
so the bottom has now more space to feel.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.990
If we remove that margin from the field,

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.440
then button will shrink and match the size off the failed.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.170
But let's get that margin for now.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.230
Sometimes when we have multiple fields,

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.270
we need that margin.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.750
We can fix this issue by simply giving the button of fixed height.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:05.060
I want you to have a closer look at this behaviour because often you'll come across with

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.610
such irregularities inside my floor.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.120
Generally,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.550
when you're kind of designing and developing of our side,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.610
because a lot of the elements and all that setting sort of interact with each other and

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.990
they change the structure,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.620
change the structure of the website.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.450
So a margin here might be changing some other behavior on a very different element,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.070
right?

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.560
Just like what happened in this example.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.140
Whenever something like this would happen to me in the beginning,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.170
I would always think like,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.370
Oh,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.840
is this the busboys and working like this?

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.680
I always thought there was something with weapon low.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.670
Then I would go around on forums searching for this fog with a button or a form or

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.290
something.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.360
And then at some point,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.150
I've got get to the answer and then answer would be quite simple.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.470
That's why I wanted to learn how to look for the clues.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.250
When you get stock about something and think of it as a puzzle,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.880
you always think that there is a solution.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.460
The answer is somewhere there.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.120
It's not that the tool is broken or it's a bog or something isn't working properly.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.890
But it's there is some sort of puzzle that needs to be solved because I remember is always

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.470
often It's frustrating.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.100
If you're dealing with a toy and you're trying to build something is just not going your

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.400
way,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.780
and it's not working out and you might feel frustration and you could might get discouraged

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.120
and you might not enjoy the process anymore.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:24.870
So I want you to kind of take a breath and look at it in a look at it in a way that

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.900
complete accident.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.950
Look at it in a way that it's a puzzle and there is a clue,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.280
and you just need to get to the answer So trackage element and,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.840
uh,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.720
see what style can be.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.370
Interact with something else and you'll get to the answer,

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.150
and you're gonna feel very good about it.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:57.820
All right,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:03.540
let's have a look at the form in the preview mode if it looks good,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.550
but the button could use a hover effect.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:14.280
A simple holler State will do just a little change off the color,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.870
and that's it.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:37.680
Uh uh.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.060
Another thing we can change is a success and ever messages to do so.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.440
First,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.280
we need to show the states which we can do from the form settings,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.090
select the form block and go to the settings panel here we can switch between normal

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.850
success and aero States.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.950
Once you have success state enable,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.450
then you can interact with it and change them as you like.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.620
We can even drag other elements inside or change the background style,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.550
the taxed or what not.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:25.450
Uh,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:34.260
instead of this success message,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.220
we can also redirect the users to a different thank you page,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.960
which we can do by adding every direct u R L in this field.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.890
But in our case,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.890
we're going to keep the success message saying for the error message,

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.350
change the state to show it and then styled as you like.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.530
I'm pretty fine with this before ever message and its style.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.800
So let's give it as is and that's it for the form for now.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.220
Once republish our side,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.620
we will test the form on the live website and see how we can manage their form.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.470
