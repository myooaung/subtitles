00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
in this video,

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.660
we're going to practice visual hierarchy.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:09.180
We're going to take the content from that lawyer website and apply whatever we have already

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.910
learned about visual hierarchy.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.300
End alignment in practice it and implied toe our example.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.500
It's,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.670
Ah,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.690
follow along video.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.500
So fire up your pig MMA.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.670
Go to the Sigma File that I have linked in the resources.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.050
The files that link should automatically create a copy in your account once you logon.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.820
If next to the file name it's as view on Lee,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.570
that means it didn't duplicate.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.310
You'll need to create a copy of the file before you can add it next to the file name,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.750
Click the arrow and select duplicate to your drafts.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.600
That will create a copy of the file in your fig,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.370
my account and you'll be able to edit the file as you wish.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.270
Now let's give this design another redo.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.610
We just need to apply what we've already learned so far.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.020
You'll see how thinking about hierarchy and alignment is going to take care off most of the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.160
designing for us.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.210
Let's start with our great Remember how to add that we have to select the frame first and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.350
then the layout grid option will appear in the properties panel,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.000
just like the last time columns 12 30 Pixel Ghadir.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.460
But 60 pixel margin this time because we're using a smaller Mac book frame instead of the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.150
desktop.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.040
The number fits perfectly on the address of this greed,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.450
because this is exactly what I was using when designing the now bar.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.010
For that reason,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.410
we can leave the navigation bar in its position.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.040
You'll see that links in the navigation bar don't align with a great columns,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.090
but that's all right.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.350
As I said before,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.570
Grid is a guideline on a forceful rule.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.850
We don't always have to take it literally.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
If we aligned the button and links to columns in this case,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.620
we wouldn't get the best results.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.470
For example,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.110
one column is too small for the button,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.340
and two columns are too big.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.800
Let's think about the visual hierarchy.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.480
Remember,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.800
what's the name for the visually most interesting object?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.650
The focal point.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.410
Using the photo as a focal point is a good idea when you have photos,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.780
especially of people.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.880
Usually it's a great idea to make them the focal point.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.580
So how do we do that last time I used some tricks to draw more attention to it.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.010
But we can go simpler than that.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.040
Making it very large always works.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.680
Want something to be noticed?

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.570
Make it big,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.090
baby.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.580
Simple.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.470
Is that because it's a vertical photo?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.970
As you can see,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.200
it doesn't make a good background photo.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.000
Instead,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.150
we can use it on the half of the screen.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.570
Okay,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.270
so this photo is covering up the navigation bar.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.850
Remember the layers panel scenes.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.960
It's a higher layer.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.950
It covers up everything underneath.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.570
We need to move it below the now bar.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.900
We can do that by either dragging it in the layers panel,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.050
but is there ways to use an option that does this for us?

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.650
Right.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.250
Click on the photo and select Send to back peaceful sent photo ALS the way to the back.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.120
Now the numbers on top.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.100
But because now bar taxes dog,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.020
we can't see anything.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.910
Let's fix this.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.750
I'm going to disable the great layout so I can see matter what's going on.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.310
We can turn that off for the entire document from here,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.540
but you'll see me often.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.420
Use a shortcut.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:45.280
Let's now make the nab our links white good.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.740
Let's do something similar way the button.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.090
It's not very visible.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.490
I could,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.870
of course,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.880
flip the colors.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.450
Make the button white and text dark but better looking.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.050
Option these cases to use either a ghost button or a semi transparent one.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.540
Change the background filter white and decrease the opacity off the collar.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.650
Feel to about 10 to 2020%.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.250
I really like this semi transparent buttons.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.050
They have a very slick look to them.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:25.890
You can see how our design is starting to take a much better shape,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.940
with very simple modifications where you have an undeniable focal point of this composition

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.940
.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.510
Now let's organize our content better and create a visual hierarchy between them.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.250
First,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.550
let's align them to the left and fit them into a grid.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:54.280
Now we have to decide on what is going to be our primary message.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.060
Here.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.480
We have to start thinking a bit deeper about our goals off the website and the visitors.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.060
Being a designer isn't just making things work Pretty often,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.620
it's thinking about the goals off your design and how to achieve those goals most

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.380
effectively.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.560
A hero section off almost every website has to answer three questions for the user.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.430
What is this website about?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.360
What am I going to get out of this website and how do I get it?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.890
The first question is,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.160
what is this website about?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.490
Well,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.730
it's about Vincent Schwartz,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.660
who is a Boston divorce attorney now out of this to information he's name in Boston.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.180
Divorce,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.580
divorce attorney.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.190
Which one is more important?

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.500
This can depend on some other factors.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.240
For example,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.780
if he's a,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.970
well,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.650
no lawyer than his name would be more important to show first.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.340
If he isn't known,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.330
then it's more important to show that this pages about Boston divorce attorney.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.920
Let's say we know from the client that his name is an important information and needs to be

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.810
displayed as I as the primary info.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.600
In that case,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.750
we're going to make the name big and bold,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.150
going to go much bigger this time because the focal point,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.940
the photo is so much more prominent that I can afford a bigger taxed.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.360
In my previous example,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:17.460
I couldn't I couldn't go to big because the photo was smaller for the headline phoned I

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.320
have chosen a play for a display phone and you the black style,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.680
which he's its heaviest for.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.360
There's an entire section off this course dedicated to typography.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.010
It's a big topic in design,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.150
and you'll learn a lot on how to choose fonts in a way to make your designs look great.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.550
In this exercise,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.280
you can choose whatever funds you like,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.590
but pay attention how you choose the weights and sizes off this funds.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.750
The weight of the phone can be selected from here.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.890
How many options you get here Depends on the phone family,

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.640
and how many waits does it come with?

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.400
Okay,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.890
so I have chosen a big and heavy stuff for the name.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.780
I'm going to do the opposite for the Boston divorce attorney tax.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.350
I'm going to keep whatever funding Waas and choose a light style and make it in and smaller

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.350
.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:16.240
The subtitle definitely doesn't compete for the attention.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.100
The name gets all this but lie,

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.810
which is exactly what we want.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.700
The hierarchy between the tour is clear.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.620
Next,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.560
lattes adjust the paragraph tax.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.720
I'm going to do decrease the tax size a little mawr and that's it.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.660
The button now will live as a days.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.060
I will just make it smaller,

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.130
and that's going to be enough to decrease its importance,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.540
that's all.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.730
It's looking pretty neat.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.330
How about the hierarchy?

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.040
Do we have a focal point?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.010
You bet we do.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.320
How about the rest of the elements?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.370
We have our headline that is,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.840
visually,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.800
most noticeable tax and then the rest of the elements with different degrees off visual

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.560
importance.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.040
And that's it.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.310
If you haven't been following along now,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.150
it's your turn.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.200
Feel free to deviate from my version if you prefer it.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.440
The important thing is Teoh Reach two goals,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:14.720
which is a to have a focal point and be to have a different levels or visual importance

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.470
between other elements.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.100
The rest up to you if you want to use different colors,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.690
no problem different phones to friend of arrangement or you can recreate my version.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.660
Pixel to pixel doesn't matter.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.400
The important thing is you start thinking like a designer and start noticing and have

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.120
visual hierarchy in your mind at all times.
