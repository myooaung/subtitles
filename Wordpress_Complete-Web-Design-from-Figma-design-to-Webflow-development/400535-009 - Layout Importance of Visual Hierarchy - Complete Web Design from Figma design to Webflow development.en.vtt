00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
meet links cars dot com one of the most terrifying websites I've ever seen.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.210
What does that make some websites so hilariously terrible?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
And what makes other looks well designed already covered?

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.530
The first big reason that alignment this page hates alignment its anti ally.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.960
The second big reason is a visual hierarchy.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.950
Every object on this godforsaken page demands our attention all at the same time.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.680
We don't know where to look at where to start our journey,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.750
and that can be so overwhelming that we would rather close the page.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.140
Now this page there's a very strong visual hierarchy.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.690
What's the first thing that you looked at?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.720
Probably either that funky,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.550
colorful art on the ride or the headline.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.630
Then comes the rest of the elements,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.460
one by want.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.280
These composition took us by the hand and guided us step by step on what was the most

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.640
important information First and second and so on.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.870
Check out the two buttons.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.430
There's a clear hierarchy,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.360
even between them.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.240
Obviously,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.300
the full button is the Alfa Doc.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.410
This is called a visual high rock,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.860
and it's a fundamental principle off good design.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.790
Visual hierarchy has a lot to do.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.300
The way our attention works.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.990
We simply cannot focus on more than one thing at a time.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.850
This is especially true off our vision.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.520
The only very small fraction of what we see what we look at is a high definition.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.310
The rest is a low resolution peripheral,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.750
er,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.780
peripheral blurriness.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.470
Do this,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.020
make a thumbs up sign,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.520
put your hand in front of you and look directly at your thumbnail.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.190
And that small some nail is the high definition is the only high definition that you see

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.140
the rest off.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.770
It is low rez and quite blurry.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.690
The hierarchy in design begins with a focal point.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.150
Tom Hanks sitting on the bench is the undeniable visual target off this poster.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.850
It's the most interesting Hank.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.700
Think of a focal point as a spotlight on a stage.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.250
You see how this stage is not actually in late.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.110
It's dark and oldest,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.250
but lines are shining on Michael Jackson,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.650
making him the obvious focal point at this stage.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.650
If they had the stage completely lied,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.750
then everything else would be visible.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.660
But that is not their aim.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.000
Our visual interest is obviously on Michael,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.280
and the stage designers have made sure to give audience exactly that we could This design

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.830
this graphic guys the focal point off this composition?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.650
He's the main hero in it.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.760
That's exactly why we're for two than main graphic on the pages.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.640
The hero shot was Do a little self critique off one of my early works this the lending page

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.020
that up built for a real estate agency.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.650
I cringe a little when I see a design mistakes in South my early work.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.020
But what you gonna do?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.360
It's the learning process.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.750
The clear villain off this work is definitely a lack off proper visual hierarchy.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.330
The forms sort of these unsuccessfully trying to be the focal point.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.420
However,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.870
it's not supposed to be on top of that Iraq.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.130
It's not the main message of this page.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.190
So how come is trying to steal so much attention when there's a big background image like

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.850
this?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.150
Usually it's because we wanted to be the hero for the audience to start there,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.490
but that's not happening here.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.160
It's dark,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.980
low quality,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.510
and it's not clear what the hell is happening in the image.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.250
Not to mention how the huge form and the taxes covering so much off it picks and wonder.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.370
What is this image doing?

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.240
Terrible together?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.290
It has no value.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.690
It's just adding more noise to the composition.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.750
Playing background would be a huge improvement to this.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.790
Same with the copy.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.120
There's no clear hierarchy.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.950
It's hard to tell where headline ands and where paragraph begins,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.170
because they're so similar and style when we see good design,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.990
a lot of times it's a visual hierarchy that contributes to its beauty.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.920
What's there were designing a website or a made up lawyer called Vinson Schwartz.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.580
What is the most important thing on this page?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.230
Easy.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.240
The fact that he's a Boston lawyer or is it his own record?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.550
Or is his photo we don't know?

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.860
Because there's no hierarchy.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.690
Everything looks like,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.940
Well,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.620
we can't really follow the narrative.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.270
This is a whole different story.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.840
It's 100% improvement,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.050
and I haven't done much.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.890
I've used a few design tricks to create a clear hierarchy between the objects,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.350
and I'm going to teach you all about this tricks later in this part of the course,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.630
so you can take something that looks like an amateur,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.770
placing elements on the page randomly and turn it into well polished war that you can get

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.890
paid really well for.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.650
Let's break down the high ranking here.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.750
Do we have a focal point?

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.950
Obviously,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.340
it's the photo of Vincent and how's the rest of the high regulated out?

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.600
The second and importance?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.790
I'd say the name tag because how close it is to the focal point.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.160
It's part of it.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.870
So the viewer will glance at the image and the name in one quick oh than the Bold All Caps

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.550
headline.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.460
Fourth is actually the button before the tax because it's ah,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.750
larger object with some white space around it.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.730
And finally,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.730
this up had text.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.890
So what exactly did I do here to create this visual hierarchy?

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.890
How come this?

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.620
And nearly no hierarchy?

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.900
But this has a very distinctive vocal point and a clearly defined visual hierarchy among

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.950
the elements believe this has to do with sizes and weights or elements.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.150
Size and weight is what usually defines the hierarchy.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.880
There are other ways as well,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.810
like collar contrast or images that draw a lot of attention and so on.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.060
But designers primarily rely on size and weight first.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.680
What I did was to increase the size of the photo.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.840
I made it the biggest element.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.430
That's it.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.040
Whatever is the biggest on the screen will attract the most attention.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.950
It's that simple.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.030
The purple rectangle behind the picture is also bringing more attention to the photo.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.840
Without it,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.250
I would have to make the photo much bigger.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.850
Then I have defined the hierarchy between the headline paragraph and the button.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.860
I made the headline Big,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.500
Bold and all caps.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.770
Not only Up made the fun size much bigger than the original,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.250
but also made it extremely ball thes.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.650
Boldness is what I refer to as a weight often element.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.610
It looks heavy in the phone families.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.820
You'll even see the style called Habit.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.890
The paragraph underneath the headline is significantly smaller than the headline.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.680
It's like David and the go Hyah!

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.150
It's a regular phone wait,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.600
small caps and small phone size and the button I have made transparent with only the

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.250
borders.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.550
This is commonly known as the Ghost Button.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.890
You don't usually want to use this as a primary button,

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.680
but for secondary actions and in cases where you want to decrease its significance.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.900
It's a great use.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.310
And last but not least,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.680
I have used a batter alignment for the content before it was all just centered in the

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.100
middle.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.000
I do open your center alignment,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.640
but often it doesn't do a good job and making the design look polish it and organized the

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.540
left alignment with agreed definitely does a better job as a fun exercise.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.130
I want you to pay attention to the designs around you.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.670
Pay attention to the billboards and posters,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.690
flyers that people hand you and obviously the websites.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.740
And look,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.890
if the designer had used a good visual hierarchy or not,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.690
and up next,

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.280
we're going to practice hierarchy,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.050
stick around.
