00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
This is one of my website project.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.700
It's a website for a scooter sharing rap.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.570
When I was designing this website of Picked a very vibrant green color.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.570
The name of the app is go green.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.130
The scooters are electric and eco friendly,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.260
so this particular green fits the concept really well.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.850
It's the right shade of green.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.360
But my clients had a different plan and they had me change into this green.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.020
This is forest green,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.150
not a good match for this product.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.740
Forest Green will work well with outdoor related businesses camping,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.620
hiking,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.200
outdoor clothing,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.580
fishing and so on,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.340
but not something that is electric and modern green technology.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.450
This cholera has made the website look at big nineties,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.780
but,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.040
you know,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.150
sometimes you gotta do what your client says.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.890
Clothes can make or break into design,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.470
were attracted to the colors that we like and quite repelled.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.860
Bio those that we don't beat Web design or other products like cars,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.930
closing ketchup bottles,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.570
whatever.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.500
We might see the best design product.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.280
But if we don't like the color,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.270
we're not buying it In the upcoming lessons.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.140
I'm gonna teach you how to pick and work with colors like a pro to make your designs look

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.740
great.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.390
Stick around
