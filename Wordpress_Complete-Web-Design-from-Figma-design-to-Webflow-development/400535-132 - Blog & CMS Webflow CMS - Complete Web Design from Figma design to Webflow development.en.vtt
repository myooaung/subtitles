00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
Before we start designing and building our master block post page,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.250
we have to first create a database for our block that happens from wet flow CMS,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.850
which we can access right here.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.730
There is a link to a video tutorials by wept flow.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.770
They have this place on the website called Wet Floor University.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.060
There is great content there and they cover every aspect off wet floor are definitely

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.650
recommend to get familiar with it.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.550
So the CMS or the content database off our website is broken down in what's called

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.380
collections.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.030
Imagine a collection as an independent spreadsheet.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.770
Let's say if we had a very large website like you to meet,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.640
we would have won spread should for all the courses.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.690
One stretchered for all the blood Post one spreadsheet for all the help and support pages

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.350
and so on.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.050
Let's create our first collection and see what happens.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.980
You know,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.430
project,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.380
we need a collection for blood posts.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.730
That's where we will keep our block post with their headlines,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.230
images,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.720
tax,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.420
etcetera.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.990
Here we have some options to name the collection some settings and important part creating

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.900
fields that will be part of this collection.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.260
Again.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.600
Think of this as a stretch it.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.960
When you create a new one,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.590
it's empty,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.090
so you have to add new columns.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.440
Right Annual title.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.170
This columns like Headline body attacks your old to the image,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.850
etcetera.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.100
That's basically what this is that each row is part of one group that makes a particular

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.950
block post.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.900
Well,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.860
flow here has collection templates.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.380
He's still help us get started on some common collections that we might create.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.330
Needless to say,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.810
1st 1 is blocked posts,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.060
probably the most common collection for everyone.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.350
One cyclical Midwest flow will create new collection with some needed items to get us

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.920
started.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.250
Let's go through each one and edit them as we need for our block.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.700
First,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.750
we have collection name.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.870
This isn't a big deal what you name its internal and not visible to the public.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.600
What floor name did block post,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.100
which we can keep next.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.660
His collection.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.170
Euro.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
This is how the euro off each block post will be structured just like it's showing.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.130
In the example below is the word that comes right after the domain.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.470
Here,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.340
I prefer using the word blawg.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.750
It's much more specific than the word post.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.440
It's a bit more common to use bloke rather than a post.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.920
And now the important stuff.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.140
This is what each of our block posts are made off.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.900
Each field is a type of content.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.820
There are many different types of content.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.340
For example,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.460
there is plain text.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.910
There is rich text.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.370
More about that later.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.170
There's image.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.070
There's a color.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.850
There's a switch to turn something on or off.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.450
Let's actually look at our block post and see what sort of feels we need.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.690
So first we have a headline,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.890
right that in wet floor is same as the name off the block post.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.160
Well,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.170
it's not exact the same,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.250
but we can turn it into a headline and making the name and had lying the same thing.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.910
Help Tax underneath is for us and for the team members who are going to create new block

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.310
posts.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.800
No need to put in here anything.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.450
The title headline says it all.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.620
Then we have an author,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.750
and a date will worry about the author later for the date.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.070
We actually don't need to add any extra field.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.640
Every new block post that we create is going to come with a creation date.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.310
That's why it's not,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.410
including inside this list of fields moving on to the next.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.710
We have a main image off a block post.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.950
What floor has already included such field?

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.540
We can move it on top after the headline to follow the order.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.910
The order doesn't really matter.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.750
It's just for us.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.370
Next in our block,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.980
we have body of the post Rep Low has included a field for that to thes field has drew extra

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.240
options minimum and maximum characters.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.690
That's if we need to add some sort of limitation to the content of our block.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.550
I'll say no need.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.280
And finally,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.750
again,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.620
we have an author,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.990
which this time has a little more information on it.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.640
We'll worry about the author later.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.050
We're going to create a separate collection for authors.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.360
Post Summer isn't really on our block page,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.950
but we will need it on our blogged home page,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.540
where we show off our block posts in cards on Post Summary.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.830
It's a good idea to limit the number of characters.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.500
Cards have a very strictly out,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.050
so we don't want a summary to be way too long.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.090
In our designs,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.850
we have used a summary that is maximum three lines.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.370
That is about 140 characters long.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.080
Now it's for the thumbnail image.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.010
That's something that goes on the block card.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.900
We can have that as an independent field or we can just reuse the same main image will make

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.180
it easier to create new block,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.190
post last things to upload future and color.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.640
We don't really need them in this case,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.750
so let's get rid of them.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.480
And there you go.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.060
We have four feels that is going to make up each of our block posts.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.010
On the right hand side,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.190
we have Editor Preview that shows all these four fields that we have in our collection.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.110
This form is what we will fill out each time we want to create a new block post.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.490
Okay,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.750
click create collection to finish the step.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.480
And that's all our block post databases now ready.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.230
So to recap,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.160
we have the ability to add a database to our website.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.870
In other words,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.640
a CMS,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.120
a content management system.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.130
Within this database,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.730
we haven't ability to create many different collections.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.650
Collections are sort of scratches that will hold all the content that is part of it for

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.040
example,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.850
block posts.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.840
That's a collection and old block posts going to one spread.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.700
Should each block post is made of certain content,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.440
like headline,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.270
Main image and Body of the Post.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.270
These are called collection fields,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.450
and we have full control over this.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.980
What we add and what we remove in the next video,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.250
we're going to add new block post to our CMS stick around.
