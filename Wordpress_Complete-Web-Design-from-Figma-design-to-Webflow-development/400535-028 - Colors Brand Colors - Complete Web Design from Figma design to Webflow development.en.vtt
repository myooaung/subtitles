00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
I love it when I'm working on a project that doesn't already come with brand colors.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.060
That means I can find the perfect color palette for the project in my hands won't be tied

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.800
with existing brand colors,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.650
and I have been more freedom to explore.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.900
But often we don't get to choose our own colors.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.990
This is good news if the project comes with good brand colors,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.180
but not as monetary.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.250
If the color sound as nice.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.610
How do you know if you have to use brand colors on the website project are not easy.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.420
If the project already has a logo,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.870
that means that you have to use the brand.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.700
Colors were to get the colors from director from the logo.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.830
But the best thing is to do is to ask your clients for the style God or the brand

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.550
guidelines that came with the logo.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.820
You look something like this.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.060
This is a guide that a logo designer usually provides to decline whenever they deliver

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.450
final logo designs.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.410
It will include primary,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.330
secondary and neutral colors.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.850
It might also have some guidelines on topography and other brand elements.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.310
If such document exists that you have to stick with their colorists and typography provided

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.700
here.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.500
The existence of this guy depends on how much the client was willing to pay and how good

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.600
off a designer they hired.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.860
If they went cheap and got a logo on Fiverr,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.960
then they might not have a style guide at all.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.390
Or if the logo was designed 10 years ago by the owner's nephew,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.450
he knew how to click few buttons on photo shop.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.390
Then they definitely don't have one.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.710
Ugly colors are very difficult to work with.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.700
And if the client's saved money on logo design that I can almost almost always bat that the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.610
colors on the logo are going to be terrible.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.490
Bad logo designers have a unique skill of time traveling into the past and borrowing colors

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.430
from the nineties.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.280
In times like this,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.440
I sometimes suggest clients ah,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.190
brand refresh the color of a fresh off their brand.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.500
They can keep the logo in the shape off the logo,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
and once I designed the website and we settle on the new color palette,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.200
then they can go ahead and refresh the existent logo with the new colors.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.420
If that's not possible and the colors are complete,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.940
junk.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.320
Then I'll limit the use off their colors on the website,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.480
and I will use MAWR neutral colors like whites,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.650
greys and,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.250
uh,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.340
blacks because they can be used with any color palette and then use ah bit limited options

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.180
and limited versions off their brand colors.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.470
This a good middle ground between needing to stick with the brand color is about not using

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.550
them so much so they don't make the whole website look terrible.
