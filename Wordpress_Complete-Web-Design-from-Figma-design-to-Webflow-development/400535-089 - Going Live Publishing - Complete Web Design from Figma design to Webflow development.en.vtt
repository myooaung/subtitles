00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
So let's finally publish our page.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.480
This is quite a simple test.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.060
Go to the publish and click publish to select a domains.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.050
Give it a moment and there our pixel perfect webpages live and operational like a charm.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:24.650
All the responsible optimization that we have done can be tested by re sizing and shrinking

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.850
the browser window.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:39.970
The buttons and links aren't operational right now because we haven't linked them to

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.650
anything.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.700
We're not going to do this on this practice project,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.610
but we will do it with this big client project that we're kind of work on.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.980
On the bottom of the page,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.620
you'll see these wet flow batch.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.050
We can remove this when we add a hosting plan to our project on free plans.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.250
This badge is mandatory.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.200
Initially,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.050
your website will be published on what floats sub domain.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.750
In order to publish our website on a custom domain,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.490
we need to add a paid hosting plan and then we're going to able to publish our website on

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.650
our own domain.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.520
My clothes hosting plans are very decent.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.810
Flick Prized Basic plan,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.570
which is for non CMS space websites,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.460
is 12 bucks a month or 15.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.550
You've paid monthly.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.760
CMS Bei's website is the one that has a blogger or other sort of dynamic content that needs

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.640
to be managed through.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.490
CMS,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.150
which is content management system,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.450
will be building a CMS based website in the upcoming project.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.450
I'm not going to demonstrate how to publish this to a custom domain for this project,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.550
but I will show it for the next one.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.800
One last thing that we need to change is thes little I can.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.350
This is called a Fabrica.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.390
Right now it's showing your Web flows to fall thalamic.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.690
Um,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.320
but we can change this from project settings.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.310
There are two icons here.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.920
First is this fabric in that shows on a browser tab and the second is wept.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.380
Clip.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.220
The Web clip is an icon that shows up on iPhone when you save your website on the home

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.630
screen.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.040
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.160
Safari has this future to sort of book market website.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.840
You can add it to a home screen and will be saved next to all of your APS looking just like

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.530
any other app.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.590
I never used this picture,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.750
but since we have an option,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.150
we should change this icon here.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.400
We'll need to create an icon in Fig Ma,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.250
which is just a regular image file,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.820
and we need to create some sort off I can out off our logo.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:35.280
Just add a new frame with a size off 256 by 2 56 Draw full rectangle on it painted blue and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.050
maybe give it around the corners.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.430
Then copy the logo.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.950
Delete everything but the letter C and large.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:06.500
It then group everything exported in PNG,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.050
and that's going to be our Web clip.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.270
Note.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.790
One thing.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.390
Either export the group or hide the background fell on the frame to avoid exporting those

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.350
wide corners.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.030
As for the Fabrica,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.070
and we just need to scale this down to 32 by 32 irregular re sizing isn't going to do the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.440
job.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.670
It's not going to scale both rectangle and the tax proportionally.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.630
Instead,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.260
we need to use the scale tool,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.350
which we confined under the move toe scale tool.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.360
Resize is grouped objects proportionally,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.470
so if there are attacks,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.470
images rectangle,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.020
it's going toe,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.800
lock the proportions off all layers inside and then resize them all together.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:59.400
It's a very handy little to shrink it until it's 32 pixels and export in PNG again and then

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.830
upload each one to their dedicated place.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.610
The dimensions off these icons have to be exactly those 32 by 32 2 56 by 2 56 Rep.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.850
Flow won't let you upload any other size.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.150
Now publish again to see the changes take effect.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.420
And that's our webpages live.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.520
It's looking great,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.190
and it's sharp and works well.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.020
It's fast,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.210
and it's responsive and just amazing.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.500
Notice how fast and effortlessly the page loads that swept close one of the amazing

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.310
benefits because their servers are blazing fast and they're just very well organized and

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.010
optimize for the pages.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.130
Send websites that are built in Web flow,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.250
and we have also done a good job because rebuilt it with a very nice clean code.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.310
And ah,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.530
website is just working well and loads quite fast.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.450
So good job to us up next,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.280
we're going to learn about what floats and other future called the editor.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.950
Stick around
