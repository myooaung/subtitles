00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.895
In this video, I'm going to show you how to install the portfolio website

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.180
in your own workflow account so you can make it your own change things,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.610
added content, demand, customized style,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.740
and publish as your personal website.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.605
I've created a showcase of this project right here.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:23.400
This is a place where Webflow designers can share their projects with others.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.710
Go to this link to access the page,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.615
the links in the resources of this video.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.145
Once you're on that page, you'll see this clone button

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:33.515
that lets you clone the entire project into your own account.

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:37.610
Click on that. There is a warning message saying that we

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.780
can create a new project and our account because we hit the limit under the free plan,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.825
you can only have two on hosted sites in Webflow.

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.555
So since you have already built two projects,

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:49.490
the chat app and tMap websites,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.945
then you'll face this issue.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.235
You have three options.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:53.765
Upgrade to a paid plan,

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:55.460
create a separate account,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.310
or delete one of dye existing projects.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.380
All right, once you solve that limit issue,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.585
then you'll be able to create a new project,

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:05.460
name your project and create.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.330
And that's a now you have your version of this website.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.910
You already know how to do everything you need to do here,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.995
but let me show you things that you should add it.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.290
First, the name, the logo is just the tags.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.780
So just put your name in there as you wish if you're on

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.100
first and last name or just first or just last name, whatever you prefer.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.780
There's also the name in the headline.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.980
Don't forget to change that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.895
There is the name in the footer as well in the copyright tags,

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:40.590
which are first and last name there.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.890
Lastly, that are names into SEO fails to places homepage and the project template.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.445
Then there are emailing into places.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:22.310
There is one in the navbar and wanting the Fodor,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.040
both navbar and footer are symbols as you'd expect.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.570
So it seemed on the project page.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.800
These are emailing so you need to put your e-mail address inside the links.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.970
So when people click on it,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.920
new email is prefilled with your address.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.040
Don't forget to change both tax and the links.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.580
I think that's it for the personal info.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.310
The rest is content which you can update as you wish,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.260
or don't feel free to keep it as is,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.960
but giving it more personal choice would be a better idea.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.185
You can give this website your own personal colors if you like.

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:16.790
Updating is very easy.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.410
All colors are global.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.870
That means you can update the global color and

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.915
all the instances of that color will be updated instantly.

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:28.950
Click on edit and just choose a different color on the map are paste the color code.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.690
Same thing you can do on the highlight color.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.375
Don't forget to click the pencil icon.

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:02.550
Otherwise you won't be editing the global color.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.565
Whatever color you use for the background.

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:19.295
Don't forget to update project thumbnails accordingly.

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:23.570
They are independent images so they don't automatically update with a global color.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.795
I've prepared Figma file for this thumbnail so you can

00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:31.290
easily update and export new ones later on that.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.040
Let me show you how I made this highlight effects so you know how to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.090
reuse it if you decide to highlight attacks is inside a div block,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.785
which has heading element inside and irregular the block as a highlight.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.020
Highlight has absolute positioning.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.330
That's why it's stacked behind the text.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
If you feel like highlighting some other tax element,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.680
just copy this entire highlight box and edit the text inside.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.840
Because of this highlights,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.060
this headline isn't one Fluid Text.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.735
It's bunch of independent inline elements sitting next to each other.

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:13.820
So to move the order you need to drag

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.460
elements around or change the order in the navigator.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.795
Keep in mind, highlight attacks can spend on two lines.

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:33.620
So try highlighting maximum of two consecutive words like

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.400
web designer or have multiple highlight boxes next to each other.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.170
If you really need longer highlight.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.510
The link highlights work a little different.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.510
Actually much simpler than headlines is just a box shadow.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.010
And if you need to apply that style anywhere else,

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.020
just select the class name yellow link.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.310
And the highlighted text will be added with its hover effect.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.290
As you probably noticed,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.830
the page has really cool interactions like those highlights on page load.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.710
And that's grown line moving like a snake up and down.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.525
Let me show you where these things are.

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:21.370
If you go to interactions panel,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.205
you'll see there are three interactions on page load.

00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:25.930
They're quite simple interactions.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.820
First one controls those highlights.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.055
Second one is for the content sliding and 30s for the scroll line in the loop.

00:06:33.055 --> 00:06:36.730
You probably won't need to edit any of these except one highlight.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.130
Because if you add any highlight elements,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.070
you'll need to add it to the interaction to,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.710
for example, this new highlighted box doesn't animate.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.700
The best thing is to just add a tax inside the existing highlight boxes.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.740
But if you really must add new ones,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.270
then here is what you need to do.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.910
So the new text animates as well.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.280
The highlight animation is very simple.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.060
The box just scales from 0% to 100%. That's all.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.750
The initial state is set to 0 vertical scale.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.070
And then it changes to one, which means 100%.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.505
So it just grows from 0 to 100% in its original size.

00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:15.780
And the same thing is done for each highlight independently.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.830
That's why first one runs and then the second one.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.525
So to animate that third one selected on the canvas and under initial states,

00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:25.190
when this plus icon appears,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:31.295
click on it and select scale and put 0 on the x value.

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:32.630
But before you do that,

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.850
disable this lock because this is preserving aspect ratio and we don't want that.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.475
We wanted to shrink and grow horizontally only.

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:42.470
Now we need to add a final state,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.510
which is to grow it back to one.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.685
And we're going to add that at the end.

00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:49.820
Why? Because we wanted to animate one after another.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.990
Now at the same time,

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.330
again, disable the lock and put one under x value.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.730
Play the animation to see how it's working.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.805
Working good, we just need to match the easing to others.

00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:11.910
I'm using out quad and 0.6 seconds.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:31.940
So check the preview and perfect.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.290
As were other interactions,

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.315
probably you won't be needing to change anything.

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:37.550
But if you do all the settings are visible for you

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.115
to see how they are set up and what needs to be changed.

00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:41.480
To find these interactions,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.370
you need to select the correct elements.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.260
So the interaction appears in the panel.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.870
Interactions that are triggered by a page load.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.855
I appear all the time no matter what element you have selected,

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:52.700
but those that have an element trigger,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.250
you have to select the exact trigger element.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.570
To find these interactions.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.430
You can see them in the navigator or

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.220
the trigger elements have this lightning icon next to it.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.470
That means there is an interaction on that element.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.060
For example, button rapper,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.000
that's where that hover interaction for the button is set up.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.260
All right, the last important thing you'll need to know is how to manage projects.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.190
They are CMS items so you can easily manage them inside CMS.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.290
I'll add a new project so you can see what's,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.450
what name description.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.470
Pretty straightforward.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.190
There are two images you'll need to generate for new projects,

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.435
a thumbnail for the homepage and the full screen of the project.

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:37.340
The full screen is simple in Figma,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.920
go to the design of your page and export the entire frame.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.185
Then just upload it to the corresponding field,

00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:50.165
but make sure to compress the image first,

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:52.950
or it's going to be a very large file.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.230
As for the thumbnail, go to this Figma file

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.810
that I have shared with you, Lincoln their resources.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.875
There's a page called acids in that's where you can create your thumbnails.

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:07.175
By the way, you'll see here there is a fabrication and a web clip.

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:11.660
Use this so you can generate your own and update them in the settings of your project.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.580
And drag the image inside.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.080
The same thing for the background.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.470
And position it as you like.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.745
Then export the thumbnail,

00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:01.890
compress it and upload it in CMS.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.990
Then you have a live site URL.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.270
If you leave this empty link will appear.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.625
So you can leave it empty without a problem.

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:24.830
Make sure to enable this toggle.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.440
This is for the project to show up on the homepage.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.075
I've added this so you have an option to disable or enable any project on the homepage.

00:11:32.075 --> 00:11:35.105
If you're wondering how I've done this, It's filters.

00:11:35.105 --> 00:11:38.540
So I created this toggle and on the homepage then I created

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.945
the filter for the collection lists saying that display,

00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:45.665
those that have toggle enabled, pretty easy.

00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:49.620
Then you have these three tags that show up under the title.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.790
And that's it. Once you save, go to the homepage.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.675
You can see the new project is going to appear on top of the others.

00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:05.080
Add in links to the project page which is ready as well.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.525
That's all you need to do to add more projects.

00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:10.825
By the way, this project on the homepage are a collection list.

00:12:10.825 --> 00:12:13.840
Remember those content is linked to the CMS fields.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.215
You won't be able to add it individual items right on the canvas.

00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:19.735
You can only edit them inside CMS.

00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:23.635
Also, the collection list has a sort order applied to it.

00:12:23.635 --> 00:12:28.780
I'll set it to the newest to oldest based on last time the CMS item was updated.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.515
If you want to change the sort order to something else you can do so here,

00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:34.405
like oldest to newest maybe.

00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.420
Well, that's all the important things you need to know about this side.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.520
If you get stuck, let me know and I'll help you out.
