00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
in this video,

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.660
we're going to practice.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.960
Applying overlays to our image is so far up your big mind.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.830
Let's get cracking.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.750
In this figment file,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.300
I have part three frames.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.040
That content is all designed and ready.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.060
Your task is to find photos for each frame and apply image LRA lace so the content is well

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.590
visible.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.740
Let me demonstrate the 1st 1 So we have this hero section for a meditation app or something

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.120
like that.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.490
Not sure,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.040
exactly.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.250
I crept this content from a random websites.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.540
First,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.550
we need to find a photo.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.010
So goto on Splash that calm and let's try searching for meditation photos.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.150
It doesn't need to be the exactly meditation.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.190
You can search for whatever you think is suitable.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.970
So perhaps,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.590
come Lake's waters nature sky basically soothing and calming images When looking for photos

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.590
.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.680
We don't need to go to literally and have the image describe everything in action.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.820
More about techniques of finding photos later.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.570
This photo works just fine for me.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.010
You can use the same or something else up to you.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.440
All right,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.780
download from here and now let's place the image in fig MMA.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.270
You can drag the image directly and fig my if you want,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.050
or you can use a place image option from here.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.420
Select your father and then,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.330
once you get this,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.440
thumbnail on your cursor clicks somewhere on the frame and it will place damage.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.960
The image has been inserted in its original dimensions,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.490
so it's super zoomed in and let's shrink it.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.450
Zoom out so we can see the handles off the image and then just grab the handles to recites

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.930
the photo.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.290
You'll see Fig MMA doesn't distort the photo if you shrink it weirdly,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.300
which is really nice.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.190
You don't get this in most other designs off tourists or many other Softwares usually,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.900
but this means some parts are being cropped.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.570
If you don't want any of the parts to get cropped and hold shift while you shrink damage,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.050
that's going to a loft aspect ratio.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.270
Okay,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.950
now we need to send the image layer back so it's behind the content.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.250
Two options either use a keyboard,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.700
short card off control or command,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.240
plus a square bracket left where bracket sent it back board and the right bracket brings it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.750
forward.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.150
One little thing you might get stopped way that we knew.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.160
Click on the image.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.880
Big muscle ex,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.010
the whole frame instead of the image.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.950
So use control or command click to select a photo directly and second option.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.370
Right click the image,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.280
then select,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.340
sent to back,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.150
and that's going to put it behind in one single move.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.100
Same goes here.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.640
You got out.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.000
Select image first with the control click and then press right click control.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.010
Plus right Clegg needs snacking on work.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.430
Really got lucky with the image.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.060
Looks great,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.190
but as you can see,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.700
their content is very hard to read.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.270
So let's apply our overlay.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.450
So it's like the image layer and under feel options.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.880
Add another field by clicking the plus.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.830
I can make sure you have the image Alere selected and not the frame or it want to.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.990
The job by default,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.700
is going to add this white radiant.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.280
We need to change this.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.350
So click on that new fell and change linear to sell it.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.680
That's changing the fill from Grady into regular soul it Phil.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.010
Move the handle on the color map to make the color black and then start playing with

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.460
they'll pass it to control how much transparency we need is going to depend on the image

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.050
itself.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.820
Ideally,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.300
we want as transparent as we can get until the point when any of the content becomes hard

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.750
to read.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.400
I think somewhere around 30% is war king.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.870
Fine with this photo,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.140
and that's going to do for each frame.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.700
Now I'm going to show you the tinting options so you can use it on one of the frames.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.400
So first step intending.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.710
We need to make the photo black and white.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.730
This is super simple to doing Sigma.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.050
Just click on the image fell and decrease saturation all the way down.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.970
Remember,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.760
from the color lessons saturation is the amount of here in the colors of 0% means the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.770
Hughes completely gone.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.070
So no colors.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.650
That's what's happening here.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.530
The next step is to add a collar tent that's going to be added to that overlay feel we will

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.850
change black color to something else.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.310
You can play with the passage to to,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.550
so you get the best results.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.830
You can also adjust other content on the page if they're not working well.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.760
For example,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.930
that sign up button on top is too pale,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.950
sort increased capacity a little bit.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.670
Also intended overlays like that a common practice is to use brand colors.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.890
That's where tempting really comes in play.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.750
Otherwise,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.750
there is really no point,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.040
and it's better to use the original photo over this vibrant colors.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.580
For example,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.810
whatever the brand colors are,

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.910
we would use them as attend and as a buttoned collar.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:34.440
Maybe if you need to move their content around on the page on those frames.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.840
You can do that because sometimes you have something on the background image that is sort

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.550
off interacting with the content,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.880
right?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.600
So if you need to,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.400
let's say,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.100
Take that content and in a make a center alignment,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.960
you can do that.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.160
You know,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.680
if you need to,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.890
like,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.350
shrink,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.250
add line or making bigger or smaller you can do that.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.060
It's up to you.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.650
Definitely.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.870
Now finish the job with the other two frames and submit your results off all the three

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.310
frames in the assignment.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.800
After this
