00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
counting out an object from its background is best down in photo show or affinity photo.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.890
Are any other similar software,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.900
which is for photo manipulation?

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.370
Let's begin.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.150
The most important part of successfully cutting out a subject is actually picking the right

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.790
photo to things that we need to pay attention to.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.550
Are the background and the position off the subject?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.350
Ideally,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.850
we want a background that it's plain and contrast really well with the subject.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.480
Cutting out subjects from difficult backgrounds can be tedious work,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.770
and the last thing you want is to spend half a Knauer to cut out a model plight into your

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.830
desires and realize that the model is not a good fit.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.730
Good design is usually a result off a lot of directions.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.610
Imagine Iterating between three cut out of subjects,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.420
sending the final version to your client for their review and then climb comes back,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.670
saying that the model isn't really their target audience,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.670
and they want someone a little older and dress a little fancier.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.390
That's going to drive you crazy.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.540
If cutting out subject is not a quick and straightforward job.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.350
The second important,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.790
in fact,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.110
is the position off the subject in the photo,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.750
cutting out a model who is sitting mood and make a lot of sense.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.740
We would have to recreate the same position you are designed,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.710
so we would have to,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.010
you know,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.260
make the model sit down on something which is very similar size and shape in our designs as

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.770
well,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.000
and that's too much.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.120
Need less work.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.390
Standing front facing positions are the best for cutouts and all camera angles like these

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.590
are just asking for a lot of trouble during the design process.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.670
Because camera is facing her from sideways from the top thin.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
The space in which you will put her has to reflect that,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.080
too.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.810
It's doable,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.350
but you will bump into obstacles and limitations for your designs.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.130
These photo,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.910
even though in a plain background it's still a bad choice,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.550
ignoring the part when she is,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.750
you know,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.340
facing away from the camera because she's wearing a white top and in front off a white

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.580
background photo shop will have hard time detecting the edges between the background and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.370
the sweater on Splash usually is not the great place to find such photos.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.100
Most of the photos here are taken in real life scenarios outside of the studio,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.440
which is not a bad thing.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.280
It offers a good selection of stock photos that don't look like stock.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.210
But for isolated images,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.360
the best place are paid stock sides,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.200
For example,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.380
big stock dot com.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.490
If you add a keyword,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.370
isolated tow whatever you are looking for,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.550
it will give you mainly studio shots on plain backgrounds.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.140
These photos will work the best for cutting out the photo show process will be super simple

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.140
,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.950
and the camera angle and position of the subject will be excellent for your work.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:47.740
This is another paid stock side photos dot icon ST dot com.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.800
They offer a selection off photos,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.280
mainly on plain backgrounds.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.720
It's free for personal use,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.650
so I'm going to pick a photo from here.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.800
This is an excellent photo work with for full subject cutouts.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.200
The background is playing in single color,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.390
and there is a clear separation between the subject and the background.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.710
It's an easy work.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.860
You can pick this exact photo to follow along or choose something else.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.550
I'll link the image and the resources.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.610
I'm not going to demonstrate background removal on difficult photos.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.120
I don't even want you to learn how to work with difficult backgrounds.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.290
This way we will make sure you get into the habit of looking for the right photos.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.490
When it comes to isolating the subject for difficult photos,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.390
I do something else.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.140
I only cut out a small part of the image.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.550
I will demonstrate this later.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.530
Okay,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.950
so let's open our image.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:47.040
Unlock the layer by clicking this lock icon from the tool box on the left shoes.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.020
Quick selection toe hovering over a tool will tell you what a days this is.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.850
The tour will used to select the model and isolate her from the background.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.380
Now select the brush options through the size that is not too big or not too small,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.950
so we can easily select tomato and set the hardness to 100%.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.060
Now start selecting the model from the center and slowly cover her entire shape.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.710
Make sure that those animated lines are surrounding her edges and nothing else to select

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.500
more precisely,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.530
zooming very closely by pinching your touch fat or hold on out or option key while using

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.520
your mouse wheel.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.780
To get a better control over your selection,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.030
increase or decrease your brush size.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.500
There's a shortcut to this so you don't have to go to the brush settings panel all the time

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.500
.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.810
Just click square brackets.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.770
Key left.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.050
One decreases the brush size and the right one increases it.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.330
If you feel like something extra,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.170
hold out or option key and you'll see your selection tool now has a minus on it.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.320
When you release out,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.830
it goes back to plus so plus adds to the selection and minus subtracts.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.250
Hold out and start removing areas that you over select it if you make a mistake and you

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.170
want to go back under auction and photo shop actually works a little weird.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.900
I remember it was very annoying for me in the beginning.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.660
It still is because it doesn't work like you would expect it.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.750
So the regular control Z or commands a young Mac goes back and forth on your last action.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.950
So if you want to under the last action that it works as you would expect.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.170
But if you press on it again,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.230
it will redo the last action.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.790
So pressing on it a lot of time just goes back and forth,

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.450
drove me not first time I was messing around in photo shop.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.260
The actual on Do see here in the Edit options is called Step Back Board and has a shortcut

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.850
with an out option in it.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.490
This is your usual under and behaves as you would expect it to behave in windows,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.160
which probably should be control.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.000
I'll see,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.010
but just in case,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.650
double checks and just go into the edit and then go to step backward and see what's the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.830
shortcut next to it.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.550
Check your address and make sure you didn't miss any spots.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.510
Don't worry too much about the loose hair.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.850
Just select the main line and then we will fix the hair later,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.390
after you're done selecting click,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.430
Select and mask right here.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.800
This is actually available on the newer Photoshopped releases.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.310
If your version doesn't have this,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.060
then look for refine ach!

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.690
It works almost the same way,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.470
but this new select and mask future is more superior in here.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.350
We are going to clean up our selection so we can get the perfect result.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.400
Here's another important Photoshopped tip.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.950
Make sure you have a correct layer selected.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.700
This is the layers panel,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.840
just like fig MMA.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.440
If you have more than one layer.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.050
Make sure to cite the one with the photo on it.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.410
Okay,

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.240
so in here,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.860
by default,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.660
that transparency is decreased.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.800
It's a transparency off our background and everything we haven't selected sliding.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.090
This doesn't affect how our cut out will look like it's a guide for us.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.500
0% shows the original image and full and 100% heights.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.000
Everything we have not selected.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.050
It's helpful to receive with Mr any details.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.980
Let's increase it to 100%.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.700
As you can see,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.550
there are some imperfections on her hair.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.150
The pink background is passing through her hair.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:20.360
Let's put her on a white background from here to better see that eat house change their

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.920
passage to 100%.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.810
Here is well,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.550
this time it says rapacity instead of transparency because the white background is on top

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.840
of the original background,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.960
So 100% opacity means it's 100% visible.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.300
Don't worry about this too much.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.850
The hair needs some fixing.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.430
Also,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.950
if we zoom in closely on her skin,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.350
the edges are jagged and unnatural.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.960
There's not a good standard to use in any design.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.110
Good design looks perfect when it comes to small details like this know all discolorations

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.110
,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.830
and the cat out should look smooth and natural,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.580
like that's exactly the background she was taken on.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.660
The ugliness off most cutouts comes out from the edges when an just aren't well refined.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.650
It's noticeable,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.680
it looks like as if someone actually took a really paper magazine and then with scissors

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.120
cut out.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.660
The model from their luckily photo shop is absolutely incredible.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.120
And fixing this to fix the edges off are cut out.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.290
We need to select a refine and brush tool from here.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.330
It's the 2nd 1 Keep your mouth over it for a second,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.120
and it will tell you which one it ISS because these three looks quite similar,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.720
just like we did with the other brush size,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.840
the brush from the options panel or by using square brackets and slowly start brushing over

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.150
the edges off her hair.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.540
And look at this.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.430
What is actually happening here is that we are telling Photoshopped to look beyond the

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:44.880
edges off our original selection and see if there are any parts that look like they belong

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.280
to our selection and at the same time to remove pixels that look like they are part of the

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:50.950
background.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.350
That's why that Ping has disappeared.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.880
Using the opacity slider,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.770
check other parts that have been missed in case you remove a little extra,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.940
just like other tool price on out or option.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.850
You'll see it's a minus sign.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.650
This will restore the original edge and then brushed over again while you keep holding on

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.650
the out key.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.180
Don't worry,

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.780
it's not going to subtract from the original selection.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.950
It's basically undoing what we just added.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.890
Her hair looks decent,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.490
but there's still some pink collar falling on her edges Will remove this later.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.370
Let's check the rest of her edges now.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:29.830
We can,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.230
of course,

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.570
go around on her entire body with this refine ach tool.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.600
But there is a quicker way to do that on skin and parts that are quite simple and uniform.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.870
Unlike hair that's done through here.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:41.950
Edge detection.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.850
It's the same concept as the refinanced toe.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.500
With this,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.330
we can tell Photoshopped to look beyond our selection and see if we have missed any parts.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.050
It's in pixel,

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.970
so one pixel means look one pixel after the selection and add any missing parts.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:04.230
Pay attention to how the edges movements out as we increase two pixels.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.660
Same dissent in this case,

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.890
Smart radios means instead of using a uniform to pixel radios everywhere,

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.520
it will use custom value depending on the edge.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.890
It's useful if you're using large values,

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.370
but I like to fix odd.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.650
Adjust manually with refine edge tool.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:25.610
Sometimes you'll notice that you have some extra patches like this when you were making the

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.430
selection,

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.620
or you have actually missed some spots going back and fixing the selection after putting so

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.650
much work is going to be heartbreaking.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.670
Luckily,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.060
we can add or remove the spots right here with a brush toe.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.070
As usual plus sign will add in any pixel C click on you will feel this works a little

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.820
different than the previous tools that we used other two tools.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.090
They do calculations in places where you press this one doesn't you don't base to whatever

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.750
you press,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:11:04.610
and one final step we need to make is to remove that pink glare from her hair that can be

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.340
done automatically from here.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.740
Select decontaminate collars.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.740
Give it a moment and Walla.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.240
Now most of the ping from her hair is gone.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.570
What amazing job it did do.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.840
This step is very last because if you have the selected after every click you make,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.650
this will recalculate again and again will make things much lower.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.600
Although something funny happened here,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.250
let's see if we can fix it with refine edge tool.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:37.070
Okay,

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:37.550
God,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.690
actually still chose a little tricky photo.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.520
Ideally,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.560
choose a photo that has a white or gray plain backgrounds.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.450
Cold backgrounds do end up mixing with the edges.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.630
All right,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.800
now,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.310
let's output are cut out.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.760
We have a few options here,

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.550
the bastards to choose new layer with a layer mask.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.360
But this does.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.160
Instead of cutting the whole thing out,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.570
it will copy the original photo and apply a mask to it.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.430
This mass will hide the background and everything we did.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.150
This is the best option because if we notice something else and want to make any changes,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.550
we will be able to.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.610
With the new layer option we want,

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.620
the background will be gone forever.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.080
Inside the layers you'll see.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.370
Also,

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.910
the original photo is still there in its below,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.770
but disabled,

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.910
so it's not visible.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.010
It bothers our copy with the mask.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:32.050
Apply to it that black and white Sylar It is the mask or gets The final step is to save our

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.540
file.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.070
First,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.950
let's save This is a photo shop file for any future addicts.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:45.390
The rest of the design will be doing in fig MMA.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.680
The Photoshopped file can't be important in Sigma,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.710
so we have to use PNG file.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.170
PNG is the one that will keep the transparency of our cat out.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.970
J pack isn't going to work because it will fill the background with white collar.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.570
When we export this into PNG,

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.090
any layer that is he don't will not be included in export.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.920
So you don't have to delete this layers.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.550
Just hide it.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.600
Also,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.390
I would like to crop the extra space,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.650
select the crop to and dragged the address,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:24.820
go to file export and quick exporters.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.550
PNG.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:33.950
Now we can place this image in fig ma and pick any background we want.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:56.850
And that's how you do cutouts in photo shop
