00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
In this video, we're going to add navigation bar to our page.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:07.545
Webflow has a default navigation bar element called nav bar.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:11.385
This is one of the pre-made Webflow elements I do like to use,

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:15.480
which we can add from the elements panel under the component section.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.710
Drag it to the top to bring it on top of the hero section.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.875
Number already comes with elements inside.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.590
Let's have a look exactly what's this navbar made of.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.690
So inside the parent navbar element,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.055
we have a container.

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:36.030
This container is similar to what we did with our hero content,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.700
centered in the middle with a maximum width.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.155
So elements are nicely wrapped inside it.

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:44.480
Then inside that, we have three other elements,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.085
which again are boxes.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:48.755
First one, the brand sits on the left.

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.675
That's where we put the logo.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:54.950
Nav menu is where this three navigation links are sitting.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.980
Like most other things that just a regular d-block,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.860
but with some default styles already applied to it,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.545
we're able to change the styles if we want to.

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:06.710
And third, we have Menu button, but it's invisible.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.020
You can see here that there is a display,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.505
none applied to this item.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:14.120
So it hides menu button is invisible only on the desktop,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.805
on other devices is visible and you can see why.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.795
It's a hamburger icon that drops down the hidden navigation links,

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:25.040
which you are probably familiar with because that's what most of the websites have.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.950
Fitting navigation links on mobile devices is difficult.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.360
We use this hidden navigation menu and the hamburger icon that contains those links.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.630
Navbar acts just like any other HTML element in Webflow,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.590
but also has some extra options inside settings.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.750
Option to open and close.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.000
The menu. Menu is basically what's hidden in mobile devices in desktop version,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.285
this doesn't do anything because menu is visible at all times.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:56.210
There are three types of menus in here, drop-down,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.900
which is the default right side and left side menu.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.360
I mainly use the default dropdown options.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.850
Underneath there are options for easy.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.445
This is relating to the animation.

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:10.730
Easing is an animation that starts low and then accelerates.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.415
This is how most animations on the web are set.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:18.035
But more about this later in entire section dedicated to interactions and animations.

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:20.165
I'll leave all the settings on default.

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.180
Only thing that I use here is the open and closed menu,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.190
so I can visually style the menu.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.750
Another useful setting here can be the display options for the menu.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.050
With this slider, we can set on which devices should there be

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.415
a drop-down menu and on which devices to leave regular navigation links,

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:39.845
just like the desktop version.

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:42.440
For example, if you move the slider to the right,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.720
this will disable it from the tablets.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.440
Meaning on tablets will see the regular links and on anything smaller,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.880
we will see the hamburger menu.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.230
Now let's style the nav bar to match our design.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.020
First, the background. That's quite simple,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.630
just set it to blue from the background property.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.060
One thing you'll notice is the content inside

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.955
the nav bar stretches only until certain point.

00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:16.105
That's because the content is sitting inside the container.

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:18.325
And this is not the container we made.

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:20.290
It's a default container from Webflow,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.090
which is not as wide as ours.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.590
We don't want that container.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.485
Instead we want to use the container that we already made,

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:29.290
like the one where our hero content is sitting inside.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.795
So how can we use our container instead?

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:37.225
Just like the way we reuse any other element by applying the same class.

00:03:37.225 --> 00:03:41.785
And you'll see how the container instantly changes the width.

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:44.560
This is the class that we created and we gave it

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.335
to this container that we styled it before.

00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:50.235
And if we apply this to this navbar container,

00:03:50.235 --> 00:03:54.995
all those styles and properties will be carried to this navbar container.

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:56.765
Just like what we did with buttons.

00:03:56.765 --> 00:04:00.200
If we decide to change the width of our default container in one place,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.650
it will instantly updated every other place, just like magic.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.885
Next we need to insert our logo,

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:10.805
just like we did with the hero image.

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:14.015
We're going to export the logo and drop it as an image element.

00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:17.840
Unlike with our hero image this time we're going to select SVG.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.945
Why? Because we created our logo ourselves in Figma.

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:22.775
It's the regular tax right now,

00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:24.410
if we exported in SVG,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.110
we will maintain its vector-based qualities.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.810
It will be routine, optimize right away.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.569
It will stretch infinitely without losing quality.

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.925
And file size is going to be very small.

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:39.080
In most cases, SVGs will be smaller than PNGs and JPEGs.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.555
All right, once you have the image exported,

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:46.250
add a new image element and upload the logo like we did last time.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.410
I have brand elements selected.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.985
So when I click the image,

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:53.910
it will automatically drop inside that brand box.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.985
But the logo is glued to the top.

00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:06.470
How do we fix this?

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.990
There are many ways to make it align in the center.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.500
Probably the simplest is to add a top margin to the image itself.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.885
Let's now style the navigation links.

00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:23.390
We're going to do that just like anything else.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.100
But first, what we're going to do is delete all other nav links and just keep one.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.900
We'll apply some style to it.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.880
So Webflow automatically creates a class.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.060
Now we can duplicate this nibbling as many times as we want.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.070
And when we make a change to one of them,

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.515
all of them will be updated instantly.

00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:51.120
Long-lived CSS. So we're going to apply the appropriate textiles pretty straightforward.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.400
And apply spacing to match our designs.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.830
We can measure spacing in Figma imply

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.250
the exact spaces in here to the space on top in big mines,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.040
42 pixels and on the side it's 30.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.080
In Webflow will use padding for this,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.250
and we could use bargains,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.790
but by default it already has padding is quite nice this way.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.600
On the side rule use 15 pixels for each side.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.270
This way, padding of two neighboring links will add up to a total of 30 pixel.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.300
By using patterning, the entire link will grow.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.270
So users will be able to click not just with the text,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.500
but with the entire box.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.515
You'll see that link is clickable even on the empty space,

00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:56.120
because it's not an empty space.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.160
The entire thing is the link itself.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.825
Finally, let's add that button.

00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:05.060
Although instead of using a button element,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.495
I'm just going to create a button from one of these nav links.

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:14.120
Duplicate the class so we can make new changes without affecting other navigation links.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.125
Now let's see what properties our button hasn't Figma.

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:22.740
The textile is the same as the navigation links.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.615
The background is white,

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:27.460
but with 20 percent opacity.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.265
And the padding around the tax is 12 pixel on top and bottom and 24 on the sides.

00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:36.320
Let's recreate all that in Webflow.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.025
Inside workflows color picker,

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:44.050
you can apply 20 percent opacity from this box named a for alpha value.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.290
Not sure wildfire and why not 0 for a past City?

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.560
It's something to do with RGBA color system, but who cares?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.930
We have different padding then our nav links.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.855
And we have rounded corners which we can set in borders section.

00:08:17.855 --> 00:08:19.580
There's no exact value here.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.230
Increase it until it stops rounding,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.775
no problem if you go over it,

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:24.290
I'll write inside Figma,

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.630
we can see that it has 30 pixel margin on the top.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.340
And for the left margin,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.430
we're going to use 15 because it will add up with

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.345
an existing 15 margin from that nav link next to it.

00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.820
Because of new spacing logo is out of line,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.830
as you can see, where you're going to have to

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.635
align the logo in the middle with the Nav Menu.

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:51.810
We're going to have to align it by I.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:03.060
Finally, let's check the fluidity and the responsiveness of our navbar.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.500
As you can see, they're being squeezed to

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.605
the edges beds because we don't have any extra spacing.

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:13.505
The hero section is fine because it has padding applied on the sides.

00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:17.285
So when browser window shrinks and container shrinks with it,

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:21.080
the padding, we'll stop it from being squeezed all the way to the edges.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.320
We can apply the similar padding to our navbar as well.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.460
And there now it's looking good.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.620
We need to adjust the padding here.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.285
38 was fine when the content was unstyled and small.

00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:46.265
But now it's a bit too much.

00:09:46.265 --> 00:09:50.060
We should shrink it to 15 or 20 VH.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.430
And the judge aversion independently because

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.770
depending on the hero image and content that you use,

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.570
it might need even less.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.155
It's almost done. There is one small but important thing missing.

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:04.895
Hover effects. None of the links or buttons react when I move my mouse over them.

00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:08.325
We're going to learn how to add hover effects in the next lesson,

00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:09.920
right, so to recap,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.455
we learn how to add a navigation bar,

00:10:12.455 --> 00:10:14.480
the anatomy of a nav bar,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.010
and what is it made of?

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.654
The settings of a navbar and how it works on smaller devices.

00:10:19.654 --> 00:10:22.115
We'll learn how to add a logo inside the navbar

00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:25.920
and how to stylings inside the navigation menu.
