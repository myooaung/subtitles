00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
all right.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:03.940
In this video,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.160
we're going to start optimizing the mobile version of our home page,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.320
starting with the navigation bar.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.400
In the previous project,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.690
we made the now bar full of visible in the tablet.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.630
Let's see if we can do the same here.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.480
To show the knave wings on the tablet,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.150
Select Now bar and go to the Settings panel.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.850
Here you'll find options for Menu Aiken.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.700
When the slider dot is on the tablet,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.720
it means the hamburger menu will show on the tablet and old smaller devices.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.080
If we move it down,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.850
then tablet will be disabled.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.060
That's excellent.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.610
No need to change anything.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.970
All fits very well.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.350
Love it when things just work out easily like that,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:47.550
let's see what needs to be done for the now bar on mobile landscape.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.740
It just caller send some spacing in the previous project that dropped on was stretching

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.570
edge to act.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.900
But here it's not.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.780
That's because we have a little different arrangement for the now bar.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.180
It's sitting inside the hero section,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.930
which has Paddick and the drop down on Lee stretches.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.550
As far as the nab our itself,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.130
we could potentially make it stretch if we wanted Teoh,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.150
perhaps by using negative margins.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.850
But personally,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.920
I'm quite fine with it,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.250
not stretching edge to edge.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.400
So let's leave it as it is to change the color of the menu button.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.960
We just need to change the tax color off the block.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.780
It's phone based,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.140
I can,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.750
so the phone color will change it.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.730
The same goes for the size.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.220
We just need to increase the phone size and it will grow.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.450
I think we use 30 pixels previously,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.940
and let's adjust the padding for the whole clickable button.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.530
It's a little too big,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.210
ideally,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.700
would make it same size of the butters and links on the now bar,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.780
which are for the four pixels and hide.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.380
I believe so.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.780
If the tax is like 30 pixel than seven,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.850
pixel padding should make it 44.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:55.240
Now let's dial the open state of the menu in order to show the menu while we're stalling,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.910
select any element on the now bar and then in the setting stop click open menu.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.400
Now,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.550
menu attempts are clickable and we can select them and style them.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.980
The background color is coming from this knave menu block,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.280
so let's select it and change the background to out.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:34.190
Say that our dark blue color that we use on the floater and saying for the background on

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.150
the menu button.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.380
When you make changes to the open state off the menu button,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.760
make sure the selector filled shows this green open class.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.570
That's how we style the open states.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.180
Sometimes the menu might be open,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.940
but these open state classes and they're so any changes won't be reflected as you want it.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.150
Just refresh the canvas and open the menu again.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.850
Let's give it some proper padding.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:12.840
Can you notice why the button is stretching to the edges?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.250
It's because the display set to block and block elements take up full available with we do

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.780
to change it,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.240
to display in line block,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.740
just like default buttons.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.920
Now that's about right,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.890
but we need to align it on the left.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.250
We'll have this similar challenge in the previous project.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.390
In line blocks acts sort of like tax,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.920
so if the parent container has left center or right alignment,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.650
it's going to obey that alignment.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.350
In this case,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.550
parent is mouth menu,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.670
but it says that it's left a line in reality it's not.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.830
This happens sometimes,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.400
so just go back and forth and just apply left alignment manually.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.950
So the changes reflected.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.250
And also let's add some left and top margins to align the button properly.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:14.550
All right,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.140
that's better.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.800
Finally,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.040
out.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.050
Make corners off the backgrounds rounded.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.790
It will give a bit nicer look,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.170
we don't need it on all four sides for the menu button we needed on top corners.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.430
Quick,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.870
this options to added individual corners for the knave menu.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.920
We wanted all corners besides the top right corner,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.910
that wave button,

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.920
and many will connect nicely like a single object.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.350
Uh,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.390
that's perfect.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.750
Now let's just see how it looks in the preview mode.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.070
Uh,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:59.220
one last thing.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.610
You see,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.750
the logo here has a little bit of patting.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.120
The's patting isn't there on tablet and desktop versions,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.640
but floors in certain get on mobile versions.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.940
We don't need that petting because we have our own,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.690
so just get rid of it All right.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.350
Moving on to the portrait version,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:22.500
there's actually nothing that needs to be adjusted for the NAB are the patterns need to be

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.890
fixed,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.580
but that's part of the hero section.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.350
So we're gonna do that in the next video
