00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
in this video,

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.250
we're going to add our hero image to our page,

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.610
will learn how to export images from Sigma,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:12.710
how to import them inside wet floor and how to work with images and went for first.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.630
Let's export our hero shot from Sigma in figment.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.610
We made this here a graphic with several different elements.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.160
We could export them as independent images,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.650
but that would be unnecessary work and quite tedious to recreate in Wet Foe.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.720
Instead,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.770
we're going to export it as a single image.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.620
This where will save time and make sure it looks exactly as we designed it.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.190
To export anything from figments,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.520
select the element and in the Properties panel,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.110
Click Plus Icon under Export section and to export several different elements as one image

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.110
,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.550
you have to group them first,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.340
select everything right click and price group selection,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.400
or use the shortcut.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.660
Then select that newly created group and heat that,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.970
plus I can under export settings.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.450
Let's go through this different export settings.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.100
Screen resolutions have improved significantly over the years.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.730
Tablets,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.800
smartphones,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.320
laters premium laptops.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.340
Like MacBook,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.690
they use high DP I screens,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.300
also known as routine a display high.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.600
Dp I means high dots per inch,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.110
and they usually have double the pixel density than common laptop and desktop screens.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.580
This makes things look much sharper and crispier,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.250
so you don't have those pixelated edges on smaller text or on the edges off the image to

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.750
make our images optimized for such screens,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.950
this is commonly called routine optimization.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.030
We need to double are actual image size.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.840
So from these drop down option,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.710
we would select two X next Pacific's.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.410
This is just adding a suffix at the end of the final aim.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.350
No need and we have several file four months ideal image format for the Web.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.820
He's SVG because they are vector based,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
have smallest file sizes and can be enlarged infinitely without losing quality.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.130
But unfortunately,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.850
they don't work on images that have photography inside.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.530
Basically,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.050
anything that is pixel based.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.890
I won't go into explanation of what's the difference between pixel bays and vector based

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.530
images.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.480
In short,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.240
PNG and JPG file four months are pixel based on S veggies are vector based.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.070
Since we are using photography,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.550
we have to export either PNG or J P G.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.340
PNG and JPG,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.490
or J Pack,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.430
have two main differences between them.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.460
First is the size J pack.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.510
Images are usually smaller than PNG images or because of the higher compression.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.350
But J pack images can have transparent backgrounds.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.350
PNG's can.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.810
So,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.460
in our case,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.080
either we have to export I,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.150
P and G or A J pack and include the blue background in it.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.050
If we don't include that blue background,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.330
it will automatically fill the space with white.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.820
And that's not gonna work for our image.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.360
Ideally,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.820
we would go with Jay Pack because the final sizes smaller and that really matters.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.490
Why?

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.600
Because no one likes a slow website and images with large file sizes is one way to slow

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.250
down a website's loading time.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.940
But if we go with Jay Pack,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.890
then we have to include a blue background and that can have some issues.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.810
Sometimes colors on exported images don't match with Web colors 100% and we need that blue

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.830
background to match 100% with the blue on the section in Web flow.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.710
If they don't,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.950
we're not going to have a smooth transition and the address off the image will be visible.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.650
I've tested this already on this image and sadly,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.550
didn't match.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.890
White and black colors are easy.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.040
They always match,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.810
but other colors not as much.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.160
So we're left with only one option,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.250
which is PNG.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.650
Let's export.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:52.830
If we check the fire size will see that it's way too large,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.080
more than one megabyte.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.830
We should always aim for images to be less than 300 kilobytes.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.390
If we can't especially those that are right on the hero section,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.850
users might end up staring at the empty spring until the image finishes loading.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.370
Luckily,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.210
we can make the file size smaller,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.150
using image compression tools.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.420
There are a whole bunch of desktop and online compression tools,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.850
the one that I like to use his image compressor that calm.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.390
Upload your file here,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.250
and it will compress instantly.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:33.730
You can see how much of the file size has been reduced.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.680
It's still about 300 kilobytes,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.750
but not too much.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.950
There's one additional thing we can do to make it even smaller.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.820
Instead of exporting to acts,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.830
we could export 1.5 x.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.030
The image dimensions are what contributes the most to the large file size.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.850
So sometimes I compromise on pixel density in favour off a batter follow size.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.840
It's much better to have a little blurry image on a minority of devices than a crispy image

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.510
that lords very slow on every single device.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.350
This time we can keep it to X.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.410
All right,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.560
let's import rpm jean toe wet flow.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.290
As with anything in wet floor,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.420
we add new elements from the Elements panel.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.420
Drop the image anywhere For now.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.450
We're going to structure the layout later.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.240
In orderto upload an image double,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.640
click the image or click the settings gear.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.260
Here it will open up their assets.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.480
Panel assets panel is where Wetklo saves all the images and documents that you upload to

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.250
your website.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.690
Remember how we exported this images to exercise,

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.340
weaken,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.450
Tell Web so that this image is double the size and made for high DP I.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.290
This will shrink it down half the size,

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.550
just like we have it on our designs.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.650
Web flow does give us a warning for a large file size.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.990
Sorry where flow will listen next time.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.680
This time would like crispy Look,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.640
That's it for now.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.440
We're going to arrange the image later.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.110
We'll need to learn important CSS properties for that So let's recap to add images to

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.440
weapon.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.530
Oh,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.340
we have to first export them from Sigma using export settings.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.250
Images that are made from several different objects need to be grouped first.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.200
To keep our website fast,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.850
we need to be mindful or for image file sizes.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.880
We can shrink images using online compression to us.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.320
Adding images and wet floor happens by first heading the image element to the canvas and

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.750
then uploading an image through the assets panel.
