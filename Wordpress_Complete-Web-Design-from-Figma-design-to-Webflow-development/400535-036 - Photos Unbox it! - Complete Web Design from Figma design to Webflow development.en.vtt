00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
photos always come in a box.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.660
That's the original format when you exported from your camera,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.330
or even if you downloaded from our website.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.020
When you take a boxed image in,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.170
place it right on the canvas,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.030
it's often not very impressive.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.200
It's a separate object,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.560
not merging with the space,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.850
and it creates extra boxes around it.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.310
You don't notice this consciously about our eyes do,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.540
and they need to process those extra boxes that have been created between the image and the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.810
address off the canvas.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.060
Let's use a real example from one of my landing page projects that have done for a dental

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.550
clinic.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.810
I've used this exact image for that project,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.550
and this is sort of where I started.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.050
So how can we improve a section with an image like this?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.140
We need to think outside of the box,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.470
literally unbox the image by completely removing the background,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.150
put her on the bottom right edge,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.790
and now,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.650
instead of it being a boring photo slapped on the page,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.650
that model is sort of coming out of the page.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.680
The white background isn't really working with this image.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.500
Can you guess why?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.980
Because the model is wearing a white top.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.660
It makes a terrible contrast,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.560
and if not for her red hair,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.790
she would be fading away.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.980
Since the image doesn't have a background anymore,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.230
we have more freedom to put our own background color on the entire canvas.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.140
This gives us more freedom to experiment and choose interesting color combinations and make

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.550
the design of more exciting.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.540
This color complements her red hair,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.660
the contrast well,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.050
and make a very good combo.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.430
Also,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
this bluish color is a right pick for the dentistry theme.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.660
Blue colors,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.770
Fillmore Clean and sanitary.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.110
Good feeling to create for dentistry and many other colors would be a red flag for a dental

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.640
clinic like red and pink.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.660
That would remind us off blood,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
not a good feel.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.050
Often I like to add a shadow behind the motto.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.550
This makes her look like she's standing in front of a wall.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.800
He'd adds more dimension to the space.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.630
There are now two separate layers.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.530
There's a wall,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.000
and then there is a model standing in front of it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.990
You don't necessarily need to apply a shadow.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.820
You can still get good results without it.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.010
Sometimes it won't even Borg this time.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.040
It works and renders a very good result because it's a direct shot off the model and she

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.050
can easily be standing in front of the wall.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.100
It the headline.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.720
See what I did with the type?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.710
It's heavy,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.320
wide and upper case.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.640
That's to match their context off this page.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.580
Wide straight teeth at black skinny phone wouldn't be as effective here,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.950
would it?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.100
We should always keep the topic in mind when designing everything we do on the page creates

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.590
associations with people.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.310
The calls were used shapes that we choose all that is going to create certain feelings in

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.710
people,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.600
just like what we discussed in the typography lesson about Taipei's personalities.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.740
This is designed thinking,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.150
and it's a one very important scale in the designer skill set.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.950
Okay,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.300
now add the rest of the copy at the navigation bar,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.690
and we have a beautiful hero section for a dental clinic.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.970
Do you notice why I made the button orange?

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.040
Because I sampled it from the girl's hair.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.280
It's not the exact color.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.110
As you can see,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.270
I've done fine tuning on it this way.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.440
It's more vibrant and suitable for modern Web site unboxing.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.470
The image has given us more freedom and control over our composition,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.780
it has added the depth.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.850
Every object seems to exist in one shared space,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.070
but on different layers,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.900
just like the real world is in.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.430
These has given as a very good looking and interesting hero section.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.150
You don't necessarily need to unbox an entire image.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.450
You can achieve an exciting result by taking a small part of the object out of its frame.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.380
For example,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.330
that's what I've done for this website.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.560
On another project for a roofing company.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.720
I wanted to emphasize the roof somehow.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.450
But the's layout isn't really cutting the mustard.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.590
The roof is lost in the design,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.690
so I took the tip off the roof and lead it poke outside of the frame.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.960
Now the roof has gained a spotlight.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.420
It's a point of interest,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.210
plus the images and as separate thing anymore.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.150
It's interacting with the canvas and other elements on it.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.550
That's all it takes to free and image from its frame and bring it to life.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.750
We can't really create this effect in fig MMA.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.110
We will definitely need a photo shop for these in the advanced part of the scores.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.580
I have put a photo shop tutorial and an assignment on how to achieve this effect and how to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.190
cut out a subject or a model from of the image and remove the background out of it.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.590
It's not an essential effect,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.420
but knowing how to make this effect work really opens up your options in design at once.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.930
You remove the background from the subject.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.120
It opens up a lot of different design options,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.790
just like what happened with here,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.530
because now we can change the background.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.960
We can move,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.220
let's say headlines and tax behind objects,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.000
and we can create a bit more three dimensional layers in our designs.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.500
So when you reach the advanced part off this course,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.190
definitely don't miss this tutorial and practice it because it's really gonna come in handy

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.350
when you start designing.
