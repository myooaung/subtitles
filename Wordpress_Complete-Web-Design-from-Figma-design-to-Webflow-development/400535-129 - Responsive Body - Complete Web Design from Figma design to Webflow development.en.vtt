00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
picking up where we left off.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.550
We're going to tackle the responsive versions off these two sections from the body.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.050
We have to make some space in this section.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.160
There is not enough space for everything to fit.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.090
For starters,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.740
we can shrink the space between the image and the content,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.100
say,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.850
from 60 to 30 pixels.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.020
Max.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.560
We can let this images go off the page in reality,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.950
just like the mock up evolve.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.560
There's no reason why we can't do that.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.550
We just need to set a negative margin.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.270
That actually looks pretty cool.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.690
Now we need to fix the cars.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.210
First of all,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.400
they're a little too big.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.370
They didn't shrink with a background image,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.720
so now they occupy too much space.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.100
Select the one that has a single based class and style that once or changes applied to both

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.450
of them.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.300
That looks about right now,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.300
the position.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.060
Remember their absolute elements,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.350
and they are moving certain amount from top and right edges.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:06.830
So there is a little issue with responsiveness on a wider screen inside the tablet mode.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.920
Now the car's a little too small,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.890
and they would work better if they weren't that close to the edge.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.390
We can improve this abuse percentage units instead of pixels,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.470
both for the size,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.820
off the card and the position.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.850
There is no exact calculation we could do here so we can just go by I and see what's the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.770
right percentage and check how it grows and shrinks for the screen.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:36.310
Size now is 45% with does a pretty good job.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.970
Remember how last time we had to change minimum with this time?

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.320
Actually,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.130
it's the opposite.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.150
The minimum with doesn't work but actual fixed with dust.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.830
The actual with works fine because it's not being overridden by maximum,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.300
with as long as the value smaller than the parent say,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.450
This is why it's the best thing to do it just to put the image always inside there.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.680
Image rapper like a regular did block and style that if you need to change sizes or move

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.370
the positions of whatever you to start,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.850
leave the image itself in a default positions and default styles.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.520
But in style,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.130
the parent now wrap her.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.080
You'll save yourself from a lot of confusions.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.060
A lot of headaches,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.350
all right in a similar way will fix that obsolete positions using percentage values.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:38.180
That the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:48.760
right,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.180
the responsiveness is great.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.850
And let's make sure the animation is working good as well.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:03.120
Moving on.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.650
I think landscape mode is pretty good as is.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.830
I would just move the image a little to the right.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.570
So the more off the girl is visible.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:34.150
Uh,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.500
now moving on to the mobile portrait.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.430
The layout here is already vertical.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.720
Why?

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.490
Because we're using the same flex box container is above,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.330
and when we styled,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.850
it evolved.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.950
The same vertical layout was applied to it.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.110
We just need to adjust image here,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.620
decrease the negative margin to something like minus 30 pixels and at a little bit of space

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.210
underneath.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:03.350
So it's not glued to the headline and zero pixels on the right side of it.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:13.850
That's all the Florida taste looking pretty good.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.400
Let's now apply similar adjustments to the second section,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.690
starting from tablet as we haven't touched any of it.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.260
First,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.150
the Image rapper.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.910
We need same margins as above,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.280
but opposite directions.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:37.760
As you can see,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.030
there is this overflow because of the image that is going off the page,

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.260
so we need to apply that combat class.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.750
We already have for the overflow section.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.240
He's a busy now.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.410
The calendar card,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.240
45% with and 10% for absolute positioning.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.150
Uh,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.650
and that's all,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.850
Uh,

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:21.810
but while Landscape is doing great on its own,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.850
I don't think anything needs to be changed now for them about portrait.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.980
First,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.500
let's reverse the layout.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.110
Luckily,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.860
we have the class specifically for these,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.950
so we just need to add the combo class to the flex box.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.710
Second,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.330
we need exactly the same spacing as the image above the same style wasn't carried on this

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.020
one because this image rapper has a Kumble class apply to it and left right margins are

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.680
overridden by the combat class,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.980
but not the bottom marching,

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.150
so that one was carried to this element as well.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:12.220
And there you go.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.750
The mobile portrait looks great.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.780
Check the responsiveness,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.100
checked the preview mode for animations and all that.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.390
Make sure everything is looking good and working fine.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.690
And in the next video,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.550
we'll move on to the testimonial section
