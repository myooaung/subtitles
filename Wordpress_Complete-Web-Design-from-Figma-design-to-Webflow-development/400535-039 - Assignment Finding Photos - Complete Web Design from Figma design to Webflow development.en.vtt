00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Now let's do a fun exercise where you go in.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.540
Hunt some stock photos in this bigmouth file.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.050
I have prepared three frames with headlines and descriptions off three businesses of

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.050
actually grabbed tax from real businesses and their websites.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.630
I want you to find an appropriate photo for each frame,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.450
imagining that you're designing their home page and you need a photo for the hero section

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.720
you're not designing in this assignment.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.160
So don't worry about the four month.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.970
Doesn't matter if they Mitchell is going to go on the background as a split screen or any

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.540
other way.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.280
The goal is just to pick an image thoughtfully.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.980
You can choose photos from any off this free or paid photo sides beat on splash pack cells

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.410
I stock or any other side.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.420
Finding the right photo for your project actually takes time,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.150
and sometimes you need to look on several size to really nail it down.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.550
I sometimes can spend couple hours searching for the right photo just for one hero section

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.550
.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.820
You can use paid sides to and just grab samples from there without paying for it.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.500
You can screenshot or download watermarked image big stock,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.050
for example,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.520
has a download previewing,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.350
and you can use that simple image.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.050
Don't worry about the quality format or the size of damage,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.570
but I do want you to use only stock photo sites and not Google or any other place where

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.620
they have street copyright rules on their images,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.410
like Flicker for grabbing someone's photo from Facebook.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.220
And for each photo that you pick,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.750
I want you to explain why you chose the photo.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.720
This is how you get in the habit of design,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.310
thinking you will do much better job and have your employer's happier.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.950
When you put thought behind each of your decisions,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.650
I'll do an example right here.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980
First stop is to understand what is the business about,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.580
and what is it that they are offering?

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.580
Then think about what sort of scene we want to sat on the website,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.130
giving the business and the text.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.310
So this business helps other companies measure their employee happiness.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.360
The sort of gives me an idea that showing happy employees would work well for this frame.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.950
Let's head to our sides and start by search and quite literally for happy employees.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:10.580
All three of them returned quite diverse results and As you can see,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.420
big stopping the paid side has returned significantly more number of results than on splash

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.250
and pixels.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.000
Also,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.530
the results are quite different.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.070
Big stock,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.770
although having a lot of results,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.630
has a lot of hold.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.040
The trashy photos like this lame business people here,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.870
as Bush actually doesn't have a good search and keyboard mapping.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.610
As you can see,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.850
it has returned a lot of irrelevant stuff.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.230
Paxil seems to have done a decent job when you do the surge experiment with different sort

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.780
of keywords.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.450
Sometimes literal key phrase like Happy employees will work,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.180
but often it's going to be better to use on mix and match single keywords,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.240
for example.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.140
In this case,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.660
I do want the seem to be set in an office environment that sort off a hard keyword that

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.630
needs to be present in the scene so I can just use office and then some secondary keyboards

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.930
with it,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.250
like smile happy and so on.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:19.250
Here's a pro tip when you see a photo that has equality that you like,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.950
but it's still not exactly the right scene or the model Fine,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.050
who is the contributor and surgery,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.270
leaving their photos,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.470
for example,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.850
I quite like the quality off this photo.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.930
Under copyright,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.690
there is a link off the contributor,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.050
meaning a photographer or the photo studio who are uploaded this photo on the site.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.880
If you click on this link,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.860
then you'll see all other photos from this contributor.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.910
And now we could this much better results than a generic search.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.330
All stock sides have their own ways to display contributor photos and where to find the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.610
link.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.730
But most of them do,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.660
in their own ways,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.750
to search through the images of one contributor on big stock just inside your keyword in

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.270
front of this short code that it automatically inserted the's full refined results within

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.770
the contributors photos.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.850
Without the streak,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.950
I would have to go through thousands off terrible photos.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:20.850
This is a pretty good option for Happy Employees Click,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.370
download,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.950
preview and then just place it inside the figment file.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:34.390
That's all.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.710
No need to design anything.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.550
Leave it as this.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.090
It shows Happy employees,

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.860
which is the goal of his business.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.060
The photo is modern,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.020
the atmosphere feels relaxed,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.820
smiles look genuine,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.900
and overall,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.930
the photo films warm and inviting and done.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.980
That's your task.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.290
No design involved.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.950
Have fun
