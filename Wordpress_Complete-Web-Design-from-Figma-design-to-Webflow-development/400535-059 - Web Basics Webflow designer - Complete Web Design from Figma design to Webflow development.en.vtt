00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
you already send this before,

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.910
but let's do a quick recap up.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.120
What's what in white flow.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.180
If this is in your initial screen,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.360
you might be on other pages like Showcase,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.300
So just click back to the dashboard.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.750
I'll be working the free account as well to make sure you get the same experience.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.190
When you click create project,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.760
you'll get options to start with.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.590
There are a whole bunch of free and paid templates,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.950
but we're not in business for those.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.850
So we're going to select a blink site.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:33.780
This is called the Designer.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.420
This is where all the magic happens in Web flow.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.480
Our pages redesign is is going to go on this white canvas and we'll be able to interact

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.450
with elements directly on this canvas on the laugh toolbar.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.910
We have our controls to go back to the dashboard project settings or the editor underneath

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.700
that we have three important panels.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.560
1st 1 is the elements panel.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.100
That's how we add new elements on the page.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.000
And then we have the Navigators panel,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.490
which is sort of like the layers paneling,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.930
figment,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.870
but not exactly the same,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.290
because the Web works a little different than the design interface tools like Sigma.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.080
Then we have the pages panel that's going to show all the pages within our website.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.550
From here,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.600
we can add new pages and manage their settings and so on.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.490
On the free plan,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.130
we only get to a static pages,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.910
but we do get a bit more CMS pages.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.480
Although the hosting plant is an expensive,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.270
it's like $12 per month,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.990
which is quite similar to what you'd pay for a regular descent website hosting anyways.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.870
But here,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.150
you don't have to worry about,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.340
you know,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.910
I have to pee server setting,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.340
security and all that.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.450
No need to worry about other stuff on the left toolbar for now.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.950
We'll get to them when we need to.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.690
In the center,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.500
you have these different device views.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.330
This is where we make our website responsive and optimize it for different devices to have

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.880
a modern website that looks great on any screen and any device were also able to resize the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.860
screen for each device like mobile,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.560
for example,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.570
and optimized to make sure it looks great on all sort of mobile devices,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.370
not just one.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.580
As you resize it,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.620
you can see that in different weeds.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.550
It shows what popular devices are sort of using that particular with now in weap low.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.950
We don't write code bought with Low writes code for us.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.170
This goat is accessible right here.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.100
After you're don building your website,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.510
you have two options to either keep your side on weather and publish it using their hosting

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.520
or export.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.240
The source code,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.950
which includes HTML,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.430
CSS,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.250
JavaScript and old assets.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.350
Organized exact the way an actual side would be organized and host hosted elsewhere.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.090
The source code is production ready,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.550
meaning you can Eastern to publish a working side,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.090
with exception for sides that have see a mass and dynamic content and maybe even forms.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.980
This will need special installation and co treatment,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.800
however,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.890
were not going to do that because the best option is always to just keep decide on wet flow

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.890
.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.360
I give my websites on wet floor.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.650
There's just too many good benefits for doing so,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.480
like superfast servers anytime I need to add it.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.100
The website for the future,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.470
the content editor,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.630
which is amazing future off wet floor,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.880
which is for clients so they can really simply and easily,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.920
added the website without knowing any tools and knowing anything about coding or

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.780
development.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.530
There's just too many benefits,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.690
and I'm going to cover all these benefits and how to sort of sell these to your clients and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.200
explain this to your clients all these benefits in the section about freelancing and

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.980
finding Warrick and all that and to publish the side of weapon.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.060
Oh,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.200
we can do that from here for free.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.510
You can publish it on what flows domain for a custom domain will need to add a hosting plan

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.510
.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.550
And on the right side,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.480
we have our style.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.000
Spinal.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.360
This is where we manipulate and style every single element on the page.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.820
You can recognize this.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.690
It's sort of similar to fig HMAS Properties panel on the same side,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.050
just like big might at its of whatever is currently selected.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.310
There are many similar properties like size,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.080
topography,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.850
phone name sizes and so on.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.950
And if acts like blurring and shadows,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.070
there are more tabs on the side,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.890
but we don't have to worry about them for now.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.980
We'll go over it when we actually need to,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.640
and that's it.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.070
That's a briefing troll off the web flow designer
