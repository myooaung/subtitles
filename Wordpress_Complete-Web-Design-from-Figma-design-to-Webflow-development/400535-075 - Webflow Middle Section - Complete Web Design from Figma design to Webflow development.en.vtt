00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
the desktop version of the hero section is completely done.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.180
We haven't optimized it for mobile devices and like tablets yet.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.290
But what we're going to do is actually,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.540
well,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.830
first going to finish the entire page.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.790
And then we're going to do the responsiveness and mobile optimization.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.510
This is sort of my habit of doing it somewhat.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.070
Designers.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.810
What they're going to do is they will each section by section,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.050
each individual block that they're building their also dream mobile optimization.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.220
At the same time,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.560
I like to finish the entire page first and then and then go to the mobile optimization and

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.440
responsiveness.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.200
Why?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.250
Because what often happens for me is that I send desktop versions or the whatever the page

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.490
that I'm basically designing.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.890
I send it to the client for their review,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.020
and they come back with revisions.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.330
So what happens that will be like even though we agreed on the design?

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.990
Sometimes you know there's animations involved,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.240
right?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.440
There's interactions involved,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.340
some horror effects,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.950
so different things are involved that haven't been part of the design face,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.970
or they might just change their mind when they see the page in reality.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.540
So what happens is that they might come back with some different changes that I have to

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.150
make.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.100
And I might completely remove part part of the section or completely change the ways laid

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.060
out and so on in now all that responsiveness and over the mobile optimization that I have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.840
put inside.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.350
It's sort of lost all the time.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.690
And this way I know that.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.890
You know,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.580
I don't have to spend any extra time on mobile versions until we're sure,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.710
and until my client has signed off on the designs and we know this is ready to go.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.450
Then at the final stage,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.450
I'll fix the mobile and then create the responsiveness off the page,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.070
and we'll use that process,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.980
finished the page first and then go over it and go through the entire tablets and mobile

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.150
versions and all that.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.780
Now it's time to build this middle section,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.950
which is going to be much simpler.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.030
So what do we need?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.450
First,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.310
we can have a look at our hero structure to get a clue so it looks like we have to deal

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.730
blocks,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.250
one name hero section and another container that sits inside that hero section.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.170
If you remember,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.740
we made a container as a generic block to center are content.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.150
We even reuse this content area inside the navigation bar.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.840
It's a great idea to reuse the container again everywhere on our website.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.170
This way we have a uniformly out,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.280
and if we ever decide to tain change the maximum weight making why they're or narrower,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.150
we can do so on entire website in a couple of clicks for the hero section.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.690
We haven't done anything standardized like that otherwise would reuse it here as well.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.640
But that's okay.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.720
We can create a generic section now,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.930
which we can reuse later like we did with container.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.250
So we're going to add a new section.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.750
Will put another do block inside,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.750
will apply container class to that do block,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:11.150
and we're going to create a new class named section for that section block.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.620
And now let's add some style to this newly created section class.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.850
One thing we can borrow from the hero section is the side padding.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.690
Remember the side pending we apply to the hero section so the content doesn't go to the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.330
edges.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.250
We know there's going to be uniform across our website and between pages,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.150
just like our generic container,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.510
so we're going to apply the same padding toe are generic section later.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.750
If we ever decide to change that padding,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.870
we can do so on the entire upside.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.500
Just by changing one instance off that section,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.150
we can also add top and bottom padding This information we can find in fig MMA.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.020
We have used the 19 pixel spacing and figment to distance this headline from the hero

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.250
section above so we can reuse that same value here,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.220
and we can applied it as both top and bottom petting there.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.700
Now we have a generic section way out with a generic container inside.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.040
Well,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.750
reuse this exact same structure on other similar sections on our page.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.060
Now we can put our elements inside and start styling them to make it look like our designs

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.060
.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.750
We'll do that in the next video.
