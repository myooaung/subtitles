00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
and moving ahead with the next section For the tablet.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.350
It's quite easy.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.950
We just need to move that image more towards the left.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.310
When you click on it,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.380
you'll see that it has a negative margin.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.850
That's what makes it move out of the page so much.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.510
Let's decrease the negative margin.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.650
I think this looks quite good minus 350 pixels.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.850
Check the fluidity and that's it.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:38.690
Now for the mobile landscape,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.430
let's start by section patting.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.200
We've made horizontal planning smaller on the heroes action.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.400
It's 30 pixels have never matched that with the rest of the sections.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.770
We can't make the change on this section directly because it has a combo class applied to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.030
it.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.280
If we shrink the space,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.950
it's only going to apply to this combo class and none of the other sections.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.580
So what we can do is either select another section that doesn't have a combo class like

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.850
that next one,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.630
for example,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.850
or we can get rid of the comfort class for a moment,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
style that section and then put the compa class back in.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.510
But that's more complicated,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.770
so let's just all the section below and of course,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.350
that has applied the padding on the above Section two.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.050
Similarly,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.320
we can change the value that is more appropriate and decrease it to something like minus

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.850
260 pixels.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.150
Again,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.250
check the Florida T.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:49.830
One more thing I would like to fix here is the vertical patting on the section on landscape

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.090
mode.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.840
Vertical space is very limited.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.880
If you imagine that you're seeing this on a actual mobile escape,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.460
you'll understand that you'll have some gaps where you're not really seeing much content.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.960
One thing to note about mobile landscape view.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.620
It's not just mobile landscape,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.080
but also some tablets and phablets or whatever they're called because you're seeing the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.790
down in the viewer.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.070
It shows different sizes for different devices,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.640
so it's not just more about landscaping reality,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.170
but we call it mobile landscape.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.350
Just to make things is here.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.820
Okay,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.880
so we have 80 pixel vertical patting on our default sections.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.130
I'll shrink this to like 60 pixels,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.810
just like we did previously.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.150
Select the section that doesn't have a combo class and style that one.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:43.590
OK,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440
moving on to the mobile portrait.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.470
The image on this action isn't of invisible.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.980
So what,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.250
we're going to do is change the direction of the flax box to vertical.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.830
There's another direction we can change.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.050
We can reverse the order inside Flex box,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.420
and having image first makes more sense,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.990
which is quite simple to do just by enabling this reverse button.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.490
But let's give the second class first before we do.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.630
This vertical direction is something that is fine.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.970
To apply to the base class.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.640
It's going to be the mainly out for most flex boxes on mobile,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.070
but the order is something more specific.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.080
So for that it's best to have a comeback class and not affect other flex boxes on our page

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.000
because we also have a flax books in the food or and that's going to reverse things there,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.450
too.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.140
And now we can style the image one issues.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.370
That image is too small,

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.000
so we should increase the size.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.680
Increasing the size of the image has some do's and dont's.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.230
We can't change the with from the image settings thes our global image setting.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.550
So if we change the size here is going to effect on every single screen size.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.850
See now images gun from the desktop,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.250
so the ideal places to style it from the Styles panel.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.130
And in here,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.750
there's another don't don't style the height.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.100
When you start to hide,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.980
it doesn't preserve aspect ratio,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.650
and you get a spaghetti image.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.990
The wheat valleys are the best option,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.450
but here to some things,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.700
will behave oddly,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.970
depending on the situation.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.700
Either fix with or minimum with works.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.360
The vest,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.960
for example,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.550
regular with valued doesn't change the size,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.650
but the minimum with does a pretty good job.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.330
Not that this Sebag or some sort of a glitch there is usually an answer to such mysterious

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.050
behaviors.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.850
In this case,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.160
we doesn't do much because there's a maximum with of 100% which is telling you to be on Lee

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.940
as wide as the parent container.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.580
It's basically overriding the with but minimal with ignores that because it comes before

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.000
the maximum with Don't worry.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.170
If you're not catching all this,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.140
I don't usually worry too much about the reasoning.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.410
I just play with values and see which one works out.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.360
Say 380 pixel looks good.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.620
Now we need to fix The negative margin may be aligned.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.450
The edge off the image with the content,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:13.250
something like minus 90 pick self and let's add some margin on the bottom.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.200
Perfect.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.950
Let's check the Florida T and we're good to go.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.370
I don't worry too much about that.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.030
Screen sizes less than 320 pixel wide.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.340
That's just such a rare occurrence,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.460
especially for our target audience for modern teams.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.950
I don't think any off them own Nokia in 95.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.800
Besides,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.930
that alluded to looks great will continue with the rest in the next video stick around.
