00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
in this video,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.190
we're going to start building our block post page toe access this page,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.630
you go to the pages panel and on the bottom you have this page with a purple icon.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.140
That's the one previously added all these content here,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.850
but I'm going to completely get rid of it and start from scratch.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.810
So based on our designs,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.750
first thing we need is a navigation bar.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.270
We're not going to build it from scratch.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.950
Obviously,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.250
we will call paid from our homepage and take it from there.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.990
So it's reach back to the home page,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.000
Select the entire now far element.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.250
Make sure you're selecting the whole thing and not just the container Glade control.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.610
See,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.950
then go back to the block page and paste it there.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.920
When you Payson object,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200
we conduct canvas first,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
or you'll get this error message where Flo needs to know.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.450
Where exactly are you pasting your element?

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.880
There we go.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.060
Well,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.690
nothing's visible right now because our now bar is white,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.770
so let's just style.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.430
The elements inside are now bar,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.770
just like in our designs,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.900
starting with links.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.310
Right now,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.970
they're white,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.610
so we need to have them dark to do so.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.510
We need to apply a combo class first and then style.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:22.380
It otherwise is going to change the original two on the home page and then apply the combat

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.850
class to the rest of the links,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.060
saying,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.120
For the now button,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.650
we need an extra combat class.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.310
I know I usually recommend to not have more than one,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.420
but it's OK every once in a while,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.980
from technological standpoint,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.980
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
It just for us so that things don't get confusing and cluttered.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.020
The buttons background is our primary blue with 15% opacity.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.250
You can see that in fig MMA.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:02:05.850
Lastly,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.560
the logo,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.570
which we need to export from pigment.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:38.050
Let's check the responsiveness.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.760
It's good to the edges on our home page,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.110
now very sitting inside the hero section,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.340
which has panning.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.530
That's why it's not glued to the edges there.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.490
But here it's outside of protection.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.390
We could put it inside the section here,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.020
too,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.060
but a better option is to just create a combo class for the now bar and add padding

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.950
directly on it.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.900
And that's all.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.230
The navigation bar is ready moving on to the rest of the block page,

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.720
we have a headline image,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.950
the content as usual.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.350
We're going to start with a section and a container.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:30.670
The section is gray.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.800
That's what we're using on the home page.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.910
But for the block post,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.720
we've decided to go with plain white,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.920
the thing with block poses that you want maximum readability.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.170
It's a lengthy content,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.940
and if the contrast isn't enough,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.120
or there is some sort of decreased readability for some other reason is really going to

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.750
hurt us.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.280
Making a white section is simple.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.610
Just a new combat class,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.350
and that's all.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.430
Make sure to use some other name,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.860
preferably something specific to the base class like white section that says a lot more

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.800
than just white,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.850
and we make sure it doesn't conflict with any other class.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.490
All right,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.810
now,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.350
let's add a headline.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.420
We already know what to do with this headline,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.690
right?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.950
We're going to bind it to the CMS item.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.450
Excellent.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.270
The boundaries off our block posts in the designs is a little different.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.410
We're using a more narrow layout,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.130
with the maximum with of 700 pixels and the maximum with off our genetic container.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.070
Here is 1160 pixels.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.450
That means we need to create a different container for our block post.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.970
So let's give it a combo class or maybe even duplicate the class and give it a maximum

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.350
without 700 pixels.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.480
All right,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.400
that's looking good.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.790
Next,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.560
we have author and date segment,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.260
but we're going to do that in the next video stick around.
