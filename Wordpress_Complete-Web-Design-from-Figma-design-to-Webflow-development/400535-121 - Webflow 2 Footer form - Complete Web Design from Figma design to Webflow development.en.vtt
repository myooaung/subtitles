00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
in this video,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.220
we have one last thing to do to finish.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.950
The further is the email form.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.320
This title here that's a subscribe to our newsletter is not a link.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.370
It's just a headline,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.730
but same style as other foot or links.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.830
We need to change this into a regular attacks and remove that horror effect.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.970
This is how we will do that.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.250
Add a regular attacks block and give it the same foot early in class.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:33.880
Now it's not a link anymore,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.840
but the hover effect is still there.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.210
To get rid of that world,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.770
duplicated class and name,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.650
eat something like Subscribe text.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.450
Now we can go to the hover fact and get rid of it.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.450
Excellent.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.210
Now let's create the newsletter form.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.180
But start by copying the email form.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.350
We already have evolved and go from there.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.690
Naturally,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.380
spacing is going to be an issue here,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.660
especially when we shrink,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.290
so we're gonna have to make some layout adjustments.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.840
The content here is flex box organized in columns.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.560
For starters,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.260
we can get rid of the wit that we have applied to the footer columns that is making them

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.850
equal with,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.650
regardless off the content inside which in this case isn't really going to work.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.220
All right,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.350
that's a little better.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.580
There is also an extra empty column,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.040
which previously re used to have an equal space between the logo and the links.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.850
This time we're gonna have to lose it,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.760
and that's an extra improvement.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.640
Now let's change the width off the first column with the logo inside.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.250
It's stretching way too much.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.140
Let's check.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:05.120
What's that within the design and apply that excellent.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.950
That might be enough.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.520
Now it's style,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520
the for now.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.580
These form is using classes from that ball of hero section form,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.630
so we need to duplicate every time we're changing something inside.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.150
So don't forget that let's start with the background color of the field.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:40.360
There seems to be some default style on the field border,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.350
so let's change the border to transparent for zero pixels.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:54.130
Remember the tax inside the field is that placeholder text which can be styled from the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.490
states.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.750
Drop down.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:26.250
Uh uh uh.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:36.940
Now the button is a little more fun.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.230
We've decided to have a button that's arrow and it's on top of the field,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.190
not outside of it.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.110
So we gotta pay for our creativity.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.740
Luckily,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.750
we have already learned how to use positions so we can make such arrangement.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.550
Will need to do a few things in order to make this work.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.980
First,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.250
let's turn our button into a narrow.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.080
This is fairly straightforward.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.570
We're going to put the arrow as a background image off the button.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.570
In regular buttons.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.780
We could directly insert the arrow inside,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.560
but when it comes to foreign buttons,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.050
they work a little differently.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.140
Here's what we need to do.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.090
Get rid of the tax and the waiting message that inside the settings off the button,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.850
but put something like one single letter.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.790
We cannot live it completely empty because weap low will insert some default text.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.850
Otherwise Now remove the existing class and create a new class something like every button

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.850
.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:31.560
We can easily make the letter disappear by turning.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.550
Cut the tax too transparent color.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.050
That's all.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.250
Now it won't be visible.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.100
Problem soft.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.760
Next,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.850
export the arrow from Fatemeh and add it as a background image off the button.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:05:00.280
We gotta change a few settings here.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.770
First choose their contained,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.390
so the full aero is visible no matter the buttons dimensions and remove tiling and position

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.850
image right in the center.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.440
Next,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.650
remove the blue background by changing it too transparent.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.510
We need to match the height off the button to the height off the field.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.250
It's not matching right now because the field has an extra margin on the bottom by default

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.250
.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.450
Change that to zero,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.350
and the button should match the height exactly.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.010
If it doesn't then check the settings of the form.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.030
It's a flex box,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.410
and something might be up in there or just change the button.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.570
Hide manual interests like the field that should do the job.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.190
Next,

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:47.650
we're going to set button to obsolete position and aligning to the right.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.670
The moment you do these,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.210
the button might disappear.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.310
Now why is that?

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.450
Because position is relative to the body.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.940
We need the position to be relative to its direct parent element,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.990
which is the four.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.990
Remember the trick.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.740
If we change the position off the parent relative or something else than the button will

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.830
position itself relative to the parent,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.150
and that will fix our issue.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:27.010
Let's move the air a little to the right now.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.550
Let's give it a task in the preview,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:39.000
always working fine except one thing for a very long email that taxed is going to mix with

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.160
the arrow fixing.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.860
This is very easy.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.250
We just need to add extra padding to the field element.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:07:12.870
That worry text will stop going underneath the arrow there.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.020
Now it's perfect way.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.140
Also need to change the success message to enable the success State Select Form,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.560
Block and in the Settings Click Success Top.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.090
Make sure you've selected the form block and not the field.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.250
Selecting just the field will show different options in the settings.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:38.630
Make sure to duplicate the success message class scenes.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.950
This is the same class from that ball form.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:47.840
Now the box grows wider compared to the form failed and alters the entire structure of the

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.170
footer.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.310
Not a good idea to fix this.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:55.590
We can give our entire form block fixed with the same size as we have in designs,

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.850
which is 267 pixels.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.830
This will keep the field the success and ever messages all the same size.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.340
Now that style the rest,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.310
the text sizes too big compared to other footer content.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.100
We should match the phone size and maybe last padding,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:19.850
and we also need to update the content.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:32.750
Uh uh,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.230
as for error message,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.000
it seems fine.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Is this all right?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.860
Check the responsiveness and see how it old looks inside the preview Most,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:52.950
uh uh,

00:08:52.950 --> 00:09:02.830
our home pages done.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.960
And in the next section,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.830
we're going to learn how to use what close interaction toe So we can create some animations

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.800
for our page and bring it to life.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.540
Stick around.
