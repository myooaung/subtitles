00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
being successful.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.360
Freeland centers often not about the skills but mawr about service that you provide to your

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.950
clients.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.530
You're gonna be the best damn Web designer.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.400
But if clients don't like working with you,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.040
if you're not delivering a high quality to service,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.980
they're not going to come back for more.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.130
Because what happens with clients that are happy is that not just they come back for more

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.450
and bring MAWR work towards you.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.060
But they also bring other people.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.030
They re fair their friends who are usually business,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.310
you know,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.660
businessmen and interpreters.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.440
Their friends are usually other businessmen,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.430
another interpreter.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.470
So they do have a really good access to bring more work towards you.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.530
Big chunk of my clients that actually referrals like I work with one client.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.570
They're super satisfied because I deliver really high quality service,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.480
and then they are happy to recommend me to their friends.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.460
But if I didn't deliver a good service even if I built a good website but the where,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.620
you know,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.700
maybe I was neglectful.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.420
Maybe I wasn't,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.800
You know,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.740
I basically think of the customer service.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.570
Maybe I was just not I wasn't very nice.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.730
Maybe it was just ruled.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.400
Or maybe I wasn't responsive to their emails or their calls or something like that.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.510
Then they're not gonna be confident.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.730
Teoh recommend me to their friends.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.890
Because where whenever you're recommending something to your friend,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.570
you want to make sure that you're not gonna,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.000
you know,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.920
screw them over,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.190
right?

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.300
That whatever you're going to recommend to them,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.650
it's going to be good and beneficial for that.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.190
So they need to be 100% confident that whatever they're getting,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.760
whether ever,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.780
whatever they're recommending is good for their friends.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.950
So here are some tips on how to be that freelancer to whom that clients keep coming back

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.450
for more.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.170
Do you know what's the one criteria that clients will never overlook?

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.380
They can overlook things like your portfolio,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.200
your previous experience,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.700
maybe even job reviews.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.730
But there is one thing that will never,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.880
never ignore.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.540
And that is trust.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.710
Do I trust this person?

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.960
If the answer is not 100% hell,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.530
yes.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.150
Then you're not getting the job.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.150
No matter how amazing everything else looks like on your profile.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.770
If I don't try to that everything can be ally.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.220
Everything you say can be ally.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.090
Everything I see on the profile can be a lie.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.870
Everything you promise can be alive.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.460
And I will never trust you with my money and my business in the best way to lose my trust

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.260
as a client.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.490
Try selling me something.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.390
If you're trying to sell me something,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.860
then you have an agenda.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.890
Why do you have the secret agenda?

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.550
That you want to make the cell?

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.290
And if I recognize that you have that agenda,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.430
then how do I know that everything that you say is true?

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.600
That how do I know that everything you're trying to do is to help me,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.660
but not just to benefit yourself?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.110
The solution is very simple.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.750
Change your personal agenda from selling to helping.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.640
You might go Wait a second.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.370
But my agenda is to sell my services,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.680
right?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.730
I'm doing business.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.940
I'm trying to make money.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.970
I'm not here to do charity or volunteer work.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.690
How do I change the agenda to just helping when I do need to sell?

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.770
I know that's true,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.860
but nothing changes in reality.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.590
Nothing changes on the surface.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.790
You're still going to get paid.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.200
You're still going to make money,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.420
but everything changes deep down the way you talk the way.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.880
Approach your clients that where you connect with them.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.580
All those small thousands off micro decisions and micro interactions change when your

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.110
agenda changes from selling toe helping and it's not going to go on noticed.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.200
Your client will trust you instantly,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.650
and that often matters more than your portfolio.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.420
One amazing helpful thing you can provide your client is to relieve the pain that they're

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.610
experiencing in this field.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.410
Imagine for a minute that you're a business owner that needs a website,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.960
and you went to design studios and found out that you know you can't afford their

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.510
astronomical prices for Web design projects.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.270
So what you do,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.870
you go on freelancing platforms like upward to hire from the higher individual freelancer

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.310
who's going to charge a bit less now,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.710
think about how much confusion and uncertainty you have to deal with if you're not,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.020
you know,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.620
interpreter.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.380
Who is from these failed from this kind of Web design industry or whatever.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.970
If you're just doing the regular business,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.360
then you probably don't know any of this technology.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.720
You don't know where to build it.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.150
I don't know what's WordPress for what's what Thor,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.670
html or CMS.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.600
You don't quite know how to judge was a good freelancers.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.340
Was a good Web designer was a bad Web designer.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.200
So you're dealing with a lot off uncertainty.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.510
And as you do more research,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.140
you will find out that instead of getting clarity,

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.420
actually,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.810
you're getting a bit more confused.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.920
So as you can see that clients have to worry about so many strange details and put their

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.150
money at risks.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.940
So how can you help them?

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.180
There are several ways we can help them in one way is definitely to tell them that and show

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.980
them that we got the process right.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.290
All the things that we're gonna take Carol for them and they don't have to worry about

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.920
things like the technology right where we're gonna build this thing where we're going to

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.610
launch this thing.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.020
Like what?

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.540
Plowright.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.090
They don't have to worry about that.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.430
We got that taken care of.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.090
We can also explain the process to them,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.460
just like our design process that we have that we're gonna go from Project Brief and then

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.850
to the wife framing and into the design and finally building the whole thing in wet floor

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.300
and developing so we can explain that you know,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.640
there will be involved and have control over each step off the process so they know what's

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.190
going on.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.360
And they don't have Teoh.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.690
Just me no commit a huge amount of money and then hope that everything's gonna work out

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.070
Well,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.560
because there will be involved in the whole process.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.070
And they will have ability to kind of tweak the from tweak the way and,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.400
uh,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.280
course to make sure that we're going to the right direction in this way.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.820
Now they can relax in our partnership because they see that we have it,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.220
you know,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.980
taking care of.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.570
And we know the process and we can guide this process and that way.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.120
Now they can relax and they don't have to risk a lot when working with us.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.850
Do that and you'll have them eating off your hands because other freelancers most likely

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.000
they're not doing this right.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.770
They're not taking them to this guided process.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.920
But you are.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.030
Other freelancers are there to take their money,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.770
but you're not.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.650
You got their back
