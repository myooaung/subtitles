00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
when the first webpage ever went live in 1991.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.360
This is how it looked like it's still live if you want to check it out.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.840
This first webpage was made by the inventor off World Wide Web team,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.750
Berners Lee,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.610
in CERN,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.020
which is a nuclear research laboratory in Switzerland.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.950
Surprisingly not really related to computers.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.290
I'm actually being concerned.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.480
I was on this business trip from my job at the time,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.740
and I was taken to this exact room where the worldwide was World Wide Web was created by

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.040
Team Berners Lee,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.180
and the room is completely unassuming.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.890
You wouldn't really think that anything creative came out of it just looks like a regular

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.450
chemistry or like a physics lab off a regular high school.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.710
And I was told this story.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.210
Apparently when teams submitted his paper about World Wide Web,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.460
he supervisor of wrote down on the paper when he was reviewing,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000
saying vague but interesting.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.170
I'm sure at the time none of them had any idea what they're Web sites and the Internet

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.300
would end up looking today.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.310
The very first webpage was made using HTML,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.100
and until today it's still whatever website is made off as we learned,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.500
Weapon will actually need to learn how HTML and CSS work.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.160
We're not going to learn how to code,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.690
but we will learn the logic behind because everything in Webnoize sort of based on that

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.250
logic.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.540
HTML I simply the content off the Web page like a headline paragraph of tax or image.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.400
And each piece of this content has a label to it of which tells the browser,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.900
If this the headline in paragraph leaning or something else,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.710
they call this a tag.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.800
HTM On its own,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.980
it's not very pretty.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.550
It has a vertical layout.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.250
Everything is stacked one after another.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.220
You can't really overlap elements or create greets and column layouts.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.220
It's sort of like a tax document where older content flows in a vertical direction.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.990
One after the other Web design back then didn't really exist.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.160
There was not much designing involved,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.250
but then came CSS and website started to have a whole different look.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.400
CSS is the style off the website.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.780
It's where we define how each of those HTM elements should look like what side they should

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.010
be,

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.250
what,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.660
fond,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.320
what color,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.400
how they should be laid out on the page if they should have any hover interactions and so

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.760
on.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760
A webpage with just HTML looks like a skeleton,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.640
and after applying CSS to it,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.790
it's like an entire person in West Flow.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.450
We had HTM elements from the Elements panel,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:42.260
and if we take a look at the Codex board will see that two HTML elements have been added

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.830
there to H one tack for the headline and pitak for the paragraph.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.530
This our default on style html elements.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.200
If you check the CSS tap,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.660
you'll see it's empty.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.340
We haven't added any style.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.350
Toe are elements yet the style is added from the right on the styles panel.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.950
We haven't Britain any code or return any CIA assess ourselves.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.750
But wet floor has done this for us.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.900
No CSS Tab has some style information in it.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.730
It's basically any structure that says even Element has a name heading,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.730
making red color and 58 pixel big that simple.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.840
This is the incredible power of wet floor.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.050
We're building our website completely from scratch.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.500
No stupid templates and ugly themes.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.190
We have the full control over building a completely unique website,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.210
and we don't have to coat any off it Wet flow,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.550
writes the code for us
