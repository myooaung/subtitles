00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
Now let's make our block page response it.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.620
The desktop is doing well,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.650
the car trying to a reasonable size so we can still keep three columns of the tablets.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.790
It's a different story.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.060
It's too much for three.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.950
So we gotta go with two columns.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.600
We can change the layout from these settings.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.950
That's going to affect deft aversion to its global,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.150
not device specific.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.440
But it's quite simple.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.320
These items are inside of flex box,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.650
with wrapping enabled.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.640
This means cards will jump to the next line when there is no space.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.470
If we give the collection item,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.950
a 50% with that will instantly organize everything in two columns.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.820
Easy as that.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.930
They're also stretch and shrink to occupy,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.950
according space.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.670
Now for the landscape,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.590
its little tricky on wider sizes.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.330
It's perfect.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.730
But when you shrink to the smallest size than two columns is too much.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.390
Some off the content even gets squeezed like avatars,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.150
for example,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.710
one option is to create a single column layout,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:22.920
so we would need to set the with 2 100% Single column isn't bad in this case,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.660
but do you know what would be the perfectly out if we could have two column layout and in

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.700
some specific wait for it to turn into single column.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.790
For example,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.210
if we sat minimum with of collection item to 300 pixels this way,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.470
cards will shrink until 300 pixel,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.820
and then they will wrap to the second line,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.640
creating one calmly out.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.950
But this is an ideal on the big screen.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.950
We get this gap.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.530
Ideally,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.810
we wanted to switch to 100% with the moment they go.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.780
Single column.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.410
Luckily,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.180
there is an advance trick for this.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.090
We can set such specific rules under flex child settings underneath.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.280
The more options remove the minimum with settings.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.950
Before you start editing this part,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.620
there are three fields with grow,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.340
shrink and basis value.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.690
The combination of these three values renders different results.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.010
It's quite powerful.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.280
I won't dive deep into the logic of how their work.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.950
I don't fully understand myself,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.150
but I'll explain the one variant that we need right now.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.890
Inside the basis we can set a value like 300 pixels.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.910
Then in the shrink fell,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.700
we can specify to natural beyond this value.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.010
The value for this needs to be zero.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.610
If it's one and a ball,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.050
then it means it can shrink beyond that value.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.920
So with shrinks set to zero,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.750
it does ensuring beyond that and the cars wrapped to the next line.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.690
It's like setting a minimum now because grow is set to zero.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.110
It neither grows beyond 300 pixel,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.280
nor shrinks 00 basically means don't grow.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.000
Don't drink,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.830
just keep it at 300 pixels.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.900
But if we sat grow to one,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.050
then we will allow it to grow beyond 300 pixels to occupy any available space.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.250
And this gives as an absolutely,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.610
perfectly out where it's too full column,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.030
and when it gets too small,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.670
then it turns into a single full.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.440
With column.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.550
If you didn't wrap your head around this fully,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.210
don't worry.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.420
It's a tricky concept.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.880
Just know that such granular control is an option when you need it,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.910
then randomly.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.250
You can play with different values until you get the desired result.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.520
That's what I do most of the time,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.050
anyways.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.080
Finally,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.180
let see the portrait mode because of the flax child settings that we have.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.310
Setting the landscape mode portrayed is automatically in a single column mode,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.560
although with one issue.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.720
Since we don't allow it to shrink below 300 pixels,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.010
it goes beyond page.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.810
Borders now,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.780
because we are using flex child settings were not able to add it with settings here because

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.350
flax child settings ignores these values.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.980
So we turned the flex child back to its default value,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.880
which is the shrink if needed.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.250
And then we will be able to change the with 100%.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.120
There's one last thing we can fix.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.440
You see on this super narrow devices,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.350
the avatar gets all squashed,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.150
squished.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.220
Yes,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.820
this are very old android phones,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.050
but we can fix it easily,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.750
so why not?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.290
Avatar is sitting inside of flax box.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.360
That's why shrinking,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.810
even though it has fixed with by default old flex child,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.050
our shrink if needed.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.070
If we change that,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.320
too,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.140
don't shrink or grow than avatar will stay proper size and other tax elements will shrink

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.120
if it and that's it,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.700
really,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.250
that's it.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.040
Our website is fully done.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.640
It's responsive.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.820
It looks beautiful,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.580
it's fast and powerful.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.330
People pay good box for this in the next section,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.610
will give finishing touches and will publish the website first.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.790
We're going to publish it on West folks up domain.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.230
But then we're going to publish it on a custom domain because that's an important part.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.620
You need to learn that as well.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.590
So you can take the website that you're building for the client and then actually put it in

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.550
on their domain.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.750
One more about that later.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.450
Stick around.
