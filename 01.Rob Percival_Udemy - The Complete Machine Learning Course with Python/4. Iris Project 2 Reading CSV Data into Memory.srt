1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:01,500
OK.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,940
The next thing we want to do is to actually read the data in to our memory.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,590
OK.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,990
First thing is that we are looking at reading the final quote Irish data.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:23,350
That's the source file that we have the data file that we have under the directory called data.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,120
And I know beforehand that this is actually a C as we file so you can see that we are using pandas.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,690
There is a sub module called Read CSP using the read C as we read the Irish stored data fall into our

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,400
memory.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,790
So let's show you a little bit within the data.

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:52,070
I do have a couple of sample data for you to utilize and the purpose of our lesson and this is that

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,850
I really don't data that already place there.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,070
So let me just hide this so that we can actually have more space.

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,830
So let's run this cell and basically I'm reading this and I'm storing it into the variable core D F

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,880
DFS shot for data frame remember that I mentioned pandas is good and useful for tabular structure excel

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,740
like Excel like data format or the actual formatting of the data.

16
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:33,370
So let's have a look at the first few rows of the data by using this module core dot head or core method.

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,160
So let's run this and you can see there.

18
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,540
Okay.

19
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,910
Right.

20
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,560
Not as I mentioned before.

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,110
These are in tabular format in columns and rows format.

22
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,620
There is one problem though is that the this is actually a data.

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:02:00,700
This row is actually a raw data and what pandas read see as we method think or thought it was the column

24
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,330
header.

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,500
And naturally we know that that's actually incorrect.

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,970
So what we can do here is that we can add a little parameter here call comma and then Heather is equal

27
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:23,020
to minus one that basically say look this data this raw data as it comes to has no header at all and

28
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,290
just take the first row as data.

29
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,000
So we're going to read that directly and then show the head.

30
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,030
Okay.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,260
The head meaning the first five rows of data.

32
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,680
So if we run that and I get this interesting error message.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,070
Right.

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,020
It's fairly roll.

35
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,710
So what it actually is saying is it's a value error.

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,100
Again how do you read.

37
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,230
Error messages passing negative integer to header is invalid for no header use header it could have

38
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,500
none instead.

39
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,030
Oh very good.

40
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,350
OK.

41
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,320
So what happened is that minus one used to be the method to actually say there's no header the library

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,180
is changed so we switch it over to none run that again no harm done.

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,800
So now the column name is called.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
Sure One two three four No.

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,840
So that's useful for the purpose of our for this exercise.

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,250
And basically this shows us that yeah we have the data and we are able to actually resolve the problem

47
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:34,500
of not using the first row of data as our column as our column header right.

48
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,520
Seeing that we don't actually have any column header.

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,680
What we also want is to extend something that inform us of what these columns in important columns of

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,740
data actually meant of course they come with meaning.

51
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:59,240
So I have actually pre populated this cell here and calling in the variable column name column on this

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:07,040
code name several length several with head or Lang header with and also finally the class.

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,320
OK.

54
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,750
So at this point if you don't know what I'm talking about then you probably have not come across the

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,340
Irish data set.

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,960
There is data set is really great introductory data set to help you get familiar with how to make use

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,040
of Python for data analysis using pandas interacting the data pulling into memory for computation for

58
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,430
manipulation to get a really good understanding the Irish dataset is fairly simple it's not complicated.

59
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,620
So a you although you might not know what I'm referring to when I say keep saying the word Iris.

60
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:55,400
So let me come over here and type Iris dataset using our good friend Google.

61
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,510
You can actually go to this the UCI machine learning repository.

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,430
This is actually we obtain the data from the end of Wikipedia.

63
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,140
This Iris flower data set.

64
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,650
There's also Cagle both of these that's fine for the purpose of what we're looking to do right.

65
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,490
So Iris flow data set.

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,170
Officials there said is actually origin introduced by Roland Fisher in 1936.

67
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,600
OK.

68
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,800
So let's flip down here.

69
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,500
Couple of things.

70
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,090
Just wanted to highlight to you Iris that Rosa is this flower.

71
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,870
What color is this.

72
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,940
Looks like this and Virginia looks like this.

73
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,560
So there's actually three types of flowers in the actual data center itself.

74
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,870
How we actually measure them or compare them.

75
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:48,330
Describe the flower itself is you meant you saw before the actual pedal length with and also the simple

76
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,390
language with.

77
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,540
OK so let's come back here the only thing here is that it didn't really describe to you what is simple

78
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,470
What is pedal.

79
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,150
So let's have a look at the Irish Flower said to see if it actually did provide the information.

80
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,980
No it does not.

81
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,710
So we're going to come up with the images and see if we can actually get a little bit more some kind

82
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,790
so has gone in there.

83
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,130
Describe for us.

84
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,590
All right.

85
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,090
Here is some kind soul has already shown us this is what a sport looks like.

86
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,620
This is what a header looks like.

87
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,030
OK great.

88
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,210
This is really what I was looking for.

89
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,350
So we have four measurements the length with the language of both pedal and simple.

90
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,510
And that's where we have the four columns here.

91
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,210
Two described in the last column column them before is to describe the three types of Iris flower set

92
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,720
that we saw earlier.

93
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,650
OK.

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:50,130
So let's run this to store these five column names now that I've stored this and this variable I need

95
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:59,570
to actually tell tenders to rename these column to these names.

96
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,250
OK.

97
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,290
So that's what I do.

98
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,930
Dot DIA dot columns.

99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,470
That's how I access the column.

100
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:13,080
The name itself and replace it and call names run dead and as I run the header again you can see that

101
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,560
the column names now is much more meaningful several laying several with and on and on it goes.

102
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,010
Right I'm going to stop this lesson here.

103
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:30,410
Just a quick summary of what we've gone through here is that we have very quickly at the beginning of

104
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:40,250
it a store the pandas sheep on a map plotted I show you how to extract the actual version that we use

105
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,990
how to read data.

106
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:52,370
Years of we file into a memory how to look at the data inspect it and how to actually change the header

107
00:07:53,150 --> 00:08:02,090
and also how to rename the actual column names and actually converting them or applying that to our

108
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,360
data frame.

109
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:10,610
Last but not least we see for the first time the ARIAs data set so that you actually get familiar with

110
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,600
it and also show you where you can actually access the data either using Google look at Wikipedia or

111
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,770
Cagle or look out the image search within Google itself so that you can actually quickly visualize some

112
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,190
kind so has already visualized that for you.

113
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,120
Of course there are some videos as well but for now this is what we actually want to access for the

114
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,780
purpose of this simple tutorial.

115
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,410
But I'm going to stop right here.

116
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,880
Thank you once again for watching.
