00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,160
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,240
And the session we're going to start digging into understanding convolution and also its neural network

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,780
structure.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,070
This lesson we're going to look at a couple properties of CNN and also how to work with images.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,670
So let's get started.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,050
One of the key characteristics of CNN is that its core local in variance.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,290
Now once did CNN have learned the pattern.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,040
It can recognize it anywhere.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,770
And it's also called a transitional or translational invariant.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,330
And also the other second feature is it is composed of senility and learns spatial hierarchy causal

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,030
patterns.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,060
Now this use an example does fancy words.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,910
The first layer may learn simple patterns such as vertical and horizontal edges.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,330
As we looked at the last lesson the secondly it may learn more complex patterns that are made up of

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,840
features from the first layer.

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,710
This ensure that the CNN then efficiently and doesn't duplicate what was learned before.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,130
So each layer actually picks up different features.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:10,350
Those are the two key properties of CNN and others is that it operates with what's called three dimensional

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,650
tenses are also images.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,180
If you look at it and how it works is that it has height.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,610
The first column or rather the first input is called height followed by the width and channels channels.

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,400
Depends on the input pictures that you provide.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,640
If it's a black and white picture then it's the channel will be equal to one if it's a red green and

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,350
blue images.

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:40,770
So G.B. then the channel will be three in the example that we looked at which is the MLS example it's

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,440
really only black and white.

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,110
The example there is 28 height 28 and with also core 28 by 28.

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,660
The channel is only one because there's no color for that is only one scale or 8 bit which is starts

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,220
which starts from zero and max out at 255 and followed by the actual filter that's being applied to

30
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,180
it is the three by three future also Coke.

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,750
Coke colonel in the previous lesson that we looked at the number of futures that was applied to it was

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,100
thirty two.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:24,920
So as a result of that what comes up idea the end is that it's twenty six by twenty six followed by

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,630
thirty two channels and that's how a few to actually work because there are 32 futures being applied

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:38,700
to the same image the output then must then be 32 futures.

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,890
So what you have now is that the depth has gone from one to now thirty two stick together again I'll

37
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:53,480
show you a picture later so that you can see visually how what it looks like the question then is why

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,020
is it that the output feature is only 26.

39
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:04,430
The reason lies with the future in this situation because we didn't had any numbers around the edges

40
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:14,150
what happened now is that the filter is only three it can go hanging out at the edge so as a result

41
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,070
of that you've lost two columns and also two rows.

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,610
Again I'll show that to you in the picture format so that you can visualize it but if you can actually

43
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:29,900
just walk through that in your mind it's a future of three by three you will that you will always lose

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:41,300
the the the core height or the high for example with and you actually lose all of it minus one The same

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,100
goes with the road.

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,990
Now when you're working with pictures this is a slightly repeat of the previous slide is that there

47
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,990
are few things to be able to bear in mind.

48
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,100
The amnesty mentioned us now was really small is 28 pixels by 28 pixels and there's only one channel

49
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,970
because it is grayscale.

50
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,380
So when you actually multiply 28 by 28 the sixty seven hundred eighty four values that you're looking

51
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,110
at in each of those values range from 0 to 255 because it is grayscale.

52
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:20,150
However if you're working with color images typically they are substantially larger and a simple image

53
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,550
a video image kind of like pixel size a 640 by four a four eighty.

54
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,970
Well not quite is actually a hundred by six hours or this is slightly SPG 640 by 480 in part by three

55
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,250
channels and then suddenly you find that this is nine hundred twenty one thousand six hundred values

56
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,760
here and that substantially in multitudes of scale larger than the seven eighty four values and 640

57
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,740
by forty is not even high at all.

58
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,150
That's not what we call a high resolution picture.

59
00:04:51,470 --> 00:05:00,950
And if you converted it usually the neural network you have fully connect that layer at the end and

60
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:07,610
if you have to fully connect that layer once you have is 640 by 40 by three to the power of two and

61
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,550
you have that guest s astronomical number Kestrel comical astronomical number.

62
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:22,010
And that's why the computational strain on our place on your laptop or your P.C. is really high when

63
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,810
you actually start playing around with pictures let alone videos.

64
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,060
And what I have shown here is that this is an example black and white scale and below here's an example

65
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,050
of a colour scale colour image right.

66
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,330
So when we come back we're going to look at the different layer types and this deconstruct them and

67
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,790
look into them a little bit more details to help you to understand CNN altogether.

68
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,350
Thank you again ones for watching.

69
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,990
I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
