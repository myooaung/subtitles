00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,510
Good to see you here again.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,750
In this slide and lecture I want to cover machine learning workflow.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:20,910
This is one of the key slides that I have to help you in terms of developing a successful and also working

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,900
machine learning model that works for you.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,920
Now the first and foremost is this is one of the most crucial step is to define the problem that you

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,340
are facing and your definition of the problem.

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,610
Define how big a data set you need.

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:50,150
If you do not define your problem properly you may come across a situation whereby you need to collect

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:56,640
a lot of data and the actual training itself will take a long long time.

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,880
I'll just give you an example as to to help you understand and appreciate this point.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,770
If I'm training a neural network to distinguish between cats and dogs and pandas then all I need to

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,680
do is collect datas for these three types of animals.

14
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:23,000
But if I want a neural network model that's able to actually tell or distinguish all the different animals

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,490
in the world.

16
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:34,130
You can very quickly see the scale of the problem and how much work you do need to do and whether it

17
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,960
is.

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,480
Of course there's the secondary context secondary the second considerations that you need to think about

19
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,670
is that why do you need to easily have a neuron network that actually able to distinguish all the animals

20
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,350
into all including animals in the sea and also deep sea as well.

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:59,540
If you put it in that perspective then it might not make any sense to actually pursue that line of of

22
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,240
of model constructions.

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,980
So you need to actually be very clear of the problem that you're actually trying to define here.

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:16,760
If you're just trying to build a model to distinguish cats and dogs for a pet or for a veterinarian

25
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,390
then it's a different story altogether and that that would be a substantially easier model to view and

26
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,860
much faster and to put it into production in a much shorter time as well.

27
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,380
So then lies the key part here is to define your problem your problem definitions what kind of a problem

28
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,170
it is which is the second step.

29
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,100
Is it a binary classification a multi class classification regression clustering or reinforcement learning

30
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:51,270
understanding your problem is crucial on how to to determine what the next step is.

31
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,710
So I also do have the necessary data and is it easy to get hold of these data.

32
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:04,420
Some of these some data and often a lot of data are really expensive and difficult to acquire.

33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,730
Do you have the means to do so if it's for business.

34
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:14,570
Do you know then it may make sense and but you also have to consider other issues such as data privacy

35
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,850
and ethics offered and also a regulatory constrains.

36
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,420
And these are all the things that need to keep in mind.

37
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,890
The next thing is you have to choose a measure of success.

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,600
What kind of success.

39
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,590
Performance measurement or metrics do you use.

40
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,580
Do you use accuracy which is what we have been doing so far or is they are the better means such as

41
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,820
position and recall OCA you see these or apply in different situations.

42
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,310
So those are the things that you need to keep in mind as well.

43
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,160
And the next one is decide on an evaluation protocol hold our validation set or carefully cross validation

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,530
really cover this at length.

45
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,770
So I want to draw that out anymore and the next one is data preparation and pre processing.

46
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,470
The part is also clear.

47
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,750
The fifth one is develop a model that performs better than baseline and the next one.

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,600
Next step Step six is to scale up develop a model that intentionally over fits.

49
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,090
That's when you start to regularize Step 7 and 2 and you'll have a pair of meetings.

50
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,730
So those are the seven steps to two in building machine learning.

51
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,710
And this is a workflow that is as a reference and that's useful.

52
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,310
This is provided by Charlotte and hope that has been useful.

53
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,940
Thank you once again for watching and really appreciate you for following me all along.

54
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,510
This journey.
