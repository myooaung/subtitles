00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.360
Welcome everyone to the course on introduction to convolution or neural networks.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.100
This is a fancy term for basically computer vision.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.370
This is a really exciting cause that's coming up ahead in front of you.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.620
I'm really looking forward to it because there's so much to actually show you in terms of what the state

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.680
of the art technology is able to do right now in terms of the artificial intelligence as well as deep

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:40.210
learning that that can enable you to automate and also expedite your business processes so the underlying

7
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:48.700
technology that can tackle this computer vision problem really is core convolution or neural networks.

8
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.030
So let's dive into a deep outline and have a look at what we are going to cover in this course.

9
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.670
So first of all we're going to cover some basic from previous cores which is the neural network.

10
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.750
I'm going to revise some of the key concepts and we're going to dive straight into the motivational

11
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:17.740
example first before we look at the portion on how does computer sorry computer or neural network actually

12
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.410
see what does the computer actually see or how does these deep learning architecture actually see.

13
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.050
And it's clearly not going to be the same as how human visualized things and how we actually make sense

14
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.460
of the world around us.

15
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.230
So we're going to have look at it and get some intuition all of that.

16
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.780
The next portion is that we are going to dive into some of the key underlying architecture which is

17
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.110
understanding convolution which is this portion here followed by training your own CNN followed by some

18
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.690
more advanced concepts such as transfer learning rather than using one that you train yourself.

19
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.260
We can actually make use of some of the state of the art architecture and expedite the process or make

20
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.360
use of what others have.

21
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.990
Have worked on and use it for your specific situation.

22
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.800
You'll be surprised at CNN or deep learning is transferable.

23
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.900
And that's where it's really exciting.

24
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.050
And that saves you tons of time.

25
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.120
And the last two parts is really visualizing network layers.

26
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.860
Once again we'll look at how to how do you actually pubic the layer in terms of what the CNN actually

27
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.950
sees as little bit different from this second portion here.

28
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.110
The second portion here really talks that in-depth a lot about how the so-called different layers work

29
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.870
and the last part here is actually show you how to extract the actual layer itself.

30
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.440
So the first part to shows you what it sees part last second last part just to wrap it up nicely.

31
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.630
I'll teach you how to actually extracts those future or that layer what's in the.

32
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.300
And finally I'm going to wrap up with where to from here.

33
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.710
This is really an introduction course on CNN.

34
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.170
We will cover the architecture on to around 2015 2016.

35
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.110
They are more advanced or rather they are advancements since then.

36
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.960
And those would be in a separate course is just too much to cover within this one course alone.

37
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.050
I really want to actually give you a sense of how CNN actually work and start to build those foundation

38
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.930
for you to actually while start working on projects that they say is useful to you with that let's start

39
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.880
this journey together.

40
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.170
Thank you once again.

41
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.700
And I'm look forward to seeing you in the class.
