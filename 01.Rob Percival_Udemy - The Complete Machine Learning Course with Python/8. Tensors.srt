00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:07,830
In this portion we're going to go into what exactly is a tensor.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:14,260
We need to make Steve walk through this because this is fundamentals to what we do need to know we're

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,460
going to look at a few key concepts and build some foundations before we proceed further.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,770
We've looked at what the neural network the training of it looks like.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:30,400
Nonetheless last question as well as in previous lessons let's build some foundation before we we start

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,510
running.

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,900
So what exactly is tensor.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,540
I've given you some examples here.

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,110
These are all tenses.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,020
OK now some describe it as a container for data.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,390
Some describe it as basically a form of representing data the other way to think of it.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:59,880
Is that it is a form of data type much like integer is a data type array is a data type tensor is actually

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:09,550
a container or a data type that actually by and large most of the time is actually just numerical data.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,640
You may be familiar with matrix would such as a two by two matrix that is actually a tensor.

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:25,220
So let me walk through some example of the different various type of tenses a tensor with 0 0 dimension

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:33,360
tensor is actually called a scalar in the math mathematical world scalar basically is one number.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
Here is an example.

19
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,340
Three is a scalar which is also zero dimension tensor.

20
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:49,660
And if we look talking about vectors it's a one dimension tensor and here's an example of a tensor 3

21
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,590
6.

22
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,050
So that's actually tensor as well.

23
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,850
Except there is one dimension in mathematics we call this a vector.

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,510
What about matrix and the wolf matrix.

25
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,500
It could be two by two could be three by three.

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,900
It could be three by five.

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,920
And that would be what's core.

28
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:19,980
Two dimensional tenses and this shapes has the first column its core number of samples followed by the

29
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:27,240
features and the next one it's the time series data as an example.

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,140
This will be a 3D or three dimensional tensor doesn't really have a mathematical name to go with it.

31
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,440
We just call it 3D.

32
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:44,180
And with this the samples there's timestamps followed by features and for four dimensional tenses it

33
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:51,090
can come in to form and these are typically images it can come in usually the first one is always samples

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,030
followed by height with and channels.

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,030
Occasionally however it can be channels height and width we'll get to that a little bit more when we're

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,300
talking about convolution or neural network.

37
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,840
For now just understand that does exist and the 5 D tenses will be a video.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,750
An example would be a video whereby you have the number of samples followed by the frames.

39
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,570
Okay.

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,070
The individual frames itself followed by either high with channel or channel height with.

41
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:22,880
Okay.

42
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,220
So that's pretty much the example of what's called a tensor.

43
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,350
And basically really as I mentioned is actually a data container.

44
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,060
And by and large most of the time is actually numerical data.

45
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:37,890
Right.

46
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,510
So that's really what I wanted to cover when we come back.

47
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm going to start illustrating some of these in a notebook so that you can actually relate how relate

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,220
this to what it looks like when you are working at in Python.
