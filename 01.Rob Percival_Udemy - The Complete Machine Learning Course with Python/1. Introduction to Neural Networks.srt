00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,170
Welcome to the cause on introduction to neuro networks in this course.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,810
Let me walk through the guideline and the outline with you.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:19,410
This cause we will cover the introduction to the foundations of deep learning and in preparation for

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:28,280
more advanced courses such as computer vision recurring neural network our team and the likes.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,980
Now at the end of this course the learners the students will have a really firm understanding of the

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:44,610
basic concepts of neural networks such as what a neuron is the architecture of neural networks are the

7
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:53,160
nomenclature such as layers nodes feed forward networks back propagation and dropout and many many more

8
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:00,650
I really wanted this cause to actually help you to set the foundation so that when you actually embark

9
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,220
on more advanced neural network architecture you will be able to understand it.

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,530
But this is why this course lies is the foundation to help you to understand really as an entry level

11
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,950
to the world of neural networks.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,790
Now we will provide many examples from really simple artificial neural networks to topics that was covered

13
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,810
in the classical machine learning.

14
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,220
I'll highlight them so that you can compare in terms of the performance.

15
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,930
These classical machine learning is self-contained is provided within this course as well so that you

16
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:46,050
can actually compare and contrast the performance of the two different approaches.

17
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:53,900
Now some of the networks some of the topics that we are covering will be topics such as neural network

18
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:02,420
architectures the actual architecture of the neural network itself the feed forward networks paper location

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:11,300
dropout and also comparing and contrasting artificial neural networks vs. classical machine learning

20
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,030
within.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,060
I'm going to stop here.

22
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,610
Thank you for listening to this introduction.

23
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,300
I'm really excited to get started with the first topic which is what exactly is deep learning.

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,790
I look forward to seeing you in class next.
