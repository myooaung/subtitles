00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.160
All right let's look at another clustering algorithm.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.770
This time is called K Means clustering how K Means clustering works as a analyze and finds patterns

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.540
or clusters within data.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.880
It's based on distance measure.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.090
If you go through with this psychic line documentation is classed as data by trying to separate samples

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.760
in groups of equal variance minimizing criteria known as the inertia or within clusters some of squares.

7
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.350
It does require you to specify the number of clusters.

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
The good thing about it it does a scale really well.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.180
How does this actually work.

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.160
It divides a set of samples into disjoint clusters.

11
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.570
Now each described by the means of the samples in the clusters the means are what we call centroid it's

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.090
not that central is are not points from although they live in the same space.

13
00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.200
So that part's important is just to mean the middle of the score are class of points but it's not a

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.490
point on its own came in the algorithm aims to choose centroid that minimize the inertia or within cluster

15
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.000
sum of squared criterion.

16
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.690
Hence the name k means you have to specify the number of k then and actually calculate the mean.

17
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:28.050
Let's go through these step by step we import from land cluster k means we specify nine classes and

18
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.100
fit the data and perform the prediction and plot it and just visualize that you will notice that it

19
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.630
one it's stated one two three four five six seven eight nine clusters here and of course when you look

20
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.440
at it this way.

21
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
Well some of these clusters are really close to each other.

22
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.990
So 9 might not be the right numbers.

23
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.090
You can also plot using the MLA extend which is the library that a while the package I mentioned earlier

24
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.210
to see how does it actually divide the nine circle clusters.

25
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.520
And you can easily visualize from this of course there are some challenges the global Optima result

26
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.150
may not be achieved the number of clusters must be specified beforehand nobody knows how many clusters

27
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.840
the R's or to force you to have to specify beforehand makes it rather a difficult challenge.

28
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.350
It is also limited to linear Custer boundaries and it can be quite slow for large number of samples

29
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.720
so these are the challenges.

30
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.400
So how do we actually choose the number of clusters and this is where we actually make use of what's

31
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.920
called the elbow method it use intrinsic metrics an example is the within cluster sums or squares error

32
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.630
and cyclone has already provided through K Means which is after you've fitted it and the inertia.

33
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.110
So I say compute this he'll give you the number.

34
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.760
So what we can do is that we can loop through the number of classes one cluster two clusters three.

35
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.240
Basically we specifying the K K is to one case go to two keys to three all the way to case 2 8 and then

36
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:20.360
we can actually save keep a copy of all of the inertia and look at okay if we specify case Group 1 What

37
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:29.420
is the inertia case go to 2 What is the inertia then I'll explain to you how do you actually pick the

38
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.580
number of optimal classes.

39
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.200
So if you look at this how would you pick the way the L method works where you see the kink All right

40
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.570
see that you notice the sharp drop and then a plateau.

41
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.170
So they are essentially what this is actually saying based on the Elbow Method one play is that you

42
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.630
can easily choose D or call K with three that's actually a natural choice.

43
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.890
Second one is for the third one is five before it becomes fairly flat after that.

44
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.920
So one two three four or five of course you can actually inspect it further we know the answer to this

45
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.090
it is five.

46
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.450
But nevertheless when you look at this again Zaman is down answer for three possibly okay maybe there's

47
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.950
definitely one on his own this is potentially you can argue for one on it's on here and these two could

48
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.450
be one could also argue there's four one two three four or five as we can see here right.

49
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.510
So that's really the Elbow Method plotted.

50
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:46.410
And then look for where the kink basically the edge of your elbow another method is what we call silhouette

51
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.730
analysis using a mathematical formula.

52
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.780
How do you actually make use of this.

53
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.660
The value of the silhouette range between minus 1 to 1 cause the 1 indicates that the data point is

54
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.450
very similar to other data points in the class 2 Okay if it's close to minus 1 indicates a data point

55
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.480
it's not similar to the data points in its cluster.

56
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:15.030
So let's import the matrix closely with score and then we look through once again range ranges this

57
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.540
time wrong from 2 to aid you can see basically use the silhouette score and calculate the difference

58
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:30.140
between X and the label with itself and finally plot that now how do you interpret this or make choices

59
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.800
based on low analysis.

60
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.030
This portion here this pic before it drops is at the 4 or 5.

61
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.740
So essentially that's how you actually pick using the so-called fluid analysis method.

62
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.280
The third and last method is called the mean shift.

63
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.980
This will actually identify the so core number of clusters and recommend the number of classes for you

64
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.800
those that we talked about beforehand.

65
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:08.100
Be the silhouette be the have a mind meld don't be at the elbow method or the silhouette analysis you

66
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.670
actually have to perform that decision yourself whereas for men shift it is non parametric you will

67
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.440
identify it for you.

68
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.400
All right.

69
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.260
So let's do this okay.

70
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.270
Couple things we need to do.

71
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.500
We do need to import mischief then we have to estimate and estimate bandwidth.

72
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:35.430
We also need the import cycle so to do this we perform the instantiation okay of the estimate bandwidth

73
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.920
and then we also instantiate the mean shift.

74
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.430
Okay.

75
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.470
And the followed by looking at the cluster centres and then printed or all

76
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.700
okay.

77
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.920
So this is what's specified as the centers of the cluster the x and y axis of them.

78
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.280
What we can do follow this is that we can print a number of clusters in input data.

79
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.620
It recommends 5.

80
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:14.560
We can actually visualize this and see that one two three four five is what's recommended by the mean

81
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.010
shift algorithm.

82
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.230
How does it work.

83
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.230
It identify a central location by these following so core.

84
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.680
You can call it algorithm but let me just walk through that with you.

85
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.420
So for each data point it identifies a window around it then it's followed by calculating centroid and

86
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.380
then it update the central location.

87
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:46.570
It continue to update this window as meaning expanding it and it keeps shifting the centroid the means

88
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:53.470
towards the peak of each clusters so it's shifted the live computer values shift to the right it computes

89
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.740
a value so it lends to actually identify where the mean is.

90
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:05.080
So this is what you call by mean shifting and to identify where the center is.

91
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.260
So we'll keep doing this until the centroid no longer moved at all.

92
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:19.730
A pretty neat algorithm at that and it seems to be able to identify this really well with five centers.

93
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:26.980
It doesn't always work that way although I did for this case the centers are really distinctive so it

94
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.990
actually picked it up very well and sometimes it fails.

95
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.070
Not all three methods worked.

96
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.980
So sometimes you have to use all three just to easily use one to confirm the other one is correct.

97
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.100
That gives you some confidence as well.

98
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.410
But that I'm going to stop here.

99
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:49.810
Thank you once again for watching this lesson on clustering and the three different methods of identifying

100
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.080
the center.

101
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.380
The three are the Elbow Method the silhouette and analysis and also the mean shift.

102
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.690
Thank you once again for watching.
