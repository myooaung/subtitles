00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,960
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,610
And this section of the video we're going to go in to deal different later times of the convolution

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,980
all neural network.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,910
So there are a few types of listed them here for your reference.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,790
It starts from convolution all and carries its called Con D.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,630
And then you have your activation layer sometimes the activation function used is rare Lou.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,770
They are also a few other types as well.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,270
We'll look into that.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:44,280
There is the pulling layer the common pulling layers used is either Max pulling or average pulling and

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,520
you have your fully connected layer.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,520
These are typically two wants to end before the so-called output.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,900
They are two are the layered types.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:03,300
Technically these are not really lay at times they are more computational that operation that has been

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,990
conducted.

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:10,620
So they're not typically counted as layers but nevertheless I put it there so that as you come across

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,590
them you won't be surprise.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,690
These are batch normalization and also drop out.

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:19,530
Right.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,320
So let's look at an example of a CNN architecture.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,550
If you look at this you have your typical input followed by convolution or layer 2D and then makes porting

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:40,380
layer followed by another convolution 2D layer and then another Max pulling layer followed by another

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,820
convolution to the plus two layers of fully connected layer.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,130
And finally the output.

24
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,430
Let's dive into these one by one we will start with input.

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,220
Now this is a typical example of an image.

26
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,880
This is a little bit contrived.

27
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,710
It's 10 by 10 pixel with a depth of one.

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:13,330
So this is the example of a grayscale or black and white picture but with grayscale the grayscale range

29
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,060
from 0 2 to 5 5 in Python.

30
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,060
In other words 256 value to it.

31
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:28,060
Now the high care is 10 pixels the width is 10 pixels the numbers there designate the so-called intensity

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,050
of the grayscale.

33
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,930
Let me just illustrate as an example.

34
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,020
We looked at this and in our previous lesson let me zoom in.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,130
You will notice that there are numbers that comes with each of these cell here.

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,980
As you move along

37
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,500
let me zoom over.

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:50,940
OK.

39
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,250
As you move your mouse along some reason is not following.

40
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,980
OK.

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:05,970
As you move along you notice that adequately checks the number each of these is a pixel each pixel has

42
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,730
a number.

43
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:15,610
That number designate or represent the actual value determines the actual the intensity of the grayscale

44
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,930
of the picture.

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,030
So this is a black and white or grayscale picture.

46
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:30,190
Why here as you can see is a small number Black is actually images some reason there is actually a delay

47
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,850
here.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,680
OK let's refresh that zoom out OK.

49
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,500
There you go.

50
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,810
Seems that when you zoom in it doesn't work so well.

51
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,760
Black is a small number.

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,240
Client is 60.

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,150
Closer and closer to 255.

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,750
So the larger number the closer it is to highlight the darker it is the lower the number the closer

55
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,710
it is to black.

56
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,090
Right.

57
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,330
So that's really what I wanted to highlight to you.

58
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,720
If you can imagine this is a little bit like the features on the machine learning.

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,330
So these are what we actually feed into the neural network every picture you feed into the neural network

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,520
and the neural network will actually start to decipher these so-called characteristics distinctive edges

61
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,480
and the characteristics of each of these input image.

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,380
Now this is an example of a picture that has color.

63
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,770
It consists of three channels to R G and B channel.

64
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,210
And if you look at this this one two three that is also represented as depth.

65
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:45,620
Again this is to a 10 by 10 pixels picture except the difference now is that you have three channels.

66
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:55,740
Now each channel represent each of the R G or B and the value determines the intensity of the red the

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,810
green and blue.

68
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,760
And when you combine them it gives you a different color.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,430
So that's really how the three layers or three channel actually work.

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:15,770
So you can pay attention to this picture here you can see is ten by 10 followed by three three layers

71
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,730
deep.

72
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:23,680
So this is a typical example of an image color image.

73
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,210
Let's move into Max pulling.

74
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,720
So I convolution to these operations so we're looking at convolution to the operation now.

75
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:42,120
And now what we will do is that I think it's best that we cover this we will move into convolution to

76
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,450
these layers in the next video.

77
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,680
Thank you for watching.
