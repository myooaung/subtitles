Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.150
Good to see you here again.

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.600
I mentioned that in the last video you can save your model and I've shown you how you can save it.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.850
In this lesson I want to cover.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.100
How do you load your model again.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:25.170
Carers have a very simple method to know your model you from carers models you import load models this

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.230
little simple package and you just use load models provide the file name and equal basically start into

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.060
whatever you want to call your model.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.070
In this case I call it model.

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.720
You can call it something else if you like.

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.290
You can call it CNN or anything else and that's it.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.800
And when you print the model summary you get or receive exactly the same the model that you've train

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.230
with the exact weights as well.

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:00.190
So you can see provided the pictures and obtain influences or prediction with the image that you provide

15
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.060
to it.

16
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.020
And that's really how powerful it is.

17
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.910
And the file that we used to create in terms of the model is right here.

18
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.390
Cats and Dogs dot page five.

19
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.850
That's pretty much it.

20
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.940
That's how easy it is to load your model.

21
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.150
I just want to walk that through with you and thank you once again for watching.
