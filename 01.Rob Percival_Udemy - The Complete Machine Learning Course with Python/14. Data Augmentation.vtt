00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.980
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.340
We're going to look at the data mutation.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.100
We talked about this so.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.480
I want to show you some randomly generated examples of data on contagion to so that you can actually

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.030
get a good idea of how it works.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.530
So these are the line of code that we used earlier and I just wanted to highlight that we used this

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.860
earlier and we're going to move on now just to see what it looks like.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.970
OK.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.420
So from carers we import Image and we're gonna use one specific file called data and in the folder Sara

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:45.060
Zee C source of visualization and I'm using that to J pack for the purpose of this exercise.

11
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.550
We're loading the image and the target size one to eight by one to it original pictures not 1 2 8 by

12
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.070
1 2 8 in terms of size.

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.620
I just want to again this line of code is here a few lines of code here is just showing the image is

14
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.500
1 2 8 by 1 2 8 in terms of the size it's been reduced to that size.

15
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.750
And the next thing we need to do in order to manipulate this is that we need to convert our image to

16
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.800
array and reshape it to 128 by 128 in front.

17
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.080
It's one sample at the end is two channels.

18
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.360
Okay.

19
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.360
And basically the next thing is we look through our batch.

20
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.700
Okay look through our flow so data again is what we defined earlier which is the data Gen here is the

21
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.930
image data generated.

22
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.170
And now every time we're drawing batch 1 meaning only one picture being drawn out and we plot the picture.

23
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.600
Okay.

24
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.440
So after we've gotten eight pictures and take a break.

25
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.160
I mean just basically stopped the whole thing.

26
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.650
So this is recorded.

27
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.220
This is our original picture.

28
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.570
Notice that has been flipped has been shared.

29
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.040
Okay.

30
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.980
So that's really the data that's been augmented or generated by using this generator.

31
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.650
So play around with it every time is likely to be a bit different because it is randomly generated and

32
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.800
that's the basic idea of this data in flow here.

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.070
So it allows you to create a whole lot of data or data augmentation is the technique and allowed the

34
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.540
allow the CNN to see something different every time to force it to learn the general feature and that's

35
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.750
it.

36
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.710
That's really what I wanted to cover so that you can actually have a little code for you to play with

37
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.380
to basically learn what or how the data augmentation is done and get some intuition out of it.

38
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.160
Well then thank you once again from watching.
