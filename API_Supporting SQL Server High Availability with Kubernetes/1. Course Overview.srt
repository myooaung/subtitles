Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,830
I'm Michael Otey, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,530
SQL Server High Availability with Kubernetes.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,340
I'm a former SQL Server MVP, Technical Director for SQL Server Magazine,

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,840
and the author of many technical books and hundreds of articles and webcasts.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,060
Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration as

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,290
many organizations are looking to move their legacy applications into a

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,250
containerized and microservices architecture.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,900
One of the challenges of running SQL Server in a container is

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,430
the need to continue to provide high availability for those

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,840
SQL Server database services.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,970
In this course,

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,970
we're going to learn how you can deploy SQL Server on

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,070
Kubernetes and have Kubernetes provide high availability

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,590
for a two‑node SQL Server cluster,

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,020
as well as a three‑node SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,800
Some of the main topics that we'll cover include what you need to know

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,450
about running SQL Server in a container, the YAML and kubectl commands for

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,100
creating Kubernetes deployments with SQL Server, the T‑SQL commands for

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,720
creating clusterless availability groups,

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,040
as well as some vital troubleshooting tips and techniques.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,540
By the end of this course,

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,870
you'll know how to create and manage SQL Server clusters and

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,960
availability groups on Kubernetes. Before beginning the course,

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,380
you should have a working knowledge of SQL Server and know the

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,340
basics of running containers using Docker.

27
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,280
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to run SQL

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:46,000
Server on Kubernetes with the SQL Server High Availability with Kubernetes course here, at Pluralsight.
