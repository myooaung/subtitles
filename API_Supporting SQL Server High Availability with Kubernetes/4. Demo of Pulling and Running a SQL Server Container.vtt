00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.150
So let's have a quick look at pulling and running a

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.840
Docker container with SQL Server in it.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.030
Here is the Docker Hub,

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.420
and I've brought up the Microsoft SQL Server image that's in that hub.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.300
Let's have a quick look at the contents here,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.110
and you can see that it has a few featured tags.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.330
Each tag is a different version image out there.

8
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.540
It has a few examples on how to run the image with

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.280
different images used in each example and also how to run

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.040
an executable for the container.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.250
It has a few examples here about how you use the

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.940
different environment variables.

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.060
And then, if we scroll to the bottom,

14
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.170
you can see a list of all of the different images that are out

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.160
there that are available for us to pull and run,

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.910
and you can see it ranges from 2019,

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.340
the latest image, through several versions of SQL Server 2017.

18
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.470
If we go to the top here,

19
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.820
you can see there's an actual example of the pull command,

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.870
which conveniently allows us to just cut and paste from it.

21
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.120
So let's click that command, and we've copied it.

22
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.110
Now let's go over to our terminal window.

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.440
Now, let's go ahead and paste in that pull command.

24
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.470
And here you can see I have actually previously pulled down the image

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.120
to save us the time that it takes to download it.

26
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.910
So that image is in our local repository. If we want

27
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.740
to see the images that are present,

28
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.710
we can run docker image ls. That lists the different Docker

29
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.040
images that are out on this system. Next,

30
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.840
if we want to go ahead and run one of the images,

31
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.280
we can use the docker run command, and there's the docker run

32
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.990
command. And you can see how quickly our image starts.

33
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.280
So now our image is out there, and it's currently running.

34
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.190
If we want to see the running images,

35
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.280
we can use the docker ps command, and you can see there's our image

36
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.140
running, and it was created basically 2 seconds ago.

37
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.870
Now, if we want to connect into our image,

38
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.270
remember,

39
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.960
we're running on the host, and the image is running detached, we

40
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.650
can start Azure Data Studio, and we'll make a connection into

41
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.440
this running SQL Server instance.

42
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.760
So we'll add a connection. And in the Server, we're going to use localhost.

43
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.480
And remember,

44
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.330
we can use this because we mapped 1433, port 1433, from the

45
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.010
localhost to our running container that will pass this

46
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.000
connection in on that port, port 1433.

47
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.920
We'll give it the password that we used when we issued the docker run command.

48
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.570
And here we've done a connection into our running container. And at present,

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.350
you can see there is probably not a lot of databases out there.

50
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.930
There are the system databases, but no user databases.

51
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.290
We could restore a database to the system if we wanted to do this,

52
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.300
or we could attach to a volume that had databases on it and then

53
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.600
attach those databases to our container. If we want to go ahead and

54
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.070
query this, we can use File, New Query option,

55
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.220
which will bring up a query window, and we can enter a basic SQL command.

56
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.600
And here we'll run select @@VERSION, and hit the button to

57
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.000
run it, and here you can see the results where we've connected into SQL Server 2019.
