1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,810
Okay, let's wrap up with a few tips.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,420
First of all, you know when you're using your containers,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,680
avoid using the latest tag when you're deploying your

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,020
containers with your Kubernetes deployments.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,020
The latest tag doesn't allow you to very easily specify

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,300
which container version you're using.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,240
This can make it harder to roll back, harder to track what you're doing.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,320
Next, in your YAML files, don't use tabs and be aware of indentation.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,160
YAML is very sensitive to indentation,

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,560
and simple mistakes that are virtually invisible can cause you headaches,

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,110
so be aware of indentations, and tabs are not going to be your friend there.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,540
Next, when you're using SQL Server in a Kubernetes pod,

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,640
be sure to set a memory limit for those SQL Server containers.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,780
By default,

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,940
SQL Server will use about 80% of the memory that's available in the base OS.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,300
In many situations, this can cause SQL Server to use too much memory,

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,640
and Kubernetes will evict the pod for going over its resource constraints.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,540
So be sure to set memory limits for your SQL Server containers.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,130
Next,

20
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,210
using a Kubernetes‑aware editor like Visual Studio Code can save you some time.

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,420
It can help you with IntelliSense‑types of things while you're creating

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,470
the code and also help you track that indentation issue.

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,860
And then, if you're looking for some more additional information,

24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,640
Pluralsight offers a number of courses out here

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,540
that you might want to look into.

26
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,070
If you're not familiar with Kubernetes, the Getting Started with

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,160
Kubernetes course by Nigel Poulton is a good place to start.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,270
If you want more in depth information about Kubernetes,

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,190
the Managing Kubernetes API Server and Pods and Managing

30
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,730
Kubernetes Controllers and Deployments by Anthony Nocentino is

31
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,770
a great place to get more information.

32
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,140
If you want more information about SQL Server availability groups,

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,850
you might want to look into the course Administering Microsoft SQL Server

34
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,180
Availability Groups by Russ Thomas. Plus, along with that,

35
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,230
this course will contain some additional resources that you can look into

36
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,820
to find more information about running SQL Server on Kubernetes, as well as

37
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,540
SQL Server availability groups on Kubernetes.

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,510
In addition,

39
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,050
the resources for this course include all the scripts

40
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,810
that we've run in the different modules.

41
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,570
Altogether, there's 40+ scripts.

42
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,210
They've all been tested, and they work with Azure Kubernetes Services.

43
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,830
If you use a different Kubernetes provider, the only things that

44
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,320
need to be changed are the scripts that create the clusters and the

45
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,940
YAML that specifies the storage classes.

46
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,280
These need to match the requirements of the provider you're using.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,780
The rest of the scripts will run as is.

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,310
This kind of cross‑platform support is one of the big

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,530
advantages that Kubernetes offers.

50
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,340
And remember, as you run these on your own,

51
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:06,000
you can also use your own customized SQL Server images, which can be pre‑configured, and they can have your own data as well.
