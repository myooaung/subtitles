00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.030
In the previous module,

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.390
you got an introduction to running SQL Server on Kubernetes, you saw how

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.010
to deploy SQL Server pods on Kubernetes, and you saw how Kubernetes can

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.820
provide high availability to those SQL Server instances. In this module,

5
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.550
we're going to build on all those concepts that you learned in the last

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.790
module by deploying a SQL Server availability group on a 3‑node

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.240
Kubernetes cluster.

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.850
Like the previous example, Kubernetes will be providing the high

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.800
availability for the SQL Server instances.

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.260
The SQL Server availability group will be providing scale‑out

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.780
processing for the SQL Server databases. To do this, we're going to

12
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
take all those basics you learned about in the last module about

13
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.900
writing a single SQL Server instance and expand them to cover this

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.740
3‑node SQL Server availability group.

15
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.240
Alright,

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.730
so let's go ahead and dig into the nitty‑gritty details of running

17
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.240
SQL Server availability groups on Kubernetes.

18
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.700
First, in case you're not that familiar with SQL Server availability groups,

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.170
you'll get an overview of SQL Server availability groups.

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.950
You'll learn about the capabilities of SQL Server Always On availability groups,

21
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.050
as well as how they work.

22
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.740
Next,

23
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.380
you'll get an overview of our SQL Server

24
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.510
availability groups on Kubernetes solution.

25
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.440
You'll learn about the Kubernetes requirements that are required to

26
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.820
deploy a 3‑node SQL Server availability group,

27
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.230
as well as what's different about using availability groups on Kubernetes.

28
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.370
You'll also learn about some of the requirements, as well as

29
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.910
some of the limitations for this solution.

30
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.140
Then, in the next section,

31
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.440
we'll start diving into the technical details of implementing the solution.

32
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.100
Here, you'll see how to create a 3‑node cluster on Azure Kubernetes

33
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.540
Services that can run a SQL Server availability group, as well as how

34
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.320
to connect and manage that cluster using your local kubectl. You'll see

35
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.680
how to create external storage and persistent volume claims for the

36
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.620
three SQL Server nodes.

37
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.080
Then, we'll dig into the Kubernetes deployments for the primary

38
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.760
and secondary availability group replicas.

39
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.140
You'll see some new concepts here like assigning a hostname,

40
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.610
using memory limitations, and opening multiple ports in the load balancer.

41
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.580
After the cluster is built,

42
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.340
you'll see how to deploy a SQL Server availability group on top of that

43
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.480
cluster. You'll see how to create the primary replica,

44
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210
the two secondary replicas,

45
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.740
as well as how to seed and load the database that's

46
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.840
part of the availability group.

47
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.590
Then, you'll see how you can connect to that SQL Server

48
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.000
availability group using Microsoft Azure Studio,

49
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.300
as well as how you can manage the availability group using

50
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.860
SQL Server Management Studio. Here, we'll connect to the

51
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.940
SQL Server availability group,

52
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.330
demonstrate the scale‑out capabilities, and perform a failover.

53
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.000
As you can see, there's a lot to cover in this module, so let's go ahead and jump into it.
