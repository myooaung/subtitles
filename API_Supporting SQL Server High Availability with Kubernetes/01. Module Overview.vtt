00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.310
One thing we're all too familiar with is Murphy's law that

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.980
states if something can go wrong it will.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.970
And this is especially true if you're working in new technology areas.

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.030
In this module,

5
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.040
we're going to cover some tips and troubleshooting techniques

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.560
that you can use if you run into trouble with your own

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.040
Kubernetes and SQL Server deployments.

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.740
We'll look into some of the basic Kubernetes troubleshooting areas,

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
and then we'll also look into some of the particular areas that you need to

10
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.520
pay attention to if you're running SQL Server on Kubernetes.

11
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.640
First, we're going to talk about updating your tools.

12
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.880
While it may not seem all that important,

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.310
making sure you're running the most recent versions of

14
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.010
your tools can help you avoid problems,

15
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.870
as well as making your work a bit more efficient if

16
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.540
you're using the right tools.

17
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.070
Next,

18
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.900
we're going to look at some of the ways you can find out important

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.070
information about your deployments using kubectl.

20
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.990
While parts of this may be a bit basic if you're familiar with Kubernetes,

21
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.900
if you're a SQL Server person and you don't have a lot of Kubernetes

22
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.890
background this could help save you a lot of time and effort.

23
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.250
Next,

24
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.930
we're going to look at using some of the interactive tools to

25
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.920
get information about your Kubernetes deployments and perform

26
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.980
some basic troubleshooting actions.

27
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.290
Here, you'll look at seeing how to use the Kubernetes

28
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.560
dashboard to get information about your clusters,

29
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.300
as well as how to start an interactive shell on your pods using kubectl exec.

30
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.840
Next, we're going to switch gears,

31
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.880
and we're going to look at some of the SQL Server connection and

32
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.760
availability group issues that you might run into. Again, if you have a

33
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.920
lot of SQL Server experience some of this may be a bit basic, but if

34
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.360
you're a Kubernetes person it could help make your troubleshooting for

35
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.180
SQL Server quite a bit faster.

36
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.780
Finally,

37
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.000
we're going to wrap up with some tips and some sources for some additional information.
