1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
Okay, now let's go ahead and actually put these tools to work.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,310
First, we're going to go ahead and create a two‑node Kubernetes cluster.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,240
Next, we're going to connect kubectl to that cluster.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,540
Then, we're going to go ahead and list the cluster nodes with kubectl.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,830
Okay, let's see it.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,680
Here's the Ubuntu system that has previously installed the Azure CLI,

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,740
as well as kubectl.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,170
The window you see here is Visual Studio Code,

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,140
which is a free cross‑platform editing tool from Microsoft.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,840
I should point out you certainly don't need to use Microsoft code

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,710
in order to follow the examples in this module.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,350
I used it because it's an effective presentation tool that can

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,950
show you both the code that's going to be run,

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,040
as well as the results all in the same window.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,030
On the left‑hand side of this window,

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,560
you can see a number of shell scripts that I created to make

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,280
the demos in this module easier to follow,

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,560
as well as easier to replicate.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,190
Of course,

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,960
the demo scripts are all part of the resources that accompany this course.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,440
So first, let's open the first script that creates the Kubernetes cluster.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,740
You can see the Azure CLI commands at the top to first log

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,680
into the cluster using the az login command.

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,560
Next,

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,550
the az group command creates a resource group that will

26
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,440
contain all our Kubernetes objects.

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:32,520
Then the az aks create command is used to actually create the cluster on AKS.

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,340
The command specifies the resource group name that we just created,

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,640
the name of the Kubernetes cluster where you can see here it's SQLCL.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,000
The cluster will consist of two nodes,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,440
and we're going to be using the smaller nodes size of Standard_B2s.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,130
Let's go ahead and execute it. First,

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:06,940
as the az login command runs, we're going to sign in to Azure.

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,620
At this point,

35
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,410
it's going ahead and creating the resource group and then creating our cluster.

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,640
It takes it just a few minutes to do this.

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,440
Okay, that took it about 3 to 4 minutes to create that.

38
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,640
Now let's go ahead and we're going to get the credentials for this cluster.

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,550
And here's the code that does that.

40
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,030
You can see we're going to be running the az aks get‑credentials command,

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,910
supplying it our resource group name and our cluster name.

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,110
It has prompted us that we've already done this before, and it finds

43
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,260
some of the preconfigurations in our kubectl file.

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,830
We're going to go ahead and overwrite them. And now it

45
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,440
has done that, and we've gone ahead,

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,540
and we've got the credentials for our cluster.

47
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Next,

48
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,390
let's go ahead and we're going to take a look at the code

49
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,960
to go ahead and retrieve the nodes for the cluster, and

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,160
that is in this script file.

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,540
You can see it will be running the kubectl get nodes command.

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,730
So let's go ahead and do that.

53
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,810
And at this point,

54
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,860
you can see we now have two different nodes running out there, and these

55
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,630
things are both ready to have a pod deployed to them.

56
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,080
You might note at this point there are no pods deployed

57
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,000
because we haven't created a pod yet. But we're going to do that in just a few minutes.
