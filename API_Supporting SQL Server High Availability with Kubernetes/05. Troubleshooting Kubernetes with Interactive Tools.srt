00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,160
A couple of other tools that can provide some useful information are

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,680
the Kubernetes dashboard and then kubectl exec.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,610
The Kubernetes dashboard is a webâ€‘based portal that provides

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,540
information about your Kubernetes deployment.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,620
To run this on AKS, you need to grant some AKS cluster binding permissions.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,680
Otherwise,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,400
you can basically run this portal by opening a connection using kubectl proxy

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,680
and then opening your web browser to the following URL This is going to

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,460
launch the dashboard that you can see to the right,

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,290
and you'll see this in action in just a second.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,310
Next, you can use kubectl exec to execute commands in the pod's container.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,830
You can use these commands to view the status of the

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,220
container or to make changes to it.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,380
With kubectl exec, you pass in the it parameter,

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,540
which indicates that you're running this command interactively.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,920
And then you pass in the pod name followed by two dashes.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,130
After the dashes, then you pass in the actual command you want to run.

18
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,040
Here you can see this example would run the top command in our container.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,310
Even more useful from a troubleshooting point of view is

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,700
the ability to open an interactive shell on the containers

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,970
that are running in your pods.

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,650
To open an interactive shell, you can use the kubectl exec command,

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,980
like you see here.

24
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,290
Again, you pass it that it flag, indicating that this is going to be interactive,

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,460
then the pod name, followed by two dashes,

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,820
then the command.

27
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,800
Only in this case, the command will be a /bin/bash,

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,640
which is going to run the bash shell on the container.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,940
Then, you can go ahead and run your standard bash commands in

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:52,000
that container to explore the container, navigate through it, or to make changes to it.
