00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.430
Well, that wraps up this module.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.130
In it,

3
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.840
we learned about some places where you can pick up some

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.480
important Kubernetes background information,

5
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.140
and we also learned about using the Azure Kubernetes Service as a platform.

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.070
We learned about using YAML and kubectl to create and manage

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.640
your SQL Server Kubernetes deployments.

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.180
We looked at the specific step‑by‑step, and how you can actually

9
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.510
deploy SQL Server in a two‑node Kubernetes cluster.

10
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.920
Then, we looked at connecting to the SQL Server pod in that cluster,

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.000
and performing a failover, and showing exactly how Kubernetes can provide high availability for SQL Server.
