00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,910
Now we have a better picture of the nature of Git, let's recap.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,350
A Git repository is a bunch of objects linked to each other in a graph.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,240
They can be commits, blobs, trees,

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,840
or annotated tags that we'll talk about a bit more later.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,440
Then there are branches that are references to a commit.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,700
And finally, there is HEAD.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,610
That's also a reference, but there is only one of it,

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,840
and it marks our current position in the graph.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,980
It's usually pointing to a branch,

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,540
but it could also be detached and pointing directly to a commit.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,750
Then there are a few rules.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,540
First, the current branch tracks new commits.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,220
So if you create a new commit by saying git commit or git merge,

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,540
for example, then the current branch moves to the new commit.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,940
If you are in detached HEAD state, then HEAD itself moves to the new commit.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,020
Second rule, your working directory is updated automatically.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,190
When you move to another commit, typically with git switch or git checkout,

18
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,430
Git replaces the content of your working directory with the

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,840
content that can be reached from that commit.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,630
Three, any commit, blob, or tree that cannot be reached from either branch,

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,840
HEAD, or a tag is considered dead and can be garbage collected.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,040
And essentially, this is the whole thing.

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,840
Branches, merges, moving back and forth in time,

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,940
it all boils down to these simple rules.

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,240
Okay, I know what you're thinking now.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,540
What about rebases?

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, rebases. We'll talk about them in the next module.
