Hello from Paolo Perrotta.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,070
Welcome to How Git Works.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,420
Git is really powerful, but let's be honest; it's also kind of scary.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,170
I remember after using Git for months I still found it confusing. But

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,770
there came a moment when suddenly it all made sense.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,980
Suddenly Git clicked for me.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,960
And that moment was when I understood how Git works from the ground up.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,520
If you understand how it works then using it becomes so much easier.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,990
That's why this training exists.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,340
I want to demystify Git for you.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,490
You won't just learn a bunch of commands here like in a regular

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,130
training. Instead, you'll see how and why those commands work, and

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,940
once you know that, you'll be able to learn any Git command with

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,390
confidence. This is, well, in theory, this is an advanced training.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,400
But even if you are a beginner at Git, I think that you should watch this.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,850
I would say this is a course for everybody who uses Git, as long

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,420
as you know the basics, how to stage files,

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,650
commit them, switch branches.

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,850
If you know those fundamental operations,

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,290
then it doesn't matter whether you've been using Git for 2 weeks or 2 years.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,840
I think you'll find something useful in this training.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:30,000
So let's dive in. It's going to be fun.
