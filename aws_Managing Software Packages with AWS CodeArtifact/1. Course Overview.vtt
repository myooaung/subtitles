00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.100
Hello, and welcome to my course on Managing Software Packages with

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.950
AWS CodeArtifact. First, a little bit about me.

3
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.640
My name's Joshua Edwards.

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.610
I am the vice president of engineering at a blockchain and

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.540
cryptocurrencyâ€‘focused business, and I have previously been the head of DevOps.

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.360
This course is going to be focused on Amazon Web Services CodeArtifact.

7
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.910
CodeArtifact is a super powerful software package service from AWS that allows

8
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.040
you to store custom software packages and also public ones.

9
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.680
This course will cover what is CodeArtifact, how to create a CodeArtifact

10
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.690
domain, repository, and work with software packages, the prerequisites

11
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.400
required to make this possible, and finally,

12
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.340
how to monitor and keep your repository secure.

13
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.470
By the end of this course,

14
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.840
you'll be well on your way to becoming a CodeArtifact pro.

15
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.010
But before beginning this course,

16
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.640
you should be familiar with the AWS CLI and npm.

17
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.370
It is not necessary to be well versed in these services, as I

18
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.930
walk you through using them. From here,

19
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.560
you should feel comfortable diving into further AWS DevOps

20
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.740
services with courses on CodeBuild and CodePipeline.

21
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.470
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn all about

22
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:54.000
CodeArtifact with my Managing Software Packages with AWS CodeArtifact course, at Pluralsight.
