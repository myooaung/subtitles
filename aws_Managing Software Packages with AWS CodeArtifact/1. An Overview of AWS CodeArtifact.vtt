00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.460
Hello, and welcome to my course on Managing Software Packages with

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.560
AWS CodeArtifact. First, a little bit about me.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.960
My name is Joshua Edwards.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.650
I am the vice president of engineering at a blockchain and

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.540
cryptocurrency‑focused business, and I have previously been the head of DevOps.

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.260
Throughout my career, I have worked in the GovCloud space,

7
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.460
the startup space, and also for tier 1 consultancies.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.090
This has allowed me to deliver fully automated and

9
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.440
secure environments inside of AWS.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.700
If you like my course, have any questions, or you just want to say hi,

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.890
please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter.

12
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.440
My username is @JoshuaGEdwards.

13
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.040
Okay, let's jump right in.

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.940
This course is going to be focused on Amazon Web Services' CodeArtifact.

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.670
We're going to look at an overview of CodeArtifact,

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.800
including the access permissions needed.

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.840
We're going to look at setting up CodeArtifact and, finally,

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.840
working with packages inside of CodeArtifact.

19
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.540
Sounds exciting, right?

20
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.240
Let's get started.

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.440
Okay, so let's delve into what is AWS CodeArtifact.

22
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.180
So let's take a look at an overview of this service and

23
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.100
some of the prerequisites required to use in this service.

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.040
So what is AWS CodeArtifact?

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.350
CodeArtifact is a managed AWS service that can manage

26
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.940
software packages in a repository.

27
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.460
You can manage and control the artifacts you need to use in your

28
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.940
software. Its underlying infrastructure auto scales of how many packages

29
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.230
you add, and it can be fully encrypted using KMS,

30
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.140
either AWS managed or managed by yourself.

31
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.880
The core components of AWS CodeArtifact are the

32
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.290
repository, which stores all of the packages,

33
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.040
the versions, and the revisions.

34
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.340
A package is a bundle of software.

35
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.740
A repository is accessed by the domain.

36
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.200
A domain is the highest level component of a repository, and it is what is

37
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.520
going to be used to group the repositories together.

38
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.140
And finally, another cool feature is an upstream repository.

39
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.510
You can create a repo that inherits its parents packages. An upstream

40
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.040
repository can also pass the packages from over public repositories.

41
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.850
How awesome! AWS CodeArtifact can contain a multitude of package

42
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.940
repositories from npm and yon for JavaScript,

43
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.450
pip and twine for Python, and Maven and Gradle for Java, amongst some others.

44
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.610
You can choose which one you want or all of them as

45
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.940
CodeArtifact is a polyglot repository.

46
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.520
That means that they can all live together.

47
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.740
Now, working with multiple package repositories can be easier than ever.

48
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.440
So cool! So, who should use CodeArtifact?

49
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.440
AWS CodeArtifact is aimed at AWS developers,

50
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.040
DevOps engineers, architects, and system administrators.

51
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.740
But this does not mean that it's solely exclusive to the people in those jobs.

52
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.860
CodeArtifact is for anyone who wants to use it, so I recommend programmers,

53
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.710
engineers, and anyone who wants to know more just take a look.

54
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.340
It's a fantastic service to use in your software architectures.

55
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.080
Okay,

56
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.390
let's take a look at some of the CodeArtifact security features that are in

57
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.740
place that are going to keep your information secure.

58
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.120
CodeArtifact is in the boundaries of the AWS shared responsibility model,

59
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.260
which means that you know AWS has your utmost security desires at

60
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.750
heart and will allow you to manage your data securely.

61
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.130
It supports encryption at rest so your software packages are safe.

62
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.900
CodeArtifact uses TLS connections for all of its endpoints so you know

63
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.840
that all of your information in transit is encrypted.

64
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.460
All of the AWS CodeArtifact actions are monitored through AWS CloudTrail.

65
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.030
This means you can see how all of the actions happened and by who

66
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.440
as CloudTrail logs all of the API calls. For incident management,

67
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.290
you can use AWS CloudWatch events to detect and react to changes

68
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.930
in the CodeArtifact state, such as if a software package was added.

69
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.960
CodeArtifact has bean audited and vetted by third‑party auditors such

70
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:49.000
a SOC, PCI, FedRAMP, HIPAA, and many more, so you know that you're getting a highly secure service to use.
