1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,630
Now that we've created a new Web driver instance class, let's make changes to our base page.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,320
So the first change I'm going to make to this base page is to move this line here.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,570
So this is where we define in the Web driver driver variable.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:25,010
But in our previous lecture where we created the new class, we've defined this line here, which is

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,890
using Fred local web driver driver, meaning that the base page line is no longer required.

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,350
So I'm going to delete it like so.

7
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,420
The next change I need to make is to describe the method.

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,250
So this is where I was originally initialized in the driver.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,900
But as we're also doing this in this new web driver instance class.

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,390
It means that we no longer need this code here.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,850
So I am going to delete most of the content but keep the get driver method.

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,730
And the reason I'm keeping the get driver method is because when it's called, I now want to return.

13
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,250
Using the new Web driver instance class.

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,450
If I add a dot here, you'll see that I've got access to different methods.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,290
So I'm going to use the get driver method and add a semicolon at the end.

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,780
So when this method is called in the bass page class, it will now return web driver, instant stock

17
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:39,380
get driver, which is a method that belongs to the new web driver instance class.

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,760
Here.

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,720
And as we know, this new method uses to create driver to initialize the driver that we require.

20
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:59,210
So we also have public stream get you are l and we don't need to make any changes to this particular

21
00:01:59,210 --> 00:01:59,630
method.

22
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,550
But if I go further down, we have a method called take snapshot which is responsible for taking a screenshot

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,830
when our test comes across an error.

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,490
But we can see that there's an error underneath driver.

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,650
And this is because I've deleted the driver variable at the top.

26
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,990
And so I need to make a change here.

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,740
So instead of the driver being defined, I'm instead going to call get driver.

28
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,910
Which is a method defined here.

29
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,590
So that's all the changes we need to make.

30
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,910
The only other method we have is time stamp, which simply generates a date and time that we use when

31
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,310
we create the screenshot file here.

32
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,970
So now I've made those changes to my base page.

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,290
I'm going to save it.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,400
And in the next lecture, we'll start looking at the next class that we need to amend.
