1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,080
So this lecture is an introduction to the job of programming language.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,689
So what is Java?

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,610
Java is the one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,570
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, and it was released in the year

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,950
1995.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,740
It is intended to let application developers at once and run anywhere, meaning that for compile Java

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,860
code it can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for RE compilation.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,620
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine regardless

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,840
of the underlying computer architecture.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,620
Java is now owned by Oracle.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,110
After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in the year 2009 and 2010.

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,680
Java boasts over 3 billion devices, uses it, and Java is also an object orientated programming language.

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,740
So the core principles of Java are it must be simple, object orientated and familiar.

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:20,000
It must be robust and secure, it must be architectural neutral and portable.

15
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:27,770
It must execute with high performance and it must be interpreted, threaded and dynamic.

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,630
The Java uses.

17
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:39,840
The Java is used for mobile applications, desktop Google applications, web based applications, enterprise

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,320
applications, scientific applications, gaming applications, big data technologies, business applications,

19
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,270
distributed applications, and also cloud based applications.

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:02,100
And to some people's surprise, the Android mobile operating system actually uses Java at its core.

21
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:14,810
So some ideas used by Java developers on Eclipse Intelligence, Apache, NetBeans Code Envy and a popular

22
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,660
idea used by students is called Blue J.

23
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,650
And the reason why students use Bluejay is because it gives you a visual explanation of how objects

24
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,940
interact with each other.

25
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,090
So I hope this lecture was a good introduction to the Java programming language.

26
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,060
Let's now move on to the next subject.
