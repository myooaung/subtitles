00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.320
In this lecture we take a look at constructors.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.940
So I'm only going to explain this using slides because I'll show an example of this in the next couple

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.630
of lectures.

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.960
So what is a constructor?

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.640
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.510
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.290
It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

8
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.550
It will be named identical to the class name as shown on Public House.

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.600
So if we look at the diagram on the right hand side, I have a class called House and it has free private

10
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.130
fields of type integer and beyond doors.

11
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.220
So number doors.

12
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.150
Number windows.

13
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.470
A Number bedrooms.

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.820
The area highlighted with the red rectangle is the constructor.

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.790
So note the name Public House.

16
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.090
So it's identical to the class name and in the brackets on provide in parameters.

17
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.550
So int so integer doors, integer integer windows and integer bedrooms.

18
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.330
I'm name using in those parameters to assign the fields the values.

19
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.680
So if I want an object creation, pass an integer doors to equal five, an integer windows four and

20
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.580
bedrooms free.

21
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.000
Five will be assigned to the numbers.

22
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.050
Door filled.

23
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.060
This will equal five.

24
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.740
This will equal four.

25
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.770
And it's equal.

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.300
Free.

27
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.890
So.

28
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.040
So.

29
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.340
Wait.

30
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.700
How we can set attributes, object creation.

31
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.380
So initializing an object.

32
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.860
When we initialize an object using the class blueprint, blueprint will be asked to provide values by

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.760
the constructor.

34
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.870
The values provided will be unique to the object instance.

35
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.700
So please don't worry if this is confusing.

36
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.710
I'll give a demonstration in the objects and classes lectures which are up next.

37
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.340
Just for now.

38
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.380
Remember, a constructor allows us to set values for object attributes.
