00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.200
In this lecture, we take a look at pop ups and learn how to handle them using selenium.

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.980
So what are pop ups?

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.000
They are small Internet windows that pop up on your screen.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.260
They are often used by advertisers to get your attention.

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.280
Although many browsers now block them with pop up blockers, many banking websites used to use them

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.540
for security reasons.

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.580
But it is quite rare these days.

8
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.890
Pop ups are also used to trick users into downloading viruses.

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.650
So how do we handle pop ups?

10
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.160
We need to use a driver to get window handles method to identify all of the open windows.

11
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.810
We then need to iterate through the windows to find the child window.

12
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.830
Once identified, we need to switch to the child window using the switch to and the Windows method.

13
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.680
Once focus has been shifted to the child window, we can then close it.

14
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.140
We then switched back to the main window.

15
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.340
So if you look to the diagram on the right hand side, selenium focus starts with the master window,

16
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.620
which is the main window.

17
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.360
The main screen for the main browser window.

18
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.060
Then when we click a pop up, a child window appears.

19
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.790
And so what we need to do is then shift focus from the master window to the child window.

20
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.140
And then once we finish through the child window, we switch back to the master window.

21
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.000
So in this lecture you're going to learn a number of new concepts, and it can be quite challenging

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.290
to understand it first.

23
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.650
But hopefully when I explain it, it will make more sense.

24
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.990
So let's try it out.

25
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.080
So before we begin, I'm going to take you through the test.

26
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.910
So I'm going to open up Chrome and go to automation tested no code UK.

27
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.670
I am going to click on the pop up alerts link which will take you to this page.

28
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.300
So we're going to be tested using this pop up.

29
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.250
And if I click on this button, you'll see that a pop up window appears.

30
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.290
So what we need to do is get selenium to go to this page and then we need to switch to this window in

31
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.430
order to interact with it.

32
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.190
So in our case, we're going to close it and then we're going to switch focus back to the main window.

33
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.820
So I'm going to close this for now and then minimize this.

34
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.710
And it's going to open up Eclipse and I'm simply going to copy and paste the class in the last lecture.

35
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.400
So I'm going to call this new class L 11 for lecture 11 and I'm going to give it a name of pop ups like

36
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.680
so and click okay.

37
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.930
And I'm going to double click that class and it would open up for you.

38
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.800
And I am going to remove all the code from the last lecture.

39
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.630
We don't need up to the driver.

40
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.440
Don't get method.

41
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.380
So the first thing I'm going to do is go back to my browser and get that URL and I'm going to copy it

42
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.270
and paste it here.

43
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.020
Like say so that will bring selenium to the pop up page.

44
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.390
And the next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to find a locator for the trigger pop up button.

45
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.710
So I'm going to inspect the page, click on the, inspect the tool, and then click on the button.

46
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.770
And then if I go to run the box velocity, you'll see I've been given some selectors here.

47
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.250
So I am just going to pick the second one.

48
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.980
And I'm going to go back to the code and I'm going to write Driver the Fine Elements by C.S. Lewis that

49
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.150
I can provide that, select a value and then use dot click like so.

50
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.930
So the next thing I'm going to do.

51
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.090
So this is going to click this button like so and it's going to open up the pop up.

52
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.230
So I need to.

53
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.030
Get the windows handles.

54
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.269
So the windows handles are identifiers that identify the different windows that are open.

55
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.060
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a new string.

56
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.070
So I'm going to call this string.

57
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.860
Main window.

58
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.620
Equals.

59
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.430
Driver.

60
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.630
Dot.

61
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.660
Get window.

62
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.890
Handle like so.

63
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.230
And a semicolon.

64
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.880
So all this is doing is I've created a new stream called Main Window and the driver is going to get

65
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.710
the window handler I.D. of the window that currently has focus of.

66
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.990
So at the time of the test, he's going to have focus of this main window here.

67
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.830
And so it's going to get the window handler I.D., which is a unique I.D. for this particular window.

68
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.700
And it's going to store that I.D. in its main window variable.

69
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.110
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use something called a set.

70
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.880
And a set in Java is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.

71
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.250
So just think of somewhere where I'm going to store a number of values.

72
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.690
So to use a set in Java you need to write set a capital S.

73
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.710
And in pointed brackets and inside these pointy brackets, it's going to be the data type they'll want

74
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.280
to store.

75
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.550
So in my case, I'm going to be storing strings.

76
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.530
And then I need to give this sets a name so I'm going to call it handles like so.

77
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:09.990
And it's going to equal driver dot get handles so you notices two similar methods here get window handle

78
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.150
and get with the high dos.

79
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.910
So I'm going to be using the while mode.

80
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.390
Yes.

81
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.540
And what that's going to do is going to trawl through all the open windows.

82
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.280
And it's going to get the point of that window and it's going to store it in this so called handle's.

83
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.740
So I need to add a semicolon at the end of it.

84
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.850
And you see that says got an error underneath it.

85
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.820
And the reason for that is we need to import it.

86
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.540
So import one import set java dot util.

87
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.690
And once we do that, the error goes away.

88
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.790
So the next thing I'm going to use is something called an iterator.

89
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.640
And I'd use that by writing i tr at0 the capital on.

90
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.760
And again, I need to state the dates of type.

91
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.120
So I'm going to be iterating through string values.

92
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.460
I need to give it a name.

93
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.110
So I'm going to call this Iterate.

94
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.100
And it's going to equal.

95
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.770
The set so handles.

96
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.290
And then I'm going to use a method called dot iterator.

97
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.400
So iterator is an object that can be used to look for a collection.

98
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:40.930
So if I hover over it, I too need to import this but make sure to import the java util one and the

99
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.890
error should go away.

100
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.550
So just to explain this iterator again, so the iterator is an object that could be used to loop for

101
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.210
a collection.

102
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:58.870
And I've created a an object called Iterate and the Equals the handles, which is the name of my sets

103
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:05.950
that holds the windows handles and is going to iterate through each one of those values in the collection.

104
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.120
So the next thing I'm going to do is use a while loop.

105
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.580
So I'm going to explain while loops in more detail in the Java section of this course.

106
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.260
But for now, I'm just going to write some code and then I'm going to explain it to you.

107
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.690
So I'm going to write while and then in brackets I'm going to use its right object.

108
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:41.340
And I'm going to use a has next method and I'm going to add some curly brackets.

109
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:50.450
And inside the wall loop, I'm going to create a new string variable and I'm going to call it child.

110
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.110
Equals its right.

111
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.640
Thoughts next.

112
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.160
Like so.

113
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.220
So just to explain what I'm doing here so far.

114
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:17.160
So I'm using a while loop and while it will keep on looking at this condition and if it's true, it

115
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.080
will run the code of inside the brackets.

116
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:25.050
So what I'm using inside the loop is I'm using the it's right object.

117
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.270
To see if it's got a next value.

118
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:38.130
So if we remember the it's fate object is iterating through the collection called handles and that handles

119
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:44.730
is stored in all to get windows said it's right object is get in the windows handle during each pass

120
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:51.210
and what this is saying is if it's got a next value so it's not at the end of the collection, then

121
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.470
run the code inside.

122
00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:02.280
So what I'm doing inside the actual loop is I've created a string called Child and it's going to store

123
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.540
the value of the next handle, the next window handle.

124
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:15.820
So hopefully this will make more sense as I start typing more code and once I demonstrate it to you.

125
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.110
So the next thing I'm going to use is an if statement.

126
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.580
So if statement takes to see if a condition is true.

127
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.030
So what I'm going to write here is main window.

128
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:40.170
Dot equals I'm going to use equals ignore case so it doesn't care about the case of the string.

129
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.520
And inside those brackets, I'm going to use the child variable.

130
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.990
And then I'm going to open and have another open and close in brackets.

131
00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:01.290
And inside the if statement I'm going to write driver dots switch to.

132
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.410
Dot window.

133
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:13.620
And then I'm going to provide the value of that child so that there is being taken from this.

134
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.880
So I am going to name a type of semicolon.

135
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.300
And then the last action is I'm going to use a command called Driver Dot Close.

136
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.600
And what that will do is it will close the tab.

137
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:37.090
So let me explain once more just just to get you familiar what I'm trying to do here.

138
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:45.550
So the first thing I'm doing is creating a string called Main Window and what the driver does, it goes

139
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.830
and finds the window handler I.D. for the main window two opens in selenium.

140
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.880
I'm then using a set which is a collection in Java and I'm calling that set handles.

141
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:05.710
And what is going to be stored in these handles is the driver is going to get the window handles all

142
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:12.400
at the sides of all the open windows, and it's going to store it in this collection called Handles

143
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:20.890
on End, use the iterator so it's right to object, which is then going to go through the collection

144
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:26.230
of those window handles and it's going to go through each one, one at a time.

145
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:36.270
So then what I use is a wall loop, and this one loop is checking to see if this iterator is at the

146
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.450
end of the collection or if there's a next value.

147
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:47.520
So if there's a next value, it then runs the code of inside the loop and inside the loop.

148
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:54.990
I've created a new string variable called Child and it's going to store the next value.

149
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.090
So the next available window value.

150
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:07.330
So you think about it, if I'm on the main Windows Handle page and there is a another window open which

151
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:13.890
is the child window, then it's going to store that child window ID in this child variable.

152
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:22.440
So once that child I.D. has been stored, so the windows handle for the child has been stored here.

153
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.870
I'm using an if statement.

154
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.810
So what is doing is is if the main window.

155
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.120
So if this window here equals ignore case child.

156
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.300
Then it runs this code.

157
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.820
But that's not what we wanted to do.

158
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.840
What we wanted to do is reverse that.

159
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:53.570
So if not, so if the main window doesn't equal the child I.D., then it runs this code.

160
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.110
Okay.

161
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.340
Because if I didn't have that not symbol down.

162
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:04.810
What you're saying is if the main window I.D. equals the same as the child one, then Monday's code,

163
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:10.450
which doesn't make sense because I'm already on the main window and I'm trying to identify the child

164
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:10.900
window.

165
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.920
But by placing a not sign there.

166
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:21.420
Now it's saying if the main window doesn't equal the child hand wide, they then run this code.

167
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:30.790
And we have inside this code itself, the driver is using the switch two methods to switch window focus

168
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.500
to the child window.

169
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.370
And then driver then closes that window.

170
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.090
So we need to do one other thing here.

171
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:50.980
So once we come out of these brackets, we need to then switch focus back to the to the main window.

172
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.200
And we can do that by doing driver dots.

173
00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:01.210
Switch to that window and a main window.

174
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:12.850
So once I have switched to the child window and closed it and then want to bring selenium is focus back

175
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.990
to the main window.

176
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.570
So I hope that makes sense.

177
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:25.010
But let me say this class for now, and I'm going to slow the test down as well, just so you can see

178
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.670
what's happening.

179
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.830
So I'm going to use some fretless leaps

180
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.670
of, say, free seconds just to slow it down a bit so you can see.

181
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:43.230
And I think I might add one more here as well.

182
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.510
So I'm going to say this class and I'm going to run it.

183
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.520
And let's see what happens.

184
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.090
So did you see what just happened there?

185
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.610
So what that just did that test was it came and clicked this pop up.

186
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:17.750
And then it switched selenium focus using the windows handle to the child window which is this pop up.

187
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:26.190
And then what it did in this child window, it closed it and then it brought the focus back to this

188
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:26.970
main page.

189
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:35.070
So, for example, if I was to then click the trigger alert button after that test.

190
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:45.900
So if I wrote here, for example, driver dot find elements by this selector and within that CSA selector

191
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.440
if it.

192
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.230
Get the locater for this alert.

193
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.230
And pace it here and do not click.

194
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.030
So I'm going to prove to you that the focus was moved back.

195
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.240
So first, let me take away this line to show you.

196
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:10.000
If I try clicking on the alert when I haven't got the main focus on the window, they won't be able

197
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.839
to find this element.

198
00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:14.800
So I'm going to say this class, I'm on it again.

199
00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.710
So it's gone to the page at the pop up window.

200
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:31.080
It's going to close it and now it should trigger the alert, but it hasn't done that.

201
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:36.710
And the reason why is because I've commented out the line that switches the focus back to this main

202
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.220
page.

203
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.470
And if we look here.

204
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.110
It says no such window.

205
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.120
Target window already closed.

206
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.220
So still focused on the pop up window.

207
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:57.340
But if I uncomment this line which brings the driver focus back to the main window, it should then

208
00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.810
be able to find this button.

209
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.310
So let's try that.

210
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.340
And you can see they click the alert.

211
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.750
That time said, of course, the focus switched back to the main page.

212
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.730
It was able to locate the trigger alert button.

213
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.760
So I can appreciate that was quite a bit that we went through in this lecture and it can be quite difficult

214
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.170
to understand that first.

215
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:44.020
But the main concept I want you to take away from this is that when we use pop ups, we need to be we

216
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:49.180
need to switch focus of selenium to that pop up window in order to interact with it.

217
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.320
And once we finish interacting with the pop up window, we need to switch focus back to the main page.

218
00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.360
So the way we do that is through the windows handler ideas.

219
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.340
And those ideas are unique guides for each open window.

220
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.940
So don't worry if you're quite still quite confused about what we've just been through.

221
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.800
But the concept is the main thing I want you to take away from this.

222
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:24.250
And as we progress through discourse and as we go through the Java section, you'll become more familiar

223
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:30.280
with some of the concepts taught in here, especially to wow and if it while loop and if statements.

224
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.330
So thanks again for watching and I look forward to speaking to you in the next lecture.
