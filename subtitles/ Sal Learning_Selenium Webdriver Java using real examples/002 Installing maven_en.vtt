00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.030
In this lecture, I'm going to show you how to download and install Maven.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:13.050
So before I begin, I'm going to open up command prompt and I'm going to type the command m the end

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.160
dash version and click enter and you can see that that is not a recognized command.

4
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.990
So I'm going to close this for now and then open up Chrome and I'm going to type here maven download.

5
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.310
And the first link should be to Maven at Apache dot org.

6
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.750
If I click that link, you should be presented with the following page.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.050
So this is the section where the files are available and I'm going to be using the binary zip archive

8
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.560
section.

9
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.820
So at the time of this record in MAVEN, free .8.1 is the latest version.

10
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.970
So I am going to click this link to begin the download once has downloaded.

11
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.840
If I click this folder, it should open up in Windows Explorer.

12
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.390
So I'm going to place this in my resources folder.

13
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.390
So I'm going to simply drag it over.

14
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.150
Mike.

15
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.480
So.

16
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.640
And then I'm going to close both of these.

17
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.290
The next thing I need to do is go to my windows environment variables.

18
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.790
So if I type EMV, you'll see I'm giving an option to the environment variables and it should present

19
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.810
the following panel.

20
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.410
I'm going to click the environment variable variable button and you should see something similar to

21
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.370
what's on my screen.

22
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.860
So I need to add a new variable for the top section and I need to add a new path in my path variable

23
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.280
as well.

24
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.190
So I'm going to start with the top section and click the new button and variable name.

25
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.420
I'm going to give its maven underscore home.

26
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.530
And then I'm going to click the variable value textbox and then click browse directory.

27
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.030
So I need to find my resources folder.

28
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.660
And I am going to highlight the Apache Maven folder like so and then click.

29
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.200
Okay.

30
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.830
And then I'm going to click okay again.

31
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.820
So in my system variable section, I am going to highlight the path and I'm going to click edit.

32
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.350
And you should see something similar to what's on my screen.

33
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.090
So here I'm going to click the new button and I'm going to click Browse.

34
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.680
And I need to find my resources folder again.

35
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.860
But this time I need to expand the Apache Maven folder to highlight the bin folder.

36
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.470
And then I'm going to click okay.

37
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.030
And then okay again.

38
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.880
So that's how two variables set.

39
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.580
So if I click okay and close this, if I open up command prompt again.

40
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.020
And that same command envy.

41
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.220
And that version.

42
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.550
You can see that it now returns Apache Maven, which confirms installation was a success.

43
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.180
I hope this was useful and thank you for watching.
