1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,970
So now that we've created our base page, let's look at ways of how we can improve it.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,830
So I'm going to copy the base page of Last Lecture calling this new 105 base page.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,840
So if we look at this code here, we're set in a properties object and a file input stream object.

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,360
But notice how we're also doing the exact same in the get URL method.

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,940
So we are repeating ourselves, which doesn't comply with the dry principle.

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,040
So a better way to handle this is to use a constructor.

7
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,440
To use a constructor you write public and then you simply pass the class name.

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,450
Then round brackets and an open and close embrace.

9
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,390
I'm then going to cut this code here and I'm going to paste it like so.

10
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,820
And if I add a froze declaration.

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,580
That era will not go away.

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,150
But notice how I've got an error here and I've got an error here.

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,590
And the reason for that is this method cannot see this prop object because it belongs to the constructor.

14
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,080
So instead I need to create a field which is going to be private.

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,360
Properties prop.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,980
And that means I can they can get rid of this properties reference.

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,100
Because this will now reference the filled.

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,340
By doing so.

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,440
Notice how those errors go away.

20
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,460
And that's because this method can see this field.

21
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,560
So if I go to the early section I'm in, I'm going to remove these lines here like so.

22
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,370
And again, this method will reference prop, which is this filled here.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,300
So if I save this place, page.

24
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,880
And if I copy and paste also for login.

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,250
Change in two Ellsbury.

26
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,630
Five Logan.

27
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,500
So this is just a simple test.

28
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,960
So I need to change this to.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,100
There are five.

30
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,080
Notice.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,130
How is now an error?

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,090
And if a hover over the error, it says add constructor.

33
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,690
So if I click that, it adds the following code.

34
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:40,100
And so what is code does is that because we extend in the zero five base page and because there is a

35
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,410
constructor in that base page.

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,070
It then instructs us to use another constructor.

37
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,560
So this is the same as this class is name, but it uses the super keyword.

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,960
So that super keyword means to call the constructor in the class extends to.

39
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,600
So by adding that super keyword and saving.

40
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,400
That era now goes away.

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,270
And if I was to now run this log in test.

42
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,610
You should see that the test runs perfectly fine.

43
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,030
So that proves that by using a constructor in the base page to handle the properties of file input stream

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,050
and in amending our test the code a super constructor, we was able to access the configuration file

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,080
to get the driver and get URL.

46
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,880
So the second improvement I'd like to show you is to amend these direct ripoffs.

47
00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:00,320
So currently I'm using a directory path using the C drive and a file structure that is specific to my

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,360
local machine.

49
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,440
The problem with this is that if I was to export this project and someone was to import it using a new

50
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,350
machine, they would have a different local directory structure than what I'd have.

51
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,890
And so the project wouldn't work.

52
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,770
Now to get around this issue, we can use a system.

53
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,490
Properties set in soda instead uses the highest level of the project as a starting point.

54
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,020
So let me demonstrate this to you by amending the following stream.

55
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,770
So I'm going to use a system.

56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,890
Dot get property.

57
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,900
And inside the brackets I'm going to enter user dot dot r.

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,870
So what this set in here means is that it should start at the highest level of the project structure.

59
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,640
So I'm then going to add a plus sign.

60
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,330
And then double quotes.

61
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:12,530
Now inside these double quotes, I'm going to enter the remaining path to point to this file.

62
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,610
So if I right click this file and go to properties.

63
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:24,830
If we look at the highest level of the project Explorer, the starting point is a intro folder and that

64
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,820
is mentioned here.

65
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,470
So I am going to get the remain remain in part the path to the file name I acquire.

66
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,840
And I'm going to copy that.

67
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,450
And I'm going to paste it in those double quotes.

68
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,460
So it's very important that you use the same structure that I've used here.

69
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,400
So don't miss, like, the back slashes.

70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,620
Otherwise, you'll get errors at runtime.

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,800
But to very quickly run through this again.

72
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:03,610
This here means to start here and in the plus source, which is this folder.

73
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,270
Section 12, which is this package.

74
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,540
And then it's going to look for this file name, which is this here?

75
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,670
So I'm going to finish this by entering a closed bracket, which is a closing bracket from this one

76
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:20,970
here.

77
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,410
And then I'm going to enter a semicolon.

78
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,110
And because I no longer require this line, I am going to delete it.

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,550
So to prove this works, I'm going to save this.

80
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,570
And I'm going to run the l05 login test again.

81
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,270
A right click in selected run as a test.

82
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:58,020
And you can see that it was able to get the URL and it was able to access those values in the conflict

83
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,080
properties file.

84
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,060
So that's proven.

85
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,160
This approach works.

86
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:11,160
So we can use a similar approach to handle the parts to the drivers.

87
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:21,060
So the issue is currently that I'm storing these drivers on my local desktop under a driver v one folder.

88
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:30,330
So what we can do is import these drivers into our project and then reference those drivers using the

89
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:30,810
system.

90
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,740
Get properties.

91
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,790
So I am going to right click the source folder, select new and Select Package, and I'm going to give

92
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,480
it a package name of drivers.

93
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,650
So that drivers folder is now up here.

94
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:58,340
So I am going to go back to my resources, drive av1 folder and I'm going to copy that and I'm going

95
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,470
to pass those into the driver package and then you'll see them listed here.

96
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,220
So now these drivers belong to our project.

97
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,080
We can use system, get properties and then point to those drivers.

98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,980
So I am going to make some room here and I am going to use system.

99
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,790
Dot get.

100
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,650
Property.

101
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,370
And again I'm going to use user thought.

102
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,000
These are.

103
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,030
And then I'm going to use plus.

104
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,240
And in in double quotes.

105
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,250
I am then going to reference.

106
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,020
So we're pointing to this.

107
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,050
If I right click and go to properties on the chrome driver, see.

108
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,340
So this is a starting point.

109
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,420
So I am going to copy the remainder like so.

110
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,920
And I'm going to paste it in the double quotes.

111
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:09,680
And then I need to finish that with a closing bracket and a semicolon, and I'm no longer required as

112
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:09,980
here.

113
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:18,960
So I'm just going to copy same line and replace the get co-driver.

114
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,190
But changes from Chrome driver.

115
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,080
To Gecko driver.

116
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,900
And the same for the edge driver.

117
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,110
So instead of chrome driver, it's going to be.

118
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,450
Edge driver.

119
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,330
Then I'm going to say this face page.

120
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,120
And then I'm going to try run in the zero five, log in, test again.

121
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,020
To see if that works.

122
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,180
And you can see the Chrome browser opened.

123
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,880
And the test worked perfectly fine.

124
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,150
And that was using.

125
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:05,140
The system, get property to code, use a directory which is available here, then it looks at source

126
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,150
drivers and then it uses used chrome driver XY.

127
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:18,380
So now if I exported this and someone else imported it using their own machine, the project would work

128
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,980
fine because where we use in system get property user directory, it will be consistent and the same

129
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,080
if they imported this project.

130
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,130
So those are the two improvements I wanted to demonstrate to you.

131
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:41,250
So this is an improved code in a practice where we've used a constructor to handle and prevent the need

132
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,570
for repetitive code.

133
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:50,970
And we've also used a user, the air system property, to point to the highest level of the project,

134
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,210
which will allow our project to be exported and work with our issues on another machine.

135
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,500
Thank you for watching.
