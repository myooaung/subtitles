1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,719
In this lecture, we're going to construct our second test.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,510
So let me walk you through what will be tested.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,050
So we're going to go to the automation test and website, began to locate the test or linking click

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,379
it, which will take us to the store home page.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,580
I want to click the first product, which is the Hummingbird Printed T-shirt.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,330
I want to change the size to medium and I want to increase the quantity to two and then add it to the

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:27,840
cards.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,250
Yes.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,490
Wouldn't show you the summary page.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,060
But this time I want to select the continue shopping button.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,970
You still keep him?

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,620
Keep me on the product's page.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,710
So I want to then click the home page link.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,230
And when I'm taken back to the test or home page, I want to click the hummingbird printed sweater,

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,670
which is product to.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,900
For this product.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,670
I simply want to add it's a cart.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,710
And then I want to proceed to checkout.

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,050
And this will take me to the shopping cart page.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:08,320
So the main functionality I want to test here is deleting a product and ensuring the total amount reduces

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,600
to the products that remain in my cart.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,140
So take a note at the total which currently reads 7396.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,920
I then want to delete the sweater from my basket.

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,800
And notice how the total has reduced, which is the price of two T-shirts and the shipping fee.

25
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:37,930
So when I delete the sweater, I want to then check the total price to make sure it matches 4524, which

26
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,250
is the amount I'm expecting.

27
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,160
And I can do that using a assertion.

28
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,270
So this is going to be our test.

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,430
So I'm going to go to Eclipse and start writing this test in Eclipse.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,650
Under the source test java folder.

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,980
I'm going to right click the automation test in package, select new and select class and I'm going

32
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:07,290
to give this class the name of at the move item basket test and then click finish.

33
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,600
The first thing we need to do is extend the base page.

34
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,460
This wouldn't allow me to import it.

35
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,520
And in the error would appear here.

36
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,020
And this is because we need to add the constructor that uses a super keyword.

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,710
We didn't need to add methods for these before test and after test annotations so we can simply open

38
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,220
up our class from last lecture, which is the order complete test.

39
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,420
And we could simply copy DS into our new class.

40
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,670
So next we need to start writing our test method.

41
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,840
So I am going to use the ATS test notation and I'm going to give this method the name of public void.

42
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,140
Add the new item.

43
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,280
So on needs need to import the test notation and that error would then go away.

44
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,100
So remember, our test, at least for the beginning, is very similar to the order.

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,970
Complete test.

46
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:20,340
So in this autocomplete test, we go into the automation tested website and we locate in the get a test

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,020
or link and we click on it.

48
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,620
On the shop home page.

49
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,410
We then get in product one and click on it and this will take us to the Shop Products page.

50
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,520
Then we going to select our options.

51
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,950
So we're going to set the size to medium.

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,740
We can to increase the quantity by one.

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,890
And then we're going to add those products to our cart.

54
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,890
Next, the shopping content panel page appears in this test.

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,800
What we did was we click the get check up button.

56
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,010
So the key difference in our new test is that we want to select the continue shopping button.

57
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,790
So up to this point, our tests are the same.

58
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,010
So I am going to copy.

59
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,340
From that point upwards like so.

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,270
And I'm going to paste it.

61
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,720
Into our new class.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,920
So now I'm going to use this C panel object.

63
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,010
And if I select if I write thoughts and then write it, you'll see that I've got an option to get continue

64
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,490
shop in button so that will get the locator to the continue shop in button on the shop content panel

65
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,060
page.

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,930
So I am going to use that and I'm going to use a click command to click it.

67
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,480
On doing so.

68
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,420
This will take us back to this product's page.

69
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:55,270
So as I'm on the product's page, I need to reuse the shop product object as this object is for the

70
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,410
shop product page.

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,890
So I am going to copy this.

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
And my thoughts.

73
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,350
And so I'm going to find what I need to find is the home page link.

74
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,470
So this home page link is this link here.

75
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,510
And when I click it, it will take me back to the store homepage.

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,230
So I am going to write here.

77
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,910
Dot get home page link and I want to click it.

78
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,330
So as I'm on the shop home page, I need to reuse the shop home object.

79
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,250
So I am going to use this and then right gets.

80
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,190
But this time I want to get product too.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,150
And that product too is this sweater product here?

82
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,530
When clicked, it would then take me to the sweater product page.

83
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,900
So on get product to I want to click product to.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,260
And then what I need to do this time is use the shock product object again.

85
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,170
As that shop product object is for the products page.

86
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,960
So I don't want to click any options here.

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,270
I just want to simply add it to Cart.

88
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,910
So I'm going to write thoughts, get add to cart.

89
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,910
And then I want to click that button.

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,600
Once I have done that.

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,580
You'll see that the content page appears again.

92
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,000
But this time I want to click proceed to check out.

93
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,040
So I'm going to go back to the clips and I'm going to reuse the C panel object.

94
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:45,310
And I'm going to try to get and you can see I've got get check out button for which I would want to

95
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,730
click.

96
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,190
On doing so they should then take me to the basket shopping cart page like so.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,640
So at this point, I'm going to save this class and I'm going to try running it to see if it works,

98
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,570
as we would expect.

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,470
So although that test executed really quickly, you should have seen the tests functioned as we expected.

100
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:29,490
He added The first item it continued shop in it went back to the store, homepage is selected the second

101
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,400
product and then it added the second product to the cards.

102
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,190
And then it took us to the basket page.

103
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,140
So we are now at this point here.

104
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,660
So what I'd like to do next is delete this second item, which is the sweater.

105
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,030
So to do this, I'm going to be using the shopping cart page object.

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,570
And if I double click and open it, you'll see that I've got two locators here which hard to delete.

107
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,710
So delete item one and delete item two.

108
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,150
So these correspond to these two delete icons here.

109
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,370
So we can add more to this page object.

110
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,240
If we wanted to test the deletion of more items.

111
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,550
So I'm going to go back to the add remove item basket test.

112
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,850
And because I haven't used it yet, I'm going to create a new object of the shopping cart page.

113
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:34,190
So I'm going to write a shopping cart and I'm going to call this cart equals new shopping cart and I'm

114
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,780
going to pass the driver object.

115
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,000
On, then need to import the shopping cart.

116
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:45,250
And then we can then use this object to interact with this page here.

117
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,730
So I want to select this delete item for the second product.

118
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,340
So I'm going to use cart dot to get the lead item to.

119
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,130
And I simply want to click it.

120
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,240
This should then delete the item.

121
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,280
Like so.

122
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:15,300
So the next thing I'd want to do is use or check this total price to make sure it matches $45.24.

123
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,900
So here I'm again.

124
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,890
Going to use a cart.

125
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,560
Object don't get.

126
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,900
And if we look down, you'll see I've got a method for get total amounts.

127
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,500
So this total amount is simply.

128
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:40,870
A locator that gets the text or the value of this particular element here so far as to right click this

129
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,590
and inspect it.

130
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,620
And Red Ragnarok philosophy.

131
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,900
You'll see that locator card.

132
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,510
Total value is here.

133
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,050
So I'm going to go back to my new class.

134
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,290
And we obviously get total amount method to get that element for the total.

135
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,920
If I write dots here, you'll see that I've got a number of other methods and the one I'd want to use

136
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,780
is this one called Get Text.

137
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,530
So this all it does is it gets the visible text for the element.

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,150
And now at the end of that line, I'm going to use a semicolon.

139
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:30,440
So what I'm going to do, just for demonstration purposes is that I'm going to use system dots out dot

140
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,610
prints and then.

141
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,100
To print out the value of that element in the console.

142
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:43,370
And then once I demonstrated this to you all, then include use it in an assertion.

143
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,590
So I'm going to save this class and I'm going to run this this class again.

144
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,680
So let's see what gets output into the console.

145
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,220
So if I scroll up.

146
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,690
You can see an amount here.

147
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,460
Butter equals 73, 96.

148
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,090
And what I was expecting was 45, 24.

149
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,020
So what do you think happened here?

150
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:27,530
So what happened is that this code to take the total amount executed before the deletion of the second

151
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,630
item had finished executing.

152
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,760
So how can we resolve this issue?

153
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,100
So what we can do is use a web driver white.

154
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,320
So after I've deleted item two, I'm going to use an explicit white.

155
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,110
So I'm going to write Web.

156
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,220
Driver.

157
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,830
Wait, and I'm going to call you object white.

158
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,750
Equals new web drive up white.

159
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:08,090
And I need to pass the driver object and duration, which I'm going to use 120 milliseconds.

160
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,090
So I need to import web driver weight from selenium.

161
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,950
And at the end of that line, I'm going to add a semicolon.

162
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,770
So now I am going to use that weight object.

163
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,260
And then I'm going to use the until method.

164
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,600
And inside these brackets I'm going to use expected.

165
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,600
Conditions.

166
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,070
Thoughts?

167
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,330
And then I have a number of conditions that I can use.

168
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,750
So I want to use a condition called invisibility of.

169
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,260
So what invisibility of Czechs is that?

170
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,940
It waits until this.

171
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,560
Whatever element I supply is invisible on the page.

172
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,460
So when I click the delete button for the second product, it would only continue, execute, execute

173
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,210
in the test.

174
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,520
Once the visibility of that product is no longer shown on this page.

175
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,170
So I'm going to use that invisibility of.

176
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:26,160
And then inside those inside those brackets, I'm simply going to pass the cards object.

177
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:36,430
Dot get delete item two and that get the item to is simply the method that locates the second delete

178
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,030
icon.

179
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,730
So now if I run this test again, let's see what happens.

180
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,930
And if I scroll up.

181
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,180
You'll see this time the expected amount has been placed in console.

182
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:17,790
So by using this web driver wait, it waited until the second item was deleted and was no longer visible

183
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,240
before it continued to check the next line of code.

184
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,630
Which is to get text.

185
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,260
So I'm going to leave this lecture at this point.

186
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:34,020
And in the next lecture, we're going to add an assertion to ensure that the amount is as we expect.

187
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,550
Thank you for watching.
