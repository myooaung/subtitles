00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,570
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:09,320
In this section we start creating like Project two and we start looking at Excel driven data.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,880
So we are now finished.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,790
Reply Project one And so it makes sense to avoid making further changes to this project so that you

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,920
can refer back to it at a later date.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,690
Will be cop in the life project one framework the intention of using it as a basis for life project

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,050
to.

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,860
This way we avoid having to go through the set up stages and have realistic tests to work from.

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,710
Luckily, Eclipse makes it easy to copy and paste a project using a different name.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,690
So we are going to explore how we can use Excel to pass data into our tests.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,160
This is a variable world scenario, but we may want to use Excel to define variables and then use asset

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,420
values in our tests.

13
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,650
For example, we may have a spreadsheet with test username and password data and we may want to feed

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,310
the username and password combinations in a log in web page.

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:13,420
Luckily this is possible using a Java API named Apache Player and I'd explain more about this in the

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,200
next lecture.

17
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,640
So this is a brief diagram to try and explain what I'm trying to achieve here.

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,300
So we're going to have an Excel spreadsheet containing email address and password combinations, and

19
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,360
then I'm going to create a test class for the log in page.

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,290
When I run this test, I expect to retrieve the data from the Excel spreadsheet, and Selenium web driver

21
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,410
would then pass that data using the browser of our choosing.

22
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,630
So this is an example of the Excel spreadsheet I'll be provided.

23
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,260
So it has a simple email address column and a password column, and then we have sets of email address

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,390
and passwords which we're going to use to pass into the log in page of the store.

25
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,690
So let's create a live project to.

26
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,150
On my screen I have eclipse open and we can see live projects, one, which is all the framework we've

27
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,740
done in the previous lectures.

28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,560
And because we know this project is working and the framework is well designed, it's good to keep it

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,640
in its current state.

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,170
For you to refer back to.

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,230
This is the reason I'm not adding these new sections to Project one and why I'm creating a new life

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,770
project.

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,550
So I'm going to collapse live Project one and I'm going to left click it and on my keyboard I'm going

34
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,210
to press control C and control the to copy and paste it.

35
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,050
You'll see that project name has been provided as Life Project two and I'm going to keep this as is

36
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,160
and click copy.

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,230
This whole Dang Creek Live project, too.

38
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,110
And until it's fully loaded, you may see some errors, but hopefully it will go away in a few seconds.

39
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,310
So Life Project too is a separate project from my project one, but live Project two is a clone of live

40
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,060
projects one.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,320
So we have all design classes from the previous framework.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,030
So this is what we're going to be using from this point.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,650
So now that we've created Life Project to move on to the next lecture.
