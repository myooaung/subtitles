1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,830
So I have lived Project one open in Eclipse and the first step is to download the extent reports dependency

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,300
and add it to our POM file.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:19,680
So I'm going to open up Chrome and in Google I'm going to tie up extent reports and the end and click

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,220
search.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,880
So the first result should be this which is extent reports for selenium.

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,890
Com dot relevant codes.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,340
So if I click this, you should see the following.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,940
But this is an old repository for the developer.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,480
So if I go back again to the results, you'll see that the second one is for com I even stack which

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,920
is their latest repository.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,960
So if I click on this.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,180
And then if I click on this extent reports link, it will show you all the latest versions.

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,360
So at the time of recording this video, version 5.0.8 was the latest.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,670
So I'm just going to select this and I'm going to copy its MAVEN dependency.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,010
If I go back to eclipse and open up my pom file.

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,190
If I go down, you'll see that this is my dependence.

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,850
U.S..

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:23,040
So I'm just going to add this as a last dependency like so and if I can hold control shift and f it

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,480
will reformat the code for you.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,670
So you can see.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,410
Com even stack extend reports 5.0.8.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,350
And if I save this, you'll see that dependency will start downloading and install it in the bottom

23
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,130
right hand corner.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,940
So I'm going to pause this video until that's done.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,440
So now just finished installing.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,210
I'm going to close the poem file.

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,280
I'm now going to create a new class for our extents manager and I'm going to do this under the base

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,860
package.

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,820
So I'm going to right click select new and select class, and I'm going to call this class.

30
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,030
Extent manager.

31
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,560
And then click Finish.

32
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,340
This would end open the class.

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,750
So the first thing I'm going to do is extend the base page.

34
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:16,210
So I'm going to write extends the base page like so.

35
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,160
You see it as an error under extent manager as we need to add the constructor.

36
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,110
So above the constructor, I'm going to start writing some new fields.

37
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,390
So I'm going to write these, and then I'll explain what they do as we come to write in the methods.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:47,280
Public static extent reports and I want to call it extend reports like so.

39
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,520
And at the end of that line, a semicolon.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,330
So if I hover over extent reports, you'll see I'm given an option to import it from extent reports

41
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,010
from com even stack extent reports, which is a dependency that we added.

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,980
So if I select that, the error then goes away.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,320
The second field is going to be public static.

44
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,130
String.

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,070
And I'm going to give this string a name of extent.

46
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,680
Report prefix was semicolon at the end.

47
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,670
And the third and final field is going to be public.

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,890
Static.

49
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,960
And I'm going to use Fred Local.

50
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:43,610
And then in points he brackets inside that I'm going to add extend test.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,350
And outside that pointy bracket, I'm going to give this a name of extend test.

52
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,410
Equals new Fred local.

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,660
Empty pointy brackets, empty round brackets and a semicolon.

54
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,530
And if I hover over extent test, you'll see I'm given an option to import that.

55
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,170
And that everything goes away.

56
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,110
So these are two free fields we need in this class.

57
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,760
So underneath the constructor, I'm going to begin writing my first method.

58
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,370
So this first method is going to be responsible for checking to see if this extent report fraud is a

59
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,390
novel value or not.

60
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,210
If it's an old value, it means it's not in use.

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,870
And so what this method is going to do is it's going to call another method which will be responsible

62
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,490
for setting up the extent reports.

63
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,370
So I'm going to.

64
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:45,970
Right here.

65
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,420
Public static.

66
00:04:51,130 --> 00:05:00,550
Stent reports and on call this method get reports round brackets and an open and close embrace.

67
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,490
Inside this method.

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,620
I'm going to use an if statement which is going to take this field.

69
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:19,210
To see if your equals equals in no value, then open and close embrace.

70
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:27,560
And then I'm going to right set up stent reports.

71
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,710
And around bracket.

72
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,150
And in double quotes, I'm going to give a name of live.

73
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,630
Project one with a semicolon.

74
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,100
So there's an error on the setup extent report because this is referring to a method that we haven't

75
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,880
yet created.

76
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,540
So this error will go away once we create that new method.

77
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,250
After that close embrace, I'm then going to right return.

78
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,380
And I am going to return this filled here extent report.

79
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,310
So I'm going to simply copy paste it with a semicolon.

80
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,710
So I'm now going to write the second method.

81
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,870
And this second method is going to be responsible for the actual setting up of the extent reports.

82
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,500
So it's going to create a new extent.

83
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,550
Report object is also going to create the reporter object and then it's going to assign the reporter

84
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,900
to the extent reports.

85
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:37,390
So I am going to write public static extent reports.

86
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,210
Set up extent reports, then round brackets.

87
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:53,580
And inside those round brackets, I'm going to add a parameter of string test name and then open and

88
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,830
close in brace like so.

89
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,690
So this sets up extent report is the same as what I'm defining in the first method.

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:12,610
So inside this new method, I'm going to write extent reports.

91
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,990
And this here matches this filename here.

92
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,190
And it's going to equal new.

93
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,470
Extent reports.

94
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,680
Round brackets and a semicolon.

95
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,250
So this is create in the extent reports object.

96
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,090
And it's a sign in that value to this field here.

97
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,970
Next I am going to use the reporter.

98
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,690
And so we need to use the extent.

99
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,130
Spark reports a class.

100
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,010
And I'm going to give it a name of spark equals new.

101
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,640
Extent SPARC reporter.

102
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,020
And this takes a argument.

103
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:13,810
So around brackets again and inside these round brackets, I need to define a location where the report

104
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,010
is going to be saved.

105
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:25,090
So as we've seen previously, I'm going to use a system property to define a start in location of the

106
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:35,080
project directory and I can do this by simply write in system dot get property.

107
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:45,730
And inside these new round brackets, in double quotes, I'm going to write You suck the air.

108
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,880
So this will get me a starting location of live project one.

109
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,930
Outside that first close in round bracket.

110
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm then going to write the following.

111
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,510
Plus.

112
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,690
And in new quotes.

113
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,800
Forward slash report.

114
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,000
Then forward slash again and outside those quotes another plus.

115
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,170
And I'm going to reference another method name, which is a method we haven't yet created.

116
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,270
So it will come back to this what is going to be an error until we do create this other method?

117
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,240
And this method is going to be called extent.

118
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,680
Reports.

119
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,790
Prefix underscore.

120
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,270
Name.

121
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,390
And it's going to take a parameter and it's parameters going to be called test name.

122
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:54,520
So I am going to add the carriage return there just so you can see on the screen what I'm typing.

123
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,160
Then after that, I am going to add another plus symbol.

124
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,560
And in double quotes, I'm going to write dots h l like so.

125
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,280
And at the end of that line, I'm going to simply add a semicolon.

126
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,550
So extent.

127
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,650
SPARC reporter has an error and then if we hover over it, we've got the option to import that.

128
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,320
And that area will then go away.

129
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,630
So the only other error we have is this method which we have yet to create, and we'll create that in

130
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,270
a little while.

131
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:41,950
So all this code is doing is is creating the extent reports object is creating a extent spark reports

132
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:47,170
who object and that takes an argument of a location of where the report is going to be created.

133
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,220
And that's simply going to be crazine it from the user directory, which is live project one.

134
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,850
And then it's going to create a new folder called Report.

135
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,610
And Inside the reports is going to use this method to get the name of the report, which takes the argument

136
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,830
of the text in them, which provides in a method.

137
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,200
Don't hate him.

138
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,370
So it's going to be great.

139
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,000
I hate him.

140
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,570
I'll file.

141
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,800
So the next thing I need to do is attach the reporter to the extent reports and so I can do this by

142
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,400
writing.

143
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,530
Stent reports.

144
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,110
I felt the dots.

145
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,110
Attach.

146
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,190
And you should have a method of attach.

147
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,820
Reporter.

148
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,480
Which belongs to the extent reports class.

149
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,490
So if I select that.

150
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,460
You'll see that there is a null value inside the brackets.

151
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,330
And so I'm going to change that and replace it with spark.

152
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,910
And spark is what we've defined here.

153
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,420
So I'm going to stop this video here and will continue in the next lecture.
