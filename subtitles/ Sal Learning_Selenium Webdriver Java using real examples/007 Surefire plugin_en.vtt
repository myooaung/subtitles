00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.230
In this lecture, we explored the Maven Sure Fire plugin.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.510
So what is the sure fire plug in?

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.830
It is a plug in that we can add into our pom file.

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.390
Maven's.

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.590
Sure fire plug in allows us to run tests via the command line.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.670
This is important for when we want to run tests.

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.630
They're a continuous integration system, and an example of a continuous integration system is Jenkins

8
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.200
CIA.

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.190
And this is something I cover in detail later in this course.

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.560
The plugin also allows us to be selective in what tests are run.

11
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.900
For example, we can specify which tests or tests to execute.

12
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.110
By adopting something called maven profiling.

13
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.720
The sure fire plugin should come pre-installed in your pubmed file.

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.510
It can be found inside the plug in tanks.

15
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.820
If it's not pre-installed, then you can simply download it from the Maven website and the screenshot

16
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.140
below shows an example of the Maven Sure Fire plugin installed in my home file and you can see that

17
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.270
it sits within plugin tags.

18
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.920
So let's try it out.

19
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.560
So on my screen I have the Maven project open and the first thing I'm going to do is double click the

20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.070
pull maximum file to show you the sure fire plug in.

21
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.690
So if I scroll down, you'll see that there is a plugin management tag and then there's plug ins and

22
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.240
there is a number of plug ins listed within the plug ins.

23
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.780
Thanks.

24
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.370
So if I scroll down, you'll see that the maven sure.

25
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.530
Fire plug in is listed here and it's inside plugging tanks.

26
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.210
So I am going to come back to this because I'm going to add some configuration.

27
00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.220
But before I do that, I am first going to create a new class by simply copying and paste in the class

28
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.240
in the last lecture.

29
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.600
And I'm going to call this new 180747.

30
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.419
And I'm going to give it a name of.

31
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.229
Sure fire.

32
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.740
And then click.

33
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.280
Okay.

34
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.180
I'm then going to open up that class.

35
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.620
And the only difference I'm going to make is use an that test annotation and I would need to import

36
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.120
that from test then G.

37
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.780
So all this is doing is employing this method is a test.

38
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.380
So I'm going to save that class and then I'm going to close it.

39
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.230
The next thing I'm going to demonstrate is the use of run in the tests through command line.

40
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.950
So I am going to open up command prompt.

41
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.570
And what I need to do is move into the directory of where this project resides.

42
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.660
So if I open up file explorer.

43
00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.420
If I go to my desktop, I'm going to click on the resources folder and there will be a workspace folder.

44
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.110
This is where all our Eclipse projects are listed.

45
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.480
And inside that you'll see that there is a Maven project, which is the current project I'm working

46
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.630
on.

47
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.380
So if I double click that and then copy this directory.

48
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.520
In command prompt, I'm simply going to use C, D, which is a command change directory and paste that

49
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.020
path.

50
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.410
And if I click enter, you'll see that I'm now moved into that directory.

51
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.610
So the maven.

52
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.550
Come on, I'm going to use his NBN test and if I click enter.

53
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.620
You should see it generate in some output.

54
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.410
And you can see that as a build success.

55
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.230
But there's no tests that have run.

56
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.610
And the reason for that is because I need to add some configuration.

57
00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.280
So I'm going to go back to the clips and I am going to open up my POM XML file.

58
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.310
And if I find the sure fire plugin tax which is here, I'm going to add some configuration.

59
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:17.170
So the first thing I'm going to do is use an open intake and I'm going to write configuration.

60
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.140
And you can see Eclipse has come up with the suggestion.

61
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.120
Then I'm going to expand those sites to make some room in the middle.

62
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.370
And I'm going to use another take.

63
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.430
And this tag is sweet.

64
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.260
SML files.

65
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.670
So this is going to be the name of my test energy example file.

66
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.010
So I am going to leave this for now, and now I'm going to generate one.

67
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.590
So I'm going to right click on that class, go to test then G.

68
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.850
And select convert to test then g.

69
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.480
And you've seen this before.

70
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.440
So all I'm doing is generating a test X email file.

71
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.670
So I'm going to click next and I'm going to click Finish and you'll see that test engine sample is now

72
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.390
listed here.

73
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.800
So if I double click it, you'll see that there's class tags and there's a class here listed.

74
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.170
And this class points to the class that I've just created.

75
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.080
So I'm going to closer and back in my pull maximal file inside the suite SML files.

76
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.570
Thanks.

77
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.230
I'm now going to write test energy dot example.

78
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.000
So this now points to this file.

79
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.780
So when I run, I may even test fruit.

80
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.530
Come online.

81
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.690
I would expect the Maven sure.

82
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.750
Fire plugin will now look for this particular file that I've defined in the POM file.

83
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.430
And in that we run this file, which should then run the Sure Fire Java class.

84
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.860
So I'm going to save this poem for now.

85
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.600
And I'm going to go back to come on line.

86
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.500
And here I'm going to use the exact same command Ambien test and if I click enter.

87
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.820
Let's see what happens.

88
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.150
And you can see that this when one test was run.

89
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.740
And it was a big success.

90
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:41.030
So what this means is that Maven ran this class and was able to do that using command online by using

91
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.230
the Sure Fire plugin.

92
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.490
And the Sure Fire plugin has configuration 2.2 this test engine XML file.

93
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.780
So I hope this made you understand why we use a sure fire plugin.

94
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.150
And this is going to be important to know when we reach the Jenkins lectures.

95
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.380
Thank you for watching.
