00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.870
So now that we've proven we're able to access data from the Excel workbook, we're going to use that

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.850
data in our test, and I'm going to be doing this on this log in page.

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.210
So I'm going to be providing a email address and password from the Excel workbook.

4
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:29.050
So to do this I'm going to need to use the shop login page object class because this contains the elements

5
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.000
that I need in order to send the data such as the email address and password locators.

6
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.750
So the first thing I'm going to do here is create an object, the shop login page, and I'm going to

7
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.940
call this shop equals new shop login page.

8
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.340
So now I need to import this.

9
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.830
Most errors will go away.

10
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.290
And so the next thing I need to do is get the locator for the email address textbox.

11
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.590
So I'm going to use the shop object name.

12
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.010
Dot gets email and I want to send data.

13
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.930
So I'm going to use send keys.

14
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.000
And inside these brackets I'm going to pass the string email row one, which retrieves this email address

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.290
here.

16
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.480
I'm going to copy this.

17
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.570
And I'm going to paste it like so I'm then going to use that page object again.

18
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.450
Shop dot get password, not send keys.

19
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.640
This time, I'm going to pass this variable.

20
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.180
So once we provided this information, we then need to click the submit button.

21
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.630
So again, I'll use the shop object, not get submit button.

22
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.930
And because it's a button, I want to click it.

23
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.070
So I'm going to save this class now and I'm going to try running it.

24
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.340
Let's see what happens.

25
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.670
And as you can see, the email address and password from the Excel spreadsheet was passed to those fields.

26
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.910
I was able to successfully sign in.

27
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.890
So that's proven.

28
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.110
The concept works.

29
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.970
So if I go back to two websites, if I type in that data again.

30
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.870
Look what happens when I sign in.

31
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.140
So I'm brought to your account page.

32
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.340
And so in order for me to enter a second set of data, I need to click the sign out button, which will

33
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.620
then take me back to the log in page.

34
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.590
So I can enter a second set of data here.

35
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.760
Once I've done that.

36
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.490
So what I'm going to do under this point is I'm going to create another page object, but this time

37
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.590
it's going to be for the shop your account.

38
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.390
Because at this stage in the code, I'll be in the your account page.

39
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.980
I'm going to write shop.

40
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.860
Your counts.

41
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.800
Equals nude shot or count.

42
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.720
Don't need to import that.

43
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.820
And then I'm going to use this object name.

44
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.500
So your echo dot gets sign out button.

45
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.600
I'm going to want to click it.

46
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.180
See this will click the sign up button and then all be returned back to this login page.

47
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.930
And this means I can then enter a second set of data.

48
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.560
So to do this, I'm again going to use this existing shop object.

49
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.690
But before I do that, I need to use or create some similar code as we've done here.

50
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.370
But for the second row.

51
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.370
So I am going to quite simply copy this code here.

52
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.820
And pace it here.

53
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.750
But instead of row one, I'm going to refer to row two and instead of dot get row one, I'm going to

54
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.100
pass the index of two.

55
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.430
So this will point.

56
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.970
So this second row here.

57
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.360
So I need to provide new verbal names.

58
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.450
So this is going to be called are two CS Evo and R2 C1 and it's going to use row to.

59
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.170
Self zero.

60
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.970
And so one which means the same.

61
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.560
Because wrote to the first cell.

62
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.450
Which cell zero contains this e-mail address I'm going to sell?

63
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.520
One contains this password.

64
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:19.990
So then I'm going to also change this to rugby, to O2, and I'm also going to be using these variables

65
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.290
here.

66
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.890
I need to replace these.

67
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.820
So now I should be able to quite simply copy this code so I don't need to create another shop.

68
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.810
Log in page object as once has been created, we can use it.

69
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.740
But they're not going to copy these free lines.

70
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.850
And paste it here.

71
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.020
But instead of email wrote one, I'm going to be passing this variable and the same for the password.

72
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.380
So now if I save this class, try running it again.

73
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.970
I see what happens.

74
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.060
So it's locked in.

75
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.190
It's gone to your account.

76
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.030
It signed out and then it inputs it the second row.

77
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.750
So let me slow that down so you can see it a little bit better.

78
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.680
So before I click, I'm going to add a dot sleep.

79
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.660
40 seconds.

80
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.960
After that, they froze declaration.

81
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.360
And I'm also going to add another one.

82
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.730
Just off this point.

83
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.210
So if I run it again, watch carefully.

84
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.960
So it's gone.

85
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:59.340
Login page is entered the email password from the first row, signed in, signed out, and then it used

86
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.570
the second row of data.

87
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.840
And that proves that we've just use these two rows of data.

88
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:15.410
So that's how we can use Apache Point and that's how we can import data from a spreadsheet and use it

89
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.220
within a test.

90
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:24.250
In the next lecture, I'm going to add an assertion to prove if a user has successfully or failed to

91
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.760
sign in.

92
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.020
Thanks for watching.
