00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.420
In this lecture, I'm going to demonstrate the code that we need in order to interact with the Microsoft

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.320
Edge browser.

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.080
So I'm going to open up the clips and I am going to highlight the Chrome demo class that I used in the

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.930
previous lectures, and I'm going to press Control C and Control V to copy and paste it.

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.820
I'm then going to provide a new class name and I'm going to call this.

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
Edge demo and then I'm going to click, okay.

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.850
And that will create the class.

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.480
If I double click that new class, it will open up.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.740
And this is the code from the Chrome demo class.

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.400
So what we required in order to open up the Chrome browser.

11
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.000
So I'm going to need to make some changes to this.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.600
So I'm going to have to change the key from Chrome to Edge.

13
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.370
Like so.

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.150
And I'm also going to need to point to a different driver.

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.140
So instead of chrome driver, this is now going to point to.

16
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.880
If you look in the driver V one folder, the message driver.

17
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.850
So if I go back to my code, I'm going to replace chrome driver with message driver.

18
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.380
And also needs a change on the second line.

19
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.280
Web driver driver equals new and instead of chrome driver, I'm going to change this to edge driver.

20
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.400
I'll need to import that by highlighting it.

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.310
One says imported.

22
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.760
You'll see that there is a reference to the chrome driver class, which we can remove.

23
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.090
So that just leaves the edge driver and the Web driver imports.

24
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.210
So I'm then going to say this class and I'm going to do this by pressing control s on my keyboard.

25
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.970
We are then able to start running this.

26
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.760
So I'm going to right click the Class Runners job application and see what happens.

27
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.590
You can see the Microsoft Edge browser has opened up and it's gone to the automation testing website.

28
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.150
So this proves that by making those simple code amendments, we can interact with the Microsoft Edge

29
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.660
browser.

30
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.510
I hope you found this lecture useful.

31
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.860
Thank you for watching.
