00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.420
In this lecture, we take a look at four loops.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.360
So what are four loops or a loop in general is code that runs or loops multiple times.

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.590
For example, a loop can execute the same code five, ten, 100 or n times.

4
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.950
A full loop is useful when you know the number of times the code should execute.

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.700
For example, I want the statement Hallowell to be printed five times.

6
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.270
We can write the code so that the Foley will stop executing in the code.

7
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.500
After the fifth time.

8
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.380
Let's see an example.

9
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.920
So in Eclipse, I'm going to simply copy and paste the class in the last lecture.

10
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.920
And I'm going to call this one L ten for lecture ten and I'm going to give it a name of four loops like

11
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.330
so.

12
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.360
And I'm going to open up that new class.

13
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.730
So I'm going to simply delete the code from the last lecture that we don't need.

14
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.120
Like so.

15
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.110
So I'm going to write a four for loop and I'm going to do it inside the main method.

16
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.970
To write a for loop.

17
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.620
I'd use the key word for.

18
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.010
And then in brackets.

19
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
I'm going to write int I equals zero.

20
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.740
Semicolon.

21
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.950
I is less than ten.

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.990
Semicolon.

23
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.960
I.

24
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.390
Plus.

25
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.240
Plus an an outside those brackets.

26
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.920
I'm going to add braces.

27
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.910
So let me explain what I'm doing here.

28
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.690
So I've used the four key word to define a four loop.

29
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.210
I've created a new integer.

30
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.750
Could I and assign an invaluable zero.

31
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.180
Then in the next.

32
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.230
So after the semicolon, the first semicolon, there's a condition.

33
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.510
So I'm checking the value of II to see if it's less than ten.

34
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.670
And in the third part of the fourth loop I'm using on a plus plus an AI plus plus the plus plus is an

35
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.960
increment symbol.

36
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.770
So it means it's going to increment the value of I.

37
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.830
Each time by one, every time the loop runs.

38
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.120
So inside this loop, I'm going to use a simple system.

39
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.330
Out thoughts.

40
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.970
Print out when.

41
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.460
And I'm going to type here on a message.

42
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.990
And at the end of those quotes, I'm also going to add a plus symbol and print out the value of I.

43
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.500
So if I save this now.

44
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.240
And try running it.

45
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.260
Let's see what happens.

46
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.580
So you can see that that loop has executed that code ten times.

47
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.030
And the reason for that is.

48
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.640
That way y equals zero cause it is condition.

49
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.820
So on the first two I'm on equals zero.

50
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.920
So I is less than ten.

51
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.750
I plus plus so increments at zero zero by one and it prints the message.

52
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.440
So in this time round I equals one.

53
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.060
Is I less than ten?

54
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.730
Yes, it is a plus plus.

55
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.190
So increase it again to two.

56
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.570
And it prints out its message and it keeps on going around in loops until this condition here is no

57
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.650
longer true.

58
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.390
So if I started with I equals ten here.

59
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.820
And I try running this code.

60
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.620
Let's see what happens.

61
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.570
And you see there's no message printed.

62
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.250
Because where I've signed the I value value of ten.

63
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.980
I is no longer.

64
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.240
Less than ten.

65
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.850
And because that condition isn't met.

66
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.250
This code here doesn't execute.

67
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.850
So that's the standard way how we write for loops.

68
00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.840
And I recommend that you have some practice with this because for loops are very useful.

69
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.990
So I hope this was useful and you've learnt how to use for loops from this lecture and I look forward

70
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.310
to speaking to you in the next.
