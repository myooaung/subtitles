00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.600
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.470
In this section, we'll be learning about extent reports.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.650
And these slides will show you how we can use extent reports to provide an advanced form of reports

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.860
in.

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:22.390
So what our extend reports Extend the pause is a customizable h html report developed by someone called

6
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.590
Anshu Observer.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.410
These reports can be integrated into Selenium Web Driver using j unit and test energy frameworks.

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.070
Extend reports offer a number of advantages over standard reports, such as their easy to read data

9
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.140
is represented in an organized way.

10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.050
And they are good for managers or non-technical people to interpret.

11
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.830
So here is an example of I extend reports.

12
00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.130
And so what I'm going to do now is pause this video and show you an actual copy of a report generated

13
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.850
previously.

14
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.360
So this is an example of a report generated from a framework.

15
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.600
This first one is displaying the or the complete test.

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.150
And here we have a number of logs which have been generated and outputs within the reports.

17
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.980
So we have an information status log and we have pass locks.

18
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.500
If we click on the second test, he shows the add remove item test.

19
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.260
And again, it has an information log.

20
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.440
It has pass logs and it also has a failure log.

21
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
And that's because the total amount is different to what was expected.

22
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.250
If we click on the screenshots, you'll see that the screenshot is also attached to the report for which

23
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.910
we can view.

24
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.140
On the left hand side, we have some additional tabs.

25
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.220
The second one is an exception tab of showing where it failed.

26
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.760
And his third one provides some key data, such as the start and end time, how many tests passed and

27
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.300
failed.

28
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.540
And this again shows in a pie chart format, including the amount of events that have occurred.

29
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.870
And also the amount of time each test has taken.

30
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.960
So that's his extent report in a nutshell.

31
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.670
So now that we've seen an example of an extent, reports ESCO, over some of the key classes that we

32
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.430
need to use in order to use extent reports.

33
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.370
So first is the extent reports class.

34
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.430
So extending the pause is a longer stall reporting library for automated tests.

35
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.130
A logger is simply an object to log messages or vents for a specific system or application.

36
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.820
Extend the pause using uses to log in style to add information about test sessions such as the creation

37
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.480
of tests.

38
00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:03.030
Add in screenshots, a sign in tanks or added events, or a series of steps to sequentially indicate

39
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.440
the flow of test steps.

40
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.360
Next, we have reporters.

41
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.800
So the information you create during your runs can be forwarded to variety destinations, including

42
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.140
files, databases, or stored in memory to be used at a later point in time.

43
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.270
Extent reports uses the observer pattern make it all reporter observers that are known by extent reports.

44
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.240
So below we show an instance of extent Spark Reporter, which is The Observer.

45
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.000
And it's to be attached to the extent reports object, which is the subject.

46
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.500
And it notifies extent spark reporter of any changes in state such as the creation of tests, added

47
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.880
blogs, etc..

48
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.380
So he can see on nine one.

49
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.620
I'm defined in the extent reports object and the object is called extent.

50
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.260
Annoying too.

51
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.240
I'm defining the reporter and I'm using the extent sparc reporter class.

52
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.850
But the reporter called spark.

53
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.339
Online free.

54
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.450
I'm then attaching a reporter to the extent report object.

55
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.480
Then we have the extent test class.

56
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.440
So tests are created using a method within the extent reports class.

57
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.480
As we have previously created an extent.

58
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.670
Reports object as shown below.

59
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.030
We can now use the method create test to create a test object.

60
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.890
So I'm using the extend test class and I'm calling the object test.

61
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.570
And it equals extent.

62
00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.110
Don't create test and create test is a method that belongs to extent reports class.

63
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.490
On doing so the create test method returns an extent test object which can be used to publish logs,

64
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.230
create nodes, assign attributes or attach screenshots.

65
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.390
So think of it this way will be crazy in a single extent.

66
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.470
Report object.

67
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.580
We would add a reporter to it.

68
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.620
It would increase tests by using the extent test, extend test class and call in a method from the extent

69
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.200
reporter object who create test.

70
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.490
Once a test extent test object is created.

71
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.900
We can then use it to log a message of information.

72
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.860
Log a message when a step has passed or failed.

73
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.640
Or log a screenshot and attach it to the test on a failure.

74
00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:04.220
Will be used in Fred local when we come to use extend test and this is so our test do not become confused

75
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.290
when running in parallel execution.

76
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.090
The next method I want to share with you is the flush command.

77
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.230
So the flush method instructs extent reports to write the test information to a destination.

78
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.310
This method is called when all our tests have completed.

79
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.470
It would then generates a report, which is usually a simple file, and it will combine all the tests

80
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.720
into a single report for us to review.

81
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.150
So last off is Maven and some closing notes.

82
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:49.390
So as we're using MAVEN in our framework, we would need to add extent reports to our POM XML file.

83
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:57.720
I will walk you through this when we set up extent reports and will be using MBM repository to find

84
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.890
the right dependency.

85
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.600
In the next lecture, I'll walk you through the architecture for how I'm going to be setting up extent

86
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.110
reports and I'll demonstrate some good design practices.

87
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:20.480
I will also explain how we're going to create and use a new extent manager class which will be responsible

88
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.800
for storing all our code we need to set up and use extent reports.

89
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.860
I hope this lecture has been useful to you.

90
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.710
And don't worry if it seems confusing at first, as I'll break this down in the following lectures.
