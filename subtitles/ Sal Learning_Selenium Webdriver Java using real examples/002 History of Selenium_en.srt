00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,950
So before we embark on a journey to learn selenium Webb Driver I think it's important to reflect back

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,930
to understand Selenium history.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,080
So in early 2004, Selenium was conceived by a full works engineer named Jason Huggins.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,100
So the first version of selenium was known as Selenium first mode of operation or Selenium core.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,260
Jason was working on a time in the expenses application and realized that testing the application using

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,580
server callbacks and different browsers was slow and troublesome.

7
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:46,090
Jason created a tool named the Java script test runner that enabled him to test the web application

8
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,700
by interacting with the client directly.

9
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:56,130
This meant he could test the web application with speed since server callbacks were no longer required

10
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,010
and tests could be conducted almost instantly.

11
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,000
In later, 2004 came second mode of operation and this is known as Selenium RC.

12
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,110
So Jason started demo in the test hall to his colleagues and was blown away by the positive feedback

13
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,040
and responses.

14
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:24,200
A fellow ThoughtWorks engineer named Paul Hammond saw the demo and discussed making Selenium open source.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,550
Paul started working on a second mode of operation whereby selenium could be remote, steered over TCP

16
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:40,230
IP, enabling instructions to be written in common programming languages like Java, C, Shop, Ruby,

17
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,520
Python and others.

18
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,950
The version of Selenium went on to become known as selenium remote control, often referred to as selenium

19
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,640
or C.

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,110
In 2005 came the transformation of selenium r.

21
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:06,530
C So in 2005, someone called Dan Follett and Nelson Sproul made an offer to accept the series of patches

22
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,420
that would transform Selenium r c into what it became best known for.

23
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,770
Originally Selenium ozone was two processes on an operating system.

24
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,310
The script running the test and the browser itself.

25
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,760
The new patches introduced a third process that sat in the middle of the two and allowed more than one

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,390
machine to be involved in the execution of Selenium tests.

27
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:41,040
This included tests being scripted from, say, Windows and being executed on a mac machine using Safari

28
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,580
browser.

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,470
In 2005 to 2006 came Selenium idea.

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,450
So Shinya Kass Itami from Japan wrote a Firefox plugin that brought the Selenium first mode of operation

31
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,700
into an idea.

32
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,200
The idea allow the user to record, edit and play back selenium scripts.

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,830
This offered users a way to get up and running with automated tests in very little time and with very

34
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,700
little overhead.

35
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,760
It required no programming knowledge to use, but is still capable of a lot.

36
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,290
There are, however, some disadvantages by using it.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,320
For example, there is no reporting and test scripts are more subject to ongoing maintenance.

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,660
In 2007 came Selenium web driver.

39
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,080
So another ThoughtWorks engineer named Simon Stuart had been working on a different web testing tool

40
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,280
called Web Driver.

41
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,940
Web driver was different as it did not rely on JavaScript and instead used a client for each browser

42
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,620
that was written from scratch.

43
00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:00,800
Each browser type, for example, Chrome, Firefox or I8 has a dedicated driver executable that allows

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,610
instructions to be sent to the browser via the operating system.

45
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,060
Web driver offered the number advantages over selenium.

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,480
See, for example, features between programming languages was consistent between different browsers.

47
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:26,480
In 2008 came Selenium Grid Support Works employee Felipe Henry Gou created Selenium Grid that allowed

48
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,110
Selenium r c to be used in expanded capacity.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:38,200
Selenium grid is a smart proxy server that makes easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines.

50
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,960
Selenium grids uses the hub node concept where hub assigns jobs to nodes when a suitable node is found,

51
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,610
i.e. operating system browser matches the tests request.

52
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,640
On this slide, I give you a summary of the key Selenium major releases.

53
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,380
So in 2009 was when Selenium one was introduced, and this was the first version consisting of Selenium

54
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,770
ai.d Selenium RC and Selenium grid.

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,590
In 2011 was selenium, too.

56
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,920
And this is a tool that makes the development of automated tests for web applications far easier.

57
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,650
It represents the merger of the original Selenium project with the Web Driver Project.

58
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,550
Selenium also got deprecated since the merge, however, was used for backward compatibility.

59
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,580
In 2016, Selenium Free was released.

60
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,700
And this is an extended version of selenium too.

61
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,220
It is inherently backward compatible and does not involve selenium or c.

62
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,420
The new version came along with several bug fixes and increased stability.

63
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,420
Browser vendors provided their own version of browser executables, and these are sometimes referred

64
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,040
to as browser drivers.

65
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:09,810
In 2021 Selenium form is released and this is a new version of Selenium that uses complete W3C protocol

66
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,230
adoption and introduces various other features.

67
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,360
So I've designed this course using a very late version of selenium free.

68
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:28,150
And my reasons for this is that this version is very stable, is still uses the W3C protocol and it

69
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,090
is by far the most popular version of Selenium has been used in the industry at the time of recording.

70
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,950
Selenium four is backward compatible, so new enough.

71
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,630
Everything you do in selenium free will work in selenium for.

72
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,360
There may be some minor differences, but I plan to explain those differences and show you how to upgrade

73
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,820
in a later section of this course.

74
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,720
So I hope this lecture has given you a good understanding of Selenium history.

75
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's move on to the next lecture.
