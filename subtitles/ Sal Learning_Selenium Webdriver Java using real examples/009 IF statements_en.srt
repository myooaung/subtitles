1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,200
In this lecture, we take a look at Java if statements.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,960
So what's our if statements?

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,460
If statements execute the block of code within the if statement if the condition is true.

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,870
If statements are used extensively in programming.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,130
The most common type is a standard if statement, but there are also else statements.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,800
ElseIf statements and switch statements.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,510
Think of an if statement in the following way.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,460
If the number ten is greater than the number nine, then the condition is met and the code within the

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,110
statement is to execute.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,420
Let's see some examples.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,650
So in Eclipse, I'm going to simply copy and paste the class in the last lecture and I'm going to call

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,460
this l0 nine and give it a name of if.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,450
Statements like so click.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,900
Okay.

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,489
And I'm going to double click and open it and I'm going to remove all the code apart from the static

16
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,930
with my method.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,150
Like so.

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,660
So my plan is to create three methods.

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,420
The first is going to use a standard if statement.

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,720
The second method is going to use an f l statement.

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,510
And the third method is going to use.

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,960
And if else.

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,450
If our statement.

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,400
So let's write first one.

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,560
So I'm going to write public.

26
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,670
Static.

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,490
With.

28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,340
If example.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,290
And inside this I'm going to write if I do it in brackets.

30
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,920
Ten is greater than nine.

31
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,720
Execute the following code system.

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,640
Dots out of print and.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,040
Ten is greater than nine.

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:07,890
So.

35
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,340
So the next method I'm going to write is public static void.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,450
If.

37
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,400
Example two.

38
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,130
And inside this one I'm going to use.

39
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,530
Owner crate two ins so it.

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,790
Our.

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:47,040
Equals 13 an int midday equals 12 like so.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,690
So now I'm going to write an if statement so that if.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,930
Our.

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,090
Is more than or equal to midday.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,010
Then execute the following code.

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,720
So I'm just going to copy the system in our print line from the one above.

47
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,260
Paste it here and I'm going to change the comet itself into.

48
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,840
Good.

49
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,360
After noon like so.

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,220
But here I'm going to write else.

51
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,520
And then another open and close braces.

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,800
And I'm going to copy this line.

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,620
And I'm going to write.

54
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,280
Good morning.

55
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,910
So what is code is doing?

56
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,170
I'm creating two ints ones in our variable which contains a value of 13, and the second is another

57
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,110
int variable called midday the value of 12.

58
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,970
The if statement is checking to see if our SO the value of 13 is greater or equal to midday, which

59
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,540
is 12.

60
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,620
And because it is, I'm expecting System.out.println line to print.

61
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,400
Good afternoon.

62
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,340
If I change our from 13 to 11.

63
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,060
Then because our is no longer great or equal to midday.

64
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,940
I wouldn't expect this code here to execute.

65
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,430
Instead, I would expect to execute.

66
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,160
This would say good morning instead.

67
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,400
So I'm going to change it back to 13 for now, and we'll run it in a moment.

68
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,510
In the third method, I'm going to create public static void.

69
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,160
Chuck Norris if.

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,380
Example.

71
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,040
Free.

72
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,220
And inside.

73
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,670
So I must see brackets at the end that I don't like.

74
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,030
So.

75
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,610
So here I'm going to create free integer variables int.

76
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,790
Our equals.

77
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,440
19.

78
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,770
ENT midday equals 12.

79
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,460
An int afternoon.

80
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,110
Equals 18.

81
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,250
So here I'm going to use an f l cif l statement.

82
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,200
So I'm going to riot if.

83
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:34,240
Our is more than or equal to midday.

84
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,790
And using a logical operator.

85
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,010
I'm going to stay and.

86
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,840
Our is less than or equal to.

87
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Afternoon.

88
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,850
Then open and close embraces.

89
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,740
Wanted to execute.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,310
So I'm just going to copy the system outline.

91
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,880
System.out.println.

92
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,630
And it's going to be.

93
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,700
Good afternoon.

94
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,160
Hey.

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm going to try else.

96
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,020
If.

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,910
In an open and closed in brackets.

98
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,510
Our.

99
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,090
It's more than or equal to.

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,040
Midday.

101
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,480
And.

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,710
Oops, sorry.

103
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,180
Inside the brackets.

104
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,730
And.

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,670
Our is more than afternoon.

106
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,440
An open and close embraces again.

107
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,690
And this time I want to prince out.

108
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,720
Good evening.

109
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,830
And then at the end the decision I'm going to write ls and open in close braces.

110
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,520
So in this line, I'm going to use again, systems or out of the print line.

111
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,290
But I'm going to print the value of.

112
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,520
Good morning.

113
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,130
So to explain what this code does.

114
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,650
So I've declared free into variables.

115
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,110
One called our the value of 19.

116
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,200
Another called midday with a value of 12.

117
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,530
And another called afternoon with a value of 18.

118
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,540
So the first if statement checks to see if our SO if the value of 19 is more than or equal to the value

119
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,100
of midday, which is 12.

120
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,070
So that is true.

121
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:44,950
The second logical operation is checking to see if our one, which is 19, is less than or equal to

122
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,730
afternoon.

123
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,810
Afternoon equals 18.

124
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,600
So our is more than the value of the afternoon verbal.

125
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,570
So I do not expect this to print out.

126
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,180
So the next one is the elusive statement.

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,890
So again, check and see if our is greater or equal to midnight, which it is and then is checking to

128
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,330
see if our is more than afternoon, which I believe it is as well.

129
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,640
So in this case, I expect this value to output the console for this method.

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,850
If never, these two were true.

131
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,030
So if the if statement wasn't true and the elseif wasn't true, then it would revert to this line here

132
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,800
and it prints out.

133
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,500
Good morning.

134
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,700
So now we're ready to run this class.

135
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,570
So like the previous examples, I'm just going to copy the method names in a public static void method

136
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,650
like so.

137
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,120
Enough outside the class.

138
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,070
Let's check the output.

139
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,360
So in his first example.

140
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,600
So this one highlighted.

141
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,730
I've used a simple if statement to see if ten is greater than nine.

142
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,120
And if that is true, I want it to print out this line.

143
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,260
And that's why ten is greater than nine has been produced here.

144
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,900
In the second effort.

145
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:27,040
So this one highlighted I've declared two integer values hour, which is 13 midday, which is 12.

146
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,270
And I'm using an if statement to see if our is more than or equal to midday because it is because s

147
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,760
15 and midday is 12.

148
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,820
I expect it to output is line and that's why good afternoon has been printed.

149
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,940
In the third example of declared free integer variables.

150
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,920
Our meta in afternoon and I'm using an f elseif l statement.

151
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:02,470
So the first one is check and see if our is greater take with the midday which is and our is less than

152
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,660
or equal to an afternoon, which it's not.

153
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,140
So I do not expect this line here to execute.

154
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:17,910
The LCF is then checking to see if our is greater or equal to mid-day, which is and if hour is greater

155
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,660
than afternoon.

156
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,020
Which is to ask why I expect it to output this line.

157
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,200
And if we look at the console, that's the law that has been printed.

158
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,530
If you have been coding along, then I recommend you play around with this code and try to produce different

159
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,220
outputs.

160
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,790
The hope this lecture has been a good introduction to Java if statements as it be used if statements

161
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,200
quite a bit in the future.

162
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,270
Thanks again for watching.
