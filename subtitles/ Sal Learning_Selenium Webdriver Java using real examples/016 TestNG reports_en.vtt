00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.500
In this lecture, we'll be taking a look at test g reports.

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.470
So what our reports.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.550
They are a document that we can use to review how our tests have performed.

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.140
For example, we may want a nice overview to see what tests have passed or failed.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.530
But for the test have failed.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.340
We may want to see at what step has failed at.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.640
The ports are important because they provide both technical and non-technical people a way to interpret

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.390
the results.

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.260
Testing provides a test report, but it will be looked at more advance reports later in this course.

10
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.310
So here is an example of a test injury report that gets generated after a test is run and you can see

11
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.030
some basic information, for example, how many methods passed or failed and what's the method?

12
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.560
Names of those that have run.

13
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.090
Test and g reports are produced each time you run a test using test n g.

14
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.000
A huge HTML file was produced that is often named indexed or h html.

15
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.540
You can locate this file under the test output folder from within your project.

16
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
And you can open this file using a browser.

17
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.190
And I usually use Chrome.

18
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.750
So let's see an example of this.

19
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.180
In Eclipse.

20
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.200
I'm simply going to right click and run the class from the last lecture.

21
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.310
And this will simply pass and fail to methods.

22
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.170
Once this is done, I'm going to return to eclipse.

23
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.310
You can see the console says passes one, failures one.

24
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.090
So to access the testing report, I need to find a test output folder.

25
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.120
But you can't see one listed in my project.

26
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.760
The reason for this is we need to refresh the project.

27
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.310
So I'm going to do this at the highest level by right click in and then click refresh.

28
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.890
And on doing so, a test output folder would appear.

29
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.590
If I expand this, you'll see that there is an index that HTML.

30
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.600
And if I right click that file and then click properties.

31
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.670
And then if I click on this icon here, it will show it in the folder structure.

32
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.300
I can then double click here to open it using my browser.

33
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.590
And this is the testing report.

34
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.850
And you can see that the suite was run and within a suite in the results section.

35
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.460
Two methods one, one that failed and one that passed.

36
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.120
And the failed method was enter email and on the pass methods.

37
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.000
If I click on the show link, it will show you what method passed.

38
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.190
Now, this report also shows you the details of why the tests failed.

39
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.990
And we know this failed because I use the assert don't fail command which had failed the test method.

40
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.030
So this is how we can use test n g reports.

41
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.400
They're quite basic, but are also good at giving us a high level overview of how our tests performed.

42
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.720
Later in this course, we'll be using more advanced reporting.

43
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.130
But for now, I hope you found how to use test energy reports useful and have an idea of how we can

44
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.580
use them.

45
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.200
Thank you for watching.
