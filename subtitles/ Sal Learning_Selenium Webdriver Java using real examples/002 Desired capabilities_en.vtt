00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.610
In this lecture, we take a look at design capabilities and how to handle SSL certificates.

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.590
Design capabilities is a class from the Remote Design Capabilities package in selenium.

3
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.260
It provides the ability to set the properties of a browser during a test session.

4
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.750
For example, set in the Browns name.

5
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.530
The platform is to run on or the browser version to be used.

6
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.360
It is commonly used with selenium grid and we cover selenium grid later in this course, but it can

7
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.400
be used to set your operating system.

8
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.660
The test is to run on.

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.090
We set design capabilities by using key value pairs.

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.320
The below website shows there is a certificate issue.

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.430
This means our test cannot progress past this page.

12
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.760
We can use design capabilities to accept this cert warning.

13
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.980
Let's review the code below.

14
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.650
So here I'm using this the desired capabilities class to create an object.

15
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.980
I then set capabilities against that object.

16
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.850
I then create a object of chrome options.

17
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.610
And then I pass the desired capabilities object as an argument using the option dot merge method.

18
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.390
So let's try this out.

19
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
So before I start writing code, let me first explain the test.

20
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.110
So I'm going to go to the foreign website.

21
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.420
Expired but bad SSL dot com.

22
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.710
And you can see when I go to this website, I'm presented with a warning saying your connection is not

23
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.840
private and is given an error of cert data is invalid.

24
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.940
So this implies there's an issue with the certificate of this website.

25
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.160
So because of this, I can't progress onto the next page.

26
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.480
So we need a way of handling this certificate issue.

27
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.300
So I'm going to go back to the clips and I'm going to copy and paste the class in the last lecture.

28
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.000
Call in this new one l0 two and given a name of desired.

29
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.210
Capabilities.

30
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.590
And then click in.

31
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.070
Okay.

32
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.940
Then going to open that class and I'm going to remove the Chrome options section from the last lecture.

33
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.590
So I am going to go back to this website and copy the address.

34
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.220
And I am going to pace this in the get method.

35
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.100
I'm also going to get rid of this options parameter from the last lecture.

36
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.450
So here I'm going to use desire capabilities.

37
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.340
So I'm going to write desired.

38
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.260
Capabilities.

39
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.650
I'm going to give it a name of cap.

40
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.960
And if I hover over the desired capabilities, I've got an option to import it from selenium.

41
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.200
And it's going to equal desired.

42
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.260
Capabilities.

43
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.900
Dot.

44
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.800
And you can see I've got an option for Chrome.

45
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.660
And in a semicolon.

46
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.800
So now I am going to add arguments using that cap object.

47
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.370
So I'm going to use cap dot set.

48
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.390
Capabilities.

49
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.670
And in his first one, I'm going to write.

50
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.830
Capability.

51
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.590
Type.

52
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.830
Dot.

53
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.810
Accept insecure certs.

54
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.920
And I am going to change this from false to true.

55
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.280
I'm then going to copy this line.

56
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.850
And pace it.

57
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.519
But instead of accept insecure certs, I'm going to accept SSL certs like so.

58
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.330
The next thing I need to do is use the Chrome options class.

59
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.370
So I am going to write Chrome.

60
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.280
Options only have a name of option equals new chrome.

61
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.150
Options.

62
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.600
And an on going to add brackets at the end of that line and a semicolon.

63
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.880
I'm then going to use the option object.

64
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.680
If I write docs here.

65
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.220
I've got access to a method called merge.

66
00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.470
And here I can pass the Desire Capabilities object, which is called Cap.

67
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.490
And I'm just going to add a semicolon now.

68
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.640
So now what I can do is quite simply add this options.

69
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.680
So chrome options object.

70
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.510
I can paste it here when I am create in the driver instance.

71
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.860
So now if I say this class.

72
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.370
And I try running it.

73
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.230
Let's see what happens.

74
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.190
And you can see that I've progressed onto the next web, web page.

75
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.620
So it's bypass that warning message.

76
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.580
And we was able to do that by using desired capabilities and Chrome options.

77
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.260
So if I commented these two lines out.

78
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.310
And try running the test again.

79
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.500
See what would happen.

80
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:11.750
And you can see I am presented with the connection is not private warning because of the invalid certificate.

81
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:23.820
So this is how we can bypass the SSL certificate warnings by using design capabilities and chrome options.

82
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.840
I hope he found this lecture useful.

83
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.220
And thank you for watching.
