00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.150
In this lecture, we're going to learn about a Selenium Jar file as well as learn how to download and

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.750
import it.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.060
So what is a jar file?

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.420
JAR stands for Java Archive.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.730
It's a file format based on the popular zip file format and is used for aggregating many falls into

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.090
one.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.210
We can import your files into our Java project so that we can then use those classes in our project.

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.340
For example, if we didn't import Selenium Java file, then we wouldn't be able to access various Selenium

9
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.020
web driver methods and classes.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.840
So we have the following steps ahead.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.250
We'll go to a website to download the Selenium Java Jar file.

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.760
We'd open up clip's idea and import the jaw file into our project.

13
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.850
Then we would write the test script.

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.770
So a Java class that can use this content is imported from that jar file.

15
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.129
So let's download and import the jar file.

16
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.030
So the first step is to open up Chrome and in a search engine.

17
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.400
I'm going to search for Selenium, Java, download and then click enter.

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.430
The first result should be to selenium dot dev and there's a downloads link here and if I select it,

19
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.470
it should take you to the following page.

20
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.430
So we need to download from this section called Selenium Clients and web driver language bindings.

21
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.200
And you can see on the Java section there's a stable release for version four.

22
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.920
But as I have explained in a previous lecture, this course has been built using a very late version

23
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.030
of Selenium Free.

24
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.190
So I'm going to download version 3.1 for 1.59.

25
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.510
So instead of clicking this, if we carry on scrolling down, you should see a previous release section

26
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.970
and if I click this link, you'll see a list of different versions we could download.

27
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.870
So I'm looking for selenium.

28
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.670
3.141.59, which is here.

29
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.280
If I expand this, you'll see this download options and we need this.

30
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.820
Selenium Java 3.14159. zip.

31
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.870
So if I select that, that should begin the download process.

32
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.350
So I'm going to click that download and select show in folder and that will take us to the location

33
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.150
of where the zip file resides.

34
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.330
So I am going to drag that over to my desktop and then I'm going to close this window.

35
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.300
And so what we need to do now is unzip the contents of this file.

36
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.830
So it makes sense for us to store this in a good location.

37
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.650
So I'm going to use the resources folder and I'm going to right click select new and create a new folder,

38
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.060
and I'm going to call this folder Selenium Hyphen Jar.

39
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.440
I'm then going to track this window over, double click on the zip folder and we should see the content.

40
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.840
So I'm going to highlight all these and I'm going to drag them over to that new folder.

41
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.650
And on doing so that will unzip the content to that new location.

42
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.000
So we can now close these windows.

43
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.940
So to close this one and I'm going to close this one here.

44
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.890
And then I'm going to open up the eclipse.

45
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.710
So we're going to use the class from the last lecture, which is this car class.

46
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.980
So I'm going to prove that we don't yet have access to Selenium Java classes and methods.

47
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.560
So I am going to highlight this exist in mine and simply delete it.

48
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.380
I'm then going to write the following.

49
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.460
Web driver.

50
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.440
Driver equals new chrome driver.

51
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.890
Then round brackets and in the semicolon.

52
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.980
So we can see that as errors, which is implied by red lines under these two words.

53
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.990
And if a hover over web driver, you'll see I'm given the following options.

54
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.620
And if I do the same to Chrome driver, you'll see that I've got limited options out.

55
00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:25.620
So what I need to do is import the classes for these two words, and I can't currently do that because

56
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.470
I've yet to import the jar file to my project.

57
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.530
So I'm going to go to file and save and then I'm going to right click my project intro, go to properties.

58
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.500
And you'll see an option for Java build path.

59
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.960
And then if I select the library's tab, it should display something similar to the below.

60
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.180
So notice says module and class path and I'm unable to select the buttons.

61
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.540
But if a highlight class path by clicking it, you'll see that these buttons then become available.

62
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.050
And I'm going to select the Add external Jaws button.

63
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.810
I'm then going to navigate to my resources folder from my desktop.

64
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.470
And I'm going to select this Selenium Jar folder.

65
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.400
And I'm going to highlight these two files here and then click open and they should then be listed underneath,

66
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.870
underneath the class path.

67
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.540
If I select class path again and then select add external chars.

68
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.770
I'm then going to double click this folder.

69
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.940
And I'm going to then highlight these files and then select open so that they get added to.

70
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.180
And all those files should now be listed underneath class path.

71
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.750
And then I need to select applying close.

72
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.730
So with our car crossed still open if I hover over Webb driver, notice how I've got additional options

73
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.990
here and I've got an option to import web driver from selenium.

74
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.930
If I click this, notice how an import is then placed at the top of my class.

75
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.560
So that proves that we're able to import Web driver from the Selenium classes.

76
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.870
And if I do the same to Chrome driver, I've got an option to import Chrome drive from selenium.

77
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.140
And if I click it, another import is listed.

78
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.170
So now if I cite this class, you'll see that the errors then go away.

79
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:37.380
So what this proves to us is that when we imported the selenium jar and imported it into our project,

80
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.460
we then had access to the Selenium classes and methods.

81
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.600
So this is all I wanted to cover in this lecture.

82
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.560
In the next lecture, we'll begin downloading the Web drivers.
