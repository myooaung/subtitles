00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.780
In this lecture, we take a look at the job math class.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.110
So what is the Java math class?

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.530
The Java math class can be used to call methods that perform mathematical tasks or numbers.

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:23.110
Some commonly used methods are math random, which returns a random number between 0.0 or 1.0.

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.550
Mac dot macs, which returns the highest number of x or Y in.

6
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.430
Mathop Min, which returns the lowest number of x or y.

7
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.730
Let's try it out.

8
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.860
So in Eclipse I'm going to copy and paste the class in the last lecture and I'm going to call this l08

9
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.390
for lecture eight and I'm going to call it math like so.

10
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.310
I'm not going to double click that glass.

11
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.230
And I'm going to delete all the code from the last lecture.

12
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.460
Apart from the static void main method like so.

13
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.830
So my plan here is to create three methods.

14
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.070
The first one is going to use the method of random method.

15
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.890
The second is going to use mathematics.

16
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.990
And the third is going to use math, not mine.

17
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.490
So first off, I'm going to write public static.

18
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.080
Boyd's.

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.820
Random.

20
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.120
And all I'm going to do is write simply system.

21
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.750
Got out of print and.

22
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.990
Brackets for a semicolon.

23
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.500
And inside those brackets I'm going to use math dot random like so.

24
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.750
In the second example, I'm going to use public.

25
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.350
Static void.

26
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.490
Max.

27
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.790
And inside that method, I'm going to use system.

28
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.150
That's out the print and.

29
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.259
And inside those brackets, I'm going to use math dot Macs.

30
00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.060
And I'm going to use this version.

31
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.640
So it takes integer arguments and the first into German to provide is five.

32
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.110
And the second is to.

33
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.250
So in the third example, this is going to be very similar.

34
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.540
So I'm just going to copy this.

35
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.080
Pace here, set a maximum record at min and instead of using math dot max, I'm going to use the method

36
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.720
max mathop min like so.

37
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.200
So like the last lecture, I'm going to place the method names in the public static void main methods

38
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.890
to trigger them.

39
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.410
Semicolon.

40
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.380
Maxwell semicolon and men with a semicolon to.

41
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.870
So now I'm going to save this class and then I'm going to right click it to run Java application.

42
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.800
So you can see that a random number has been generated for the first method.

43
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.390
So this random number is between the values of zero and one.

44
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.610
So if I was to run this class again, watch that first value.

45
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.660
So you can see a new number has been generated by the Java math class.

46
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.950
If I do it one more time.

47
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.910
You see, another number has been provided.

48
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.650
So every time this class is run, that method random will generate a new number, random number between

49
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.700
zero and one.

50
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.730
The second method to our views, the Mathop max method is provided of provided to arguments of five

51
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.200
and two, and the max method will get the highest value.

52
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.980
So the maximum value of the two, hence y five has been outputted.

53
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.260
But a third method we use min mathop min.

54
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And again we provide the same two values as arguments, but the mathop min method will go.

55
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.320
We'll look for the minimum value of the two.

56
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.170
So in this case, two is lower than five.

57
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.880
It's what two has been printed.

58
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.920
So I hope this has been a good introduction to the Java math class and I'll speak to you in the next

59
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.370
lecture.
