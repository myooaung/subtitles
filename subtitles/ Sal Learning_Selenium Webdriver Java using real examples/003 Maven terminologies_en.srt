00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,320
In this lecture, I go over some maven terminologies.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,500
So it's important that we understand some of the key maven terminologies that we are going to use in

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,640
the upcoming lectures.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,440
Understanding these terminologies is essential when creates and maven projects.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,190
I'll be covering the following groups with the artifact I.D. and version.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,200
Group D will identify your project uniquely across all projects.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,840
So we need to enforce a name in schema.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,560
A group said they should follow Java's package name rules.

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,220
This is to use a reverse domain that you control because this will be unique to you or your company.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:54,170
For example, if I look on my vienne repository, I can find all dependencies that have been developed

11
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,830
by Selenium HQ because I can look up their group by day.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:08,330
So this screenshot shows a number of dependencies that are owned by org dot selenium HQ Selenium such

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,870
as Selenium, Java, Selenium API and Selenium server.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:20,080
As I own the domain w WW dot automation test encoder UK.

15
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:26,350
I might use the following group by D UK ae the automation test in.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,690
If I worked for an organization called the made up company and they own the domain W WW dot the made

17
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,990
up company dot org then I might use a group by the of org not the made up company.

18
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,420
So if you don't have your own domain, don't worry.

19
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,110
This is more for when you work in a company in the real world that need to use and prior to this naming

20
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,770
convention.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,680
If you're just following along and don't have a domain, you can just use any value locally.

22
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,380
Next up is the artifact guy de.

23
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,920
So you need to think of the artifact I.D. as the project name.

24
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,940
It can be whatever you choose it to be, but it must consist of lowercase characters and no unusual

25
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,520
symbols such as dollar or percentage.

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,170
If I was going to create a new Maven project to create a weather system, then I might set the artifact

27
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,280
idea as whether.

28
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,610
If we then combine the groups into an artifact I.D., then we might have the following.

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,940
So the red part is Mulgrew pointy, and the purple part is my artifact I.D..

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,740
So the following slide highlights the artifact I.D..

31
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,880
So all three of these is provided by.

32
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,020
Org dot selenium.

33
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,400
HQ dot selenium.

34
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,880
But they provide artifact guides for Selenium, Java, Selenium API and Selenium server.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,860
So these are free separate projects provided by the same supplier.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,380
Next up, his version.

37
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,890
So if you decide to distribute your MAVEN project, then you would release it under a particular version

38
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,370
number.

39
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,140
The main version, types and explanations are shown below.

40
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,860
So the major version is shown on the left hand side and we would use something like 3.9.

41
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,220
Minor versions would use something like 3.9.1 or 3.9.0.

42
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,520
So I hope this was a good overview of some of the key Maven terminologies.

43
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,980
And don't worry if you don't understand some of this, as will be using it, and I'll demonstrate it

44
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,120
in the next few lectures.

45
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,040
Thank you for watching.
