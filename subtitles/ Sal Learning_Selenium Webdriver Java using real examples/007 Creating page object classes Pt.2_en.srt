1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,610
In this lecture, we're going to create our second page object class.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,340
So we've already done the home page.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,250
And if I go back to the website, the next page that we're going to be looking at is the test store

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,000
home page.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,740
So this will be the second page that will be interacted with when we construct our tests.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,120
And on this page you have the option of different products to select.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,780
So I am going to base this second page object on the elements from this page.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,520
So if I go back to Eclipse, I'm going to right click the page objects package, select new and select

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:49,540
class, and I'm going to give this class a name of shop home page like so and then click Finish.

10
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,950
I'm then going to open that class.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,010
And this is where I'm going to begin writing my code.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,930
So remember, like the last lecture we need to add public.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,590
Webb.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,269
Driver.

15
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:05,470
Driver.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,790
I would have to import that from selenium.

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,860
The next thing to do is to source the element locators.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,790
So we need to think of all the elements we'd want to interact with on this page.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,010
So the first one that I'm going to get is this first product here.

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,610
And in fact, I'm going to get locaters for all these products because I plan to use these in my test.

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,260
So I'm going to right click the name, go to inspect.

22
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,880
And then I'm going to go to annual philosophy.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,410
And you'll see there's a list of selectors I can use.

24
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,190
So the most suited one I can see here is link text.

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,810
So I'm just going to grab that.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,120
I mean, go back to Eclipse and I'm going to write by.

27
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,860
And I'm going to call this variable product one equals.

28
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,040
Buyer dot link.

29
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,160
Text and I'm going to pay earlier.

30
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,260
We have a semicolon.

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,970
So I'm going to do the same for by.

32
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,480
Product two equals.

33
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,520
If I go back to the website.

34
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,450
And if I right click the name the second product and inspect.

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,330
And again, go back to Red Rocks velocity.

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,000
This one has a link text of hummingbird printed sweater, so I'm going to copy that.

37
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,760
And I'm going to write by link text and I'm going to provide that value.

38
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,600
So I'm going to do the same for the remaining products, but I'm not going to show you this as this

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,350
is going to bore you and I will predefined the code which you can download.

40
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,210
But before I copy the code into this class, let's do the next few things I would have had to have done

41
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,130
if I was creating this class by hand.

42
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,390
So I need to create a constructor.

43
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,990
So I'm going to write public and then provide the class name of shock.

44
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,100
Home page.

45
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,070
And in brackets, an open and close embrace.

46
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,780
So I've misspelt downloaded an error which I am going to remove an error then goes away.

47
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,870
So I need to provide in the parameters with driver driver.

48
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,590
And this is identical to what we did in the last lecture.

49
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,030
So this is something that's going to be consistent in all our page object classes.

50
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,670
And here I'm going to write this.

51
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,090
Thought driver.

52
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,050
Driver.

53
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,260
And the next thing to do is to start creating our public methods.

54
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,560
So public web element.

55
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,420
And I'm going to call this get prod one.

56
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,140
Our need to import web element.

57
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,990
And this is simply going to return.

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,970
Driver the fine element.

59
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,940
And then I am going to provide this field.

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Put product one was semicolon.

61
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,730
So if I copy that and place this below.

62
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,970
I'm simply got to change this to product two and put up one.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
Is instead going to point to this variable like so.

64
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,460
So I would have done the same procedure.

65
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,560
I would have gone back to this website and I would have.

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,890
Right.

67
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,550
Clicked on this name, this name, this name.

68
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,520
And for the rest of the products, I did those in this section as fields and then create in methods

69
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,530
that will point to those fields.

70
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,250
So instead of showing you this, which would take time, I've already written this code for you, which

71
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,490
you can download, so I'm simply going to copy.

72
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,100
From the bottom to the Web driver filled at the top.

73
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,980
And I'm just going to paste it.

74
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,540
Like so.

75
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,620
And as you can see, it contains the exact same what just showed you up to this point.

76
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,690
So by all means, if you would like to practice governance source locators and write this code yourself.

77
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,090
Otherwise you have the option to download it.

78
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,900
So this is the second page object class done, and in the next one will do the next page.

79
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,190
Thank you for watching.
