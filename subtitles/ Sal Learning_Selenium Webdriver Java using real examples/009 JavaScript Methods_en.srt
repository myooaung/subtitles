1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,540
In this lecture, we begin to look at some JavaScript methods.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,820
So we can access elements by using JavaScript.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,730
The easiest way to access a single element in the DOM is by its unique hidey.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,710
We can grab an element by we with the get element by the method of the document object.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,660
So this image is a screenshot of the console window.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,160
So where we access the developer tools by pressing F12 or right, click it and inspect it on a web page.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,310
We also have a panel where we can insert and write JavaScript code.

8
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:54,460
So in this example, I'm using document dock element by ID and I'm passed in the ID value of content.

9
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,280
So I'll be showing you these in the demonstration towards the end of this lecture.

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,910
Access in elements by class said the class attributes is used to access one or more specific elements

11
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,600
in the DOM.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,470
We can get all the elements with a given class name with digit elements by class name method.

13
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,450
We can also access elements by tag.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,730
So another way to access multiple elements on the page would be by its HTML tag name.

15
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,600
So we can access that element by tag, by using the get elements, by taking a method.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,490
Accessing elements by query selector.

17
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,770
So another useful method is document the query selector.

18
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,970
The document method query selector returns the first element within the document that matches the specified

19
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,570
selector.

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,130
We can pass a class or an ID using this method, using the hash or the dots prefix.

21
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,710
So in the example in the diagram, I'm passing an idea of content.

22
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,190
So let's try some of these out.

23
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,390
So I'm going to open up Chrome and I've gone to the automation test and website and I'm going to click

24
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,590
on the Buttons page.

25
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,060
So on here I had either press F12 or right click and inspect.

26
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,560
And this opens up the developers panel, which we've seen a number of times now.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,590
But notice at the top there's an option for console.

28
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,250
And if I select that you're presented with a console for which we can write JavaScript code.

29
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,890
So I'm going to minimize this a little bit like so.

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:09,080
So the first thing I'm going to do here is I'm going to get a element's or return an element using JavaScript

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,440
code based on the ID.

32
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,120
So if I use a select, that's all and click on button one.

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,990
We can see it as an idea of button underscore one.

34
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,220
So I'm going to copy that.

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,030
And I'm going to go back to the console and I'm going to write some JavaScript to use that I.D..

36
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,390
So I'm going to write a document.

37
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,710
Dot get element by date.

38
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,460
And then I open and close in bracket only use single quotes.

39
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,980
And I'm going to pass that value.

40
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,770
At the end of that line, I'm going to use a semicolon.

41
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:04,840
Now that is JavaScript code we use in a JavaScript method here and if I press enter.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,810
You'll see that it's returned back an element.

43
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,640
So this means he's found the match and if a hover over it, you can see the bottom.

44
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,450
One element has been highlighted on the left hand side of my screen.

45
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,880
So let's try another example.

46
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,920
So I'm going to close this panel.

47
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,540
And I'm going to go to the accordions page.

48
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,200
So on this page I'm going to right click and inspect and I'm going to get to select it all and click

49
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,010
on the accordion.

50
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,080
So you can see that there is free elements that have the same class of accordion header.

51
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,520
So I am going to use this class name.

52
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,830
And again, I'm going to go back to console.

53
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,620
And I'm going to write some JavaScript that uses elements by class name.

54
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
So I am again going to write document.

55
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,340
Don't get elements by class name.

56
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,640
And then in brackets.

57
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,450
And in single quotes, I'm going to place a value over a semicolon at the end.

58
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,220
And if I click enter.

59
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,870
You'll see that I've been provided with free values.

60
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,520
And if I expand them.

61
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,940
You'll see the free elements have been returned.

62
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,020
So that's how we can retrieve elements by class name, by using the get elements by class name method.

63
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,300
So I'm now going to close this developer panel and I'm going to go to the calculator page.

64
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,700
So on here.

65
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,570
Each one of these button elements is the same type of element.

66
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,760
So if I right click on inspect and select one of these buttons.

67
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,460
You can see it's an input that is a tight button.

68
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,470
And if I open up these table data type tags, you'll see that there's other buttons inside them.

69
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:24,530
So what I'm going to do here is take note of the input tags and I'm going to go to console and I'm going

70
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,520
to write document.

71
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,300
Thoughts get element by tag name.

72
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,500
And then in brackets and single quotes.

73
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,410
I'm going to pass the tag Empower.

74
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,530
Semicolon and press enter.

75
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,840
So you can see a similar collection has been returned with 18 values.

76
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,090
And there are a number of input tags on this page.

77
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,960
So if I expand this and hover over these.

78
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:58,970
Oops.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,330
Sorry.

80
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,700
And hover over them.

81
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,880
You'll see that they're being highlighted on the page.

82
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,830
So that's how we can get all elements on a page by using the get elements by tag name method.

83
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,960
So I'm going to close this and I am going to return to the accordion page.

84
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,630
So I'm going to do one more example, and this time I'm going to use the query, select the method,

85
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:38,790
and what I'm going to do is select this header and use JavaScript to interact with it.

86
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,320
So I'm going to do this by right clicking and inspect them.

87
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,260
I'm going to focus on that hate to Heather.

88
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,770
And we can see as a hate to element of an idea of content.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,390
So I'm going to go to console and I'm going to write.

90
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,290
Document Dot.

91
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,300
Query selector.

92
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
And then in brackets.

93
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
The single quotes.

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,780
I'm going to provide that I.D..

95
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,920
It was content.

96
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,380
And I'm going to use another method which is code in a HTML.

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,520
Now that is going to equal.

98
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,169
And I'm going to equal.

99
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,539
It's a hello world.

100
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,950
It was semi-colon at the end.

101
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,460
So what do you think will happen when I present you?

102
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,040
Let's try it.

103
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:59,620
And you can see that the hate to element text has changed by using JavaScript.

104
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,750
So I was able to select using the query, select the method.

105
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,760
The hate to element by side they.

106
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,180
And then I used the method of inner turmoil.

107
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,090
So it's the inner HTML of the H two element.

108
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,810
Was to equal the value of hello world.

109
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:26,630
So I hope you found this introduction to some common JavaScript methods useful.

110
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:33,950
And in the next couple of lectures, I'll show you how we can use JavaScript within our Selenium tests.

111
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,750
Thank you for watching.
