00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.790
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.670
We have reached a major milestone.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.350
So far.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.130
We have been working towards building core selenium web driver skills, and we're now in a position

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.370
to start learning about framework, tools and techniques.

6
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.400
Our journey so far has covered some of the following topics.

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.760
These are all topics that are key to gaining a core Selenium Web driver skill set.

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.740
We then use these topics as we start building our frameworks.

9
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.470
The journey ahead consists of the following.

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.250
So we have achieved learning course, linear web driver skills, and now we're going to learn about

11
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.050
framework, tools and techniques.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.750
And these are tools and techniques that are used to create a framework for which we learn in phases.

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.110
Then we're going to combine our core skills and our framework tools and technique knowledge to start

14
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.430
building native projects.

15
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.800
So for example, towards the end of this course, I teach you about cucumber BDD, and then we integrate

16
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.220
cucumber BDD into our Third Life project.

17
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.210
Framework tools and techniques.

18
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.580
So we'll be covering a number of different modules to gain knowledge of the tools and techniques that

19
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.950
are used to create automation frameworks.

20
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.970
Each twin technique will have its own dedicated section and will go over each tone technique in detail

21
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.050
with examples.

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.200
And once completed, we move on to the next module.

23
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.980
Once we reach a checkpoint, we'll create a framework using what we have learned so far.

24
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.510
Who then continued to learn additional framework tools and techniques and repeat the cycle.

25
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.880
So framework end to end test, then once we've reached a major checkpoint.

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
Q In the framework tools and techniques section, we then start creating an end to end framework.

27
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.920
This framework will combine our core skills and new framework tools and technique knowledge.

28
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.190
Once complete, it would then look at the next set of framework tools and techniques and repeat the

29
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.760
cycle.

30
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.790
Gradually will widen our knowledge and have a wide array of skills that will cover various scenarios.

31
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.810
So I hope this has made it clear what's ahead.

32
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.180
And let's continue with this journey.
