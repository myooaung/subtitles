WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.870
So we need to interact with this personal information page.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.950
So I need to select a gender and we have two options.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.940
Mr. or Mrs..

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.740
We need to enter first name and last name and an email address.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.360
I'm not going to create an account as these are optional fields and the only other mandatory element

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.970
is to take this.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.540
I agree to the terms and conditions before selecting the continue button.

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.660
So if I go back to the clips and look at my page objects, we can see that we have all the form pers

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.140
info.

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.060
And this page object contains those locators that we need in order to interact with that page.

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.810
So in my test class, I'm going to create a new object of all the form pass info.

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:05.180
So I'm going to write order form plus info and I'm going to call it P info equals new order form pers

13
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.240
info and I'm going to pass the driver object.

14
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.210
And once I import this.

15
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.280
Those errors will then go away.

16
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:24.370
And then guns use an object p info and I'm going to click a right to dot and then right gets and you'll

17
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.530
see all the methods that I have available.

18
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.410
So I'm going to select the Ms. the gender, so I'm going to use the get gender.

19
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.800
Mr..

20
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.010
The method and I would need to click it.

21
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.110
I'm again going to use a p info object and again get and I need to provide a value to the first name.

22
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.950
So I'm going to use the get first name field method.

23
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.400
And as I need to send a value to the textbox, I'm going to use the same keys and I'm going to simply

24
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.710
send the name John.

25
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.560
I'm going to use an object again that this time for the last name field.

26
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.740
Again, I need to send keys to send the value.

27
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.740
And I'm going to give a name of Smith.

28
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.210
So that should select the gender.

29
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.430
Enter first name.

30
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.160
Last name.

31
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.700
So I need to enter an email address and then select.

32
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.530
I agree to the terms conditions.

33
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.610
So using that same object and use gets.

34
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.040
And I have a method of get email filled.

35
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.740
And I'm going to say in case.

36
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.250
And I'm just going to use a email address of John Smith at test dot com.

37
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.370
If a user object one more time.

38
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.580
I need to find a method.

39
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.540
That will select or relocate the get terms and conditions, which is this method here.

40
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.280
And I simply need to click it.

41
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.120
So that should enter all the mandatory information.

42
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.990
And so the only other thing I'd need to do is select the Continue button.

43
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.110
So again, I'm going to use that object one more time.

44
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.040
And I'm looking for a method to select that button.

45
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.420
And I have a method here called Get Continue Button, which I simply need to click.

46
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.450
So I am going to just add another thread.

47
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.110
Don't sleep.

48
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.200
So what I've decided is once I finish writing this test completely, I'll remove all these for dot sleeps

49
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.670
is only for demonstration purposes so you can see what the test is doing.

50
00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.820
So I am going to save it at this point and I am going to try run in the order complete test again to

51
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.840
see how far we get.

52
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.170
So you can see that the test functioned as we expected.

53
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.050
And what we actually did was get as far as entering all this information.

54
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.100
So let me just quickly replicate this.

55
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.800
And as the terms and conditions are already selected, I can simply press continue.

56
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.680
It would then take us to the addresses page.

57
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.940
So on this page we need to enter the mandatory information.

58
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.700
But notice that the first name and last name has already been entered.

59
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.780
Because this has been brought across from the impersonal information page.

60
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.840
So all we need to do here is enter the mandatory fields, which is the address the city, the state,

61
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.730
which is a dropdown menu, the zip or postal code, the country which again is a dropdown menu value

62
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.790
as there's only one value and it's predefined.

63
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.650
We don't really need to select this.

64
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.190
And the user's address for invoice too is already checked.

65
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.480
So all we need to do once we've entered the postal code is Click Continue Button.

66
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.470
So I'm going to go back to Eclipse.

67
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.880
And if I look at my page object classes, you'll see that I have a order form, delivery page object.

68
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.110
And if I openness.

69
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.510
Enclosed is upper class.

70
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.410
You'll see that these are all the elements I need to interact with that delivery page.

71
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.120
So in my test I am going to create a new object based on the order form delivery page.

72
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.040
I'm going to order form delivery.

73
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.260
And I'm going to call it the.

74
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.240
Delivery equals new order form delivery.

75
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.700
And I'm going to pass the driver object.

76
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.410
And if I hover over and import this, those errors wouldn't go away.

77
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.300
So on that page because these are predefined.

78
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.410
The next one I need to interact with is this address filled?

79
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.060
So I am going to use an object.

80
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.030
Thoughts get.

81
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:06.540
And if I look through these methods, you'll see that the one I need is get a address filled.

82
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:16.280
So I'm going to select that and I need to send the value and I'm going to send a value of 1 to 3 Main

83
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.540
Street.

84
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.380
The next element I need to interact with is the city.

85
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.140
So I am going to use that same object.

86
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.020
And they'll get.

87
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:42.090
And if I look to see if there is a city method which there is get city method and I'm going to use the

88
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.600
same keys method to send a value of Houston.

89
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.600
The next element is the state.

90
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.300
So remember, the state is a dropdown menu, so we need to use the select class.

91
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.020
So I'm going to call it select state.

92
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.780
Eco's new select.

93
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:18.430
And inside these brackets, I need to provide a locator, so I'm going to pass the order delivery object.

94
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:19.870
Don't get.

95
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.980
And if I look down, you'll see that I've got an option or method called get state dropdown menu.

96
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:40.210
So once I've written that, I can then use the state object and I can select by visible text.

97
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.250
And I am going to be sending a value.

98
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.080
Of Texas.

99
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.150
So.

100
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.250
So I'm going to be selecting a value of Texas.

101
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.510
So that should then select Texas from the state dropdown menu.

102
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.910
So the next element is the zip postal code.

103
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:10.070
So I am going to use the order delivery object again.

104
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.380
So get in.

105
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.730
If I scroll down you'll see that I've got a method called get post code filled.

106
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.810
And again, I need to send keys.

107
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.830
And I am going to send a zip code of.

108
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.130
77021.

109
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.850
So once I've entered that.

110
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.540
The country is already pre-defined, as there's only one option on this web page.

111
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.370
So I don't need to interact with it.

112
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.570
So the only other element that I need to select here is the continue button.

113
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:57.460
So if I use order delivery again don't get you'll see that I have a method forget continue button.

114
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.740
And I would need to click this.

115
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.630
So again I am going to add afraid that sleep to slow it down a little just to see if the.

116
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.310
Test works as we expect it to.

117
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.900
I'm just going to reduce these.

118
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.900
Fred got sleep so it runs a little bit quicker.

119
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.180
So if I save this class and try running it, let's see if it works.

120
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.730
So you can see that the test functioned as expected.

121
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.750
Once we entered this information.

122
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.450
So if I just fill in some information here.

123
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.020
So we are then presented with the shipping method page.

124
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:16.380
So here we have one option, which is to select my caviar, which is already selected.

125
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.400
We also have an option to add a comment about the order.

126
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:28.370
So all I'm going to do on this page is select this textbox and add a comment and then click Continue,

127
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.820
which should then take us to the payment web page.

128
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.540
So if I go back to my test and if I look on my left hand side.

129
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.700
Let's see what page objects we can use here.

130
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.720
So we have a page object called order form ship in method.

131
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.090
And this is the page object that relates to this ship in method page.

132
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:59.750
So I have a delivery message textbox, which will get the textbox to add a comment and another element

133
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.540
to continue to select the continue button.

134
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:11.380
So in my mind test I am going to use or create an object based on the order, form and method class.

135
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:22.250
So I'm going through order form ship in method and call it ship method equals new.

136
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.890
If I just copy paste this and pass the driver object.

137
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.290
And then simply need to import this.

138
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.900
And the error goes away.

139
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:44.090
So the first thing I'm going to do now is use that ship method, object, don't get and I'm going to

140
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:49.400
use the get delivery message text box method and I'm going to send keys.

141
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.990
And the comment I'm going to leave is if I am not in.

142
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:02.320
Please leave my delivery on my porch.

143
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:13.320
I'm then going to use that ship method object again, but this time I'm going to use the get continue

144
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.190
button method.

145
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.260
And I would need to click it.

146
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.050
So I'm not going to demonstrate the test at this point.

147
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.420
So I'm going to continue to the payment and then that will be the test complete.

148
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.680
So I am going to simply copy that message.

149
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.920
On the web page like so if I click continue.

150
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.240
We are then presented with the payment page.

151
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.100
So we have two options here.

152
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.040
Pay by cheque or pay by bank wire.

153
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.760
And we also have an element to agree to the terms of service.

154
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:58.490
And once we've made those selections, we can then select the order we have an obligation to pay.

155
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:07.990
So if I go back to my test and we look at our page objects, we can see that we have all the form payments.

156
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.370
And if I open it.

157
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.530
These are the elements that relate to that Web page.

158
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.070
So on my main test, I'm going to create a new object using order form.

159
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.450
Payments.

160
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.370
And I'm going to call it order pay equals new.

161
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.860
Just copy this over here, and I'm going to pass the driver.

162
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.560
I'll need to import that.

163
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.570
And I will go.

164
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.760
And now for user order.

165
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.760
Pay object.

166
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:55.590
Go get your see I've got an option of using either the get paid by check radio button or get paid by

167
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.620
a radio button.

168
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:02.740
So I'm going to select the check radio button and I would need to click it.

169
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.530
And then guns use that object again.

170
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.930
But this time I'm going to get the get terms condition checkbox.

171
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.250
And I am also going to click that to.

172
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.680
So that will select this and then it will select this.

173
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:29.650
And by doing so, this order we have an obligation to pay button will be selectable.

174
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.720
So I need to now select this button.

175
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.730
So again, I'm going to use order pay.

176
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.210
Thoughts get.

177
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:47.670
And you can see that I have got get for the button which the method and all I need to do is click it.

178
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.800
So that is our test complete.

179
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.830
And once they select this button.

180
00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.260
You should see that will see a message saying your order is confirmed.

181
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:08.550
So I am going to add a few more Fred slips just so that we can see what is happening.

182
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.260
So if I save this test now.

183
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:18.940
And run it.

184
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.900
We should see a full end to end test.

185
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.410
And you can see the our test functioned as we expected.

186
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.730
And the test has passed as listed here.

187
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.500
So congratulations.

188
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:15.170
You've just created a full entrance test using the page object model.

189
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:21.540
Similar to how a user would interact with the website in order to make a purchase.

190
00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:29.470
So we have used the page object model and the page object classes are what store the elements for each

191
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.400
page as well as methods to access those locators.

192
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:40.430
So this means if those web pages were ever to change, say, a web developer made a change to the actual

193
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:48.500
page itself, then all we'd need to do is update the page object classes for our test to inherit those

194
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.130
changes.

195
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.990
So this is a big achievement and well done for following along.

196
00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:00.860
In the next lecture we will construct a number test which will be much shorter, but I'll show you how

197
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:07.370
we can delete an item from the cards as well as to check the total amount is the amount we expect in

198
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.690
use in an assertion.

199
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.640
Thank you for watching.
