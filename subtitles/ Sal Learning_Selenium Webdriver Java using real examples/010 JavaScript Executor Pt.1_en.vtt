00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.610
In this lecture we explore the use of the JavaScript executable, and this is part one of two parts

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.300
of lectures.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.370
So what is the JavaScript executable?

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.460
JavaScript executable is an interface that helps to execute JavaScript through sitting in web driver.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.520
It allows you to interact directly with the HTML dom of the web page by executing JavaScript expressions.

6
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.880
It provides a way to automate a user interaction, even when the page is not fully loaded or elements

7
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.940
are placed in a way that the direct interaction is blocked.

8
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.240
So when could we use it?

9
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.430
Sometimes web controls don't react well when using selenium commands.

10
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.200
If we come across a situation where our Selenium tests are not fully functional.

11
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.220
What I don't function as would expect, and that could be for various reasons.

12
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.470
Then we will also have the option to interact with the web page using JavaScript.

13
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.170
For example, say we have a button on a web page and for some reason we can't click on it.

14
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.940
But the standard Selenium methods.

15
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.190
We could instead click the button.

16
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.110
By executing JavaScript via selenium.

17
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.830
Using the JavaScript executes our interface.

18
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.720
So let's keep it simple.

19
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.260
In the following video, I'm going to demonstrate how I send a JavaScript command using my Selenium

20
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.070
Java code.

21
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.550
The objective of my code is to send JavaScript to the browser using selenium to scroll down the page

22
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.870
by 200 pixels.

23
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.890
I will be visiting a web page, an automation test in the code at UK.

24
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.250
Wait for the page to load, execute JavaScript to scroll down on a web page without interacting with

25
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.180
any elements.

26
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.580
By the way, we go through disco step by step in the next lecture.

27
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.300
So let's see an action.

28
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.410
So as I have mentioned, your objective of this particular lecture is just to provide you with a demonstration

29
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.110
of JavaScript code being sent to the browser through signing in web driver.

30
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.820
So to walk you through the test, I'm simply going to go to the automation testing website and I'm going

31
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.490
to send JavaScript to the browser to simply scroll down 200 pixels.

32
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.680
So I've written this code already for you.

33
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.330
But I will add this code to the lecture as an attachment for you to download if you acquire.

34
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.530
So do not take note of the details of this code for now.

35
00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.960
I would explain exactly how it works in the next lecture, but do notice that I'm using JavaScript at

36
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.590
this point.

37
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:11.270
And if I copy this and go to the automation testing website and open up the developer developer panel

38
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.100
and click on the console tab if I pass that command here.

39
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.770
Watch what happens when I press enter.

40
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.630
You can see that by using JavaScript, I was able to scroll down on the page.

41
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.420
So I'm now going to run this code.

42
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.620
And let's see what happens.

43
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.160
And you can see that the window also scroll down.

44
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:56.420
But this time I was using Java code and send in a JavaScript command using Selenium web driver to the

45
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.960
browser.

46
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.590
So I hope that was a useful demonstration for now.

47
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.540
And let's go through the code in detail in the next lecture.
