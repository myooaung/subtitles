00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.300
In this lecture, I'm going to demonstrate how we can create a MAVEN project using command prompt.

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.450
So if I go back to the website where it has the Quickstart template, you'll see it as a usage section

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.690
here.

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.810
And there is a command which is provided.

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.940
So this is what we can use in command prompt to generate the project in if I copy that.

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.280
A tape that I recommend is open up notepad and then paste in it.

7
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.860
So I need to add to this to add my own group D and artifact I.D. And I can do this by using Dash D.

8
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.720
And then I'm going to use group.

9
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:56.050
I thi with a capital I and it's going to equal for me UK echo dots automation testing.

10
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.950
I then need to add my own artifact guide.

11
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.350
So again, I'm going to use that capitalized D and then I am going to type i.

12
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.520
R t.

13
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.690
I f i c t i the with the capital i and it's going to equal the project name.

14
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.700
So I'm going to call this.

15
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.400
Maven.

16
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.660
Seemed like so.

17
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.370
So I'm going to keep this in notepad for now.

18
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.970
And what I'm going to do next is open up Windows Explorer, and I'm going to go to my desktop.

19
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.610
And go to my resources folder and then I'm going to double click into the workspace folder.

20
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.160
So here you can see my project from the last lecture.

21
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.610
So I am going to copy this path.

22
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.030
And then I'm going to open up command prompt.

23
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.420
And I'm going to use the command C D which stands for Change Directory and I'm going to paste that path

24
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.350
and click Enter.

25
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.820
So you now see that I'm in that path.

26
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.470
And so I am going to go back to Notepad and now copy this.

27
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.610
And then go back to command prompt and paste it.

28
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.280
And then I'm going to select Enter.

29
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.680
So you'll see that Maven begins generating the project for you.

30
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.150
So it asked me to define value for property version.

31
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.880
So I'm just going to leave that blank and click Enter.

32
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.520
It then asks you to confirm by song and enter why and then click Enter.

33
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.570
And you can see that the project has now successfully been built.

34
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.000
So this is the first time you use a maven through command prompt.

35
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.920
It may take a while and it may load a number of different other components for you.

36
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.480
But as I've loaded it before, this is why it's taken quick on my screen.

37
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.770
So now I am going to minimize command prompt.

38
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.590
I am going to close this notepad.

39
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.870
And I'm going to close Chrome.

40
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.470
So you can see in my workspace folder, I now have a project called Maven Command.

41
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.470
So if I double click that, you'll see the following two files.

42
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.920
So to import this into eclipse, we need to do one further action here.

43
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.940
We need to run one more command through command line.

44
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.110
I need to do this inside the project structure.

45
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.590
So I am going to highlight this path.

46
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:52.230
Go back to command prompt and I am going to use the command again c d space and then paste that path.

47
00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:02.160
You'll see that I'm now in may even see M.D. and the commander I am going to right here is m the N.

48
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.530
Eclipse.

49
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.000
Colon Eclipse and then click Enter.

50
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.230
And you'll see that build success has completed.

51
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.740
And if I go back to Windows Explorer, you'll see that it's generated these two files.

52
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.370
These two files are what we need to be able to import a MAVEN project into Eclipse.

53
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.820
If I don't have these files, it wouldn't allow me to do it.

54
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.190
So I'm going to go back to Eclipse and I'm going to select file and then import.

55
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:53.240
I'm then going to select Maven and expand it and select existing MAVEN projects and click next.

56
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.170
And then I'm going to use the browser button.

57
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.780
And I'm going to go for my desktop to my resources folder, to my workspace folder, and you'll see

58
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.550
Maven, C and D and if I select that folder off the highlights in it.

59
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.770
You'll see they selected Pond or Exmouth.

60
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.420
And if I click Finish.

61
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.960
You'll see that that project has now been imported.

62
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.880
And it contains the same structure as the last lecture that I demonstrated.

63
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:36.420
So this is how we can generate a project through TMD and also import it into Eclipse.

64
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.610
Thank you for watching.
