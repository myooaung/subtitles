00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.740
In this lecture, we look at how to handle hidden elements in selenium.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.950
So what are hidden elements?

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.830
The hidden app tribute is a boolean attribute, which means it returns a true or false value.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.670
When this attribute is set, it specifies that an element is not yet or is no longer relevant.

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.130
A browser should not display an element that has the hidden attributes set.

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.880
The hidden attribute can also be used to keep a user from seeing an element until a condition has been

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.300
met.

8
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.060
For example, if we had a website and it had a form that asks views if they owned a pet, if they choose

9
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.730
yes, then more options might be revealed.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.250
For example, what type of pet do you own?

11
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.700
So example of a hidden element.

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.540
The hidden attribute has been assigned to a P tag.

13
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.020
The element remains listed in the document object model listed as number one in the image.

14
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.320
It is not displayed to the user via the browser.

15
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.490
If the hidden attribute was removed from the P tag, it would be displayed in the line marked number

16
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.390
two in the image.

17
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.230
So let's look at the is displayed method.

18
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.130
The IS displayed method is used to verify presence of a web element within the web page.

19
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.600
The method is designed to result from a boolean value.

20
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.490
With each success and failure.

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.890
The method returns a true value if the specified web element is present on the web page and a false

22
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.370
value.

23
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.080
If the web element is not present on the web page, we might write something like Driver to find element,

24
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.260
but the SS selector is displayed.

25
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.520
So let's try this out.

26
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.690
So the first thing I'm going to do is walk you through to test some open up chrome.

27
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.660
I want to go to automation tested and I'm going to click on the Hidden Elements link, which will take

28
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.560
you to this page.

29
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.050
So the section that we're going to be using is this hidden paragraph section.

30
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.150
And the first thing I'm going to do is right click and inspect the page.

31
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.380
So there is actually a hidden P elements paragraph within this text here.

32
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.210
And if I want you to select it all and focus on this section.

33
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.230
If I expand the.

34
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.970
Element like.

35
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.170
So you see that there's a p tag with the hidden attributes that.

36
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.490
But that particular line is not displayed on the Web page because of that hidden attribute.

37
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.910
But if I went to the next element that hasn't got the the hidden attributes that you'll see is displayed

38
00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.180
there.

39
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.770
So we're going to test against this hidden P element and we're also going to test this one as well.

40
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.750
So the first thing I'm going to do is go to Eclipse and I'm going to copy and paste the class in the

41
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:24.890
last lecture, and I'm going to call it L13 for lecture 13 and I'm going to call it Hidden Elements

42
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.700
and then click, okay.

43
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.390
I'm simply going to remove the code we don't require from the last lecture, and I'm going to go back

44
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.160
to the web page and get the URL and paste that into to get a fit.

45
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.610
Like so.

46
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.460
So I'm going to go back to the Web page and I'm going to find that hidden element, which is this one

47
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.230
and using the selected.

48
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.880
So I'm going to click it.

49
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.340
And if I go to runner ups velocity, I'm provider of selectors, so I'm just going to pick this first

50
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.580
one.

51
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.870
And I'm going to go back and I'm going to write driver dot find elements by system selector in quotes.

52
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.980
I'm going to use that selector value and I'm going to use is displayed like so it was semicolon.

53
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.970
So I'm going to go back and I'm also going to get the value of this second one.

54
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:41.480
So I'm just going to take that selector and I'm also going to try driver to find elements by CSF selector.

55
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.940
Again, copy the set.

56
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.830
The value and only use is displayed through a semicolon.

57
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.870
So I am going to test the is displayed method to see if the first selector, the hidden one is displayed

58
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.620
on the web page.

59
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.290
And then I'm going to use is displayed method again for the second one that we know is visible on the

60
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.890
web page.

61
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:12.900
So I need to display the results of these tests in the console and to do that as we have done previously.

62
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.680
I'm going to write a system out of print that will end with brackets and a semicolon.

63
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.320
So I'm going to copy and paste that because I need a second time and what I'm going to do to remove

64
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.210
the semicolon from this line and highlight it and control X to cut it and control B to paste it.

65
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.330
And I'm going to do the same to the second one.

66
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.930
So move the semicolon, control X to cut it and control B to paste it.

67
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.930
So we're going to be running two tests.

68
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.360
The first one is for the hidden element, and the second one is the one that is about is is visible.

69
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.460
So I'm going to save this and I'm going to try running the test.

70
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.120
So if we go back.

71
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.850
You see, the first one because it's hidden is returned false and because the second one was visible

72
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.480
so it is displayed on the web page.

73
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.070
Is return true?

74
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.440
I hope you found this select useful and thank you for watching.
