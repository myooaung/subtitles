00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,770
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,400
So this section is going to focus on more advanced features available in Selenium Web driver.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,880
And we're also going to explore some more complicated websites and how we can interact with them.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,950
So this lecture and the next is going to focus on a travel website.

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,120
So what is the problem?

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,230
So some websites have quite complicated designs and the degree of difficulty in being able to interact

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,820
with elements can vary.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,820
A prime example of a fairly complicated group of elements is the input fields that you often find on

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,900
travel websites.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,070
These are often difficult because of validation rules.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,510
Because of predictive text.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,490
Difficulty to read the dom.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,280
And no easy to use locator.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,250
So my plan or our plan is that we're going to review a travel website called easyJet.

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,420
Understand how the flight search panel works.

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,990
Understand that the from end to flight validation moves.

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,750
Practice how to select a result by using visible text.

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,990
And we're going to discuss the approach that we need to use.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,860
So let's begin.

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,280
So the first thing I'm going to do is take a look at the website to see how it functions.

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,590
So I'm going to open up Chrome and I'm going to search easyJet.

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,040
And the first result should be to easyJet dot com.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,170
So you should be presented with a website similar to this.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,600
And the main focus is on this flight search panel.

25
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:59,660
And we had the ability to enter a from location A to destination the parts in and return in dates and

26
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,540
also selected the number of passengers that will be flying.

27
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,980
You can search for flight results based on these criteria.

28
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,030
So you'll notice that London Gatwick is pre-selected in the from filled.

29
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,010
And if I select the two fields and type in the character of a.

30
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm presented with results that begin with my that fly from London Gatwick.

31
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,640
Sir.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,700
Note that there's Aberdeen and Agadir in Morocco.

33
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,510
If I changed the from location to London Luton.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,450
And then search for the character of again, you'll see there's different results.

35
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,180
So that flight to Morocco is no longer available.

36
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,220
But instead I can fly to Aberdeen, Alicante.

37
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,950
And the reason for that is that depending on where you're flying from.

38
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,990
There's only certain destinations you can fly to based on flights from that particular airport.

39
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:14,180
So what I'm trying to test in this particular example is as me as a user, I want to come to this website

40
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,350
and in the from field I want to type in the value of London.

41
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,930
And you can see that there are a number of airports within the London zone.

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:33,510
So after Typekit in London, I want to be able to select a particular value based on the visible text

43
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,130
that is presented to me.

44
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,760
So I want to select London Luton.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,040
So I am going to search for a phrase that has Luton in its name.

46
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,110
So the approach that I will be using here is type in London to get the results of all the airports that

47
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,340
are in London zone.

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,810
I then need to store all these results in a list.

49
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,380
And then need to loop through that list to search for one that has gluten in its name.

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,870
And when I have selected that particular results, I want to click it so that London Luton appears in

51
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,890
the from field.

52
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,709
So this is good practice.

53
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:27,210
So we're going to be using a list, we're going to be use in a loop, and we are likely going to also

54
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,700
need to use an explicit weight.

55
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,190
So let's begin.

56
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,490
So as we're in a new section of this course, I am going to right click the source folder, select new

57
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:47,560
and then select package, and I'm going to give this new package a name of section zero eight and then

58
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,310
click Finish.

59
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,830
I'm then going to right click that new package, go to new and class, and I'm going to give this a

60
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,810
name of l01 under school travel.

61
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,600
Website.

62
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:05,520
P.

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,210
T.

64
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,720
One.

65
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,910
And I am going to select public static void main and then click Finish.

66
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,650
So this will creates a new class.

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:25,550
So to save time, I'm just going to copy the set up code from our chrome demo class.

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,420
So I'm going to highlight these lines.

69
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,570
Control C on my keyboard to copy it.

70
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,140
And then I'm just going to paste it here like so.

71
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,980
And then I can close the Chrome demo class.

72
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,280
So the first thing I'm going to do here is update the address.

73
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,480
So I'm going to copy easy jet.com forward slash end.

74
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,290
And paste it like so.

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,160
So I am now going to save this class.

76
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,850
And I am going to try running it.

77
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,380
Because I would like to show you something before we begin.

78
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,290
So you'll notice that when I first come in to this website, you're presented with a cookies panel.

79
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,770
And we have the option to let me choose or accept or cookies.

80
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,490
So you didn't see this before?

81
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,850
Because I had visited the website in the past.

82
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,330
But when a new session opens this website, we need to handle these cookies panel.

83
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,710
So if I right click and inspect the acceptable button.

84
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,480
And if I get to select it all and select it.

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,950
You'll see that the element is then presented to you.

86
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,960
So this pattern has an I.D., which is a unique property.

87
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:07,340
So I am going to copy the I.D. and I'm going to go to Eclipse and I'm going to write Driver to find

88
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,890
elements, buyer I.D. and then I am going to pay that value.

89
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,660
Then I am going to click that button using the Click Command.

90
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,810
So now if I say this class.

91
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,280
And try running it again.

92
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,900
We should see that I cookies panel will be closed.

93
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,860
As shown.

94
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,270
So now we can begin using or testing against the from field.

95
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,960
So we'll begin writing this code in the next lecture.
