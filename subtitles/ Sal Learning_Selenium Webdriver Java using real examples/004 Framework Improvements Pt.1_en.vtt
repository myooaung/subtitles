WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.800
So let's begin improving our framework.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.150
So I'm first glance open up the base page just to go over some key points.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.720
So I'm using public static web driver driver here.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.650
And this set driver method is what initializes the driver.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.480
So I'm going to be transferring a lot of this into a new class.

6
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.410
So under the source main Java folder and under the base package, I'm going to right click select new

7
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:40.520
and select class and this class is going to be called Web Driver Instance and then I'm going to click

8
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.000
Finish.

9
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.770
So as mentioned previously, this new class is what's going to be responsible for initializing the driver.

10
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.620
And I also want to use Fred Local.

11
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.370
So the first thing I'm going to be doing in this class is write in public.

12
00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.840
Static.

13
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.550
Fred.

14
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.250
Local points he brackets.

15
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.370
And inside those pointy brackets, I'm going to define the type which is Web driver.

16
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.350
I'm going to give this variable a name of driver equals new.

17
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
Fred Local.

18
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.920
Empty pointy brackets, empty round brackets and a semicolon.

19
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.500
So you can see I need to import Web driver.

20
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.890
Once I do that, that ever goes away.

21
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.940
So this is very similar to this line here.

22
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
But the key difference is that I'm using Fred local.

23
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.200
So the next thing I need to do is create a new method.

24
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.800
So I'm going to call this method public static web driver.

25
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.170
Get driver.

26
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.310
So this method is going to be responsible for checking the Fred to see if it's in use.

27
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.420
If it's not in use, then we're going to set the Fred local variable to use the driver.

28
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.870
So I'm going to right here.

29
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.540
If.

30
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.630
Driver dot get so get is a Fred local method.

31
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.620
Equals No.

32
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.900
Then I want to do something.

33
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.970
So what I'm going to do is use a tri catch statement.

34
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.770
So I'm going to try.

35
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.410
An open and close embrace.

36
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.710
Driver dot set.

37
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.530
And inside the set brackets, I need to provide a method.

38
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.080
So I haven't got that method yet.

39
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.930
So I'm going to put an X in as a placeholder.

40
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.160
Next after the closing.

41
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.270
Try a brace.

42
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.100
I'm going to write Catch.

43
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.580
And I'm going to have an opening close in bracket.

44
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.810
And inside here I'm going to write my own exception a.

45
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.990
An open and close embrace.

46
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.050
And I'm going to use a parameter.

47
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.540
To print stack trace.

48
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.720
So just to walk you through this again, I'm checking to see if the Fred has the driver set.

49
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.000
So if the Fred is empty so it's not being used, it's going to equal.

50
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.390
No.

51
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.610
And so I never want to set that, Fred.

52
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.150
By using whatever method I place here.

53
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.260
If the driver doesn't equal know so it is in use, then it will execute the catch part.

54
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.630
This statement and it was simply prince in error.

55
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.630
So the next thing I need to do is create another method.

56
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.570
And this method is going to be called public.

57
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.680
Static Web driver.

58
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.520
Create driver.

59
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.920
So this method is going to be responsible for initializing the driver object similar to what we do in

60
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.280
here.

61
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.290
So I need to create a local variable here.

62
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.660
So a local variable can only be accessed from the method that it belongs to.

63
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.890
So I'm going to write Web Driver Driver, and it's going to equal a no value.

64
00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.690
After this line and then I need to use or access the config the properties file to know what driver

65
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.910
needs to be initialized.

66
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.120
So I'm going to simply copy this code here from the base page.

67
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.010
And then I'm going to paste it like so.

68
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.350
But you can see there is a error on the prop and that's because I need to define properties.

69
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.880
Then you see it as an error here because we need to add a froze declaration.

70
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.720
And once they decided that error goes away but is still a never at the top here because he's expecting

71
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.830
a return statement.

72
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.240
So once we have that property's variable set, the next thing I'm going to do is go back to the base

73
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.090
page and from this return driver, line up to the first if statement.

74
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.220
I'm going to copy that and I'm going to paste it here like so.

75
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.860
And you can see that those errors have now gone away.

76
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.790
So that's this method complete.

77
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:13.730
So the only other thing I need to do now is create one more method and to go back and set a method name

78
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.440
into these brackets here.

79
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.420
So at the bottom here, I am going to create a new method which is going to be responsible for cleaning

80
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.170
up the session and removing the variables from the front.

81
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.760
So I'm going to call it public static void clean up driver.

82
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.780
And all I need to simply right here is driver.

83
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.010
Dot get.

84
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.080
Dot.

85
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.700
Quit.

86
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.430
And underneath that lion driver thought remove.

87
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:04.670
So if I go back up now, you'll remember I have a place holder here, so I am going to set the driver

88
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.710
using this method that I have now created.

89
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.760
So I am going to copy crate driver.

90
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.500
And pace it like so.

91
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.510
And the only other thing that I need to do is add a return statement.

92
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.620
So after this brace here I am going to write a return driver.

93
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.400
Dot gets.

94
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.350
It was semi-colon.

95
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.030
And that is this class now complete.

96
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.020
So let me just walk you through it one more time.

97
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.390
So I've created a new field here that uses Fred local with the name of Driver.

98
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.110
This method named get driver is checking to see if the frets in use.

99
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:54.600
If it's not in use, then I want to set the driver variable using this great driver method.

100
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.900
If the driver is in-use, then it will show an error.

101
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.190
We've also created a new method here called Create Driver.

102
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.630
And we have set a local variable here.

103
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.820
So if I was to comment this local variable.

104
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.160
Well.

105
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.750
You'll see that there's errors here.

106
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.380
And that's because this driver is referring to this field here instead.

107
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.140
But by using a local variable, these are now using this driver.

108
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.650
So we've seen this before, so I'm not going to talk for it much.

109
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.490
We're doing is access in the conflict properties to find what browser we need to use and it will load

110
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.520
the relevant driver for that particular browser.

111
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.840
Last.

112
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.930
We have a new method here called cleanup driver.

113
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:57.090
So all this method does is it quits the session for a particular friend and it sets the variable back

114
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.750
to no.

115
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.600
By using the remove fred local method.

116
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.300
So that is this web drive, for instance, class now complete.

117
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.990
In the next lecture, we'll start making some adjustments to the base page.
