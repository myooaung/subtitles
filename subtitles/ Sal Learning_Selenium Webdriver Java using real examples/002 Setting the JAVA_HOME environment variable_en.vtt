00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.540
So in this lecture we learn about the Java underscore home environment variable and how we can set it.

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.450
So what is the Java underscore home variable?

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.130
Java underscore home is an operating system environment variable, which is usually set after the installation

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.570
of either the Java development kits or the Java runtime environment.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.740
The Java underscore home environment variable points to the filesystem location where the JDK or Java

6
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.580
was installed.

7
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.200
The variable should be configured on all operating systems that have a Java installation.

8
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.460
So why do we set a Java underscore home variable?

9
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.200
The environment variable is used by programs that require Java at runtime.

10
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.130
The program will query the operating system for the Java underscore home variable to find out where

11
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.510
the runtime is installed.

12
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.570
After the location of the JDK or Java installation is found, those programs can initiate Java based

13
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.410
processes.

14
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.870
So let's make a start.

15
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.330
Set a neat Java home variable on Windows.

16
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.520
So before we begin in the search bar, I'm going to type CMD and then open up command prompt.

17
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.550
So I'm going to prove that the JDK is yet to be installed.

18
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.520
So I'm going to type Java Space Hyphen version and click Enter.

19
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.750
And you see Java is not recognized.

20
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.230
And this is because the environment variable has not been set yet.

21
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.660
So I'm going to close that.

22
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.130
And in the search part again, I'm going to type system.

23
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:54.230
Space envy and you should be presented with a system environment variable button, which, if we click,

24
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.090
will open up the foreign panel.

25
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.270
So you can see at the bottom we have environment variables and if I click on that button, it should

26
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.500
present the following.

27
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.430
So this is where we can set these system variables.

28
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.470
So there's two sections to this.

29
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.470
At the top is the user variables for admin, and this is where I'm going to set Java underscore home

30
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.080
and in the system variables at the bottom.

31
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.170
I just need to edit the existing path variable.

32
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.020
So under the admin variable section, I'm going to select the new button.

33
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.730
And under variable name, I'm going to type Java in capital letters underscore home.

34
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.610
And then I need to provide a variable value which is going to point to the JDK folder.

35
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.890
If I click browse directory.

36
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.250
And then if I scroll down on this panel, we're trying to locate the resources folder where the JDK

37
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.970
resides.

38
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.750
So if I expand on this resources folder, you'll see at the top level is the JDK folder and this is

39
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.950
what I need to highlight.

40
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.660
So if I click okay, that path would then be populated.

41
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.000
And you can see is for reference in the JDK folder.

42
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.890
If I click okay, that java underscore home variable is now set.

43
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.850
In the bottom section, I'm going to edit the existing path system variable.

44
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.240
So if a highlighted and then if I click the edit button, you'll see some existing paths.

45
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.610
So I need to add to this.

46
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.370
So what I'm going to do is click the new button.

47
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.610
And then, you see, I need to provide a path.

48
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.850
So I'm then going to select the browser Batson.

49
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.800
And the difference to this is that I need to go to the resources folder again a scrolling down and expand

50
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.010
it.

51
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.660
Instead of selecting the JDK folder, I need to instead find the bin folder, which is a sub folder

52
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.210
so you can see bin is highlighted.

53
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.280
But click okay.

54
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.280
That path would now be populated.

55
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.340
So this is all we need to do.

56
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.370
And now we can click okay and click okay again.

57
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.920
And then if we click okay on this one panel, those system variables have now been set.

58
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.589
So now if I search for command, prompt again and type in that same command.

59
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.230
Java space hyphen version and now click enter.

60
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.130
You'll see the open JDK has been found.

61
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.130
So this confirms it's working and this lecture is showing you how to set the Java home variable.

62
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.320
Let's move on to the next lecture.
