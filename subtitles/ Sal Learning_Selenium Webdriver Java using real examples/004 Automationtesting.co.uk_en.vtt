00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.730
In this lecture, we look at a dedicated website that comes bundled with this course, which has been

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.650
designed to support your learning.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.600
So what is the best way to learn?

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.070
In my opinion, is by using billboard examples, by testing against a variety of different scenarios.

5
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.340
By using scenarios that vary in complexity.

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.020
By staying organized and having a central repository.

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.070
And that's why I'd like to welcome you to.

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.560
Automation testing the code at UK.

9
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.590
Automation Test Encoder UK is a website I have developed to help support your learning.

10
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.290
It consists of a number of different scenarios and elements you would often find across the web.

11
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.260
On the left hand side is a menu.

12
00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.790
And if I select one of these links such as the Buttons Link, it will show you a Buttons page and he

13
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.800
can interact with the button examples.

14
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.960
So for example, if I click on button one, it pops up an alert.

15
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.340
If I show you the contact us form page, you'll see a contact us form.

16
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.420
And here I can provide data and try submitted.

17
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.150
This works like a contact us form you'd find across many websites.

18
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.840
So if I was submitted without entering data.

19
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.660
You see, they froze in error because some of that data is mandatory.

20
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.380
So there are various pages that you can explore here.

21
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.770
So I'm not going to go through all of them now, but I will show you the test or link.

22
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.990
So when I click on Test Store, it will take you to a e-commerce store, which we can use to develop

23
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.040
our test scripts.

24
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.780
So the good thing about this eCommerce store is that it can replicate real user behavior.

25
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.530
So for example, I can look at products one.

26
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.120
I can select the size for this particular T-shirt and add it to my cart.

27
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.430
On income follow a full end to end process where I can go all the way to proceeding and checking out

28
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.150
the product and replicate paying for the item.

29
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.680
So this website is key to this course.

30
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:35.610
So I develop a framework which varies in complexity as we progress and we make use of these websites

31
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.830
in order to replicate tests that you may find in the real world.

32
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.640
I hope you found this useful.

33
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.710
Let's move on to the next lecture.
