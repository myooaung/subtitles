00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.910
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.710
This section is called Quick Java and its purpose is to provide a one stop shop intro to the Java programming

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.310
language.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.100
So first, let me give you some advice.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.780
If you are completely new to programming, then I recommend you take a course dedicated to Java programming.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
Programming in general takes dedication and time to learn.

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.580
But there is nothing stopping you from mastering it.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.610
If you put the time and effort in, this course is not dedicated to teaching you Java.

9
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.580
Its main purpose is to teach you selenium.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.200
Web driver use in Java.

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.580
I have dedicated a whole section to Java just to help get those less experienced up to speed.

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.030
Remember always continue to learn.

13
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.930
So this section of this course is designed to be direct, quick and said appointees.

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.210
Each letter is designed to be short.

15
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.190
My objective is to get you familiar with Java in the least time possible.

16
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.300
If you wish to learn more about a particular subject, then you can find many useful tutorials across

17
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.750
the web.

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.810
So what is covered in this section?

19
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.700
So the below table is an overview of the subjects we'll be covering.

20
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
And these are some of the key features of the Java programming language.

21
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.100
And we'll go through each of these in a dedicated lecture.

22
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.490
So I hope this has given you an overview of what we're going to cover.

23
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.170
Let's continue learning.
