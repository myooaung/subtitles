00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,560
In this lecture, we take a look at the different types of wipes available in Selenium Web driver.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:16,250
So the first one is called Implicit White, and the implicit white will tell web driver to white for

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,480
a set amount of time before it throws eight.

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,350
No such elements exception.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:31,220
It continuously posed Adam looking for a specific condition and it implies a common up to time limit

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,659
for all cause in a session.

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,560
The default wait time is zero, but will be set to longer if used.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,380
For example, we can set the white to wait for 10 seconds until it froze the error exception.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,010
Implicit weights are set globally.

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,350
This means you set an implicit white once in a test, and if an element can't be found, web driver

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,069
will wait until the global weights limit in real world world terms.

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,250
I found that this weight isn't used very often.

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,330
Next, we have explicit ways to express it.

14
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,880
White Command instructs Web driver to whites until a certain condition occurs before proceeding to the

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,570
next step.

16
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,360
Setting an explicit weight is important in cases where there are certain elements that naturally take

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,500
more time to load.

18
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,350
Explicit ways is more intelligent but can only be applied for specified elements.

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,340
In order to declare explicit weight, one has to use expected conditions, which I'll explain further

20
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,410
when we cover explicit weight in detail.

21
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,880
Explicit weights are the most commonly used weights in my experience.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,440
The last one is known as fluent whites.

23
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:10,160
So the fluent white command instructs the maximum amount of time for selenium Webb driver to wait for

24
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,720
condition to be met.

25
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,150
It also sets the frequency of how often Webb driver will check to see if the condition is met before

26
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,370
throwing a element.

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,150
Not fat, not visible exception.

28
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,370
Flute lines.

29
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,700
Look.

30
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,590
Looks for web element repeatedly at regular intervals until time out happens until the object is found.

31
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,320
Fluent white commands are most useful when interacting with web elements that can sometimes take more

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,880
time than usual to load.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,890
So the flu of mice, in my opinion, are not used very often, but there are some cases where they are

34
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,520
ideal.

35
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:03,400
So the main difference between implicit and explicit ways and these two of the most common to type of

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,540
whites, in my opinion, the implicit white set globally, whereas an explicit way is set to element

37
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,960
level.

38
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,570
So what that means is we only have to set one implicit white in the code.

39
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,600
But for explicit whites, we need to set that against each element that we're looking for within the

40
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,020
code.

41
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,740
So there could be multiple explicit ways within our test.

42
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,910
An implicit white is applied to all elements.

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,280
Whereas an explicit white applies only to that particular element that we've set against.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,580
Implicit weight does not require setting a specific condition, but the explicit weight must always

45
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,690
specify expected conditions on the element to be located.

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,020
Implicit weights are best used when all elements are loaded before the duration time set.

47
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,380
But an explicit way is best used when an element tends to take a while to load.

48
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,310
So I hope this gives you a brief overview of the different type of weights in Selenium.

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,380
And in the next few lectures we're going to go through each one in detail.
