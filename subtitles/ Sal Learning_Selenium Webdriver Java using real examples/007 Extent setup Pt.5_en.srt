1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,740
So at this stage we have now set up the extent manager class and now we've also amended the listeners

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,630
class and also made a slight change to the base page for the screenshot method.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,560
So we're now in a position to start amending our tests.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,670
So I'm going to open up and remove item basket test.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,540
And in here we can start making some changes to use the log in that we've set in the extent manager

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,140
class.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,770
So at the top here inside this add remove item method, this is where the test begins.

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,020
So I'm going to write extent manager.

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,380
Dot log.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,260
And I'm going to add a message here.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
And I am going to write starting.

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,420
Add the move item basket.

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,560
Test.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,819
And I'm just going to add free docs at the end.

15
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,750
So this log is a method.

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,460
From the extent manager, which is to log an information message.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,880
I'm then going to scroll down a little bit more.

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:33,330
So at this point here we are going to the shop home page and then we're clicking on product one.

19
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,040
So underneath shop home page equals new shop home page.

20
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,120
Underneath here I am going to riot.

21
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,970
Extent manager.

22
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,060
Dot.

23
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,080
Pass.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,830
And I'm going to write another message here and say, reached the shop home page.

25
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,380
And this dot pass method refers to a pass message.

26
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,770
So we can add to our tests as with like depend on how much you'd like to report in the actual extent

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,640
report itself.

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,480
So if I copy this line here.

29
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,820
And if I scroll down a little bit more.

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,080
So at this point here, for example, I can pass that message again.

31
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,980
And instead I can say reached the shop product page.

32
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,460
And so these messages will be reported when the code reaches each of these points.

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,460
So you'll see that at this point here I'm select right in option dot select by visible.

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,820
So I'm select in the size which is M for medium.

35
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,810
So underneath this I could write.

36
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,850
Have successfully selected product sites.

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,830
And underneath this one, I could write.

38
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,540
Have successfully.

39
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,330
Increased quantity.

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,240
And then underneath this one is where I'm adding the item to the basket.

41
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,610
Soccer.

42
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:30,790
Right.

43
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,580
Have successfully added product to basket.

44
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,950
So you can add as many of these logs as you desire.

45
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,720
So I think that's enough for this at this point here.

46
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,440
So I'm just going to say this class.

47
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:58,450
And then I am going to open up the other class, which is all a complete test and I am going to do something

48
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:58,880
similar.

49
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,680
So like the previous one, they add remove item basket.

50
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,460
I am going to copy to extent manager dialog.

51
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,530
Start in message.

52
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,410
And I'm going to paste it here at the top.

53
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,810
But instead of add remove item basket.

54
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,130
I am going to replace that with this test name.

55
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,810
So if I scroll down a bit more.

56
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:40,880
At this point here, I'm going to the test store homepage so I am going to write extent manager dot

57
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,580
pass.

58
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,770
And inside that I'm going to write.

59
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,090
Have successfully

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,880
reached.

61
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,070
Store.

62
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,830
Home page like so.

63
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,340
So I'm just going to add a few more these messages.

64
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,340
So here I'm going to say I have successfully.

65
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,410
Clicked on the product.

66
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,520
Underneath this one I'm going to add have successfully.

67
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,530
Reached.

68
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,390
Shop.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,470
Product page.

70
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,750
Underneath here again.

71
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,740
Has successfully.

72
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,840
Selected.

73
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,470
Product size.

74
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,340
Has successfully.

75
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,070
Increased quantity.

76
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,950
Has successfully.

77
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,730
Added item to cart.

78
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,550
I think I'm going to add a few more in this one.

79
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,280
So here.

80
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,290
Have successfully reached.

81
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,340
The shopping cart page.

82
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,140
Have successfully.

83
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,890
Selected.

84
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,980
The.

85
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,910
Promo.

86
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,950
Button.

87
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm just going to add one here.

88
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,210
Successfully selected the check out button.

89
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,940
And I'm just going to add a couple more.

90
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,440
So underneath this one, so this is where we start entering the customer's information.

91
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,240
So have successfully entered customer details.

92
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,170
This section here.

93
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,150
We're entering the delivery information.

94
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,840
Entered delivery info.

95
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,390
Here we select in the shipping method.

96
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,030
Selected the ship in.

97
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,630
Method.

98
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
And here I'm going to have successfully.

99
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,290
Placed order.

100
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,660
So those are the logs that I'm going to place into the autocomplete test.

101
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,790
So I'm now going to save that.

102
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,150
And I just want to go back now once we've done those logs to the add remove item basket test.

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,470
So if I scroll down, you'll remember we have an assertion here where we check in the total amount and

104
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,470
we're looking for a value of 4520 free.

105
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,190
So the issue that we have here is that because we we have an assertion there could be two results.

106
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,420
A pass will fail.

107
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,120
But how can we do that?

108
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,850
Because we don't know until the test executes whether to output a pass or fail or log.

109
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,260
So what we can do in that case is that we can use a tri catch statement.

110
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,770
So I'm going to make a slight amendment to this line here.

111
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,550
Why use in try to catch.

112
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,370
So I'm going to write try.

113
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,909
In an open and close embrace.

114
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,470
And then what I'm going to do is cut this line.

115
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,480
And paste it like so.

116
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,100
So it's going to try to see if the total amount equals that amount.

117
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,940
And then if it does, then I want to use extent.

118
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,180
Manager thoughts pass.

119
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,280
And I'm going to write the total amount.

120
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,210
Matches the expected amounts.

121
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,190
And then we can use catch.

122
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,860
And we come right assert that fail.

123
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:32,120
And then inside those brackets, I could write a message saying cart amounts did not match the expected

124
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,950
amount.

125
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,260
Comma it found an outside those brackets.

126
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,940
The quote sorry.

127
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,890
I'm going to add the plus cart.

128
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,310
Which is the cart object.

129
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,460
Get.

130
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,050
Total amount.

131
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,140
Don't get text.

132
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,760
And then after that, if I had another plus, if I do this on a new line so you can see it better.

133
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,190
I'm going to write.

134
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,470
Double quotes again with space expected.

135
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,200
And then I can simply copy this amount here, which is the amount which was expected.

136
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,810
Every semicolon at the end.

137
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,070
So you can see it as an error on the catch.

138
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,540
And that's because when we use a catch statement, we need to write.

139
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,880
So because it's an assertion try to catch on camera assertion.

140
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,220
Ever.

141
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,460
E like so.

142
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,380
So what I'm now going to add after this.

143
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,290
Is extent manager the fail.

144
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,010
And a message of.

145
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,260
The total amount did not match the expected amount.

146
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,740
And this foul method is referring to the one from the extent manager class.

147
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,850
So I'm just going to add this comment back up to top here.

148
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,230
So.

149
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,280
And that is the changes that were required to this class now complete.

150
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,980
So I'm going to save this.

151
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,010
And then in the next lecture, we're going to start or try and generate our first report.
