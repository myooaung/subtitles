00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.420
So the last thing that we need to do now is we need to upload our changes to Jenkins.

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.450
So we can do this by right, click it on the project and get into properties.

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.760
And if you click on this icon, it will take you to where your framework file or folder is located.

4
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.510
So in my case, it's in my resources workspace folder.

5
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.220
And I've got like Project One highlighted.

6
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.940
So I now need to move this to the location where Jenkins observes.

7
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.900
So I'm going to open up another phone explorer.

8
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.270
And on the C drive and the users under my username I've got a dot Jenkins folder my listed my life project

9
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.380
one previously.

10
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.810
So I am going to copy this updated project.

11
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.120
And I'm going to replace the one in the Jenkins folder.

12
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.010
The place, the final destination.

13
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.860
So that has now been copied over.

14
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.010
So now if I go back to Jenkins and try running it, let's see if the reports get generated.

15
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.690
So again, to run Jenkins, I'm going to open up command prompt.

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.610
I'm going to go to my resources folder.

17
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.770
I've got Jenkins listed here.

18
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.040
So this is the wall file.

19
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm going to copy that directory.

20
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.950
And to start.

21
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.650
Jenkins I'm first going to change that directory.

22
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.570
And then I'm going to run the command.

23
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.590
Java.

24
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.660
I have an.

25
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.220
John.

26
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.440
Jenkins thought war.

27
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.800
And I always thought Jenkins for me.

28
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.700
So let's just give that a second for it to finish.

29
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.400
So now it says Jenkins is fully up and running.

30
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.030
So if I open up chrome.

31
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.250
And go to local host.

32
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.620
8080.

33
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.870
We should be taken to the Jenkins login page.

34
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.720
Well, I need to enter my login information.

35
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.330
And now I'm on the Jenkins dashboard.

36
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.280
So all I need to do is execute job one.

37
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.000
So because I updated the project folder in the background.

38
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.550
That means that all I need to do is open that same job and it'll be observing that new live project.

39
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.710
One folder that replaced the original from.

40
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.890
So now all I'm going to do is select build now.

41
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.010
And this should generate the test for us.

42
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.750
So you can see that the job has started running.

43
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.280
And the reason why it jumped from version 4 to 11 is because I've been tested in some changes while

44
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.890
in between videos, so don't worry about a number difference.

45
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.260
So those tests have generated and started running and now that test is complete.

46
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.820
And if I click on this job.

47
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.480
A look at console output, for example.

48
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.680
It will show you how many tests run and what passed and failed.

49
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.040
Now currently to review those reports, we would need to go to the Dot Jenkins folder.

50
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.080
And in light of Project one, there's a report folder which will now display the report for that job

51
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.250
that we just generated.

52
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.130
So you may be asking yourself.

53
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.310
Is there a way that we can review the reports in Jenkins itself?

54
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.060
And the answer to that question is, yes, there is.

55
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.100
So I'm going to select on Jenkins and then I'm going to select Manager Jenkins, and then I'm going

56
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.630
to click manage plug ins.

57
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.560
Then I'm going to select this available tab and I'm going to tie it to email and you should see how

58
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.150
much HTML publisher.

59
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.860
So if I select this and then select install, so I'm going to select install without restart.

60
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.080
That will start installing that plug in for us.

61
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.850
Once has completed, you'll see success messages here.

62
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.910
Now, if I go back to the Jenkins main page and if I click on Manager Jenkins.

63
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.160
So if I click on the job itself.

64
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.400
So job one and I select configure.

65
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.780
If I scroll down.

66
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.230
And if I go to the ad posted with action.

67
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.910
You see an option now for public.

68
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.130
Publish HTML reports.

69
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.030
So this option wouldn't be available until you install that plug in.

70
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.650
So I'm going to slap that.

71
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.900
And then I'm going to select this add button and you'll see I need to provide some information here.

72
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.100
So this top field is the directory of where the reports reside.

73
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.850
And this is from this life project one folder.

74
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.350
So all I need to provide is this report folder name.

75
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.140
So here I'm going to enter report forward slash.

76
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.070
This index page is the HTML files you want to return to Jenkins.

77
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.080
So as we're using dynamic names in our files or in our reports where we're using the date and time,

78
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.370
I'm going to change index to Asterix the HMO, so that returns all reports to me.

79
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.830
And then go into Select Save.

80
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.350
And before I run this next build, I need to make one further change.

81
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.860
So before through this change, actually, it probably be better to show you what the current issue

82
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.190
is.

83
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.660
So before we run another build, it's good practice to restart Jenkins to make sure those changes take

84
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.170
effect.

85
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:51.720
So I'm going to close this browser and in come online, I'm going to click on the window and press control,

86
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.770
see on my keyboard.

87
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.980
You may have to press a couple of times, and that will stop.

88
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.700
Jenkins.

89
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.970
And if I run that command, that Java Jenkins stop war again, it will restart it.

90
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.540
And then once that's restarted, that's when we can go back to the login page and log in to go back

91
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.160
to executing the job.

92
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.590
So in the search bar again I'm going to write local host and the port number.

93
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.660
And it would ask me to log in again.

94
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.760
And on doing so, I'm going to click Job one.

95
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.150
And then I'm going to select Build now.

96
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.550
And that will start to build.

97
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.210
So I'm going to pause this video to that completes.

98
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.240
And now it is completed.

99
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.830
If I go back to the dashboard.

100
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.290
And taking that job again.

101
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.090
You should see there's an icon now for each HTML report.

102
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.810
And it's also shown here.

103
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.030
If I select that.

104
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.870
You should see something like this.

105
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:11.360
And this is the issue that I'm talking about in regards to the style in not being applied.

106
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.870
So there's a way that we can fix this.

107
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.030
And the reason this happens is to do with a security set in Jenkins.

108
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.610
So there is a workaround to prevent this styling from not being displayed.

109
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.320
So I'm going to go back to Jenkins.

110
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:36.090
And I'm going to click on the Jenkins icon and I'm going to select Manage Jenkins.

111
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.380
And if I scroll down.

112
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.890
We're looking for.

113
00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.179
Script console.

114
00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:49.210
If I select that this is a console where we can enter some commands.

115
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:58.790
So I am going to attach a command for which you can enter here as an attachment to this lecture on Udemy.

116
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.310
So this command consists of the following.

117
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.460
So this is something I haven't written myself.

118
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.090
It's just been sourced from a simple Google search.

119
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.050
So if I copy this.

120
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.750
And pieces in the script console and then click Run.

121
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.460
That would have been applied.

122
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:29.300
So now if I go back to Jenkins and click on Job One and then click on HTML reports.

123
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.020
You should see the styling has been applied again and the first report that will be displayed is the

124
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:44.210
1/1 in the archive and you can see it is tabs here for all the other reports that have been generated

125
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.510
since I've been executing these jobs with extended reports.

126
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:47.870
Run running.

127
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.880
So the only issue we have now is that the screenshot is not being displayed, fruit is plug in and that

128
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.170
is something we could fix by will require some additional configuration.

129
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.730
So my advice is if you do want the screenshots to just source the report files from the Jenkins report

130
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.580
directory as that is by far the easiest method.

131
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:18.200
So that now concludes the Extent Report section and that also concludes Live Project one.

132
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.880
Just to reflect on what's been achieved here.

133
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:29.530
We've created a fully functional, well designed framework that uses a whole host of technologies.

134
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.700
We've used the paved logic model for maintainability.

135
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.800
We've used Fred local so that we can run our tests in parallel execution.

136
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.210
We've used Maven so that we can add dependencies to our project.

137
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:50.110
We've used things like the config file so that our project is configurable, and we've used things like

138
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.140
listeners to trigger certain actions on events.

139
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.870
We've also now included extend reports and we've got that run in with Jenkins.

140
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:06.100
So you can see that a lot has been achieved through those videos and I hope you've learnt a lot of useful

141
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.940
information.

142
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.460
So I'd like to thank you for following me up to this point.

143
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.180
And in the next section, you introduce the next topic.
