00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.030
So this lecture is on driver comments.

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.680
So Java comments are useful to explain what your code is doing.

3
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.620
They can help make your code more readable.

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.250
They can help others to pick up and understand your code.

5
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.790
Some codes might remain unvisited for years.

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.400
So it's important to explain its purpose.

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.740
Comments should be brief, but contain useful and direct information.

8
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.450
So in Java we have two different types of comments.

9
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.520
We have single line comments and we have comment blocks, single line comments.

10
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.230
Start with two forward slashes.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.550
They are useful to explain a line of code and they're quick and easy to write, whereas comment blocks

12
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.610
are multi-line comments and they start with a forward slash and matrix and they end with an extra export

13
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.150
slash.

14
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.849
Any text within these symbols will be ignored and are useful when needed to write a block of code to

15
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.930
explain a class.

16
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.870
So let's take a look at the two different types of comments.

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.150
So I already had the clips open and I'm simply going to copy and paste the class in the last lecture,

18
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.620
but I'm going to call this 1l04 for lecture four and I'm going to give it a name of comments like so.

19
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.710
So if I double click and open that class, you'll see that we've got a hello world from the last lecture.

20
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.810
So I'm going to keep this here.

21
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.740
But all I'm going to do is add to forward slashes and.

22
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.130
Right.

23
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.300
This is a single line comment.

24
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.370
So these line comments are really useful just to explain what the code below is doing.

25
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.750
Whereas if we wanted to write more comments such as a comment blog, then we'd use a forward slash in

26
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.610
Asterix and in Eclipse.

27
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.380
If you press enter, you'll see that it'll create another two lines.

28
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.730
So anything in between this here and before this last one will be a comment.

29
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.370
So I can like this is a comment and if I wanted to add another line or simply press ends on my keyboard.

30
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.000
An Occupy block, for example.

31
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.710
So the key thing is single line comments are good to explain very briefly what the line of code might

32
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.620
be doing, where the comment block is more useful to explain or give more context to what you're trying

33
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.910
to do within the code.

34
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.520
So you'll find that common blocks are useful or usually found at the beginning of a class to explain

35
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.570
what the class is doing.

36
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.090
So that's it for this lecture.

37
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.870
Let's move on.
