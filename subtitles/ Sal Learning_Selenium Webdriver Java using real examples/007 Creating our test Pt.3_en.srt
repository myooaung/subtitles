1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,100
So let's add assertions to our test.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,480
So I'm still using the data from Google one and two.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,480
And I'm going to be tested to see if the user is able or not able to sign into the websites.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,740
So for this first survey data.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,030
Which is this email address and password.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,490
I know that they can sign in.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,120
And in doing so, they can see the your account page.

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,520
And they had access to the sign up button.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:40,360
I think I mentioned in a earlier lecture that I was going to use this H1 title in your assertion, but

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,700
I thought of an improved way of doing this.

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,870
So to explain what we're doing in the code quickly, this is where we provide the email address of Rogue

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,130
One and the password for Mode one.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,600
We then attempt to click the submit button and if the user signs in, I then want them to click the

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,019
sign out button, which appears on the your account page.

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,540
So it's at this point, which is ideal for an assertion.

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,710
So I'm going to riot.

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:12,920
Try.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,940
And then I'm going to cut this line and paste it here.

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,270
So it's going to try to click the sign out button.

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,840
And if he can do that, I then want to use extent reports to log a past message.

21
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,830
Sam gets right extents manager.

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,870
The past user has sign in.

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,490
So after Trier you also have to add a touch statement exception.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,570
And here I'm going to write extents manager dot file

25
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:10,370
user could not sign in and I want to force the test to fail at this point.

26
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,930
So as I know that is first user is a valid combination.

27
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,840
I expect this code here to run.

28
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,930
If I go to devote to data, we didn't get as far as click in the sign out button.

29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:34,670
So we simply enter the email address row two and a password for MOTU and try clicking the submit button

30
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,240
to lock in.

31
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,990
So if I simply copied his try catch method.

32
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,820
Apace it like so.

33
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,590
Is then going to try to click the sign up button.

34
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,750
But as we know, the road to data is not valid.

35
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,720
That's when I expect this code here to run.

36
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:05,440
So before I attempt this first, scroll up to the top of my class because I've copied this class from

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,950
another.

38
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,930
You can see it is extents.

39
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,420
Manager Locke is referring to another class.

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,830
So I'm going to change this to shop, log in, test, and then I'm going to save it.

41
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,760
Then I'm going to try running it.

42
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,880
Let's see what happens.

43
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,720
So if I go back to Eclipse and let it finish.

44
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,960
You can see the test has failed.

45
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,860
And if I refresh the project.

46
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,350
You can see the report has been generated.

47
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,950
If I look at that report.

48
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,980
Notice what it's written.

49
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,900
Started shop log in.

50
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,470
Test.

51
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,810
User has signed in.

52
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,649
Which is offensive this year for the first data.

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,560
And then it says user could not sign in and this outputted a message was failed the test.

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,910
That's because on the second rotator.

55
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,670
Because they can't sign in, they're unable to click the sign up button.

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,600
That's why this has been triggered.

57
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,780
And we can also see a screenshots here showing authentication filed.

58
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,400
So that is how we can use Apache Wire to access data from Excel and use it within our test.

59
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,240
There are a number of improvements we can make to this code.

60
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,300
I wanted to demonstrate the concept to you.

61
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,490
I hope you found it useful.

62
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,900
And thank you for watching.
