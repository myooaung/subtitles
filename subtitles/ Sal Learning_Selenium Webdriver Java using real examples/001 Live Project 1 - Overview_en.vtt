00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.690
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.800
So this is a section where we start right in our first live project, and it's going to be an end to

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.950
end test using topics we have learned so far.

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.100
So two steps ahead are that we're going to create a framework using much of what we have learned up

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.910
to this point.

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.340
Began to create a new Maven project.

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.330
Began to test various pages from the test store.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.420
Began to make use of the page object model.

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.240
We can't use a base class to store reusable methods.

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.030
Began to use a properties file to store global variables.

11
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.250
And we're going to use a test inject small file to control what tests we want to run.

12
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.090
So what is our learning objectives?

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.930
So by participating in this live project, it will help you join the dots by helping you understand

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.360
how everything so far fits together.

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.030
We all build in a framework which consists of a number of different technologies.

16
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.100
This project will be similar to how you test a web application in the real world.

17
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.580
Practice also helps you retain information.

18
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.390
So our requirements are to understand what we are trying to test.

19
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.730
We can do this by going through a user journey using the browser.

20
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.470
This will inform us what pages and actions are required.

21
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.990
Once we understand this wood and know what our test is going to do and what page object classes we need

22
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.740
to create.

23
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.330
So what is the plan ahead?

24
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.190
We are going to create page object classes, one page at a time.

25
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.670
We are going to assess what elements exist and what we may want to interact with.

26
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.710
We will then form an object class for a specific page.

27
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.560
We are going to create eight object classes for each page involved to place an order on the test store.

28
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.830
And this will be known as Test one.

29
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.590
We would and we use some page objects to test, addin and the removal of a product from the test or

30
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.190
basket.

31
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.440
And this will be known as test to.

32
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.990
So let's walk through test one.

33
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.680
And I'm going to call this test or the complete test.

34
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.710
So the first thing I'm going to do is go to the automation testing website and from this home page I'm

35
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.480
going to click the test or link.

36
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.400
This will take me to the test or home page and I'm going to select a product.

37
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.020
That product is going to be the Hummingbird printed T-shirt, and I'm going to add one item to my cart.

38
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.590
This wouldn't open up the shopping cart panel.

39
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.740
And as you can see, that one item is added.

40
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.960
So I'm going to proceed to checkout.

41
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:16.480
You will see a summary of my cards items and I'm going to use a 20 off code where I expect 20% to be

42
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.680
deducted from the total price and then going to proceed to checkout.

43
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.520
And I'm going to start entering the dummy customer information.

44
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.940
And then again to move on to the address section where I'm going to add a dummy address.

45
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.100
I'm then going to select a ship method and I'm going to add a comment to that shipping method, and

46
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.220
then I'm going to proceed to payment where the store has been configured to only allow pay by check.

47
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.630
So I am going to select that method and then I'm going to agree to the terms of service before click

48
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.910
in the order with an obligation to pay.

49
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.680
Once I select a button, it should then show that my order is confirmed.

50
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.260
So that is test one.

51
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.810
And remember, this is a test store.

52
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.520
So all the data is dummy.

53
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.690
So there's not actually any ordering or payments taking place.

54
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.019
So for test two, I'm going to call this add remove item basket test.

55
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.740
So again, I'm going to go to the automation website and click on the test or link.

56
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.280
This again will take me to the test or home page where I'm going to select my first product, which

57
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.380
again is the Hummingbird Printed T-shirt.

58
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.870
I'm going to add to these t shirts by increasing the quantity to two before adding it to my cart.

59
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.960
You should see two of these T-shirts that added on the shopping cart panel.

60
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.480
I'm then going to click Continue Shopping, which will take me back to the test or home page.

61
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.520
So the next product that I'm going to select is the hummingbird printed sweater.

62
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.590
So I'm going to add one of these items to my cart.

63
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.940
And again, the shopping cart panel is open.

64
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.450
And you should see that there was a total of 73, 96, and that's because there's free items now in

65
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.080
carts.

66
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.830
If I click Proceed to checkout, you'll see all the items listed and quantity users see a total price

67
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.540
of 7396.

68
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.730
On then going to make a slight change.

69
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.990
And what I'm going to do is remove the sweater from my basket.

70
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:37.150
This will leave only two of the hummingbird printed T-shirts and the total with taxes and shipping should

71
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.950
be 4524.

72
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.940
So I'm going to check to see if the total amount after products has been deleted equals expected amount

73
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.360
of 4524 by using an assertion.

74
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.820
So that will be my second test.

75
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.920
So I hope this has made it clear what will be covered.

76
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.680
So let's begin with the first live project.
