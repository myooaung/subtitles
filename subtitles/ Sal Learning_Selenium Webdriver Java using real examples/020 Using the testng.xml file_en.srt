00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,870
In this lecture, we're going to use a test engine small file to execute both our tests at the same

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,260
time.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,570
So I am going to highlight the first class how to control my keyboard and then select the second one.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,750
And then I'm going to right click, go to test energy and select convert to test energy.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,130
And then go and click finish and this will generate the test injects and I'll follow in my project.

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,910
And then going to double click it because I need to make some amendments.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,620
So I am going to copy the test tags and I'm going to sir below like so.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,900
So in this first test, I only want to run one of the tests, which is the ad to remove ice and basket

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,320
test.

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,530
And in the second test, I'm going to remove the add remove item basket, leaving just the order complete.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,170
So I need to change the names of the tests so they don't match.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,450
So I'm just going to call this test to.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:10,510
I'm then going to cite this and enclose it, and then I'm going to simply right click run as test in

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,970
G Suite and let's see what happens.

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,630
So the first test that's executed is the add remove item from basket test where we add and then delete

16
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,910
an item and then check the total price.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,010
Once has finished.

18
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,760
The browser reopens for the next test and this is where we enter doing an end to end test until we purchase

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,390
an item.

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,800
So you can see that two tests have run and both of them have passed.

21
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,920
So that's how we can run both our tests using the test g xml file.

22
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,180
Thank you for watching.
