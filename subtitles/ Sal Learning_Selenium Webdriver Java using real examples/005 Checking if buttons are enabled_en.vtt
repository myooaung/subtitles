00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.160
In this lecture, we look to see how we can find if a button is enabled.

2
00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.920
So how to see if a button is enabled.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.520
We use a command called DOT is enabled.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.540
This command will return a true or false value.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.160
There is a neighborhood command text to see if a person has been assigned the disabled attribute.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.000
And if you look at the image below, you'll see disabled is listed in red.

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.470
An example of how we might use this command is shown below.

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:42.010
Driver find element buyer I.D. then ID value of bottom one and then I'll use the is enabled method.

9
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.830
Let's try it out.

10
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.230
So to begin, I'm going to walk you through the test.

11
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.150
So I'm going to open up Chrome.

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.420
Go to the automation testing website and click on the Buttons link.

13
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.610
Will you be presented with the following page?

14
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.160
So this test is going to focus using this disable button.

15
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.340
And as you can see, I can't select it.

16
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.620
So if I right click and inspect the page and try to select that box and use it to select it all.

17
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.370
You'll see that I can't focus on it.

18
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.770
Which is unlike the others.

19
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.490
Well, I can.

20
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.570
So I'm just going to select this area.

21
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.880
And then in the document object model, you'll see that this line has been selected.

22
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.890
So if I expand that.

23
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.360
You will see that there is a buttons type here.

24
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.950
And if I click on that and then go to runner UPS Velocity panel, you'll see that I'm being I've been

25
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.630
given the following selectors.

26
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.440
So before uses I'm going to go to the clips and use in the class in the last lecture.

27
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.070
I'm going to control C and control V to copy and paste it.

28
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.780
And I'm going to give this new class the name of L five for lecture five and I'm going to call this

29
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.580
is enabled and then click okay.

30
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.120
And if I double click that class, you open it.

31
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.380
So the first thing I'm going to do is get rid of this, this code here because I don't need it and I'm

32
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.170
going to change the address of the get method.

33
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.300
So I am going to use the buttons address on a copy that and replace this like sign.

34
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.510
So I'm going to write driver thought fun element, but don't say yes.

35
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.480
Select the double quotes which I'll leave blank for now.

36
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.790
Dot is enabled and a semicolon.

37
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.750
So I need to go back to the Automation System website and I'm going to pick this top.

38
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.430
So I'm a copy that.

39
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.120
Go back to Eclipse and paste that here.

40
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.390
Now, like the last lecture, I need to output the value of this test to console.

41
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:22.090
So I'm going to write system thoughts out of print now in open and close in brackets and semicolon and

42
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.910
without the semicolon from this line.

43
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.850
So if I remove it.

44
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.500
And cut this line and then paste it within those brackets.

45
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:42.460
So I am now going to say this, and what I expect from this test is for it to go to this website and

46
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.100
then check to see if this button is enabled.

47
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.080
And because it should because it is not enabled, it should output false.

48
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.120
So let's try it.

49
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.270
So if I minimize this.

50
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.440
And you'll see in the console output is false.

51
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.690
So if I copied that line.

52
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.870
And pasted it a couple of lines below.

53
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.649
If I run the same test, but this time for batsmen free.

54
00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.450
So far.

55
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.440
Copy this selector and paste that here.

56
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.550
So it is parts in here is enabled.

57
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.600
I can click it.

58
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.980
So I expect the first test, which is for bottom four.

59
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.190
So for this one, so it's a false.

60
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.350
And then the second test for bottom free to return.

61
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.770
True.

62
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.690
So let me say this class and try running it again.

63
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.630
And if I go back to Eclipse.

64
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.840
You'll see the first one is false as expected, and the second one is true.

65
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.750
So I hope you found this lecture useful.

66
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.750
And I look forward to speaking to you in the next lecture.
