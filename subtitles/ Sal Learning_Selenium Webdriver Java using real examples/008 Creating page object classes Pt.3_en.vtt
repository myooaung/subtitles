00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.200
In this lecture, we're going to create our third page object class.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:12.050
So we've already created a page object class for the automation test in home page, and we've also created

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.850
one for the test store home page.

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.630
So the next page I'd like to create is if I was to select the product, and this is the product page.

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.440
So here I have a number of different options available to me, such as I can select size, choose a

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.360
color, increase or decrease quantity and add to cart.

7
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.280
So what I'm doing here is I'm construct in page by page.

8
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.140
I'm creating classes of how a user with interact with the website.

9
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.820
So this is another page that the user would interact with when they're purchasing a product.

10
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.720
So I'm going to create my third page object based on this web page.

11
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.150
So I am going to take into account the size, the quantity, increase and decrease and add to cart.

12
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.200
So I'm going to keep this fairly simple for demonstration purposes.

13
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.440
And for that reason, I'm not going to include the color elements, but that is something you can include

14
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.880
if you wish to do so.

15
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.740
So I'm going to go back to the clips and I am going to right click the page objects package, select

16
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520
new and select class, and I'm going to call this class.

17
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.410
Shop.

18
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.040
Product page and then click Finish.

19
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.690
So again, I am going to create a web drive, for instance.

20
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.380
So public web driver.

21
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.370
Driver.

22
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.730
And that would need imports.

23
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.120
And again.

24
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.390
And the next thing I'm going to do is create the fields that we need that will contain the selectors.

25
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.220
So I'm going to write by.

26
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.490
And the first element I'm going to do is to do with size.

27
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.340
So I'm going to call this size option and it's going to equal by.

28
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.010
And if I go back to the website, I am going to right click a size dropdown menu and inspect.

29
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.310
And I went to go to run amok velocity.

30
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.710
Well, I am provided the following options.

31
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.710
So I'm just going to take this second one here, so I'm going to copy it.

32
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.550
And I'm going to write thoughts, scissors, selector and paste that locator value.

33
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.260
The next one I'm going to do is quantity.

34
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.260
Increase.

35
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.170
Aton and it's going to equal.

36
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.010
Bye.

37
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.670
And if we go back.

38
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.080
I am then going to focus on this up arrow and right click and inspect.

39
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.890
If I go to Roanoke Velocity, I'm given the following options.

40
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.620
And this one here seems like a nice, simple one.

41
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.490
So I'm going to copy that.

42
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.530
And I'm going to write dot CSA selector and I'm going to place a value like so.

43
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.800
The third one is to decrease the quantity.

44
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.940
So I'm going to buy.

45
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.400
Quantity

46
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.260
decrease and it's going to equal buy this CSA selector.

47
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.510
And again, I'm going to focus on the down arrow and inspect.

48
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.980
And I'm going to take this value here.

49
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.460
And I'm going to put it in double quotes like so.

50
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.490
And then the next one is the add to cart button.

51
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.790
So I'm going to write by.

52
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.920
Add to.

53
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.320
Can't beat an off it with their equals by.

54
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.310
And if I go back to the website.

55
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.380
I'm going to inspect the bottom.

56
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.690
And I'm presented with the following options.

57
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.890
So I'm just going to take this top one.

58
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.030
So I'm going to copy that.

59
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.480
And I'm going to write, thought, set a selector and place that value like so.

60
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.320
So I'm going to get one more locator.

61
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.460
So as a user.

62
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.570
If I'm on this page, I may find or decide that this isn't the product for me.

63
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.250
So I may want to go back to the home page to select another product.

64
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.860
So that's why I think it'd be good to include a locator for this home link.

65
00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.040
So when clicked it will take me back to the home page so that I can select an alternative product.

66
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.220
So I could quite simply right click this link inspect.

67
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.760
And go to run amok velocity and I'm provided we have some options here.

68
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.130
But I think this is a good opportunity for us to get some practice by writing our own custom locator.

69
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.180
So if I look at the document object model, you'll see that this line here has been highlighted.

70
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.640
So we can see this is a span element and it's got text on home.

71
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.850
So I can write a path locator to focus on these elements.

72
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.150
And we can use and validate this by using the textbox from manual velocity.

73
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.760
So I'm going to write the next locator or write in to forward slashes.

74
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.810
And because it's a spent element, I'm going to write span.

75
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.150
Then I need to write.

76
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.670
I open and close in square bracket.

77
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.350
And what I could write here is text is round brackets equals.

78
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.940
And in single quotes I could provide the text home.

79
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.480
So now if I press enter.

80
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.170
Notice how one element has been found.

81
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:31.380
And if I minimise this a bit and prÃ©sents again, you'll see the browser has located that link.

82
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.780
So we've used the text method.

83
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.200
And the text method allows us to search the text of an element.

84
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.170
So that is one way of writing a customer locator.

85
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:53.110
An alternative instead of using text is to quite simply use dots equals.

86
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.910
If I use dot equals home.

87
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.680
You see that?

88
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.290
That works.

89
00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.880
Also.

90
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.230
So when we use the dots in X path, this is called a context item expression.

91
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.580
And this is because it refers to the context item.

92
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.870
So this could be a match with a node such as the element, attributes or text.

93
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.980
So all this means is that by using dot equals.

94
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.200
So we started with span.

95
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.840
So he's looking for a certain element.

96
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.300
And then dot equals is then looking for foreign nodes.

97
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.880
In our case, it equals home.

98
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.370
So it's looking for text.

99
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.360
Hence why I was able to find this particular element.

100
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.900
So that's quite difficult to explain.

101
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.330
But I don't want to spend too much time on it.

102
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:55.220
If you're interested in learning about the DOT equals expression, please look up context item expression

103
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.060
in a search engine where you'll be able to read more on it.

104
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:08.100
But for now and as I mode it, this element or this locator works, I'm going to simply copy this and

105
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.490
go back to my code and I'm going to write by.

106
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.460
Home.

107
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.250
Page link and it's going to equal.

108
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.730
By.

109
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:30.470
X path and in double quotes, I'm just going to pace up value with a semicolon at the end.

110
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.820
So these are the locators that I think I need in order to complete my test.

111
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.390
So the next thing I'm going to do is write a constructor.

112
00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:50.540
So public shop, product page, round brackets and an open close embrace.

113
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:57.720
And inside those round brackets, like the previous lectures, I'm going to write Web driver.

114
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.470
Driver.

115
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.310
And in the constructor, I'm going to write this.

116
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.390
The driver equals driver.

117
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.090
So the next thing I need to do is create my first public method.

118
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:25.300
So I'm going through a public web element and I'm going to call this get size option.

119
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.920
I'm going to need to import Web Benjamin's.

120
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.280
And I'm going to simply return.

121
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:44.980
Driver got to find elements and I'm going to pass this size option filled above like so.

122
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.090
With a semicolon.

123
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.340
So I need to do the same for the remaining fields.

124
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.880
So rather than bore you as it's very, very simple, I'm just going to copy a very simple concept to

125
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.070
provide the correct field for each method.

126
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.910
So you can either practice writing the remainder yourself or you can download the code, which I would

127
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.470
add to the lecture for you.

128
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.920
So in my case, I'm just going to copy the remaining methods and I'm just going to place them.

129
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.800
So I hope this lecture has been useful for you.

130
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.940
And in the next lecture will create the next page objects class.

131
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.410
Thank you for watching.
