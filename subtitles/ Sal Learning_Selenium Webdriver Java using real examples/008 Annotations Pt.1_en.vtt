00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.730
So in this lecture, I'm going to demonstrate the use of the before suite after suite and test annotation.

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:17.770
So I'm going to copy the class in the last lecture and paste it cool in this 108 for lecture eight and

3
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.100
I'm going to give it a name of annotations, underscore pt1 and then click.

4
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.670
Okay.

5
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.170
And I'm going to open that class and I'm going to move everything.

6
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.380
So.

7
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.220
So the first thing I'm going to do here is open up the Chrome demo class from the full package.

8
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.480
And you see it's got some of the set up code here.

9
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.500
So for now I am just going to copy these four lines and then go back to the new class and I'm just going

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.060
to paste them like so.

11
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.590
So the first thing I'm going to use is the before suites annotation.

12
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.760
So I'm going to at before sweet.

13
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.300
And then I am going to create a method.

14
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.800
So I'm going to call this public void set up.

15
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.320
And inside this method, I am going to Pisces free lines here.

16
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.890
Like so.

17
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.650
So what I expect to happen in the before.

18
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.290
Sweet said to run before the sweet is for the set property.

19
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.480
So the chrome driver property to be set.

20
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.520
A driver instance to be created, and then for that browser window to be maximized.

21
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.580
So under before sweet I have an error and the reason for that is I need to import it.

22
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.630
So now I am going to create a at test annotation and I'm going to create a new method called public.

23
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.130
Void.

24
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.840
Test.

25
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.080
And inside this, I am now going to pace this line.

26
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.570
Like so.

27
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.130
And then finally I am going to use the after suite annotation and I'm going to call this public void

28
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.530
and like so.

29
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.530
And inside this I am going to use driver dots.

30
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.650
Actually, before I do that, let me just address something.

31
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.510
You see that there's an error on the driver.

32
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.790
And the reason for this is that this method can't see that variable driver because driver is being created

33
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.630
inside before.

34
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.080
Sweet.

35
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.730
So what I need to do is to create the driver instance outside this method so that it's accessible to

36
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.720
the rest of the class.

37
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.220
And to do this, I can write outside of the methods.

38
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.450
So right at the top.

39
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.720
Web driver.

40
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.810
Driver, like so.

41
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.950
And now, because I've created a new driver variable, it means I don't need to declare it again here.

42
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.710
So I can remove this.

43
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.320
And you'll see that these turn blue in eclipse and that error has now gone away.

44
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.680
So just to briefly explain what I've done there.

45
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.940
I've created a new Web driver driver variable, and inside the before suite, I'm setting the system

46
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.410
properties to the driver and I'm reusing this variable here and I'm creating a new object of chrome

47
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.920
driver.

48
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.330
I'm then using that driver to open the maximize the window.

49
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.560
So this is done that before.

50
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.970
Sweet.

51
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.960
So I expect it to run early on.

52
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.750
Then I expect this test annotation to set this method to run next.

53
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.250
And again, I'm using this driver variable and I'm using the dot jet method to go to automation test

54
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.390
in the code at UK.

55
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.750
Then after the test is completed, I would expect the code seek out and run the after suite annotation

56
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.440
code and there's an error because I need to import it.

57
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.360
And error will now go away.

58
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.820
And here I'm going to write Driver.

59
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.180
Not close.

60
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.260
And driver don't quit.

61
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.410
So you haven't seen these two lines before.

62
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.400
So what?

63
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.450
The clothes come on.

64
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.860
Does is it closes or closes the browser window.

65
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.000
And drive acquit who safely close the instance of the driver session.

66
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.460
So this is commonly used at the end of our test to close the browser and to quit the session.

67
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:58.110
So the order I expect is to run in is before sweet to run first, then the test annotation to run next.

68
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.190
And finally, the after suite should run to close the browser.

69
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.490
So this is going to happen fairly quickly.

70
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.340
So I am going to use Fred sleep just for then demonstration purposes.

71
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.980
I'm going to set.

72
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.790
A waits for 2 seconds.

73
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.770
And when we use this, we need to add a phrase declaration.

74
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.740
And I'm also going to copy that here.

75
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.990
And then also at that Ffos declaration.

76
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.660
So that is the class written.

77
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.330
So I am now going to save this.

78
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.560
And then try running it.

79
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.990
So I really run it by right clicking and going to run as test and g orca run it from a test inject smell.

80
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.040
So I am going to amend the test inject smell to do this.

81
00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:04.420
So I am going to review that and here I'm going to change EL 0608 and I've called it annotations annotation

82
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.260
without the S.

83
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.550
pt1 like so.

84
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.990
And if I say that I can now run it from the tests inject smell.

85
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.070
And let's try this out.

86
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.690
So it's opened the browser and expanded it.

87
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.790
It's going to automation test in the UK and then it closed down the browser.

88
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.060
And if we look at a console, you can see that the total test run was one and it passed the test.

89
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.680
So that code there ran in the order it was expected.

90
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:46.050
And that's how we can use it before sweet taste and after sweet annotations in test n g.

91
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.180
Thank you for watching.
