00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,790
So so far we've created Web Drive, for instance, class, which is responsible for setting the driver

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,920
instance using local.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,149
We've created the Hook's class, which stores the acts before test and off the test annotation code,

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,740
and we've made changes to our base page based on the changes we've made.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,210
But these other two classes.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:30,130
The next change that we need to make is to our page objects, and the changes I'm going to be making

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,229
is going to be identical for each.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360
So I plan to show you one example of the changes I'll be making.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,820
And then you would ever have the choice to mainly update each new page objects.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:50,830
Or you can download the code from this lecture as I will update or upload the updated page object classes

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,310
for you.

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,240
So I'm going to open up one of these classes.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,090
So I'm going to open up a shopping cart or Java.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,210
And our code company contains the following.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,240
So the first change I'll be making to this page object class is that I'm now going to be extending the

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,560
base page.

17
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,180
And on doing so, there'll be an error.

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,230
And that's because I now need to import the base page to this class.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,020
Next, you'll see an error under the constructor.

20
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,950
So this Webb driver driver parameter is no longer required.

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,510
So I'll be the lead in it.

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,170
And this line here is also no longer required.

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,460
So I'm going to replace it with the super keyword, since because we're using the base page now, we

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,150
need to use a super keyword to the base page constructor.

25
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,810
I need to add a phrase declaration to de constructor and that error then goes away.

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,840
The next change I need to make is the same change for each of these methods.

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:09,050
So before the return statement, I'm now going to write this thought driver equals get driver, which

28
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,650
is a method.

29
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,120
And on doing so, I'll need to add a froze declaration.

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,190
So to explain what we're doing here as we now extend in the base page, this is what we called a super

31
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,630
keyword in the constructor.

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,680
And then in each of these methods, I'm using this driver.

33
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,010
So this driver is referring to this driver here.

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,140
And it's equal in get driver, which is a method that belongs to the base page.

35
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,680
So this method then uses the web driver instance class and it calls the get driver method.

36
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,670
Which is this method here.

37
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,330
And as we know, this method is set in the thread.

38
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:02,520
But check and see if it's a no value and if it is and includes the create driver method which initializes

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,150
the driver.

40
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,160
So I need to repeat this line in every method.

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,680
So I'm going to quickly do that.

42
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,930
So those are all the changes that were required to this class.

43
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,850
So we need to make identical changes to all the other page objects.

44
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,530
But just to go over what we did here, we simply extend to the base page.

45
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,750
On doing so.

46
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,080
We then needed to update the constructor to use a super keyword because of the base page constructor.

47
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:16,130
And then for each the methods we use this driver, which is referred to this variable at the top here.

48
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,880
And it's equal in a method called get driver, which belongs to the base page.

49
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,530
All the other code remains the same.

50
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,900
So as I said, if you'd like to have some practice and update the remaining page object classes, please

51
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,500
go ahead.

52
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,540
Otherwise, you can download the updated code from this lecture.

53
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
Thank you for watching.
