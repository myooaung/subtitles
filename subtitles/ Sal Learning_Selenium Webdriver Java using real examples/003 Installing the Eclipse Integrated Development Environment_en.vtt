00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.689
In this lesson, we learn about eclipse idea and also learn how we can install and configure it.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.600
So what's his eclipse idea?

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
Eclipse is an integrated development environment using computer programming.

4
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.420
Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may

5
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.340
also be used to develop applications in other programming languages.

6
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.590
Eclipse Software Development Kit, also known as the SDK, is a free and open source software released

7
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.990
under the terms of the Eclipse public license.

8
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.170
So here is a screenshot of Eclipse.

9
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.260
It's where we can write our code, where we can create our projects and arrange the folders and files.

10
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.440
It's where we can debug if we come across code errors.

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.220
It's where our code is compiled and it's also where we execute our code to run.

12
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.200
So let's download and install what clips idea.

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.500
So before we begin downloading and installing Eclipse, there's an important point I need to share.

14
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.560
So when you come to take this course, you may find there's later versions of the clips available.

15
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.160
So you need to make sure that the version of clips that you download and install supports Java version

16
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.610
11.

17
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.670
And you can do this by searching for Eclipse.

18
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.900
Install Wiki in a search engine and the first result should be to wiki don't eclipse the org.

19
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.900
And if we click that link, it should take you to the following page.

20
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.400
So at the time of record in Eclipse version 4.18 was the latest version.

21
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.480
And these are all the previous versions that were available at the time.

22
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.020
If I click on that later version, it will show me some details of what Java version is supported.

23
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.710
So if we look at Eclipse 4.18, you'll see that a Java 11 or newer JRA or JDK is required.

24
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.190
So if you come to this page and there's later versions available, please make sure you install a version

25
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.920
of Eclipse that supports this version of Java.

26
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.630
So let's begin downloading and install in eclipse idea.

27
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.970
So I'm going to open up a web browser and in a search engine I'm going to type eclipse into a download.

28
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.930
You should then be given results similar to what's shown.

29
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.040
So this first one is to the eclipse, the org website.

30
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.810
And if I click it, it should take me to the eclipse download page.

31
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.570
So this is the download page and you can see that in the left hand corner there is a get eclipse idea

32
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.840
two 2012 downloads, which is the latest version available to me.

33
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.640
This may be different from when you come on this screen, if you're taking this lecture at a later date.

34
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.710
So I can quite simply select that download button and that will begin the download process of Eclipse.

35
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.340
Otherwise I can select this download Packages button and this will take you to another download page

36
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.250
which breaks down the different packages available and you can see on the more download section as the

37
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.190
older versions of Eclipse are available to download.

38
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.670
So I'm going to select this Eclipse 2020 12, which is the latest version available to me.

39
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.130
And you can see there's different download options available based on your operating system.

40
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.310
So as I'm using Windows, I'm going to click the Windows link and then I'm going to select the download

41
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.820
button.

42
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.010
Once pressed, this will start the download process and I'm going to pause this video here until that

43
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.580
completes.

44
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.600
So now that Eclipse has finished downloading, I've gone to my downloads folder where you should see

45
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.810
the Eclipse Installer for double click this.

46
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.060
This should start the installation wizard.

47
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.940
So this can take a moment to open based on the speed of your machine.

48
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.990
But you should eventually be presented with the following panel.

49
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.390
And as you can see, there are a number of different installer options that we can select.

50
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.190
So the version that we need should be right at the top.

51
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.270
And it's called eclipse idea.

52
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.020
The Java developers, if we select that, it should then take us to the following panel.

53
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.320
So you'll notice that this panel references a Java version.

54
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.090
You can see Java 11 plus VM, which stands for Virtual Machine.

55
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.290
And you can see that there is a path that is being pre-populated and it references the resources folder.

56
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.870
JDK 11 .0.2 And this is the version of the JDK that we've installed and is inside our resources folder

57
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.740
on our desktop.

58
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.680
So this is the version we want to use.

59
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.520
If I click on the dropdown menu, you'll see that there's other versions of the geography that we can

60
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.120
select, which comes bundled with Eclipse, but we want to use the version that we've set on our system.

61
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.960
So everything else on this panel can remain the same.

62
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.710
So all we need to do is keep the install button and the installation should begin once we accept the

63
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.860
license agreement by clicking on the Accept Now button.

64
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.340
So I'm going to pause this video until this installation has completed.

65
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.100
So once the installation is complete, you should see a launch button.

66
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.380
And if you look on my desktop, you will also see that there is an eclipse icon there.

67
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.180
So if I select this launch button, you should then be presented the following panel.

68
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.740
So Eclipse is asking for a workspace directory.

69
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.380
So this is going to be a directory that stores our preferences and development artifacts.

70
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:16.010
So I'm going to leave this as the default location for this demonstration in future videos.

71
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.780
I'll be changing our workspace location so that our projects are stored elsewhere.

72
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.830
So I'm going to click the launch button, which would then start Eclipse.

73
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.030
So this is our first view of eclipse.

74
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.490
And you can see on the left hand window there is a package Explorer panel.

75
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.020
So this panel will display our projects and all our classes.

76
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:48.070
In the next lecture we begin crates in our first Java project and crates in our first Java class would

77
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.070
explore Eclipse in more detail in later lectures.

78
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.600
Thank you for watching.
