1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.170
So now that we've attached the reporter, I'm now going to some extent reports config properties.

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.970
So I'm going to call the extent.

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.290
Reports filled.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.160
And then dot.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.220
And I'm going to call a method called set system info, which takes two strings.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.790
So this first string, I'm simply going to call Tester.

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.850
And the second string I'm going to call simply my name.

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.140
So we can configure this to be whatever we like.

9
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.050
But I'm just going to use these two values for an example, and you'll see those values reported when

10
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.460
the report gets generated.

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.950
I'm then going to set another couple of properties.

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.870
So I'm going to be using the reporter object.

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.140
So I'm going to call Spark.

14
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.960
Dot and you'll see there's an option or method for config.

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.030
So if I select that and then if I write thoughts, you'll see that I've got a number of methods here.

16
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.410
So I am going to use one called set reports name and I'm going to give this reports a name of.

17
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.220
I'm just going to call it regression.

18
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.990
Test like so.

19
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.010
I'm then going to do the same, so spark the config dots.

20
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.530
But this time I'm going to use a method called set document title.

21
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.190
And I'm going to give a document title of test results.

22
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:55.310
And then finally I'm going to set one more again using the same line as above dots set theme.

23
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.240
So in extent reports, you can also sets a theme.

24
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.430
And so the theme that I'm going to be using is theme dot and I've got the option of dark or standard.

25
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.670
So in the example I showed you in a previous video, I'm actually using the dark theme.

26
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.720
And when we come to generate reports, I'll come back and change some of these to show you the impact

27
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.020
on it.

28
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.260
So finally, what I need to right now is a return statement.

29
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.300
So all I need to write is return.

30
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.920
Extent reports of a semicolon.

31
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.880
And on doing so.

32
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.560
That is this method now complete.

33
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.810
And this Eva, as I said, will go away once we write this method.

34
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.260
So underneath this, I'm now going to write the next method.

35
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.530
And this method is going to be the extent reports prefixed name.

36
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.920
So let me give you some information before create this method.

37
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.050
So every time we run our tests, it's going to generate reports, but we want to prevent our reports

38
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.430
from overwriting each other.

39
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.620
So how do we do that?

40
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.710
So that's the purpose of what this method is going to do.

41
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.600
This method is going to use the date and time of when the test is running to generate a name that uses

42
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.150
that date and time to differentiate between other reports that get generated later.

43
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:41.320
So I'm going to write here public static string, and then I'm going to simply copy this method name

44
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.570
and paste it like so.

45
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.260
And it's going to take a parameter of string.

46
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.310
And I'm going to call this test name.

47
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.310
Then I open and close embrace.

48
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.510
Inside this method, I'm going to create another string and it's going to be called date.

49
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.410
And it's going to equal new simple date format.

50
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.990
And if I hover over that, I've got an option to import it from Java DOT text.

51
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.040
And then what I need to add after that is brackets.

52
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.829
And this is going to be the format of the date.

53
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.880
So in quotes, I'm going to write y.

54
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.470
Y y y.

55
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.800
Dash.

56
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.320
Mm.

57
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.390
In capitals, Dash.

58
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.760
D in lower case.

59
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.910
Then after that, I'm going to add a underscore.

60
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.380
And then to Capital Haters.

61
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.500
Then another dash.

62
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.680
Mm.

63
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.940
Lowercase.

64
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.260
And another dash.

65
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.260
Assess for hours, minutes, seconds.

66
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.070
Then outside those round brackets, I'm going to add a dot.

67
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.330
And then I'm going to call a method of format.

68
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:22.070
And inside those brackets, I'm going to write new date round brackets and a semicolon, and I'll need

69
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.980
to import date and make sure to import the one from java dot util.

70
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.020
And that era then goes away.

71
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:42.070
I'm going to use the filled don't have to find up here extent report prefix so I'm going to copy that.

72
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.230
And I'm going to paste it here.

73
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.410
And it's going to equal.

74
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.870
Test name, which is this value?

75
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.780
Plus double quotes with an underscore inside it.

76
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.970
Plus date, which is the value of this field.

77
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.160
We have a semicolon at the end.

78
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.820
And then the last thing I need to do is to find the return statement and it's going to return extent

79
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.370
report free prefix like.

80
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.310
So it was semicolon at the end.

81
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.730
And asked that method now complete a new C by idleness.

82
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.970
That extent reports prefixed name.

83
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.280
The error has also gone away from this method.

84
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.300
So I'm going to stop this video here and we'll continue with the next method in the next video.
