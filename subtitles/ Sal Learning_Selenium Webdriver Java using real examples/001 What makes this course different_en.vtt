00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.030
So what makes this course different from others?

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.430
To begin is the overall structure.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.150
This course has been designed for all experience levels.

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.420
Topics are introduced in a logical way.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.410
We start on a journey that builds on past knowledge to explore more advanced subjects.

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.720
We then come to a point where we use our new knowledge to build a highly advanced and well-designed

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.470
framework.

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.240
This course has taken over 14 months design record and to develop.

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.160
So I also provide in-depth explanations.

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.570
So each topic combines educational PowerPoint slides with explanations so that you gain a deep understanding

11
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.430
of why we do things.

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.510
So here is an example on a slide for later in the course, which explains why we developing or use in

13
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.040
a particular architecture.

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.130
I also provide code examples.

15
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.760
So code examples are provided after each lecture.

16
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.950
The course is also structured in a way, so you can easily refer back to code examples from previous

17
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.580
lectures.

18
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.460
And if you look on the left hand side and this is showing you a project in Eclipse, you'll see that

19
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.970
every single section has been divided and each one, those lectures and code examples have been structured

20
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.790
in a way where you can easily go back and look at what code has been written, what changes have been

21
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.540
introduced.

22
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.060
We also provide a dedicated website for learning.

23
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.510
So this course comes with a dedicated website that has been specifically created to help you learn using

24
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.770
real world examples.

25
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.870
The website even includes a test e-commerce store so that you can try automating a user purchase in

26
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.530
items.

27
00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.280
This course covers a whole host of topics, and these are some of them that have been listed on this

28
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.790
slide.

29
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.530
We explore each of these in detail and we use real world examples so that we gain a deep understanding

30
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.820
of each of these topics.

31
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.390
Finally, Udemy offers you a 30 day money back guarantee.

32
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.320
So I'm so confident you will learn Web driver extremely well, but rest assured you can request a full

33
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.970
refund using you'd be up to 30 day money back guarantee.

34
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.250
I hope you enjoy this course.

35
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.540
And thank you for watching.
