00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,620
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,000
In this section, we'll be focusing on various scenarios.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,780
So what's covered in this section?

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,930
I will demonstrate how you can interact with various elements and scenarios found across the web.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,030
Will mostly be using the elements found on the automation test encoder UK website.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,000
Lucy, a whole host of commands, such as locating elements and interacting with them.

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:37,820
Send in data to forms, how to deal with alerts, dealing with radio buttons and checkboxes and much

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,160
more.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,390
So this is an example of us covered in this section, and the upcoming lectures will focus on each of

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:46,840
these.

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,410
So we'll build in the core skills.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,150
So our aim is to build core skills that is important to automation testers.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,930
Once we have gained a good level of core skills, we'll move on to constructing a framework using various

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,740
technologies.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,690
So we've already seen the basics and take a look at set up.

16
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,470
Now we focus in on core skills and after this section we move on to construct in a framework.

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,920
After we've done that, we then look at some additional subjects.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,260
So let's make a start.
