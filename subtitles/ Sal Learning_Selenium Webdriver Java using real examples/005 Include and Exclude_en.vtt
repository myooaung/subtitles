00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.500
In this lecture we take a look at the include and exclude tax.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.220
So what are the include in exclude tags?

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.500
Testing provides an option to include or exclude groups, test methods, classes and packages by using

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.080
special tags could include or exclude.

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.690
We use these tags in our testing XML file.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.170
For example, if we didn't want a particular method to run when we trigger our tests, then we can set

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.870
the test method name inside the exclude tags and it will be out of scope of execution.

8
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.310
These tags provide additional flexibility, allowing us to very easily control what tests should and

9
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.940
shouldn't run.

10
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.950
So if we look at this example, this is an example of the use of the include tanks.

11
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.430
And on the left hand side I have a class with free methods and on the right hand side I am showing an

12
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.230
example of the include tag inside the test energy example file.

13
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.630
So our views include and provide the name of test one, which is the method name on the left hand side.

14
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.800
On line eight.

15
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.960
So when I run this test, inject some old file, it will only include the run in of method called test.

16
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.830
Underscore one.

17
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.330
In this example, I've used the exclude take and this time, well, views exclude take on the name test

18
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.720
one.

19
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.200
It will mean that test two and test free methods will run and it would exclude the running of test on

20
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.920
the score one.

21
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.060
So let's try this out.

22
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.810
So in this first example, I am going to show the use of the include tank.

23
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.160
So I am going to reuse classes from the last lecture.

24
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.580
And if I double click on this class, you'll see there's two methods here method seven and method date.

25
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.480
So I am going to use the include tag to run just method eight from this class.

26
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.500
So to do this again, to open up the test in XML file and I am going to remove those packages tags and

27
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.830
instead I am going to write classes.

28
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.730
And then we've we've inside those classes.

29
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.380
I am going to use the class tag.

30
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.180
Name.

31
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.820
Equals.

32
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.820
Double quotes.

33
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.910
And I am going to provide the package name, which is section 11.

34
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.650
And a dance.

35
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.630
And then the class name.

36
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.160
The class name being l zero for B on the school test.

37
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.770
NJ ex AML.

38
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.540
To.

39
00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.260
And then at the end of that line.

40
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.290
I am just going to have a closed intake like so.

41
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.980
And inside that class tag, I am going to use methods.

42
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.290
And in inside those method takes I am going to use the includes.

43
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.530
Keyword and then name.

44
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.690
Equals double quotes.

45
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.110
And here I am going to provide the method name, which is method eight.

46
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.810
Like so.

47
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.560
And then at the end of this, I'm going to use a forward slash and they close in take.

48
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.070
So I've used classes and then inside the classes of use class and the nine up divide is the package

49
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.600
name, which is section 11.

50
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.220
And then the dots and then the actual class name itself, which is the same as this one.

51
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.340
Then I used the method tax and inside the method tags I use the include keyword and I provide the name

52
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.339
of the method that I would like to include, which is just this method eight here.

53
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.090
So if I say this now and try running it, let's see what happens.

54
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.350
And you can see only one test was run and it passed.

55
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.260
I mean if I scroll up it's output it.

56
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.190
Hello world from method eight.

57
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.110
And that is the message that this method here prints.

58
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.400
Now to do the same with exclude.

59
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.810
This is very simple.

60
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.970
All we need to do is change.

61
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.570
Include.

62
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.440
To exclude like so.

63
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.400
And if I say this now and try running it again.

64
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.110
You'll see once again, only one has run in passed.

65
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.270
But if we look at the message.

66
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.380
It says Hello World from Method seven.

67
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.940
And the reason for that is when I have excluded MiFID date.

68
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.910
It means this will not run.

69
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.000
And so the only remaining method in this class is method seven.

70
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.180
Hence why in the message hello world for method seven has printed.

71
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.310
So if I copy this quickly.

72
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.170
And added a new method called Method nine.

73
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.020
Change this thing on as well and save this.

74
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.110
Why try running that testing smell again?

75
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.920
You can see that two have run method seven and method nine.

76
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.270
And that's because method eight is quite simply been excluded.

77
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.030
So it's very simple.

78
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.530
And I hope you found this useful.

79
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.210
Thank you for watching.
