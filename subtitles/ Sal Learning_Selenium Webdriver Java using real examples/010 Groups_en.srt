1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,290
In this lecture, we explore the testing group's.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,550
So WhatsApp groups, they are a powerful way to group tests together so that we can run a specific group

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,170
of tests at a time.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,670
For example, say we had a handful of tests we want to run during a smoke test and then wanted to test

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,310
in more detail during a regression test.

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:31,700
We can assign a group to the tests that make up the smoke tests and do the same for those that form

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,170
the regression tests.

8
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:41,590
This way we can amend our test engine small file to only run the group of tests that meets our requirement.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,240
So let's take a look at the following example.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,210
So I have a test energy example file.

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:58,030
And I've assigned a group to the add item to basket and check out classes so I can amend my tests in

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,730
small file to only run the smoke group, which includes these two classes.

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:12,130
I can then amend the text in simple file to run the regression group of tests, and the regression group

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,780
includes the log in ad review.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,090
I do that since basket.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,620
Check out and check our order.

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,200
So this is how we can assign groups to different classes, and then we can be selective to run a particular

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,320
group by amending our Test and G example.

19
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,940
So let's try this out.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,730
To demonstrate the use of groups.

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,220
I need to reuse classes from the last lecture, so I'm going to use the ones from lecture free.

22
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,310
So this class is Lecture Free II, which simply had two methods method one and method two.

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,550
And they both outputs in a simple message console.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,610
And we also had free B, which was method free, a method for which also outputs it.

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,960
A simple message to console.

26
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:09,699
So I am going to copy l zero free a and paste it and call in this new class l10 a test energy example

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,920
and I'm going to do the same for the free B class call in this one L10 ten B test energy example.

28
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,690
And they are now both listed here.

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,680
So in this second one, I am going to create one more method.

30
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,450
So I'm going to copy method for.

31
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,730
And paste it.

32
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,000
And I'm going to call this new method five and I'm just going to change the message to console two,

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,080
method five as well.

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,600
And then I'm going to say that class.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,310
So if I open up today, you'll see there's two methods here.

36
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,990
Method one and method two.

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,590
And I'm going to assign groups to each of these.

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,510
So on the line of test, I'm going to write here, I'm going to open and close brackets.

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,460
And inside there, I'm going to write groups equals.

40
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,010
And then prices.

41
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,720
And inside those braces, I'm going to add double quotes and I'm going to write Smoke.

42
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,500
And then after that double quote or not use a comma and I'm going to use double quotes again and write

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,130
regression.

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,850
So I am now going to copy that line and paste it to the second one.

45
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,560
But this second one is only going to contain smoke.

46
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,390
So method one has groups equal smoking progression, but method two has groups equal smoke.

47
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:53,300
So I'm going to copy this again and open up the ten, be a class and I'm going to do the same for this

48
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,540
one.

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,780
And for this one, I'm going to paste it.

50
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,970
But this one is only going to have.

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,950
Regression.

52
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,810
And this final one is also only going to have regression.

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
So save both of these classes.

54
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,579
And then I'm going to open up the test engine XML.

55
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,410
So the first thing I need to do is update the class tags to list those new to classes.

56
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,660
So on I remove this.

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,390
I'm going to change that to L ten.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,050
I underscore test and g x, you know, like so.

59
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,450
And I'm going to copy that line.

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,090
And paste it again for ten be.

61
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,670
So this testing example now points to these two files.

62
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,990
And the next thing I'm going to do is.

63
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,380
Make some room under here.

64
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,610
So within suite.

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,240
Underneath suite.

66
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,120
I am going to introduce some new takes.

67
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,750
So I am going to use the take of groups.

68
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,430
Like so.

69
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,950
And inside those groups tags, I'm going to use one.

70
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,460
And inside those run tags I am going to use include.

71
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,630
And I'm going to provide a name.

72
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,340
Equals.

73
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,250
And I am going to write inside those double quotes smoke.

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,950
Then outside.

75
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:43,130
So after the double quote, I'm then going to use a forward slash and appointee bracket.

76
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,450
So this has now we have now finished writing his test inject smell.

77
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,890
So I'm going to save it.

78
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,050
But before I run this, what do you think's going to happen?

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,640
So let me try running it and let's see.

80
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,820
And you can see a total of free tests for run and free of past.

81
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,420
And the reason for that is I've included the smoke group.

82
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,150
And if I look in that first class, you'll see this one has been set with a group name of smoke.

83
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,440
And so this one.

84
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,300
So that's two in total.

85
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,540
And if I look at the second class, you'll see only this one has a group smoke.

86
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,060
And that's why only free have run.

87
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:42,010
So in my tests in g small file if I was to change smoke to regression.

88
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,550
And save and try running it again.

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,040
Let's see how many run this time.

90
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,800
And you can see that for one this time.

91
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,030
And if I look at a first class, this one has been set with a group of aggression, which is one in

92
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,540
total.

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,420
Two, three and four.

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,720
If I look upwards, you'll see that MiFID five was printed.

95
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,770
Which is this?

96
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,450
Method for which is this one, a method free.

97
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,290
Which is this one.

98
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,640
And method one from the other class.

99
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,250
Which is the one that was set.

100
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,880
The group name of regression.

101
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,960
So that's how we can use groups in our code.

102
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,220
We can quite simply add groups to the test annotation and set a group name.

103
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:47,310
And then we can amend our test engine simple to use the groups run and include tags to be selective

104
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,800
in what group of tests we'd like to run.

105
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,710
Thank you for watching.
