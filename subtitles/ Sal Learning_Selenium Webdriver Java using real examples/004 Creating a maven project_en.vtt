00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.490
In this lecture, we're going to create our first Maven project.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.150
Now, there's two ways to Crater Maven project.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.610
First way is through Eclipse.

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.220
And the second way is for you to come online.

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.990
So in this lecture, I'm going to demonstrate how we can do this in Eclipse.

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.150
And in the next video, I'll demonstrates how we can do this in command line.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.380
So I have eclipse open and we have now finished with the intro project.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.630
So I'm going to minimize that like so.

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.490
I'm then going to click File New Project.

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.980
And you can see it as a folder for Maven.

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.450
And if I expand that, we've got the option for Maven project.

12
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.210
I'm going to highlight that and then click next.

13
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.010
So the default workspace should be ticked.

14
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.090
And if I browse to that, you'll see that it's pointing to my resources folder in a workspace folder.

15
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.140
So I'm going to keep that as is and then click next.

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
So this is the archetypes that we have available.

17
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.150
And it can take a few moments to load.

18
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.330
So please be patient.

19
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.420
So this is like a list of different templates that we can use for our MAVEN project.

20
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.830
So before I select one of these, I'm going to open up Chrome and I'm going to tie it.

21
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.120
Maven Quickstart art type.

22
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.610
And you should be provided with the following result.

23
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.650
So if I click this link.

24
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.050
You'll see the following page.

25
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.850
So this is a Maven type quickstart template.

26
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.180
And this is similar to what I demonstrated to you earlier.

27
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.960
So it has a project POM structure and a source folder for main and test.

28
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.050
So we're going to use this template.

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.390
So if you highlight this and copy it and then go back to Eclipse and then paste it in the filter.

30
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.850
You should see some results will appear.

31
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.979
So, again, this will take a moment.

32
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.160
So we want the one from org Apache maven archetypes and the artifact by the is maven archetype quickstart.

33
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.860
So if I click on next.

34
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.380
It's going to ask me for group point, the artifact guide and the versions already selected.

35
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.930
So the group point I'm going to use is UK.

36
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.930
Echo the automation testing.

37
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.650
And the artifact I.D..

38
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.880
I'm just going to call this Maven project.

39
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.960
And then I am going to click Finish.

40
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.040
Eclipse would then begin creating a Maven project for you.

41
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.430
And once that's finished loading, you can see Maven project is now listed.

42
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.980
If I expand that.

43
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.290
You'll see that it contains a similar structure to that template demonstrated.

44
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.570
So here we have the project.

45
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.760
Here we have the pom file and we have a source main java and a source text java folder.

46
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.910
And if I expand those.

47
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.230
You'll see the following.

48
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.910
So these are demo files and we can remove those later.

49
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.790
But we have now successfully created a MAVEN project in Eclipse.

50
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.020
So we'll be looking at this in more detail in the next few lectures.

51
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.380
But for now, I hope you found this useful.

52
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.260
And thank you for watching.
