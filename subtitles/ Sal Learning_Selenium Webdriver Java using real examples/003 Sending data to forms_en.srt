1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,160
In this lecture, we take a look at how we can send data to elements such as forms.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,980
So how do we send data?

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,830
So we use a command called send keys.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,290
And we've seen a couple of examples of this already.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,000
The same.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,950
His command emulates a user sending data to an element like a textbox.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,340
For example, enter in John in the first name filled.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,170
This command takes a parameter value, which is a value that gets sent.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,450
This could be useful if you want to test the form, not those found on contacts pages.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,740
So an example of how it uses command is driver defined element by name and in the first set of double

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,310
quotes is the selector value in only using keys.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,770
And then in double quotes I provide the value of John, and John is the value that will get sent to

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,270
the elements I'm sending it to.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,170
So let's try this out.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,920
So the first thing I'm going to do is open up the clips and instead of creating a new class and define

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,710
an order set up code again, I'm going to simply highlight the class in the last lecture press control,

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,170
see and feel my keyboard to copy and paste it.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,890
And I'm going to change the name of this new class to L zero Free Lecture three and I'm going to give

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,750
it a name of send in.

20
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,280
Later and then click.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,760
Okay.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,240
This will create a new class.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,520
And if I double click it, the new class will open.

24
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,770
So I am going to delete this bottom line as I don't need it.

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,570
And I also need to change this driver thought jet method to point to a different page on the automation

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,610
test and website.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:49,960
So if I go to Automation Test Encoder UK, I'm going to be using the Contact US form test page and here

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,820
we have a simple contact that's form.

29
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,790
So I've copied the URL and I'm going to paste it.

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,080
Update the get method to the new contact us form address.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,860
So this code or simply open up chrome, expand the window and it will take me to the contents form page.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,449
So I need to provide data for these fields.

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,570
So if I click on the page and then click Inspect, this would open up the developer's stores.

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,490
If I go to the Random Monstrosity tab and then user select the tool, I'm going to click on the first

35
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,140
name filled and this will provide some select the values that I can use.

36
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:36,200
So I'm going to use this first use as selector, but I don't believe I need the full selector value

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,850
in order to focus on the elements.

38
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,090
So I'm going to select the pencil icon, which will now place the selector into this textbox here,

39
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,820
and I'm going to delete his highlighted part.

40
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,140
So all I have left is this input.

41
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,780
Take the name of the first name.

42
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,340
If I press into my keyboard, you can see that only one element has been found.

43
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,950
So although of shorten this selector, this selector still only finds the one element that I'm looking

44
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,280
for.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,280
So I'm going to copy that selector when I go back to Eclipse.

46
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,120
And I'm going to write some comments in my code just to gather the selectors before I actually write

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,050
the code itself.

48
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,840
So two Ford slashes in Java would imply a single line comment.

49
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,970
And then I'm going to paste the selector value for the first name field as shown.

50
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,470
Now I am going to go back to the automation testing websites and I'm going to get to select the value

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,070
for the last name filled by using the exact same method.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm going to use a pencil and I'm going to shorten this process selector.

53
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,950
I'm going to confirm that.

54
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,670
Still, any funds?

55
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,220
One element I selected into my keyboard.

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,050
And then I'm going to copy it.

57
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,150
When you go back to Eclipse and I'm going to write another comment to paste that locator.

58
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,430
And I'm going to do the exact same with the email address.

59
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,190
Again shorten in the selector.

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,950
Precedented to confirm one single element.

61
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,580
Get a copy that and paste it below.

62
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,170
And then one final one for the last text field, which is the comments.

63
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,970
And again, only one element is found.

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,590
So I've got a copy that.

65
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,350
And I'm going to paste it as my final comment.

66
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,990
So these are the four selectors for the text fields.

67
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,100
So now I'm going to write code to start using these selectors.

68
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,510
So I'm going to write Driver the find element by dot CSA selector.

69
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,070
And then in double quotes, I'm going to provide the first name selector.

70
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,060
So I'm going to simply copy and paste it within double quotes.

71
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,180
At the end of this line, I want to send data, so I'm going to write dot, send keys and then within

72
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,140
double quotes.

73
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm going to provide the value, which is going to be the first name value I want to send to this text

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,480
field.

75
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,770
So I'm going to write John.

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,250
On the second line, I'm going to do exactly the same thing.

77
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,540
So I'm going to simply copy.

78
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,800
And pace the line above.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,560
But instead of input name, first name, I'm going to use a second selector.

80
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm going to replace the value within the first double quotes.

81
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,360
And he said that in my name, John, I'm going to change this to I'm going to use the name Smith.

82
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,960
So we were smart.

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,970
So then I need to do the same for the email address.

84
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,310
So I'm going to copy the line above and paste it.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,550
I'm going to use a selector for the email address field and replace the one in the double quotes.

86
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,330
And instead of the name Smith, I'm going to replace this with an email address value.

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,910
So I'm going to write John Smith.

88
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,630
At.

89
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,840
Test dot com.

90
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,310
And in the final one is for the text, the textbooks message.

91
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,180
So again, I'm going to copy the line.

92
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,690
I'm going to replace the selector value.

93
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,500
And instead of the email address, I'm going to send a random comment.

94
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,210
So I'm just going to write.

95
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,170
This is a message.

96
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,820
Full stop.

97
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,250
So we have now written the four lines, a code that uses different selectors in order to identify the

98
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,890
text fields in the contact as form page.

99
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,520
And I provided values for these by using the same key command.

100
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:06,110
So for the first time, I'm sending John last name, I'm sending Smith email address, I'm sending John

101
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,490
Smith for test dot com and for the message I'm sending, this is a message.

102
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,650
So I'm now going to say this class and I'm going to try running it.

103
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,420
Let's see what happens.

104
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,050
So you can see that that data has passed that a form and it's worth correctly.

105
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,200
So that's how simple it is to send data using send keys.

106
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,760
Thank you for watching.
