00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.450
In this lecture, we take a look at locating by link text.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.170
So what is link text?

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.480
Most websites will contain links to other sections, web pages or websites.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.910
We can select an element using part or all of the link text.

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.130
For example, say we had a link to contact us which took you to the Contact US page.

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.020
We could use the Selenium link text method to select the elements by search for link named.

7
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.730
Contact us on the web page.

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.970
If we take a look at the below code snippet, you can see I'm using by link text and in the next set

9
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.650
of brackets double quotes, I'm providing a link text value of contact thus.

10
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.670
Let's look at an example.

11
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.660
Okay.

12
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.360
So the first thing I'm going to do is open up Google Chrome and I'm going to go to the automation test

13
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160
in the code at UK website.

14
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.580
All I need to use is his home page.

15
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.910
And if we look on the left hand side, you'll see a menu and there are a number of links here which

16
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.060
will take you to a different Web page.

17
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.500
For this example, I'm going to use the actions link.

18
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.270
So the next thing I'm going to do here is press F12 on my keyboard to open up the Chrome developer tool.

19
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.360
On doing so you'll see that the menu collapsed.

20
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.000
So I'm going to click the burger bar to reopen the menu.

21
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.060
I'm then going to select the selector tool, and then I'm going to hover over and then click the actions

22
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.420
link.

23
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.000
If we look at the html, we can see that there's an open in and close in ally attack.

24
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.830
And inside these alloy tags is an I.D. take an I.D. tag is for links.

25
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.940
So we can see an open tag.

26
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.480
And after we can see hatred of an equal value, which is a link to another web page.

27
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.350
After that link, we then have actions and this is in plain text.

28
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.360
So this is a link reference or link text that we can then use.

29
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.130
So if we look at the HTML again, we can see actions as a capital, i.e., whereas if we look at actions

30
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.390
in the actual web page itself, actions is all uppercase.

31
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.510
So we need to reference one of these link takes values.

32
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.210
When we use the link text selector, so do we use actions in the HTML as shown with the capital, i.e.

33
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.440
or do we use the actions in uppercase as on the web page?

34
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.650
So we are going to be using the one from the Web page.

35
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.990
So the actions in uppercase and this is because link text is case sensitive.

36
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.660
So let's try this out.

37
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.490
So I'm going to open up the clips and I'm going to copy the class in the last lecture.

38
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.660
Some kinds of highlighted press control see and control reads.

39
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.650
Copy and paste it.

40
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.700
And I'm going to give this new class a name of l04 for lecture four underscore.

41
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.900
Located.

42
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.960
By link text.

43
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.840
And then I'm going to click okay and I'm going to double click that new class to open up.

44
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.660
So much of this code is going to be identical.

45
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.320
So the first thing I need to change, though, is the address from Driver.

46
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.340
They'll get to go directly to the automation test in home page and they need to change its last line,

47
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:56.270
which is C select the reference and I'm going to write driver dots, find element by dot link text and

48
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.630
you can see in the brackets I need to provide a string value.

49
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.650
So first I'm going to prove that the HTML link doesn't work.

50
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.600
So I'm going to copy actions with the Capital II and paste it in the double quotes.

51
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.410
And since this is a link, I'm going to want to click it.

52
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.769
So I'm going to write Doc click at the end of this line.

53
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.630
I'm then going to save this class and try running it to see what happens.

54
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.230
So you can see is gone to the automation testing homepage, but it hasn't clicked on the actions link.

55
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.720
This is proven that because we've used the HTML link reference, it hasn't worked.

56
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.960
And if we look at the error message here in the console.

57
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.240
I see what it says.

58
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.240
And it says no such elemental exception.

59
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.300
Unable to locate elements.

60
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.100
So it is unable to locate the elements used in the capitalized actions link.

61
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.690
So let's try this again.

62
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.220
But using the actions reference in all uppercase.

63
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.420
So I'm going to change actions to all uppercase as this is what appears on the web page.

64
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.180
Therefore save the class and try running it again.

65
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.040
Let's see if this works.

66
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.090
So as you can see, it's taken us to the actions Web page proving that it worked.

67
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.800
So we was able to do this by using the link text selector and providing a link takes value as shown

68
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.530
on the web page, not the page HTML.

69
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.460
So this is how we can use the link text selector.

70
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.870
Thanks for watching.
