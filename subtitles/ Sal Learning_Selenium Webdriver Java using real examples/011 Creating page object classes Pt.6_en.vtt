WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.390
So let's create our next page objects class.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.020
So we've just created one based on this page.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
A user would then typically select the proceed to checkout button.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.970
They'll then be presented with the following page.

5
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.980
So this page allows the user to enter personal information such as a name and an email address.

6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.300
And if we scroll down, we can see it as a continue button.

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.650
It.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.590
Also notice that there are some tabs here for the address.

9
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.820
Information, shipping method information and payment information.

10
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.600
So we got to handle these tabs as additional page object classes.

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.520
So the page object class began to create.

12
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.630
Now it's only going to focus on this first tab.

13
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.760
So I'm going to go back to Eclipse.

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.690
I'm going to right click the page object package, select new and select class, and I'm going to get

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.590
this the name of order form.

16
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.480
Purse info.

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.880
And then click Finish.

18
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.140
So the first thing I need to do is declare the web driver filled.

19
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.990
So public web driver.

20
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.470
Driver.

21
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.400
I would need to import that.

22
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.770
And then the next step is to start creating the locator filters.

23
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.660
So I'm going to use by and I'm going to give this first one a name of gender, mister.

24
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.530
And it's going to equal.

25
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.980
So I'm going to import the buyer class like so.

26
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
And then if I go back to the page, I'm going to find a locator for this Mr. Radio button.

27
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.250
So I'm going to right click it and inspect.

28
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.780
And then I'm going to go to runner ox velocity and I'm going to simply take his first one.

29
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.720
And I'm going to go back and I'm going to write by CSA selector and then paste that value with a semicolon.

30
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.960
So I'm going to do the same, but this time for the gender.

31
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.210
Mrs..

32
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.300
And he's going to equal buyer sex selector.

33
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.910
And I'm just going to focus on that Mrs. Option.

34
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.940
And I'm going to copy this.

35
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.250
And I'm going to paste it in the brackets like so.

36
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.240
So I need to do this for the various fields.

37
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.450
So I also need to do the same for the first name.

38
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.740
The last name.

39
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.090
Email address.

40
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.880
Password.

41
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.560
Birthdate.

42
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.580
And also the checkboxes.

43
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.900
So you've seen me do this a number of times and you know the process I follow now.

44
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.710
So to save a bit of time, I'm just going to simply copy the code which you can download from this lecture.

45
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.030
So I've done up to that point.

46
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.220
And I'm just going to paste it like so.

47
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.670
I need to import element.

48
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.950
So you can see that I've got a number of different selectors here available now which all reference

49
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.700
the elements on this page and I've just created simple.

50
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.140
Well after creating the constructor similar public methods as we've seen before, that returns the filled

51
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.880
value which contains the selectors.

52
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.740
So if you like to practice and write, it's mainly please go ahead.

53
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.980
Otherwise, you have the option to download the code from this lecture.

54
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.480
Thank you for watching.
