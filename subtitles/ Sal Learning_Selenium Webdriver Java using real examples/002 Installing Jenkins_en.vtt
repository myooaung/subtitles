00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.900
In this lecture we are going to install Jenkins, but before doing so I'm going to open up my resources

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.320
folder.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.260
I'm going to right click select new and creates a new folder for which I'm going to call Jenkins.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.010
And this is where I'm going to place the Jenkins file.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.440
I'm then going to open up a browser and I'm going to simply search for Jenkins download.

6
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.750
You should see a link to Jenkins download and deployment.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.850
And it should take you to the full page.

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.060
So the download that I'm interested in is this one here, which is ELTs and LTA stands for long term

9
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.690
support.

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.070
So we're going to use a lot more file approach, which is probably one of the easiest ways to install

11
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.730
Jenkins.

12
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.300
As you can see, there are various ways that we can also install Jenkins using installers such as one

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.910
for Windows or one for Mac OS.

14
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.629
So I'm going to click this Stop War link and it should start the download of that file.

15
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.070
So I'm going to pause this video until that completes.

16
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.220
So now that he has finished downloading, I'm going to right click on Select Shown Folder and you'll

17
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.590
see a Jenkins wall file and I'm going to simply control C to copy that.

18
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.660
And I'm going to place it in my Jenkins folder in my resources directory.

19
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.510
So I now have the Jenkins wall file.

20
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.180
So the next step is to open up.

21
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.840
Come online.

22
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.230
And what I need to do is I need to change directory to this Jenkins directory here where the wall file

23
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.250
is residing.

24
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.800
So I'm going to copy that path.

25
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.930
And in command prompt.

26
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.190
I'm going to see D which means change directory to that path.

27
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.110
So now I can run the command to install Jenkins and I can do this by write in Java.

28
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.770
Hyphen jaw.

29
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.990
Jenkins the war.

30
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.030
So this command will trigger the war file.

31
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.250
To execute.

32
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.000
But there's also a additional command you can run if you come across a port issue.

33
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.760
So we're run in Jenkins using a local host.

34
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.000
So that means that we're running a server from our local machine as opposed to running it on an independent

35
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.200
server elsewhere.

36
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.140
So if you find Port 88 is already in use.

37
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.430
You may need to write an additional command to use an alternative port.

38
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.720
And you can do that by write in the following command.

39
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:59.950
So java hyphen geor jenkins dot wor two hyphens htp port equals and in the port number that you want

40
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.580
to use.

41
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.580
So I'm going to be using the default ports, which is Port 88.

42
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.360
So on command prompt, I'm simply going to press enter.

43
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.720
And then we should see the installation of Jenkins executing in our command prompt window.

44
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.870
So you can see here that we're provided with an admin password.

45
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.200
So we're going to need to use this in a moment.

46
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.120
But you can also find that the password can be found in the following directory.

47
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.610
So just wait a few more seconds for it complete and we should see a message saying Jenkins is up and

48
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.000
running.

49
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.930
So here we can see Jenkins is fully up and running.

50
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.630
So that means that the installation has been successful.

51
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.610
So if I open up another tab on my browser and go to local host.

52
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.190
With a colon and in the port number and press enter.

53
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.120
It should take you to the Jenkins admin panel.

54
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.970
So on first set up, we need to provide that password.

55
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.180
So if I go back to command prompt, I'm simply going to copy this.

56
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.850
You control C on my keyboard and place that password and then click continue.

57
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.500
Jenkins wouldn't ask you to even select the suggested plugins or to select your own plug ins.

58
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.340
So I'm going to keep things simple and just select the suggested plug ins.

59
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.460
And this will start downloading some plug ins into Jenkins for us.

60
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.180
So I'm going to pause the video here until these have been installed.

61
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.520
Now that the plugins have finished downloading, we then taken to the following page where we need to

62
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.500
create a first admin user.

63
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.960
So I'm just going to write admin.

64
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.910
I'm going to provide a password and confirm that password.

65
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.810
A full name.

66
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.960
Some just can use tester and an email address of test at test dot com.

67
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.310
I'm then going to select, save and continue.

68
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:16.180
So you can see that the installation configuration your role has been provided, which is local, hosted

69
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.080
AT&T.

70
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.850
So this is the address that we need to use in order to access Jenkins.

71
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.970
So I'm going to click Save and Finish and it says that Jenkins is now ready.

72
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.460
If I select start using Jenkins, it will then take me to the Jenkins dashboard.

73
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.750
So this is Jenkins and we have now completed the initial installation.

74
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.820
And in the next lecture we're going to begin configuring Jenkins for our use.

75
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.080
Thank you for watching.
