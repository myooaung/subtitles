WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.180
So if I open up a clips, you'll see I have live project to open.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.020
And if we look at the resources package, this is the ideal place where we can place our workbook.

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.840
So I'm going to minimize this.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.870
Open up my resources folder and I'm going to control seeds and copy the credentials workbook.

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.240
I'm going to go to Eclipse and I'm going to highlight the resources package and do control V and you'll

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.240
see credentials box exo sex is now there.

7
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.260
So we've imported that spreadsheet, that workbook into our project.

8
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.050
The next thing I need to do is to create the two new page object classes.

9
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.640
But before I do that, I've noticed we need to make one small change.

10
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.240
So we already have a shop home page, page, object class.

11
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.810
If I open it, you'll see.

12
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.790
Currently we have selectors for the products, but we don't have one for the sign in button.

13
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
So we need to add one for the sign in button as we can to need this in our test.

14
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.380
So on the test or home page, I'm going to inspect the sign in button.

15
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.470
I'm going to go to run rocks velocity.

16
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.630
And I'm going to retrieve the second USS Locator.

17
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.340
Now, for some reason, Selenium Web driver doesn't like this first one.

18
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.410
So please ensure use of second USS Locator, which I've copied.

19
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.870
I'm going to go back to the page object class and I'm going to create a new variable.

20
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.480
It's going to be called by lock in button and it's going to equal by CSX selector, and I'm going to

21
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.860
place that value.

22
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.750
So I now need to create a new method which will retrieve this locator reference.

23
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.470
So I'm going to simply copy.

24
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.050
This method and instead of product eight, I'm going to call it Get.

25
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.950
Plug in button.

26
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.820
And instead of returning Product eight, I'm going to replace this with this value.

27
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.830
So that's what we need to do in our shop.

28
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.710
Home page paint object class.

29
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.490
So I'm going to save it and I'm going to close it.

30
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.030
So I need to create a new page.

31
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.050
Object class.

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.510
For.

33
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.220
It's log in page here.

34
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.550
So I'm going to do this by simply copying and pasting in the shopping cart class.

35
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.390
But I'm going to rename this new one.

36
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.730
Shop.

37
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.030
Log in page and then click.

38
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.540
Okay.

39
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.230
But then double click that class to open it.

40
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.490
I need to amend this class now for the purpose of this page.

41
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.970
So I'm going to delete all these fields apart from one just to reference that.

42
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.600
And I'm also going to delete all these methods apart from one.

43
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.810
So the first thing we need to do is update these fields.

44
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.490
So the first element I'll be using is this email address.

45
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.830
So I'm going to call this.

46
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.050
Email.

47
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.960
And if I right click and inspect the email filled and go to run along philosophy, I'm going to simply

48
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.240
copy this versus a selector.

49
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.460
And I'm going to replace the existing one.

50
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.280
If I then copy this line.

51
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.830
Instead of email, I'm going to changes to password.

52
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.960
And if I go back to the web page and users select a all to click on the passwords field, I'm then going

53
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.550
to take this CSC selector.

54
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.920
And I'm going to replace the value like.

55
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.870
So finally we need one for the sign in button.

56
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.040
So again, I'm going to get the selector tool and click it and I'm going to copy this selector value.

57
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.290
I'm going to create a new field.

58
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.770
But says this selector and I'm going to place a value.

59
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.690
So now we need to create the method or method is first method.

60
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.120
So instead of get to have promo, get the changes to get email and instead of return and have promo,

61
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.860
I'm going to replace it with the filled.

62
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.030
And I'm going to copy this method two more times instead of get email.

63
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.880
The second one is going to be get password.

64
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.720
And I'm going to pass that password like so.

65
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.190
And for this final one get submit BTN and on gets pass that filled like so.

66
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.820
So this is our shop log in page class now completed.

67
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.620
So I'm going to save it.

68
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.380
And then I'm going to copy it and paste it.

69
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.100
And this second class is going to be called.

70
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.050
Shop.

71
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.600
Your account.

72
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.200
I think.

73
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.690
Okay.

74
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.410
So this class is going to represent.

75
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.920
Page when I successfully log in.

76
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.640
So this page here.

77
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.720
So I need to get a locator for this headed as I'm going to be using this in my test.

78
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.710
So if I go back here, I'm going to create or I'm going to amend this class similar to what I did last

79
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.040
time.

80
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.020
But I'm going to be leaving one method and I'm also going to be leave in one filled.

81
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.600
So I'm going to be calling his first field.

82
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.260
Heading.

83
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.680
And I'm going to get the locator for this, your account title.

84
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.600
So if I quickly inspected.

85
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.490
Again, go to runner up velocity.

86
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.390
You'll see that is simply a one element and it's unique.

87
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.800
So if I type page one here center, you'll see there's only 1h1 element on the page, which means we

88
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.520
can use this.

89
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.310
So I'm going to change this quite simply to the one value.

90
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.630
I'm also going to get a locator for four.

91
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.350
Closes the sign out button.

92
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.270
So if I inspect it.

93
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.920
Go back to run amok, Felicity.

94
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.880
You'll see.

95
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.060
I'm given a CSF selector, which I'm going to copy.

96
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.870
And I'm going to create a new field called.

97
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.250
By sign out this going to equal buyer.

98
00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.950
Yes.

99
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.550
A selector, and I'm going to place that value.

100
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.900
So now I need to amend this first method instead of get email.

101
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.970
I'm going to change it to.

102
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.280
It's heading and it's going to pass the heading filled.

103
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.140
I'm going to copy that method, paste it instead of gets hidden.

104
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.800
Get sign out, beat and.

105
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.570
I'm going to pass that sign out filled like so.

106
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.710
So this is the shop your account page.

107
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.240
An object class.

108
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.350
Now, complete it too.

109
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.090
So I'm going to save it.

110
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.970
And an encloses.

111
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.160
So those are the two page object classes we need.

112
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.450
And we've also imported the Credentials Workbook in next lecture.

113
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.310
We begin building our test by accessing the data from the Excel workbook.
