WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.730
So let's create our next page object.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.400
So we've just created the shop content panel, which is the following as shown.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.600
So as a user I may want to select proceed to checkout when I take this button.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.910
I'm presented with the following page.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.090
So this is the next page I'll be created.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.650
So in Eclipse I'll be right clicking page objects and select class and I'm going to give this a name

7
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.509
of shopping cart and then click and finish.

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.830
So the first thing I'm going to do is create the Web driver filled.

9
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.500
And then I'm going to create the fields for the locators.

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.200
So if I go back to this Web page, the first locator that I'm going to use is this.

11
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.390
I have a promo code link.

12
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.730
So I'm going to right click this link and inspect.

13
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.890
And I'm going to go to Red Rocks Velocity.

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.680
And I'm just going to take this top one here.

15
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.670
So I'm going to go back and I'm going to write by.

16
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.170
Have a promo and it's going to equal.

17
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
A test selector and I'm going to place that value.

18
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.420
The next field I'm going to create is a promo text.

19
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.970
Box and it's going to equal buyer.

20
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.660
And if I go back to the website.

21
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
When I click this link, this text box appears.

22
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.080
So I'm going to right click it and I'm going to inspect it.

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.860
Any Red Rocks velocity.

24
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.600
I'm just going to say this first.

25
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.590
This selector.

26
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.930
I'm going to write s selector and place that value like so.

27
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.440
The next one is the promo.

28
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.540
Add a button like so.

29
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.470
And it's going to equal fire.

30
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.220
And this one will be.

31
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.880
This button here.

32
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.020
So on.

33
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.860
And inspect it.

34
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.680
And the MetroPCS velocity.

35
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.300
I'm just going to say this first.

36
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.290
Yes, a selector.

37
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.570
And I'm going to my sister selector and pacer value.

38
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.120
The next field is going to be proceed.

39
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.220
To check out bottom.

40
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.570
And if I go to the website.

41
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.520
You'll see that there is a proceed to check out what's in here somewhere.

42
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.320
Inspect that.

43
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.840
And I'm going to take this first.

44
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.320
When again?

45
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.870
And I'm going to write by CSA selector and paste in that value.

46
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.640
So as you can see, I'm building up my class to contain all the elements that I think I require in my

47
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.150
test.

48
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.750
So once we've created these page objects, we can then build all of our tests using these pages.

49
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.580
So it's a bit of a mundane tasks to do at first, but once this has been created, it's very easy to

50
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.020
construct our tests using it.

51
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.690
So the next one is going to be by.

52
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.200
Delete.

53
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.090
Item one, and it's going to equal buyer.

54
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.380
And if I go back.

55
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.830
I'm going to be focusing will finding a locator for this delete cycle.

56
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.120
But before doing so, let me just demonstrate something to you.

57
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.970
So I'm going to go back to the home page and I'm going to add another product.

58
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.610
And now if I go back to the shopping cart page, you'll see that there's two items now listed.

59
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.529
So if I focus on this first icon and go to random velocity.

60
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.570
Take note of this end of type one.

61
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.840
So if I now focus on the second delete icon, notice how that changes to two.

62
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.900
So the reason for this is that this list is dynamic.

63
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.810
So if I was to add more products to my shopping cart, then the list will grow.

64
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.670
So there will be more elite icons such as M4 type free four, five, etc..

65
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.700
So I am just going to select on this first one and I'm going to take the second SS locator.

66
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.380
And I'm going to go back and here I'm going to write thoughts here selector and pacer value like so.

67
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.190
I'm then going to create a novel one and it's going to be called the Delete.

68
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:23.700
Item two and it's going to equal buy CSA selector.

69
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.890
And if I go back.

70
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.660
And just focus on that second one.

71
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.150
I'm going to take this one, which is exactly the same set for SQL, M4 Type two.

72
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.940
I'm going to place a hint of a semicolon.

73
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.990
So the final fill that I'd like to take is if I go back.

74
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.430
Is that?

75
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.230
I would like to get the total amount.

76
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.500
And the reason for this is I'm going to use this as ribbon surgeon when I create my test.

77
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.130
So I am going to right click and inspect that total amount.

78
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.370
And if I go to run ox velocity.

79
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.050
You see, I've got a nice car.

80
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.980
Total value.

81
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.120
So I'm going to copy that.

82
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.460
And I'm going to run it by.

83
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:30.880
Total value equals buyer CSA selector, and I'm just going to provide it like so.

84
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.380
So the next thing is to create a constructor.

85
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.810
And again provide an Webb driver driver.

86
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.640
And here this dot driver equals driver.

87
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.740
And then it's just a matter of creating the public methods.

88
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.470
So I'll create one and then I'll copy the code I've already written, which you can download.

89
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.760
Otherwise, again, you can practice and write your own methods if you'd like to follow.

90
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.310
So I'm going to write a public web element.

91
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.890
And I'm going to give this a name of get.

92
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.520
Have primary.

93
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.220
It's going to return driver thought one element.

94
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.130
And I'm going to purposely have promo filled like so.

95
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.540
I don't import web element for that ever to go away.

96
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:45.500
So I am now just going to copy in the remaining methods as we've seen the concept many times now.

97
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.050
Like so.

98
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.140
So that is this page object completed.

99
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.960
So thank you again for watching and I'll speak to you in the next lecture.
