00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.450
So let's create our last page object's class.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.310
So we've just created a page object for the shipping method page.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.750
So I am going to add some dummy data here and click continue, which will take us to the last page,

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.430
which is the payment page.

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.920
So on.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.590
Here we have two radio buttons.

7
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.590
And we also have a checkbox to agree to the terms of service and a button, which is order with an obligation

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.160
to pay.

9
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.340
So I am going to get locaters for these two radio buttons, the check box and the obligation to pay

10
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.760
button.

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.660
So I'm going to go back to Eclipse and that's right click the page objects package and select class.

12
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.590
And I'm going to give a name of order form.

13
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.090
Payment and then click finish.

14
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.440
So I have also pre-written the code for this class, which I am going to simply copy and paste.

15
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.080
And as mentioned previously, you can download this or you can practice yourself.

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.320
So I'm just going to import these classes.

17
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.290
Which will remove the errors.

18
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.770
And to just quickly go through this class.

19
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.020
So these are four fields.

20
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.360
So pay by check, pay by wire.

21
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.420
Terms and conditions and all the bottom.

22
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.850
Simple constructor, which passes the web driver object and in four public methods that are simply in

23
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.940
the fields which contains the value of the selector.

24
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.610
So this is the page object class is now complete and in the next video we will begin create in our tests.

25
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.990
Thank you for watching.
