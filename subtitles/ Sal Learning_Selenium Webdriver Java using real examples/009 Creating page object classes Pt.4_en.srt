1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,650
In this lecture, we're going to create our next page object class.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,210
So we have just created the shop product page, which is this page here.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,770
So as a user, I may want to enter or add this product to my cart, and I can do this by pressing this

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,250
button.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,250
And the forum panel will be displayed.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,000
So this is the next page that I will be creating locators and methods for.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:35,330
So I'm going to go back to the clips and I am going to right click page objects and create a new class

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,200
and I'm going to call this class shop content panel.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,170
And then click Finish.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,510
So again, like we've done previously, the first thing I'm going to do is write public web drive up

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,290
driver.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,860
Again, important Web driver.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,310
And now I'm going to begin, Chris, in the fields.

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:10,560
So the first field that I'm going to create is the continue shopping button.

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,640
So I'm going to right click it and inspect.

16
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,250
And on doing so if I go to velocity.

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,620
You'll see that I'm given some options here.

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,620
But again, I think this would be a good opportunity for us to see another customer locator.

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,190
So if I look at the dome, we can see that the button is listed here.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,150
So the main thing I want to do here is I'm going to use an X path, but this time I'm going to use the

21
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,850
text method, but I'm going to use it in combination with a method called contains.

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:56,440
So contains when used in combination with text to allow us to search for some of the text.

23
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,510
For example, just a search will continue instead of continue shopping.

24
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,410
So to write to write to located like this, I'd write the following.

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,350
The two forward slashes.

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,530
And then it's a baton element.

27
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,590
As displayed here.

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
Followed by a open in square bracket.

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,810
And I'm going to write contains.

30
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,120
And then a round bracket.

31
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,840
Text.

32
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,130
We've been open and close in around Brexit.

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,230
Coma.

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,280
And in in single quotes, I'm going to provide some of the name so I can write, continue or continue

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,500
shopping or SEO Anti.

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,200
We can use a number of different combinations.

37
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,910
So I'm just going to write continue like so.

38
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:03,190
Then outside of the single quote, I'm going to add a closing round bracket.

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,330
And then a closed in square bracket.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
And if I press enter on this.

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,370
Notice how the element has been located.

42
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:23,070
So we've used containers and we've also used the text method and we've provided some of the value.

43
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,220
So the full value is to continue shopping.

44
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,910
We've just provided continue and because there's no other element with a name of continue on the web

45
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,620
page, that's why only one of one elements has been located.

46
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,560
So I couldn't even reduce that.

47
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,440
The C.R.A. and presenter.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,650
And you'll see that only that one element matches that value.

49
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:58,380
So I am going to leave this as continue and I am then going to copy this locator and I'm going to go

50
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,860
back to Eclipse and I'm going to run it by.

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,360
And I'm going to give this a name of continued.

52
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,550
Shot in Baton.

53
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:21,010
And it's going to equal buyer x path in double quotes.

54
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm going to provide that locator.

55
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,660
The next one I'm going to go and find.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,100
Is the proceed to check out button.

57
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,760
So this is what the user will click to proceed to check out.

58
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,360
So if I inspect that item.

59
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,380
And go to Redbox Velocity.

60
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,040
You see that there's various values that we can use there.

61
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,580
So there is one thing I've noticed with random velocity, and sometimes it provides a locator with a

62
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,730
unknown, a character such as this question mark.

63
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,710
So a workaround that we can use is simply copy in this.

64
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,120
And I'm going to write by.

65
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,330
Check out checkout button equals bi link text.

66
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,340
But when I provide that value, I can simply remove that character and this locator will work fine.

67
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,010
So I'm going to add a semicolon now.

68
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,300
And those are the two fields that I need.

69
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:35,900
So the next thing after that is to create the constructor, which is going to be public shop content

70
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:36,710
panel.

71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,340
And inside those brackets, I'm going to provide a cab driver.

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,150
Driver?

73
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,880
And I've noticed once again I've spoke shop from I don't know why I keep doing that so I'm just going

74
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,520
to move to.

75
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,320
So here I am going to write this.

76
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,980
But driver equals driver, as we've seen many times now.

77
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,030
And as there's only two fields here, I'm just going to write the methods.

78
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:13,760
So public web element get continue shop.

79
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,580
Button.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,350
And he's going to simply return driver that fund element.

81
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,670
And I'm going to return.

82
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,420
It's filled here.

83
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,990
And again, you need to import web elements and that goes away.

84
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,800
But a second one, I'm going to create a public web element.

85
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,830
Get check out.

86
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,190
Button.

87
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,910
And this is going to return.

88
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,630
Driver not find element.

89
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,090
And so when you got check up on Mr. Death, which is fine.

90
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,770
So this is the pay page objects we needed for the shop content panel.

91
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,580
And as there is only two buttons here, this is all that we will be required.

92
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,120
So thank you for watching.

93
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,830
And I'll speak to in the next lecture.
