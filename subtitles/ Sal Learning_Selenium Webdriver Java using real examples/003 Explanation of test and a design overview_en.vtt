00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.530
In this lecture, I'm going to explain the test and also go over the design.

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.760
So we'll be using the test store to replicate a user log in.

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:09.950
In.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.710
Will be used in a combination of email addresses and passwords that are to be stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

5
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.410
We'll be creating two new page object classes, one for the log in page and another for the account

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.450
page for when a user is signed in.

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.130
Who then creates a new test class that will connect the Excel spreadsheet to retrieve the data.

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.680
The Excel spreadsheet that I'll be using will be attached to this lecture.

9
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.750
You are to use it by saving it.

10
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.700
So you haven't got to create it from scratch.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.240
Will be important into our framework.

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.170
And this is an example of what the work that contains.

13
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.710
So there's a single tab and it contains free columns, an email address column and a password column

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.380
and column C, which is valid credentials.

15
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.560
So we won't be actually use in column C.

16
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.200
This is just to let you know what email address and password combinations are saved against the website.

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.720
So as I've explained previously in this course, I recommend you create your own user email address

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.600
and passwords, because if another person is taking this course and using one of these email address

19
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.470
and passwords, you may be still in each of those sessions which will knock you out.

20
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.530
So we need to create two new page object classes as we think create these in my project one.

21
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.010
The first one is for the log in page on the left hand side where we have to enter an email address and

22
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.700
password.

23
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.940
And once a user has signed in, they wouldn't be displayed at your account page as shown on the right.

24
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.640
You then use these page objects in a new test class that will be name in shop.

25
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.020
Log in test stock java.

26
00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.340
This class will also access the Excel spreadsheet to access the email addresses and password combinations.

27
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.660
You wouldn't try logging into the store using the spreadsheet data using Apache player.

28
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.919
So let's walk through to test.

29
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.060
So the first thing I recommend you do is download the Excel workbook from this lecture, and then once

30
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.990
you've downloaded it, place it in your resources folder as shown.

31
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.920
Would then import this into our project in a moment.

32
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.710
So now that we've done that, I'm going to go to the automation testing websites, which is going to

33
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.000
be our starting point.

34
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.150
I'm then going to click on the test or link.

35
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.390
And then on the top right hand corner, we have a sign in link here.

36
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.990
If I click that, that will take you to the log in page.

37
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.820
So this is where we need to provide an email address and password combination.

38
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.530
And this is where we can also use the Excel data to import this here.

39
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.670
Once we enter an email address and password, we're going to click the sign in button.

40
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.390
So the first user or email address and password you're going to be using is going to be a valid form.

41
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.760
So if I click, sign in here, look what happens in the top right hand corner.

42
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.740
So you can see I'm signed in and I'm also taken to the your account page.

43
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.270
So this is where a user is taken if they successfully sign in.

44
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.680
If I was to enter invalid email, address and password.

45
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.700
You can see the I guess the error message authentication failed.

46
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.300
And I'm not taken to your account page.

47
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.880
So this is how we know what happens if a combination is valid or is invalid because the user is taken

48
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.900
to different paths.

49
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.340
So this is what we're going to be doing in our test.

50
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.130
And if I go back to the Credentials Workbook, you'll see the data that will be used in.

51
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.420
In the upcoming lectures, I'm going to show you how we construct our tests and how we can actually

52
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.130
use this data in our tests.

53
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.040
But first, we need to create the page object classes.
