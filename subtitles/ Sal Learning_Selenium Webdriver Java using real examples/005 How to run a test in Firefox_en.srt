1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,340
In this lecture, we're going to create a new class in order to create code which will interact with

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,160
the Firefox browser using the gecko driver.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,430
So in Eclipse if I double click and open the chrome demo class from last lecture.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,720
Much of this code is going to be very similar to what we need.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,340
So I'm going to close this class and we have it still highlighted.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:33,650
I'm going to simply copy and paste it by using the control C and then control V on my keyboard.

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,980
On doing so I'll be asked to provide a new name for a new class.

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,950
And I'm going to call this fire.

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,920
Fox.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:44,750
Demo.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,780
And then click.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,350
Okay.

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,850
And then you'll see Firefox demo dot Java has been created.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,690
And if I double click that class, you'll see that open.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,700
Sudan are a few things we need to change in this new class in order to interact with the Firefox browser.

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,450
The first is this set property line where we need to change the key and we also need to change the path

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,230
to the driver.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,550
So if we follow this path and look in file explorer.

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,500
We can see that all the drivers are located at the same location.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,590
So all we need to do is change the driver name.

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,790
On the second line, you can see that we're also using Chrome Driver.

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,220
So this is something we also need to change.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,920
So let's start making the changes.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,730
So on the set property line, I'm going to replace Web Drive Adult Chrome driver with web driver.

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,560
Dot Gecko driver.

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,260
And in the value set apart location.

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm going to change chrome driver to gecko driver.

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,470
On the second line, I'm going to replace Chrome driver with with Firefox driver.

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,970
But note that the second F fox is lowercase.

30
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,190
If we then hover over Firefox driver, we've got an option to import it from selenium and on doing so,

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,660
that red line goes away.

32
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,880
And if we look at the imports at the top, you'll see the Firefox driver has been added.

33
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:24,180
Also notice we've still got the Chrome driver listed and since we're not using that in this class,

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,430
we can simply highlight and delete it.

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,080
So the rest of the class can remain the same.

36
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:38,400
So we can use driver dot manage window maximize to maximize the Firefox driver and we can also still

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,540
use a driver to get methods to go to the automation testing website.

38
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,160
So let's save this class and give it a try.

39
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,140
So I'm going to right click Select Run and Select Drive Replication.

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,760
Let's see what happens.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,800
So you can see that the Firefox browser has opened up and it's expanded the Firefox window.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,490
So you may remember back from an earlier lecture where I very briefly explained the use of the Web driver

43
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,300
interface.

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,160
So here we use it in our code.

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,310
And currently web driver driver equals new Firefox driver.

46
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,060
So this driver could be anything.

47
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,820
It could be a Firefox driver.

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,800
It could be a chrome driver.

49
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,120
Or it could be an edge driver.

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,130
And the reason for that is because driver is the type web driver.

51
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,650
So how he could write this as well is Firefox driver driver equals new Firefox driver.

52
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,300
And if I say this class and try running it, you'll be accepted.

53
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,720
But the problem is, is that if we wanted to try to change a driver, chrome driver and import chrome

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,170
driver.

55
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,510
You'll see they won't be accepted.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,230
And if you hover over the error, says type mismatch.

57
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,390
So this is why we use the web driver interface.

58
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,600
If I change this back to Web driver.

59
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,860
You can see that driver now equal chrome driver.

60
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,690
So this helps support cross browser testing.

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,530
We're able to easily change the driver type and we can do that because we use the web driver interface.

62
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,850
That is everything I wanted to cover in this lecture.

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,320
In the next lecture with take a look at the Edge browser and driver.

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,460
Thanks for watching.
