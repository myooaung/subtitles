00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.220
So let's take a look at an example of inheritance.

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.850
So I'm going to simply copy and paste the class in the last lecture.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.950
I'm going to call this L 14 for lecture 14, and I'm going to give it a name of inheritance like so.

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.850
And then click.

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.360
Okay.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.120
So I'm going to open up that class and I'm going to remove this method, which we don't require, and

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.910
I'm just going to clear out the main method like so.

8
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.410
So the first thing I'm going to do.

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.810
So outside of these braces is I'm going to create a class within the class.

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.810
And to do this, I'm just going to type class.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.500
And I'm going to call it vehicle.

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.920
And then with open and close embraces, like.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.160
So the first thing I'm going to write is private.

14
00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:01.540
String Mike equals and in double quotes, BMW with semicolon at the end.

15
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.650
So I have just created a private field called Make.

16
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.430
The next thing I'm going to do is create a method and this is going to be public string.

17
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.320
Get Mike.

18
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.370
Open and close in brackets and an open and close embrace.

19
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.670
And in now I'm just going to return.

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.620
Mike.

21
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.000
So when this method is called.

22
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.570
It's going to return the value of this field.

23
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.820
Then after that, I'm going to create another method called public void.

24
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.430
Rev.

25
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.600
And this method is simply going to use system.

26
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.980
Not out of print when.

27
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.930
And it's going to return them like so.

28
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.050
And I'm going to add a semicolon at the end.

29
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.100
Mr. Taylor.

30
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.650
I'm just going at that t and it's fine.

31
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.060
So now outside this class.

32
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.759
So after this end, brace.

33
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.110
I'm going to create another class and I'm going to call this class car.

34
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.140
But the key difference to this one is that it's going to use the extends keyword.

35
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.230
And it's going to extend the vehicle class like so.

36
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.260
And then I'm going to have another open and close embrace.

37
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:44.240
And inside this class, I'm going to create another filled private string model, and it's going to

38
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.220
equal the value free series.

39
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.390
It was semicolon at the end.

40
00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.930
Now at the end of this, I'm going to create a method, public method called public string get model.

41
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.750
And this is simply against return.

42
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.460
The field model.

43
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.010
So I've created two additional classes here.

44
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.990
One which is called vehicle.

45
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.480
And another one called Car, which extends vehicle.

46
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.720
Okay.

47
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.410
So I'm going to go back to the main method at the top.

48
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.680
And in here I am going to do the following.

49
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.890
I'm going to create a new car object and I'm going to call it car object like so.

50
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.420
Equals new car.

51
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.390
And then with that object.

52
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.460
I am going to call a method called rev like so.

53
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:07.270
And then underneath this line, I'm going to use system dots out the print alone.

54
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.560
And inside this, I'm going to use the car object again.

55
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.279
I'm going to use the method get.

56
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.899
Mike.

57
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.620
And then Ong used the plus symbol with double quotes just to put a space in between the values.

58
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.110
The plus symbol again, can't object.

59
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.780
Dot get model.

60
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.740
And at the end of that line, I'm going to use a semicolon.

61
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.720
So I am going to say this class before I run it, let me just explain quickly what it's doing.

62
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.910
So I've created a new class called Vehicle, which has a field called Make, and that Mike Fields has

63
00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:02.380
been assigned a valuable W a single a public method called get mike, which will turn the value of that

64
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.740
field.

65
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:11.110
And it's got another public method called ref, which system prints out the word room and console.

66
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.850
I've then got a car class and this car class extends this vehicle class.

67
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.680
But the car class itself has a field called model, which has been assigned the value of free service.

68
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.750
And it's also got a method called get model which returns the value of that field.

69
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:41.050
Now in the main method, I've created a car object called car object, and using that car object, I'm

70
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.490
using a method called ref, which belongs to the vehicle class.

71
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.720
I'm then printed out using system outthought print line.

72
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.730
I'm using the car object again, but this time to use a method called Get Mike, which is a method that

73
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.750
belongs to a vehicle.

74
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.040
And I'm using the car object to use get model, which is another method.

75
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.740
But at method belongs to the car class.

76
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.580
So let me try running this to see the output.

77
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.990
And you can see the room has been displayed and so has free BMW and free series.

78
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.520
So the key thing to understand here is that I've created a car object.

79
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.040
So it's a new car.

80
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.430
So I've created an object based on this class.

81
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.960
But this class has access to the fields and methods within the vehicle class.

82
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.450
Okay.

83
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.980
So if we look at Mike.

84
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.970
Of BMW.

85
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.430
That BMW belongs to the vehicle class.

86
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.140
But by creating a car object, I'm able to call.

87
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.900
The get make method.

88
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.880
And the rev method.

89
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:09.530
Use in the car object because the car object extends or the car class extends the vehicle class.

90
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:17.480
That's why I'm able to output the following, because the car object has access to the methods of the

91
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.440
vehicle class.

92
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.150
And that is the key points of inheritance.

93
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:30.430
By using the extends keyword, we can have access to the attributes and methods of another class for

94
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.560
which the class extends.

95
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.610
So take this can be quite confusing if this is quite new to you.

96
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.020
But you'll see how important this concept is when we come to create in our frameworks.

97
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.530
But the main purpose of this is not only to have access to the attributes and methods of another class,

98
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.650
but is to prevent repetitive code.

99
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.370
So using this concept, we can reuse code.

100
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:05.020
So I hope you found this lecture useful and I look forward to speaking to you in the next.
