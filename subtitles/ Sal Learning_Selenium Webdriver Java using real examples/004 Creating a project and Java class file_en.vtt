00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.010
In this lecture, we create our first Java project and Java class.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.380
So what is a Java project?

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.340
A project is a group of source files and the settings for which you build, run and debug those source

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.940
files.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.330
Any idea or Java development has to take place within a project.

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:31.020
For applications that involve large codebases, it is often advantageous to split your application source

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.510
code into several projects.

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.560
So here we look at Java classes and objects.

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.520
To understand classes, we need to also talk about objects.

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.360
Java is an object orientated programming language, often referred to as O.P..

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.920
An object is an instance of a class, whereas a class is like a blueprint for that object.

12
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.770
For example, we might have a car class.

13
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.129
We might create two object instances of that class.

14
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.150
For example, one for Ferrari and another for BMW.

15
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.590
Both are based on the car class blueprint, but the Ferrari and BMW objects will have unique features.

16
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
For example, the top speed that a Ferrari might be higher than the BMW object.

17
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.010
So let's try to visualize this.

18
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.840
So imagine I have a car class and this class has free fields.

19
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.450
Make a model and top speed.

20
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.260
If I create objects based on this class.

21
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.880
So one on the left hand side for Ferrari and the other for BMW.

22
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.720
On the right hand side you can see that the properties of that make model and top speed are different.

23
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.540
On the left one, the make is Ferrari.

24
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.360
The model is for five Italia and it has a top speed of 210 miles an hour.

25
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:06.150
On the right object to object to is a make of BMW model of M3 and a top speed of 155 miles per hour.

26
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.150
So we will be writing a number of Java classes for out this course.

27
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.010
The cross will contain code.

28
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.290
So think of it of instructions that the computer will interpret to run our tests.

29
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.540
A cross will often contain fields, a constructor and methods and would learn more about that later.

30
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.490
For now.

31
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.520
Just remember we'll be creating a Java project in Eclipse and then a Java class within that project.

32
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.920
So before I open up a clips, the next thing that I'll be doing is creating a new directory where we're

33
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.960
going to store our workspace.

34
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.840
So I'm going to double click the resource folder.

35
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And inside this, I'm going to right click select new and select folder and I'm going to give this folder

36
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.830
a name of work space.

37
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.200
So this is where our projects are going to be stored.

38
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.380
And then go to double click a clips, open it.

39
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.380
And you can see on this screen, we used the default workspace before, but this time I'm going to browse

40
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.980
and I'm going to navigate to that workspace folder.

41
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.830
So in the resource folder, I'm going to highlight the workspace folder and then click select folder.

42
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.540
That wouldn't update the workspace path to that new folder.

43
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.800
And now I'm going to click launch, which will open up Eclipse.

44
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.140
So what this means is that when we create a new project and save that project, those files are now

45
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.840
going to be listed in that new workspace folder.

46
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.420
So when Eclipse opens, you may see this welcome screen.

47
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.260
So I'm going to close this as we're not going to use it.

48
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.640
And on the left hand side, you'll see the Project Explorer with free options.

49
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.400
And one of those is to create a Java project.

50
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.310
But the usual way that will create a new driver project is food to file menu.

51
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.920
Select a new and select in Java project.

52
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.590
And if we select that, we're shown the following.

53
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.720
So we need to enter a project name.

54
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.839
And I'm going to call this intro with a capital I.

55
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.370
In the jury section, you'll see that the use an execution environment Jerry has been preselected.

56
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.720
But I'm going to take this use default Jerry, which is the JDK we installed in earlier lectures.

57
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.050
Once that's done, click finish and then you'll be asked to create a module which we don't need.

58
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.600
So we need to do is click don't create.

59
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.040
So if we look at the Project Explorer window will now see that there is an intro project folder.

60
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.140
So this is what we just created.

61
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.520
If we expand it, you'll see two other folders already system library, which contains all the Java

62
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.950
classes that come bundled with the JRA.

63
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.150
You also have a source folder which is currently empty.

64
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.410
So we're going to create a class on the resource folder.

65
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.240
If we right click it.

66
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.130
And select new and then select the class.

67
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.920
We should be presented with the following panel.

68
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.450
So I need to provide a class name and I'm going to get this class a name of call with a capital C.

69
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.390
So it's important to know that in Java all classes should begin with a capital letter.

70
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.800
You can also see it as an option to select public static void main.

71
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.740
And I'm going to take this and then click finish.

72
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.450
You then see that the class has been opened and it is now showing the core Java class.

73
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.200
You also see this public static void main method.

74
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.960
So in Java programs, the point from where the program starts is execution or simply the entry points

75
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.540
for Java program is the main method.

76
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.000
So this means when over my code, this is where the program will begin executed.

77
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:16.550
So inside that my method I'm right in system with a capital s dots out stop prints l end round brackets,

78
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.620
double quotes and inside those double quotes on right in I am a car class.

79
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.500
Full stop at the end of that line.

80
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.420
I'm going to add a semicolon.

81
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.300
If I go to file and then saved, save that class, I'm now able to run it.

82
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.140
So if I right click that class and go to run as new select Java application.

83
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.600
You'll see in the console that takes has now been output and it states I am a car class.

84
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:54.440
So we've created our first Java project and our first class called Car and was able to run that code

85
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.220
of the car class to output a message in the console window.

86
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.850
So I'm going to minimize the clips and I'm going to take a look at our workspace directory.

87
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.000
So under resources I'm going to click workspace.

88
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.710
And inside that workspace is an intro folder, which is the name of our project.

89
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.520
Inside that you'll see a source folder.

90
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.050
If I double click source folder, you'll see our core class.

91
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.650
So this is the hierarchy of our project.

92
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.230
So our car class falls inside the source folder, which belongs to the intro project.

93
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:37.270
So that is everything I wanted to cover in this lecture, and I hope it's giving you a good understanding

94
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:43.780
of how we can create a job, a project, and a job a class in the next lecture will begin download in

95
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.480
the classes we need to use Selenium web driver.
