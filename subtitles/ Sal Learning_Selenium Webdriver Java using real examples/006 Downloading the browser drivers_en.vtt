00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.760
In this lecture, we download the drivers so that we can interact with the web browsers.

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.850
So remember that Selenium web driver works by controlling the browser through the operating system.

3
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.000
We need a way for our test scripts to interact with the browser.

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.040
This is where the Web drivers come into play.

5
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.040
Each browser has their own driver, for example.

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.500
Chrome has a driver named Chrome Driver.

7
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.870
Firefox has a drive.

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.070
A ninth gecko driver.

9
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.730
And Edge has a driver named Edge Driver.

10
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.640
So the key thing to remember is that each driver is specific to the browser type.

11
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.910
So if we take a look at the following diagram, I can write a test in Java which will use the chrome

12
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.070
driver to talk to the Chrome browser.

13
00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.120
And it's the same for Gecko driver which will talk to the Firefox browser and the same for Edge Driver,

14
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.670
which will talk to the Microsoft Edge browser.

15
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.560
So let's begin download in the driver's.

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.640
Before I download the drivers, I'm going to create a folder to store them in.

17
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.820
So I'm going to double click the resources folder.

18
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.610
I'm going to right click select new and in select folder.

19
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.550
So I'm going to call this folder drivers.

20
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.200
Underscore the one.

21
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.750
I'm then going to close this window.

22
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.270
And I'm going to open up Chrome browser.

23
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.660
So in the search engine, I'm going to type chrome.

24
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.490
Driver download.

25
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.530
The first result should be to chrome driver dot chromium dot org.

26
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.210
And if I click this link it should show you the following page.

27
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.960
So here you can see different Chrome versions.

28
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.970
And you'll see on the same line there is a link to the Chrome driver, which is specific for that Chrome

29
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.570
version.

30
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.660
So an important tip is to make sure you download the correct driver for your browser version so you

31
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.200
may not realize it, but google push updates for your browser and so your browser version can change.

32
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.110
So during this course, if you find that your browser version is later than what you started with,

33
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.550
you may need to download the latest driver for that specific version.

34
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.350
To find out what version of Chrome you're using if you click on this burger bar and then go to help.

35
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.980
And select about Google Chrome.

36
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.310
This panel here will display the version of Chrome currently installed.

37
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.090
So I need to download a specific driver which works with this version of Chrome, and I can see that

38
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.470
based on that version of Chrome.

39
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.550
I can download this particular version, which is 88.

40
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.440
So I'm going to click that link which will display the following page, and I've got options to download

41
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.310
the Chrome driver based on my operating system.

42
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.470
So as I'm using Windows, I'm going to select this Win32 zip and the download will begin.

43
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.810
So if I click on this download and go to show in folder, you'll see the chrome driver zip folder.

44
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:34.040
So I am going to minimize the browser and I'm going to drag that zip file over to my desktop and I'm

45
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.300
going to close this window.

46
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.960
So I'm going to unzip the contents of this folder into this drive up V1 folder.

47
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.630
So if I move this window over here and then double click on the zip file.

48
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.970
I'm going to simply drag the chrome driver into that driver V1 folder and that will unzip in that location.

49
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.650
As I no longer need this zip file, I'm going to place it in my recycling bin.

50
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.140
So the next step is to download the gecko driver for the Firefox browser.

51
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.570
So if you haven't got the Firefox browser, we're going to need to first download it.

52
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.480
So I need to download this for my machine too.

53
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.710
So I'm going to open up Chrome and I'm going to search for Firefox browser.

54
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.970
And if I search, the first result should be to the Mozilla dot org website and if I click on this link.

55
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.800
You should see a page which shows you a download Firefox button.

56
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.270
And if I click that the download of the Firefox browser should begin.

57
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.950
Once has finished downloading.

58
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.390
If I click on the installer, this should open up the installation wizard.

59
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.760
So I'm going to pause this video until the installation has finished.

60
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.980
So now that he's finished installing, you can see the Firefox browser on my screen.

61
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.730
So on first opening of Firefox asks you whether you want to set this browser as the default browser.

62
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.390
So I'm not going to do this, so I'm going to select not now.

63
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.180
In order to interact with the Firefox browser, we need to download the gecko driver.

64
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.480
So I'm going to close Firefox and for consistency I'm just going to open up Google Chrome.

65
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.170
So I'm going to search for gecko driver downloads.

66
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.430
And if I click enter, you should see the first result is to it gets a page at Mozilla Gecko driver

67
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.200
releases.

68
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.710
And if I click on this link, you'll see the Gecko drive it release.

69
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.210
And at the time of recording, 29 was the latest version.

70
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.840
So if I scroll down, you'll see that there is the options to download the driver based on our operating

71
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.350
system.

72
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.550
So as I'm using Windows, I'm going to select this within 64 zip.

73
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.700
When doing so, the download will begin.

74
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.640
So once has finished downloading.

75
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.820
If I click on it and go to show in folder, you'll see in my downloads folder I have the gecko driver

76
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.180
zip.

77
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.500
So like last time, I'm going to drag that over to my desktop.

78
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.670
I'm going to close this window and I'm going to unzip the content into my resources driver V1 folder.

79
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.750
So I'm going to double click the zip file and I'm going to simply drag the content to that driver V1

80
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.170
folder.

81
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.440
So we now have the gecko driver as well.

82
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.730
So the next step is to download the driver for the Microsoft Edge browser.

83
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.980
So as I'm using Windows, the Edge browser comes by default.

84
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.550
So you can see I have Microsoft Edge listed here.

85
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.970
If you haven't got Microsoft Edge, then all you need to do is go to a search engine and type Microsoft

86
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.480
Edge download and install it, similar to what we did with Firefox.

87
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:08.420
So to download the Microsoft Edge driver, I'm going to open up Chrome and search for MSS Edge driver.

88
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.730
And on searching.

89
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.760
The first results should be to developer Dot Microsoft.com, Microsoft Edge tools.

90
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.990
And if I click on this link, it should display the following page.

91
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.220
So we're going to be using Microsoft Edge, which is on the left hand side here.

92
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.880
If I scroll down, you'll see that there is a download section and like Chrome, there are different

93
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.590
releases available to us.

94
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.300
So if I open up the edge browser by clicking it.

95
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.730
So similar to what we did with the Chrome browser.

96
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:50.330
If I click on the burger bar and go to help and feedback and select about Microsoft Edge.

97
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.610
We'll see the version I currently have installed.

98
00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:02.350
So I have version 82.0 .705.50.

99
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.020
So I need to download an H driver which matches that exact version.

100
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.280
So if we look at this top one here, it finishes with .50.

101
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.490
So I am going to select x64 as I'm using windows and this will download the edge driver.

102
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.380
So if I click on that download and go to show in folder, you'll see the edge driver zip file.

103
00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:37.419
And like I've shown you previously, I'm going to drag that zip file to my desktop.

104
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.590
I'm going to double click to open it and you'll see two files.

105
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:50.050
So I'm going to simply drag the message driver from the zip file location to my resources driver b one

106
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:50.590
folder.

107
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.370
So if I drag that over, that would unzip to that location.

108
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:05.310
So in my Resources Driver V1 folder, I now have the chrome driver, the gecko driver and the message

109
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.380
driver, which are the drivers we need.

110
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.110
So that's the end of this lecture.

111
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:18.740
And in the next section will begin writing tests that will use each drivers to interact with each of

112
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.460
the browsers.

113
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.990
Thank you for watching.
