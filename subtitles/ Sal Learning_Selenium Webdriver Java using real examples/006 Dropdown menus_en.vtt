00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.290
In this lecture, we look at how to handle dropdown menus.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.930
So what our dropdown menus, dropdown menus can be found across the web, a most commonly used in input

3
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.560
forms.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.210
They allow the user to select a value from the provided options.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.980
The select element is used to create a dropdown list and the options take inside the select element.

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.680
Define the available options in the dropdown list.

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.890
So if we look at the image on the right hand side, the select element is used as a surrounding opening

8
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.000
and closing takes.

9
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.730
The actual drop down value options are then listed using the option tags.

10
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.270
The Select Clause.

11
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.640
So to be able to select an option from a dropdown menu, we need to use the select class.

12
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.440
The select class is a web driver class which basically provides the implementation of the HTML select

13
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.830
take.

14
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.510
A select type provides to help methods with select and select options.

15
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.290
Don't worry.

16
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.590
If these slides appear confused, the demo will make it clearer.

17
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.840
So how to use a select class?

18
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.790
First we need to import a select package in our test in order to use it.

19
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.690
So this is the import that we would place in our code.

20
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.660
Then we must declare the drop down element as an instance of the select class and the example below.

21
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.030
We name this instance as call selection.

22
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.510
So cost selection is an instance of the select clause and within the brackets I provide a driver find

23
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.410
element by name cause.

24
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.970
Now we can select an option to cite BMW by using something like the below code.

25
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.750
So now I'm using the object call selection and I have access to methods.

26
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.039
So in this case, I'm using the select by visible text method and providing a value of BMW.

27
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.370
So let's try this out.

28
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.450
So before we write any code, let me first walk you through the text.

29
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.840
So I'm going to open up Chrome and go to automation testing the code at UK and I'm going to click on

30
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.660
the dropdown link which will take you to this page.

31
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.650
So we're going to write tests using this dropdown menu and if I select it, you'll see that there's

32
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.740
a number of options for different car makers.

33
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.650
And if I select one of these options, that value is then shown in the dropdown menu.

34
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.020
So the first thing to do is right click and inspect.

35
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.700
And then I'm going to get selected too, and then focus on that dropdown menu.

36
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.130
And if we look at the HTML, you'll see that it's highlighted a select line.

37
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.820
And if I expand that select line, you'll see that I'm given a number of options for different comics.

38
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.240
So here we have a value and we also have the text that appears on the Web page itself.

39
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.450
So what we need to use is the select class in order to interact with this.

40
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.040
So I'm going to minimize this for now and then open up a clips.

41
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.820
And then from using the class in the last lecture on that to highlight it and then copy and paste it

42
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.460
and I'm going to give it a new name.

43
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:42.610
So l06 lecture six and I'm going to call it a drop down menu and then click okay.

44
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.120
So if I double click that new class.

45
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.040
So I no longer need these lines from the last lecture, and I need to update the address to the drop

46
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.790
down page.

47
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.080
So I'm going to open up the browser and copy the address.

48
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.430
And I'm going to replace this here like so.

49
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.260
So the first thing I need to need to do is to use a select class.

50
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.300
So make sure to use a capital s like so s e l e c t and I need to give the object an object name.

51
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:33.030
So I am going to call this menu item and I'm going to write equals new select and in brackets and a

52
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.750
semicolon.

53
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.150
So you can see that select is currently highlighted we've been error so if I if I hover over select

54
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.230
you'll see I'm given an option to import so make sure to import the one from selenium support UI.

55
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.340
So if I click that Evernote now goes away.

56
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.510
But it's still an error under this one and if I hover over it.

57
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.920
You'll see that I need to provide a value.

58
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.720
So within the brackets I'm going to write Driver Dot's find elements.

59
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.740
But.

60
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.180
Thoughts.

61
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.310
I'm going to use a set selector, and for now I'm just going to want to double quotes.

62
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.800
So what I need to do now is go back to the web page and I need to provide a selector for the dropdown

63
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.660
menu itself.

64
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.080
So if I look at the rhetoric philosophy panel.

65
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.570
So I am going to get the selector tool and then click on the dropdown.

66
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.940
And these value, these selectors are already shown.

67
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.870
So the one I'm going to use is the simple one here.

68
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.930
So I have scores, which stands for I the cause, because the selector has an idea of cause.

69
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.210
So if I copy that.

70
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.130
And then go back to Eclipse.

71
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.530
I'm going to simply paste it there like so.

72
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.920
So the next thing I'm going to do is use that menu item object.

73
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.100
So I'm going to write menu item.

74
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.020
And then if I write dots.

75
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.710
You can see that I'm given access to a number of methods.

76
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.780
And the method I'm going to demonstrate is this one here.

77
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.690
So select visible text.

78
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.710
So for a double, click it.

79
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.610
You'll then see that there's brackets.

80
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.920
And in those brackets I need to provide a string.

81
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.830
So string is provided by double quotes.

82
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.390
So going by the method name select by a visible text.

83
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.800
What do you think that means?

84
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.270
So what it means is the text that we see on the Web page.

85
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.560
So in this example, I'm going to try and select Honda notes his Honda has a capital H.

86
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.300
So in my code, I'm simply going to write Honda as it appears on the web page.

87
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.170
And now I'm going to say this class and then I'm going to try running it.

88
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.000
Let's see what happens.

89
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.820
So you can see from the dropdown menu Hondo was selected.

90
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.560
So that's worked as expected.

91
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.460
Now, if I go back to clips and if I comment that line out.

92
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.540
Let me try another example.

93
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.440
So I'm going to write menu item thoughts, but this time I'm going to use.

94
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.650
Select by value so far click the.

95
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.720
And inside the brackets, I need to put double quotes.

96
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.700
So I need to provide a value here.

97
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.440
So what do you think I should write to select Jeep?

98
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:58.080
So you may think that I need to use the capital G, but because we selected by value, we need to look

99
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.710
at the HTML and here we can see that the option value equals G with a lowercase w.

100
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.060
So I need to use that value there with lowercase g.

101
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.960
So I'm going to write g like so.

102
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.670
So again, I'm going to say this class and see if that works.

103
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.870
So I'm going to run it.

104
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.730
And let's see.

105
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.100
So you can see it has been selected.

106
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.150
Now just for some reassurance.

107
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.030
Let's see what happens if I did change that to a capital J.

108
00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.320
Let's see if it works.

109
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.850
So again, I'm going to save.

110
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.840
And I'm going to run this class.

111
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.110
And you'll see that Jeep wasn't selected.

112
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.930
So an important thing to remember is if you're using select by value is to make sure you use the value

113
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.910
as it appears in the HTML.

114
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.040
So that's it.

115
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.540
It's fairly simple.

116
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.530
Once you got the hang of it.

117
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:11.520
But remember, if you're using interactive dropdown menus, always make sure to use the select class.

118
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.080
Thanks for watching.
