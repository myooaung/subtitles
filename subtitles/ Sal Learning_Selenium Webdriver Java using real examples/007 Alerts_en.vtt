00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.780
In this lecture, we look at how to handle the alerts.

2
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.620
So the most common alerts.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.740
So I know a simple witness.

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.200
And this alert is used to notify a simple warning message with an okay button as shown.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.980
Or there's usually confirmation of those.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.460
And this is usually used for confirmation of a task.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.310
For example, do you want to leave without saving?

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.060
Okay.

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.780
Or cancel?

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.610
So the main features of an alert and alert is displayed as an alert window to the user.

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.380
Alerts often used to communicate an important message.

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.480
The browser's focus shifts to the alert box, and the user can't interact with the web page until the

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.590
alert is closed.

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.180
An alert will not appear in the HTML or web page.

15
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.140
We need to use an interface to interact with the alert.

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.270
Switching to an alert and interacting with it.

17
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.060
We can interact with alerts by using Selenium switch two method and this method switches city news focus

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.600
and then by using the alert interface which exposed a number of methods that we can use to interact

19
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.350
with the alerts.

20
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.790
So to click on the okay button, we might write driver dot switch to dots alert except to click the

21
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.720
cancel button.

22
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.940
We might write driver dot switch to Dot's alert, not dismiss.

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.810
So let's try it out.

24
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.030
So before we begin, let me first walk you through the test.

25
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.010
So I'm going to open up chrome gates automation test in the co.uk and then click on the pop ups link,

26
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.170
which will take you to the following page.

27
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.090
So what I want to do in this test is click on this trigger alert button.

28
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.440
A alert will then appear and then I'll want to click the okay button to close it.

29
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.820
So the first thing to do is to inspect the page.

30
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.940
And if I open up the Runner Rocks philosophy panel and then use a selector tool to focus on that bottom.

31
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.060
You'll see that on then provided with some selectors.

32
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.120
So if I click on this button.

33
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:35.290
You won't find this alert in the HTML and we can't use a selector tool to focus on it because the browser

34
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.360
focus is now shifted to this alert.

35
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.740
So I can't even interact with this page until of closer look.

36
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.740
So this is where we need to use the switch to interface.

37
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.050
So I'm going to minimize this for now and open up the clips and I'm going to simply copy and paste the

38
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.610
class in the last lecture.

39
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.650
I'm going to give the new class the name of zero seven for Lecture seven and I'm going to call it alerts

40
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.270
and then click.

41
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.780
Okay.

42
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.880
So I'm going to double click that class and I'm going to remove the codes from the last lecture that

43
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.020
we no longer require.

44
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.640
So the first thing I'm going to do is update the address.

45
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.350
So I'm going to go back to the browser and copy the popups address.

46
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400
And go back to eclipse and replace the existing one.

47
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.390
Like so.

48
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.380
So the first thing we need to do is to click on the trigger alerts bottom.

49
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.510
So I'm going to copy a CSF selector and choose a second one.

50
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.010
And I'm gonna go back to Eclipse and my driver.

51
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.420
Dot find elements by this selector and in the brackets.

52
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.510
I'm going to put double quotes and pipes that value.

53
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.270
And then dot click.

54
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.560
So that will locate the button and it click it.

55
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.260
So once we've done that, it would open up the alert and now we need to switch to this alert and then

56
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.610
click on the okay button.

57
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.100
Now to do that, I'm going to write driver dots.

58
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.720
Switch to.

59
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.730
Dots, alert and then dots.

60
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.650
And there's an option to accept.

61
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.310
So that's all the code we need.

62
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.790
But because I'm going to demonstrate this test to you and it happened so quickly, I'm going to slow

63
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.240
this test down just for demonstration purposes, and I'm going to do this right in the line.

64
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.170
Fred, the sleep.

65
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.400
And all this starts is it slows down the test, says commit, delay it by 3 seconds before it moves

66
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.450
on to the forward line.

67
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.440
And whenever you use for sleep, you need to add a further declaration.

68
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.780
Right.

69
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.570
So now I'm going to save this class and then I'm going to try running it to see what happens.

70
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.390
So it's open the inner switched focus and then click the okay button.

71
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.690
So the code is fairly simple.

72
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:38.890
But if we come across an alert had to cancel button or we'd need to do is change accept to dot dismiss

73
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.220
and that would select the cancel button on not.

74
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.050
So I hope you found this lecture useful.

75
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.690
And I look forward to speaking to you in the next lecture.
