1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,430
In this video we look at why frames.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,670
So what is that?

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,270
My frame.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,580
iFrame is short for inline frame.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:18,020
It's a component of a terminal element that allows you to embed documents, videos and interactive media

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,880
within an existing web page.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,230
Think about the many websites that embed YouTube videos.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:32,060
They most likely do this by using embedded codes that use an iframe to reference YouTube video web page.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,430
This will give the impression that YouTube video is part of the web page that you own when in reality

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,790
is simply a portal to the original YouTube content.

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,840
So let's look at the code below.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,000
So on the left hand side, the user is presented with a video.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,320
But if we look at the code itself, we can see that the embedded code is actually surrounded in iframe

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,830
tags.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:06,850
And if we look within those iframe tags, we can see there is a source and that source points to the

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,060
actual video that may exist on a different website.

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,640
So let's look at a web page that has in my frame.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,220
So I'm going to open up Chrome and I'm going to go to the automation test and website.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,320
And if I click on the iFrames link, it will show you two examples where videos or in other websites

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,240
has been embedded inside a web page.

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,550
So in this top wireframe.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:45,190
You can see that actually it's in my frame pointing to automation test in itself and I can use the websites

23
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,990
as if I was actually on the main page.

24
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,840
And if you look at the second wireframe, it's actually points to a YouTube video.

25
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,150
So what I'm going to do here is right click the page and view page source.

26
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,680
And if I look through this HTML.

27
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,230
You'll be able to see iframe tags.

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,150
So here's the first one.

29
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,100
And here is a second one.

30
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,920
The second one is that a YouTube video?

31
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:23,020
So you can see that the YouTube video has an iframe with a source and it points to youtube.com.

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,220
So if I go back to the automation testing website, you can see I can also right click the video and

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,940
copy video.

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,630
You are well.

35
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,290
And if I open up a new tab and paste that URL and in search.

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,590
You'll see that it's take me to the actual video where the video is hosted on YouTube.com.

37
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,500
So what's important about my frames?

38
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,240
So the important thing about time frames is that you can't interact with wireframes directly through

39
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,960
the web page.

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,190
So if I was writing a test on this iFrames Web page, and then during the test I wanted to click on,

41
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,530
say, one of these buttons within an iframe.

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,760
We can't do that directly using streaming web driver.

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,520
We have to use a method to switch to the iframe to be able to interact with it.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,800
And then once we've finished, we need to switch back out to the main content.

45
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:37,140
So the important thing to remember is that we need to switch selenium web drivers, focus to the content

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,470
within the iframe itself and then switch back.

47
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,700
Once we've finished.

48
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,320
So I'm going to give you a demonstration of this in the next lecture.

49
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:54,940
But for now, I just want you to understand what wireframes are and how we need to handle them in terms

50
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,590
of switching focus to them.

51
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,730
Thank you for watching.
