1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,450
So let's conclude Section one by going over core support so you can get help if you need it.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,550
So I encourage people to have discussions with other students as this is a great way to share ideas

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,690
and approaches.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,510
There are a number of ways to code, so someone might have an entirely different approach to another

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,230
person.

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,450
If you think you can help another student, then feel free to offer advice or a solution to their problem.

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,760
This enforces repetition, and repetition is great to reinforce your learning.

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,560
This is also a form of revision, as you'll be rethinking of how you did something.

9
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,040
It's likely that your question has already been asked and answered before.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,340
Udemy provides a Q&A section for each course and lecture.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
This has been improved and now accepts words and phrase searches.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,150
You can also go to in a particular lecture or search questions from the whole course.

13
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,160
So this is a demonstration of the Udemy Q&A section.

14
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:23,150
So each lecture has a Q&A link under the video, and if you click it, you'll be presented with a page

15
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,500
similar to what's shown.

16
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,910
You then need to decide whether to search using the full course or in the current lecture by selecting

17
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,500
one of the two options.

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,680
You are then able to enter key words or phrases to perform a search.

19
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,890
And if you click enter, it will never return.

20
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,920
Results match in those keyword or phrases.

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,530
So I am searching for how to identify it.

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,880
And it's found 298 related questions which either contain those key words or phrases.

23
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,090
If you then select the question, you'll be taken to the question page and it's here.

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,110
You'd often find discussion and a solution to your question.

25
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,590
It's very common to come across code errors when learning a new technology.

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,200
They don't be put off as it happens to all of us on a regular occasions.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Look at the code.

28
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,750
Ever log and identify the key words from the error message.

29
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,730
So in this example, no such elements exception, web driver and Java are the key words.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,700
We can in search for these keywords using a search engine like Google or Bing.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,520
And you'll find that it's more than likely someone has asked for help on this area before and a solution

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,840
is already provided.

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,120
This often saves time.

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,660
Each coding lecture from this course will have code attachments for which you can download.

35
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,130
Use these code examples to compare to your own.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,270
I recommend you try coding along in each lecture.

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,350
If you come across an issue, then download and compare your code to the course sample code.

38
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,110
Try to understand why the issue occurred.

39
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,850
If you still can't find an answer, then leave a new question on the lecture you'll have in trouble

40
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,240
on.

41
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:39,280
Make sure to highlight key words in a title so that others can find the question in the future.

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I will answer questions as soon as I can.

43
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,520
And remember, debugging and practice helps you learn.

44
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,510
I picked up a lot of my knowledge by learning to debug errors and to learn from my mistakes.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Finally, ratings and reviews really help give this course exposure.

46
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,050
If you like this course, then I would really appreciate a positive review.

47
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:16,320
This will enable me to spend more time dedicated towards improving this course and to work on new content

48
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,370
in the future.

49
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,940
Finally, thank you for enrolling and I hope this course meets your expectations.
