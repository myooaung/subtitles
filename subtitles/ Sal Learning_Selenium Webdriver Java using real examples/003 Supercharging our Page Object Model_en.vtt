00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.960
In this lecture, I'm going to explain the changes we're going to make to really supercharge our page

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.550
object model framework.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.100
So this lecture will provide an overview of all the changes we need to make to our framework to implement

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.940
Fred Local.

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.360
We would also use this opportunity to improve our overall framework design.

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.460
By the end of this section, you would have a fully functional framework that allows you to run tests

7
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.140
using parallel execution.

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.310
This brings us up to commercial standards, i.e. standards you will find in the real working world.

9
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.670
So the first change will be to the base page class will be amending the existing code.

10
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.210
We will be removing the driver initialization code out of the base page class and moving it into a new

11
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.640
class that is solely responsible for managing and initializing the driver object.

12
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.790
And this is for better maintainability, and the new class will be named web driver instance.

13
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.820
We'll amend the base page constructor to use the new Web driver instance class.

14
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.630
And in this diagram I've highlighted the public static web driver driver line, which I intend to move

15
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.450
and change into the Web driver instance class, which is highlighted in the left.

16
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.620
But also be moving the drive initialization code where we using prop don't get properties.

17
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.510
So this too will be handled in the new web driver instance class.

18
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.490
The base Paige get driver method will use the new web driver instance class to initialize the driver.

19
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.240
So we're going to still keep the jet driver method in the base page, but will be changing this to now

20
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.780
use the web driver instance class to code.

21
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.020
You get driver method where there would also be a get driver method that belongs to the web driver instance

22
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.620
class.

23
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.810
Some other very minor adjustments will also be made to the base page class, for which I'll explain

24
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.030
in detail during the demonstrations.

25
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.590
So we'd also be creating the new web driver instance class and new code will be added so that the driver

26
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.540
uses Fred local and I have provided screenshots of how this will look.

27
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.870
Will be used in the Fred Lowe who set and get methods to set each Fred's driver variables.

28
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.400
So very briefly, I'm using an if statement.

29
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.180
Let's check in the drive up variable to see if it's null.

30
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.830
And if it is, then I want to set the driver variable and I'll be using a method called Create Driver,

31
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.950
which will belong to the web driver instance class.

32
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.650
So we would also be adding a new method called cleanup driver and it will be responsible to close the

33
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.320
FRED local session when the test completes.

34
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.270
Next will be creating a new class could hook slot java.

35
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.470
So the new Hook's class will be created to take care of our before test and after test annotation code.

36
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.030
So currently we declare this code in each and every test class.

37
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.700
It makes more sense to define this once in the framework use in a separate class as shown.

38
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.100
So on the left hand side I have created hooks dot java.

39
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.490
And this class contains the before test and after test code.

40
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.530
So this will mean that we can simply use this this class within our tests rather than having it defined

41
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.210
in each and every test class.

42
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.000
Next would need to amend our page object classes, so we need to make several changes to our page objects.

43
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.010
Each page object class will now extend the base page class.

44
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.200
When they need to use the base page constructor using a super keyword and pass a web drive up parameter.

45
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.890
We need to make small adjustments to each method to use the get driver class from the base page class.

46
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.260
Next, we need to make changes to our test classes.

47
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.820
So we're going to move to before test and after test annotation codes as this is now handled in Hook's

48
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.450
class.

49
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.230
Both our tests classes now need to extend the Hooks class to be able to access the before test and after

50
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.880
test annotation code.

51
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.140
We no longer need to pass the driver object when creating a new page object.

52
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.140
So we're going to be changing.

53
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:13.950
And I'm showing you the shop home page line as an example, where before we had to set or pass the drive

54
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.780
a variable as a parameter.

55
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.680
So we'll be changing our test classes as we no longer need to pass that driver parameter when creating

56
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.690
that new object.

57
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.090
So the key thing I want you to take away from this lecture is don't worry about the changes.

58
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.430
They seem like a lot, but they're actually very simple.

59
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.890
I will show you how to make each change in easy to follow steps.

60
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:51.600
Once we make these adjustments, your tests will run using parallel execution using Fred Local, which

61
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.440
is an advanced subject that not many people know about.
