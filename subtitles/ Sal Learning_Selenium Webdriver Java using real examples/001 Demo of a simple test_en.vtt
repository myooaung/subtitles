00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.040
In this lecture, we take our first look of a simple test in action.

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.000
So I have written a predefined test in Eclipse using Java.

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.630
I'm going to run the test using the Chrome browser.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.470
It has purposely been slowed down for demonstration purposes.

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.920
It will test some elements on the automation testing website before moving on to the test store where

6
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.800
we impersonates user purchasing a product.

7
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.350
The objective is not to explain or understand the code, but to see a test in action.

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.950
So let's run the test.

9
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.540
So on my screen is a demo test Java class, and this contains all the code that I need in order to demonstrate

10
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.710
a test in action.

11
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.760
So some of this code we wouldn't use in the real world.

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.540
For example, there is lots of references to free dot sleep.

13
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.350
And that code is there just to slow down the test itself.

14
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
If I scroll down, you'll see what this class contains.

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.910
So there is quite a bit of code here.

16
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.000
In order to run this class, I'm going to right click it, select run as and Select Java application.

17
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.600
On doing so, you'll see the Chrome browser will open and it goes to the automation testing website

18
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.730
and starts clicking on some elements.

19
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.370
So it's now clicking on the accordion test page.

20
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.400
Expand in and collapse in the accordion.

21
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.860
And then goes down and clicks on the test or link, which takes me to the test store.

22
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.110
And here I'm looking at different products.

23
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.580
I'm selecting one.

24
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.980
I'm changing the dimension and quantity, and then I'm adding the item to the carts.

25
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.220
And then select proceed to checkout and I attempt to enter promo code.

26
00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.750
But unfortunately this promo promo code has expired and then proceed to check out and start entering

27
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.920
the customer details.

28
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.610
Then enter a first name.

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.210
Last name.

30
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.310
Provide an email address.

31
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.789
And if I scroll down.

32
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.300
And then click continue.

33
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.580
Where asked for address information.

34
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.750
And so I start populating the address of this particular customer.

35
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.700
I think continue again to the shipping method where there's only one option and I'll add a comment.

36
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.060
And then I select a payment method by paying by cheque.

37
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.550
I agree to the terms and conditions and then I select order with an obligation to pay.

38
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.770
The order is then confirmed.

39
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.960
If we then look at the console, you'll see a message saying end of test.

40
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.460
So we was able to interact with the browser and a web page and its elements using this Java code.

41
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.060
And this Java code uses Selenium web driver and the browser drivers to interact with the browser.

42
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.730
So I hope you found this demonstration useful.

43
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.510
Now let's begin building up our selenium web driver knowledge.
