00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.900
In this lecture, we're going to start amended upon file to download and install the dependencies that

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.330
we need in order to build our framework.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.640
If I open up the file, you'll see that there is a default dependency.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.350
What he listed.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.970
And there's also a number of plugins.

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.510
So I need to download and install the Selenium Java dependency test thingy and Apache Commons, which

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.330
we use for screenshots into my pong file.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.730
So I'm going to open up Chrome and I'm going to search for maven repository and the website returns

9
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.010
should be MVA and repository dot com.

10
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.920
And this is where I can search dependencies.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.970
So the first one I'm going to look for is Selenium Java.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.540
And the one that I need is selenium java from org selenium HQ Selenium.

13
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
So if I select it, you'll see all the available versions.

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.209
So this course has been designed to use Selenium Java version free.

15
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.470
So although there is version four listed here, you'll see that it's currently in a beta state, which

16
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.410
means it hasn't been officially fully released.

17
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.220
So in the future, when Selenium Java version four is available, I plan to add a new section to this

18
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
course to go over the key differences.

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.810
So I am going to select the latest version free, which is free point one for 1.59.

20
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.640
And then going to look at the MAVEN tab and I'm going to copy its dependency.

21
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.760
I'm going to go to my clips and in my home file and we've inside these dependencies tags.

22
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.680
I am going to paste that dependency that I've just copied.

23
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.980
And if I hit control shift and f on my keyboard, it will reformat my code as well.

24
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.790
So the next dependency that I'm going to get is test then.

25
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.580
G So I'm going to go back to my VM repository and I'm going to search for test, then G.

26
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.570
So I need one from all that test n g, which is this top one.

27
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.860
And the latest version available is 7.40.

28
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.200
So I'm going to select it, copy the MAVEN dependency and then go back to my POM file and paste it.

29
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.470
And again, control shift f three for my code.

30
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.870
So define what dependency I need is the Apache comments.

31
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.970
So again, back to the NBA Repository website and I'm going to search for Apache Commons.

32
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.900
And one not only is this one, which is Apache Commons I.

33
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.170
And if I select it.

34
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.350
I'm going to simply take the latest version, which is 2.8.0.

35
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.440
I'm just going to place that underneath flights.

36
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.770
So.

37
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.090
So those are the three dependencies that we need.

38
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.900
And the other thing that we do need is a sure fire plug in.

39
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.010
But you'll see as part of a may maven project creation that a sure fire plug in is already provided.

40
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.600
So the difference I'm going to do with this is I'm going to pointed to a test g file.

41
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.740
So I hadn't created that test g file as of yet in my life project one.

42
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.290
But it's something that I will do soon.

43
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.560
So while I'm here, I am going to configure the short fire plugin to point to a test energy file, which

44
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.120
I will create in the future.

45
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.390
So under the version tags, I am going to add a configuration tag.

46
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.340
And then inside those configuration tags, I am going to add a suite.

47
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.950
X.

48
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.060
M l.

49
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.860
Files like so.

50
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.880
And in science, those those sweet, small files.

51
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.470
I'm going to add new tags, sweet smell file and weave inside those tags.

52
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.180
I'm going to add taste.

53
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.450
Energy.

54
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.630
Don't smell like so.

55
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.870
So that is the sure fire plug in prepared for when I do create the test in g file.

56
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.840
So that is my at home file now complete.

57
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.740
So I am going to select file and save.

58
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.040
And in the bottom right hand corner you can see those dependencies are being downloaded in my project.

59
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.120
So that is the POM file now configured.

60
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.390
And in the next lecture will begin create in the properties file to store global variables.

61
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.560
Thanks for watching.
