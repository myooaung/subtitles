00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.040
So now that we have a basic understanding of locaters, I feel it's the right time to give you your

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.060
first assignment.

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.970
So I want you to go to the automation test in the code at UK website and on the home page.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.280
I want you to view the page source.

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.490
I then want you to review the h timo of the page and look at the loaded link which is highlighted on

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.510
the left hand side.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.850
Using a pen and paper, white tests, import LINQ text locator to find this element and the tip is to

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.330
use this template driver, find element, buyer and you need to complete the rest.

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.530
So pause this video at this point and then come back once you have it written down.

10
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.020
Now that you have it written down, let's take a look at the solution.

11
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.360
So you should have something like driver dot find element by link text and in double quotes.

12
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.880
Loader should be in uppercase.

13
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.400
This is because link text requires you to provide a value that matches the text on the web page itself.

14
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.650
So on the web page, loader is in uppercase, but in the HTML documents, you'll see that it isn't.

15
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.860
And it's for this reason, it needs to be in uppercase.

16
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.740
So if you got this right, well done.

17
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.630
If you didn't quite get it.

18
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.620
Not to worry.

19
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.770
We'll get plenty of practice as we progress for this course.

20
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.900
Thank you for taking part.
