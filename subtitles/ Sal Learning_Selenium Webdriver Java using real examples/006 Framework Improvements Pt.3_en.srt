1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,580
In this lecture, I'm going to create a new class called Hooks.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:12,800
And the Hooks class is going to be responsible to store the before test and after test annotation code.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,520
So if I look at my project and because we've made changes to the base page in the last lecture, you

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
can see that my add remove test and autocomplete test has errors.

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:32,119
So we're not going to worry about the errors for now as in a later lecture will start correct in these.

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,430
But if I was to open up one of these classes you'll see that is here.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,330
I had the before test and after test annotations.

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,600
And if I open up your the complete one, you'll see that that code is also defined here.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
So I'm going to handle that code in a new class.

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,710
So under the base package, I'm going to right click select new and select class.

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,780
And I'm going to call this class hooks and then click Finish.

12
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:15,110
So the first thing I'm going to do to this hoax class is extend the base page using the extended keyword

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,710
followed by base page like so.

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,730
And if I hover over the error on the hooks, it says I need to add the constructor, which will use

15
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,930
a super keyword.

16
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:39,080
After the constructor, I'm now going to use the at before test the notation code.

17
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,890
And right following method public.

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,360
Void set up.

19
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,870
And inside this method, I'm going to use the method.

20
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,730
Get driver.

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
If brackets.

22
00:01:59,430 --> 00:01:59,800
Dot.

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Get.

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,560
Get you out.

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,669
So I'll need to import that before test annotation from test then g.

26
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,930
And you can see this two errors here, because I need to add the Pharaoh's declaration.

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,840
Once I do that, those arrows go away.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,830
So what this method here will do sat before each test.

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,300
This set up method will be called and it's using the get driver method from the base page.

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,550
Which is this method here.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,480
And this method is using the web drive instance.

32
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,420
Class calling this method.

33
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,580
Which thing calls this method?

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,840
So it can be quite confusing, but hopefully if you keep reviewing this code it will start making sense.

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,890
But what we're doing here essentially is creating a well maintainable framework.

36
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:10,200
So all we need to know is that for each test, this set driver driver method will be called and it's

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,040
going to get the get you are well using the get your old method.

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,100
Which is his method here.

39
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,870
So all it means is that before each test.

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:31,100
It's going to get the URL that we have defined in the config the properties file, which is the home

41
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,520
page of automation test in the code UK.

42
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,540
The next methods I'm going to use.

43
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,400
So I'm going to use it at after test sanitation.

44
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,570
I'm going to write to public void.

45
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,460
Tear down.

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,700
So this method is going to be called after each test.

47
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,840
So I'm going to import the after test annotation from test in G.

48
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:13,320
And inside this method, I'm going to use the Web driver instance class and I'm going to call the method

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
clean up driver.

50
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,720
And that is the method that simply cleans up the session.

51
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,180
So that's all we need to do in this hoax class.

52
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,010
So I'm now going to say that.

53
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,410
And I appreciate that this can be quite confusing as we are use in various classes here.

54
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,980
But follow along and hopefully this will begin making sense.

55
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,640
But for now, let's move on to the next class.
