1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,969
In this lecture, we take a look at a test.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,770
Energy depends on method.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,670
So what is it that depends on?

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,960
Method is a test energy attribute that we can use to trigger method only after another method has passed.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,810
We set the method to depend on another.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,840
This method would only execute once the former has executed successfully.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,010
This can be useful for when we might have a scenario where we might need to wait for something to happen

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,260
before proceeding to the next step.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,090
So here is a visual example.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,080
So at step one, I go to a website sign in page.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,220
I then enter a username, an email address, and then enter a password.

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,620
But I only want to enter a password once the username or email address has been entered, so the first

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,400
step won't execute until the second step has passed.

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,260
So let's see an example of this.

15
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,930
So in this lecture I am once again going to use the login page from the store website.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,970
So my plan is to create three simple test cases.

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,910
The first one will simply enter email address value.

18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,300
The second test case will enter a password value and the third test case will click the sign in button.

19
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,600
I'll then use the depends on methods within my code and I'll demonstrate the output and the effects

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,230
of using it.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,160
So I am going to go to Eclipse.

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,510
I am going to right click section 11, select new and in select class and I'm going to call this new

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:53,430
class l 13 underscore depends on methods and then click finish.

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,280
So this new class would then open and rather than manually write setup code.

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:07,840
I'm just going to open up data provider and copy the before sweet code and also the web driver driver

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,139
line.

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,080
So I'm going to click Control, see on my keyboard and I'm going to paste it like so.

28
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,350
So that next thing not I'm going to do is I'm going to use driver don't get to go to the URL.

29
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,370
So I'm going to open up the web page and copy the URL.

30
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,910
Go back to eclipse and right driver dot get in double quotes.

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,620
I'm going to take you out to the Web page.

32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,240
So the slight thing I've done differently to other lectures is that I've placed the driver that gets

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,380
in the default suite.

34
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,980
So this means that the browser will go to this web page before it starts executing the text annotations.

35
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,690
So now underneath this, I'm going to create three simple methods.

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,830
The first one is going to be called public void.

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,240
Enter.

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,160
Email.

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,670
Open and close embrace and I'm going to use driver thought to find elements via CSA selector.

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,230
And I'm going to open up the Web page.

41
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,100
Right click and inspect the email address text field.

42
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,150
Open up red rocks velocity and simply take this first selector.

43
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,490
And I'm going to pay in the double quotes and as it's a textbox filled, I'm going to use send keys

44
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,390
to provide a value.

45
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,300
And I'm going to pass test at test dot com like so.

46
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,370
And for demonstration purposes I'm again going to use Fred built sleep.

47
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,990
And as a sleep free seconds, just so you can see what's happening when I demonstrate the running of

48
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,560
this code.

49
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,570
So I'm going to copy that method.

50
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,230
And I'm going to paste that below and I'm going to call it Enter Password.

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,890
And I need to get a selector for the password textbox.

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,130
And I'm going to pace that here.

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,730
And I need to update the value that I'm sending to the password value, which is test.

54
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,600
One, two, three.

55
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,580
And then finally, I'm going to copy this one more time.

56
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,670
And this is going to be click.

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,230
Button.

58
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,170
And then I'm going to go back to the website.

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,810
Focus on the sign in button.

60
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,400
Got to take this first.

61
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,700
Yes.

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,390
A selector.

63
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,910
And I'm going to update the value.

64
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,490
And instead of saying keys as a button, I need to use dot click like so.

65
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,880
So there's one thing I need to do here before I try running this and try to think what that is.

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,140
So what I need to do is use that test notation.

67
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,380
And I need to import that from Test and J.

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,710
And I need to set one of those at the beginning of each of the methods.

69
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,940
So I'm now going to save this class.

70
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,820
And then I'm going to right click run as test in G test and let's see what happens.

71
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,650
So he's gone to the sign in page.

72
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,210
A in an email address.

73
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,700
It's entered a password.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,790
But it hasn't selected the sign in button.

75
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,040
Have a thing quite at his.

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,410
If I go back to clips, it says that free tests have run them free of past and if I scroll up you'll

77
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,420
see is pass click button pass enter email and pass enter password.

78
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,570
So it has run all free test cases.

79
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,710
But the issue is to do with the ordering of execution.

80
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,320
So the click button test executed before the email address and password.

81
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,780
And because the button was clicked before there was an email address or password, it didn't log me

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,050
in.

83
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:35,390
So what I'm going to use on this click button is the depends on methods, and I can use this button

84
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,320
right in a bracket.

85
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,060
And Martin depends.

86
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,480
On methods we've been at the end.

87
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,730
Equals.

88
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,740
Open and close embraces.

89
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,270
And then use in double quotes.

90
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm going to copy the enter password method name and paste it like so.

91
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,380
So now this method should only run once this method has finished executing.

92
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,030
So let me say this.

93
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,520
And try running it again.

94
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,920
So again, it's gone to the log in page.

95
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,590
Enter an email address.

96
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,420
Sensitive password.

97
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,940
And this time you selected the sign in button.

98
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,380
So that is how we can use that depends on method.

99
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:49,690
Attributes allows us to run a test only after the successful execution of another test case that we

100
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,260
provide.

101
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,190
I hope he found this lecture useful.

102
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,230
And once again, thank you for watching.
