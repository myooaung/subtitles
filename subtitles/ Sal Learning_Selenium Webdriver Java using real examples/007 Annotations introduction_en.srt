00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,740
In this lecture, I briefly go over some of the available test annotations that we have available to

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,070
us.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:16,110
So first off, I'd like to say, do not worry if some of these are difficult to understand because in

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,410
the next few lectures I demonstrates use in some of these.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,560
So in automation test, then we have the X Test annotation and this is often written in front of the

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,230
method to imply the code is a test.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,570
So we've seen a couple of examples of this already in our previous lectures.

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,730
We also have the act before method which allows the method to execute before the execution of each at

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,600
test method.

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,640
The after method is executed after the execution of each act test method.

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,380
The method annotated with acts before class who executes only once before the first test method in that

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,760
class is invoked.

13
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:12,110
The at off the cross annotation will be executed only once after all the test methods of that class

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:12,980
have been invoked.

15
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,130
The app before test method runs after the apps before sweet annotation.

16
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,760
The app before test could be used to create initial data prior to run in other test methods, whereas

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,530
after test annotation will run after the other tests are complete.

18
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,110
We also have the apps before sweet annotation, which is often used to set up and start the Selenium

19
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,860
web drivers.

20
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,390
The after suite annotation is often used to stop the Selenium web drivers.

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,100
So what I'm explaining to you here is that we have different tests and g annotations available to us

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,550
and these allow us to control what code to run based on the order that we set.

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,060
So how can we use these annotations?

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,090
So here I'm demonstrating how we can use the before sweet and after sweet annotations.

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,930
So I might use the before sweet annotation to set a code block to set the driver and open the browser.

26
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,670
Then once before Sweet has completed.

27
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,450
The code will name run any methods that have been set within ACT test annotation.

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,570
Then.

29
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:43,280
The code will look and execute a method that has been set with an after suite annotation.

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,900
An example of this might be to close down the session and exit the browser.

31
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:57,250
So what I'm doing here is using test and annotations to set order execution in my code.

32
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,760
So the before suite would run first in this example, followed by any code that has been declared with

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,450
a test notation, then followed by anything that has been declared as an after suite notation.

34
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,200
So it gives us control.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,420
Testing annotations provides us with an additional layer of control.

36
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,980
We can trigger code to run at a specific time.

37
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,900
This is useful if we need to do things before or after an event.

38
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,050
For example, we most likely will always want to close the browser after our tests have completed,

39
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,950
and so we have an invitation available that will trigger the code at a specific stage in the process.

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:54,110
So I hope this has been a good introduction to some of the annotations available in test testing and

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,440
would explore some of these in the forthcoming lectures.

42
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,820
Thank you for watching.
