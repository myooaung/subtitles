1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,340
So let's create a life project one.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,680
So in Eclipse, you'll see that I have the free projects I've created previously.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,830
I'm going to be creating a new project called Live Project one, and I'm going to create it through

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,850
Command Prompt.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,940
So I'm going to minimize the clips for now and I'm going to open up File Explorer and then from my desktop,

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm going to go to my resources folder.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,390
And this is where the workspace folder resides.

8
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,680
And if open that, these are the projects I've created so far.

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,800
So I'm going to copy the path to the workspace folder.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,150
I'm then going to open up command prompt and I am going to see day and pace that path to change directory

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,660
to it.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:01,540
I'm then going to open up Chrome and if I type in Maven CMT, the first result should be to Apache the

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,959
org to the Maven in 5 minutes web page.

14
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,980
So this is where if I scroll down I'll find the create in a project section and there is a command here

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,260
which I'm just going to copy.

16
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,910
I'm then going to open up Notepad and I'm going to Pacer here.

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,990
So I need to make some adjustments to this command.

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,750
So from my group, Heidi, I am going to use UK AE the automation testing.

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,960
So this can be whatever you'd like it to be.

20
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,310
So you don't need to use the same value to use it and then need to update the artifact I.D..

21
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,630
So I'm going to call this project live.

22
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,450
Project one.

23
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:58,030
I'm then going to copy this full command and go back to command, prompt and paste it and then I'm going

24
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,170
to select Enter.

25
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,070
Maven should then create its project for us.

26
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,810
And I have build success, which means it's been built successfully.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,470
So I am going to go back to File Explorer and in my workspace folder you'll see that there is now live

28
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,250
Project one.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,630
So I'm going to double click it and you'll see a source and pom file.

30
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,580
So I am now going to copy this new path.

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,040
And in CMT I'm going to use a C D command to change directory into that new life project one.

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,150
So remember, I need to create the two new files so I can import this project into Eclipse.

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,280
So to do this, I'm going to go back to Command Prompt and I'm going to type in m the N.

34
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,680
Eclipse, colon, eclipse, and then presenter.

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,810
And you should see another build success.

36
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,390
And in File Explorer, you should see a class path and a project file.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,530
So these are the two that we need to import our project into Eclipse.

38
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,670
So now I'm going to go back to the clips I'm going to file and I'm going to select the import option.

39
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,000
Then you should see a Maven folder, which if you expand.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,890
And you can select existing MAVEN projects.

41
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,930
So if I select next.

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,930
I'm then going to browse.

43
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,450
And I'm already in my workspace folder.

44
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,920
So I'm going to select Live Project one and then click Select Select Folder.

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,110
And you see that so identified the pond, for example.

46
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,850
And if I could finish.

47
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,050
We should see that project is now imported into Eclipse.

48
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,970
So that's how we've just created our project and we've been able to import it into Eclipse.

49
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,390
And in the next lecture we'll start editing the POM file using the dependencies that we need.

50
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,830
Thanks for watching.
