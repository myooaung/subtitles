00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,180
In this lecture, we explore some of the most common web driver methods.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,230
So when we initiate the driver object, the blue methods are then available to use.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,640
And I'm going to go through two key ones in the next few slides.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,820
So first we have to get method.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
The syntax it is is get an in brackets.

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,790
We provide a u of l.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,520
So for example, drive it or get it in brackets and then double quotes.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,440
And then we provide a you are aware of a website.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,010
The purpose of this is that it will load a new web page in the current browser window.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
Next we have gets current URL.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,920
The syntax for this is get current URL with brackets.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,370
An example is driver don't get current are.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,460
And the purpose is that it will return a string represent in the current goal of the web page.

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,180
Then we have get title.

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,740
The syntax is simply get tighter with brackets.

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,020
An example is driver don't get title.

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,960
And the purpose is it will get the title of the current web page.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,130
It returns the title of the current web page we've lead in and trained in white spaces stripped out.

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,350
Or now if one is not set.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,870
Next we have find elements.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,390
And so this is a common method that we're going to be using often throughout this course.

22
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,220
So the syntax is find element and they move in brackets I'm using by.

23
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,640
So an example is driver find element by dots and I'm using CC selector.

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,740
In the next set of brackets and within double quotes, I'm then providing a value of hash primary button.

25
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,350
So this is a unique idea of an element on a Web page.

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,870
The purpose of this is to find the first web element using the given method.

27
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,370
And it returns the first mentioned element on the current page.

28
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,660
If an element cannot be found, then it will throw a no such elements exception.

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,780
Next we have find elements with an s.

30
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,010
So the syntax is fluent elements and again we use by.

31
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:38,960
An example is driver find elements by and this time use an x path and in the next brackets and double

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,600
quotes, I'm providing a different take.

33
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,890
So the purpose of this is that it will find all elements within the current page using the given mechanism.

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,390
So it's going to find all elements that use the div tag and it will turn a list of all web elements

35
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,790
or an empty list if nothing matches.

36
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,770
Next we have the closed method.

37
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,710
The syntax for this is void to close.

38
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,890
An example is driver doc close.

39
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,940
And the purpose of this is that it will close the current window.

40
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,400
Or if there are multiple windows then it will close the current window which is active and then quits

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,000
the browser.

42
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,430
And then finally we had the quit method.

43
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,520
The syntax for this is void quit.

44
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,780
An example is driver acquits and the purpose of this is that it quits.

45
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,550
The driver instance close in every associated window which is open.

46
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,400
So this has been a brief overview of the most common Web driver methods.

47
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,120
We are going to be using them frequently throughout this course.

48
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,120
And by the end of this course, you'll be very familiar of how we use them and why we use them.

49
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,500
Thanks for watching.
