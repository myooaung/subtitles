1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,710
In this lecture, we take a look at job variables.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,600
So what are the variables?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,830
Variables?

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,360
Store data, values.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,960
There are a number of different variable types in Java such as string, which is used to store text

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,310
values int which is used to store integer whole number values including negative numbers boolean.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:31,280
And this can be even true or false char which stores a single character such as an uppercase a or lowercase

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:41,310
a floats is thoughts floating point numbers, for example 10.99 or -10.99 and then its double which

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,050
is like float but has greater range of precision but requires more storage.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,910
So let's try it out.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,240
So in this lecture, I am going to show you how to declare a variable and how to assign value.

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,410
In the next lecture, we'll take a look at the data types in more detail, and I'll provide a demonstration

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,410
of how we can use the different types of data types.

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,480
So all I'm going to do in this lecture is copy and paste the class on the last one, and I'm going to

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:20,110
call it l05 and I'm going to give it a name of variables and then click.

16
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,680
Okay.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,880
So I'm going to double click that new class and remove the code from the last lecture that we don't

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,240
need.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:37,370
So all I'm going to do here is, is, is create a string variable and I'll do this a write in s t i

20
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,120
g the capsule s go get the string in name.

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,100
So I'm going to call it dog.

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,120
Great.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,340
With a semicolon.

24
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,690
So I have just created a variable who does not breed, which is of type string.

25
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,020
Now.

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,950
If I wanted to assign a value to dog breed, I need to use the equals sign.

27
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,160
And that equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

28
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,419
So if I use double quotes now.

29
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,660
And signed a value of poodle.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:24,950
This dog breed variable will now contain a value of poodle, so it references a value in memory which

31
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,480
points to a value of poodle.

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,450
So that's how we assign values to variables in Java.

33
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,010
So in the next lecture I'd expand with more examples.

34
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,240
The key concept to takeaway from this lecture is simply how we can create variables and how we can assign

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
them values.

36
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,270
Thank you for watching.
