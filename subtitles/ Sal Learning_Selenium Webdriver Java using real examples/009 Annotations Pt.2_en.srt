1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,640
In this lecture we continue with the test in G annotations, but this time I introduced the before method

2
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,860
and after method annotations.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,250
So before I start writing code, let me first walk you through the test that I'm going to write.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,380
So I'm going to use the test for Home Page and I want to click on the sign in link.

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,320
And then provider email address and password and then sign in.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:37,640
This one inside me in and take me to the signing welcome page where I want to click on the clothes link.

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,120
This will then take me to this page.

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,430
And then once I've been taken to this page, I want to sign out.

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,140
I then want to close the browser window and exit the session.

10
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:59,800
So to do this I am going to add or introduce the before and after method and rotations.

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,620
So I am going to simply copy and paste the class in the last lecture call in this new 109 annotation

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,340
part to.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,970
Then double click to open it and you'll see that this is the code from last lecture where we've used

14
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,990
before suite to handle, to set up the test notation to handle the actual test and the after suite to

15
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,460
close and quit driver.

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,310
So this time I'm going to introduce at before method.

17
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,510
And I am going to create a new method.

18
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,990
Public void.

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,890
Sign in.

20
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,350
And if I hover over before method, I'm given the option to import it.

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,480
So in the before method, this method is going to be responsible.

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:02,490
For clicking on this sign in button and then provided an email address password and then sign in is

23
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,680
also going to handle the euro.

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,930
R Well, so in my comment code I've used the test notation to take me to the web page.

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,400
So I'm going to cut that and paste it in the before method.

26
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,320
Annotation.

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:29,550
So the method called sign in and I am going to get this test or home page URL and paste it in here like

28
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,940
so.

29
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,690
So once I've done that, it will take me to this page.

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,230
So I need to find a selector for the sign in button.

31
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,120
So if I right click and inspect it.

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,130
And then go to Ragnarok Velocity.

33
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,410
I'm going to take this second sister selector.

34
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,210
So for some reason, this first one doesn't work well.

35
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,860
And I think it's because of how the Web page has been designed.

36
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,180
So if you're following along, make sure to select the second cursor selector.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,080
And I'm going to write driver dot find elements via CSA selector.

38
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:09,890
That's.

39
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,410
Pace that value.

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,790
And as I say, Link, I need to click it.

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,240
That would then take me to this page, but I need to get a selector for the email address password and

42
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,110
the sign in button.

43
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,400
So I'm going to right click on the email address textbox and inspect it.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,140
It's Ragnarok Velocity.

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,310
And I'm going to take that first one.

46
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,910
Mike So.

47
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,970
And I'm going to try driver find elements by a selector and place that value.

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:58,020
And as is the text field, I need to send values sung using keys and I'm going to use my test account

49
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,030
name, which is test at test dot com.

50
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,670
And if you're following along, please use your own test account and test password.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,250
So I am then going to go back to the web page and use a select at all to focus on the password textbox.

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,230
And I'm going to get that top one.

53
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,310
And I'm going to write driver the find element.

54
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,500
Buyer Set a selector.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,960
Pacer value and then use the send case.

56
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,670
And my password for this test account is test 1 to 3.

57
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,170
And then finally, I need to focus on the sign in button.

58
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,820
And I am just going to copy that top one.

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,270
And I'm going to write driver thought find element set a selector.

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,750
And as it's a button, I need to click it.

61
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,740
So once I've signed in.

62
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,810
So if I go back to the browser and just quickly sign in for you.

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,720
It would then take you to this page.

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,950
So I need to right click and inspect on this close link.

65
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,250
If I go back to Ragnarok Velocity.

66
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,000
So I'm going to take this link text.

67
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,950
And copy it.

68
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,040
And I'm going to do this in the test annotation.

69
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:43,020
So before method is simply take me to the well and is handling the log in a code and the test annotation

70
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,160
is where I'm actually going to click on the close link once I've been signed in.

71
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:54,890
So I'm going to let driver fund element by link text.

72
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,320
And in double quotes, I'm going to provide that value.

73
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,270
And I'm going to remove those question mark symbols.

74
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,070
I don't know why those appear, I think is just based on how the Web page has been designed.

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,060
And then I'm going to click on that link.

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,730
So that will now.

77
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,610
Take me to this page here.

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,230
And once I've reached this page, I want to click on the sign out button.

79
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,900
So if I right click and inspect.

80
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,000
And again, go to Red Rocks velocity.

81
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,790
I'm simply going to take this top one.

82
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,210
And I'm going to handle this in a after method.

83
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
So I'm going to look at after.

84
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,110
Meffert.

85
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,290
I'm going to create a new method public.

86
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,140
Void.

87
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,510
Sign out.

88
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,160
And I'm going to write driver but find elements.

89
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:03,600
But sir says selector and pacer value and I want to click on that sign up button.

90
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,660
So I need to import the after method.

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,490
And then that is complete.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,810
And then the after suite is simply closing and quitting the session.

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,420
So I'm just going to add a few more things here.

94
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,730
So at the end of the before method, I'm going to print a message to console.

95
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,180
So I'm going to use system dots out of print end.

96
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,400
And I'm going to write a message of user has logged in.

97
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,090
I'm then going to copy that.

98
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,890
And paste it after this line.

99
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,880
And I am going to write user has clicked the close link.

100
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,740
And I'm simply going to copy one more.

101
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,690
And I'm going to paste it at the end of this line.

102
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,930
And I am going to write a message off user has.

103
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,550
Locked.

104
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:07,830
Out.

105
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,950
So the one other thing I'd like to do is also add some Fred sleep's just for demonstration purposes

106
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,480
so you can see what's happening.

107
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,290
Otherwise it will execute too quickly and you won't see it.

108
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,930
So I'm going to add a Fred dot sleep here.

109
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,450
And I'm going to add froze declaration.

110
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,690
And I'm going to do the same for this after MiFID.

111
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,789
Like so.

112
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,210
So that's our code complete.

113
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,059
And there is one other thing that we could do.

114
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,630
Just in case the web page takes a little while to load.

115
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,300
And that's to use an implicit white.

116
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,700
So I'm going to add an implicit weight in this before.

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,180
Sweet.

118
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,850
And I'm going to do it after the maximized line.

119
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,370
So I'm going to write here, driver.

120
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,120
Don't manage thoughts, timeouts, thoughts, implicit weight.

121
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,500
And hey, I need to provide a value of how long to wait.

122
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,550
So it's going to be ten.

123
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,100
And it's going to be at the time.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,310
Unit dot seconds.

125
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,730
So I've used an implicit white to wait 10 seconds before it froze in error.

126
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,800
And as it's an implicit weight.

127
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,200
This will be global for the whole class.

128
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,360
So this is our class now complete.

129
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,840
So I'm going to write, file and click Save.

130
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,520
And close it and I'm going to double the test engine example.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm just going to update it with the new class name.

132
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,530
It's EL zero nine.

133
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,490
Part two.

134
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,230
An insider's.

135
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,740
So now I'm going to right click the test, inject smell.

136
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,230
And run it as a test in g suite to see what happens.

137
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,210
So it's opened and expanded the browser window.

138
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,150
Is click the sign in link and provided values.

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,360
Sign me in is click the club's link.

140
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,830
And then it's going to sign me out.

141
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,540
And then it closed the session and we can see in the console.

142
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,180
It's run one test and it's passed.

143
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,190
And if I go upwards, you'll see the messages users logged in, clicked the close link and logged out

144
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,530
has been outputted in the console.

145
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,760
So that is an example of how we can use the before sweet before method.

146
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,550
The test annotation, the off the method annotation and the after suite.

147
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,110
I hope you found this useful.

148
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,850
And thank you for watching.
