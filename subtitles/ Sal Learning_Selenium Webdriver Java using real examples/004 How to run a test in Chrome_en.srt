00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:07,330
In this lecture, I'm going to show you the code that we need in order to interact with the Chrome browser.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,410
So the first thing I'm going to do is open up Eclipse.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,630
And under the default package, I'm going to right click select new and select class.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm going to call this class chrome.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,730
Demo.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,290
And I'm going to select public static web main and then click Finish.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,500
So you'll see that the class has been created and that new class is now open.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,160
So we're now in a position to start writing some code.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,320
So the first thing I'm going to write system the capital S.

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,460
Dot set property and this is where I need to provide a key and the value.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,250
So in these first couple quotes, I'm going to write Web Driver Dot.

12
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:01,800
Chrome.

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,030
Dot driver.

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,090
And the value is going to be the path.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,410
So the chrome driver.

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,520
XY file.

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,830
So if I open up file explorer.

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:22,090
And if I go to my desktop and then look at my resources folder and then look at driver V1, you'll see

19
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,190
this is where the chrome driver resides.

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,310
So what I'm going to do here is get the path to this location.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
So I'm going to simply copy this.

22
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,750
And then I'm going to go back to Eclipse.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,270
And I'm going to paste it in those second double quotes.

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,880
Like so.

25
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,310
So this will now point to that folder location.

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:53,170
So the only thing I need to do is add two more bank slashes and then reference the chrome driver file

27
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,470
name.

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,590
So I'm going to a chrome driver to see.

29
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,140
On doing so.

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,030
This was established the full link to the location of the chrome driver file.

31
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,870
So we had the key.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,180
And in the second quotes, we have the location of the chrome driver.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,220
So you may have noticed that when I copied the path from File Explorer, there were single back slashes.

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,090
Yet when I place that path in Eclipse, no single backslash is replaced with double back slashes.

35
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:35,410
This is because a single backslash in Java represents an escape sequence, whereas a double backslash

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,220
will print out a backslash as would use in a path.

37
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,500
So let's write our next line of code.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,440
I'm going to write Web Driver.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,480
Driver.

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,260
Echo's new chrome driver with round brackets and a semicolon.

41
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,470
So you'll see there's two errors here.

42
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,480
If I hover over Web driver, you'll see I've got an option to import it from selenium.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,820
And it's the same for Chrome driver.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,240
And you'll see that the two imports appear at the top.

45
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,670
So we can now use this driver variable to call chrome driver methods.

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,820
So for example, if I make some space here, I can write.

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,580
Driver dots manage.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,330
Dot window dot.

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,100
Maximize.

50
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,350
So when the Chrome browser opens, this line will maximize the Chrome browser window.

51
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,990
I'm then going to write.

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,970
Driver Dot get.

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,800
And here I need to provide a string, which will be an address to a website.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,730
So within the double quotes, I'm going to write hij types colon.

55
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,220
Two forward slashes.

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,940
Then w w w dart's automation testing.

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,240
Echo dot uk.

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,670
I'm then going to save this class again to file and save.

59
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,350
If we then right click the class and select run as and Select Drive application.

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,270
Let's see what happens.

61
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:35,210
So you can see that the Chrome browser has opened and is going to automation test in the code UK.

62
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,330
So this proves our code works.

63
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:47,240
And it also proves that our code has been able to identify and interact with the chrome driver XY file.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,250
So to prove this, let's change the path location.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,920
So instead of driver underscore one, I'm changing it to driver underscore v2 which is a folded.

66
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,900
It doesn't exist.

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,280
If I then save and then try in this class.

68
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,900
Let's see what happens.

69
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:14,990
You can see it as an error in the console and the error states the driver executable does not exist.

70
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,520
So this proves that our earlier code was interacting with the chrome driver.

71
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,000
And it was able to do this by interacting with the chrome driver in this location.

72
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,980
So that is everything I wanted to cover in this lecture.

73
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,840
In the next lecture, we'll take a look at the Firefox browser using the gecko driver.
