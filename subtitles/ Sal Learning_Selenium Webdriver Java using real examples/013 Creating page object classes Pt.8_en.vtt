00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.870
In this lecture, we're going to create our next page objects class.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.480
So if I go back to the website.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.180
We are going to focus on the shipping method page and in order to access this page, we need to fill

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.240
in the mandatory fields with some dummy data.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.200
So I'm going to simply type in a here, here.

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.600
I'm going to select the random state.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.020
I'm to provide a zip code, which has to be five digits.

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.960
And you do not need to enter a phone number.

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.300
This checkbox, which is to use the address for invoice in two is ticked.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.270
So now I'm going to select the continue button.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.050
In doing so I'm then bought to ship in method page and you can see that is only free to select elements

12
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.860
on this page.

13
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.490
CheckBox TextBox and then continue button.

14
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.510
So as there's only one choice for shipping method, I'm not going to get a locator for this as it's

15
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.470
already pre-filled.

16
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.530
But I'm going to get a locator for the textbox and for the continue button.

17
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.380
So I'm going to go back to clips.

18
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.190
Right click the page objects package and select class.

19
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:21.670
And I'm going to give this class a name of order form shipping method.

20
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.690
And then click Finish.

21
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.770
So I'm not going to show you the code by hand as I've already written this, and you can simply download

22
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.150
it yourself from this lecture.

23
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.700
Or, as I've said previously, if you'd like to practice, try writing this code yourself.

24
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.660
So all I need to do is import the classes.

25
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.350
And then this is the class complete.

26
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.390
So I've simply got a locator here for the text area and a locator for the continue button.

27
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.060
Use the constructor and provide it to public methods.

28
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.360
Each of these return in the fields are written above.

29
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.880
So thanks for watching.

30
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.820
And now let's move on to our final page object class.
