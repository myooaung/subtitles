00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,330
Before you continue on with this lecture, it's very important you've updated your page object classes.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,600
So I've already done this in my framework.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,500
For example, if I open up my homepage class, you'll see that this too extends the base page.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,060
The construct has been updated and I've also added this line to each of the methods.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,810
So if you haven't already updated your page objects, please do so.

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,490
So now I'm going to be focusing on updates in our test classes.

7
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:42,150
So I'm going to open up the autocomplete test and our code currently looks like this.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,770
So you see that there is a number of errors that have been highlighted.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,240
And if I scroll to the top, you'll see that I still have my before test and after test notation code.

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,550
So we know that we're now handling this in the Hook's class.

11
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,030
So what I'm going to do in my test class is highlight this code and delete it.

12
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:17,620
The next change I'm going to make is I'm going to change extends base page to extend its hooks.

13
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,230
And I need to import that.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,810
Like so.

15
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,850
And that era then goes away.

16
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,800
So what it means is my autocomplete test will now extend the hooks class.

17
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,130
And this hoax class contains a before and after test annotation code.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,190
But the Hook's class also extends the base page.

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,960
So that base page contains code that we're familiar with.

20
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,590
Sonata.

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,000
I've updated that I need to focus on these driver parameters.

22
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:01,100
So as we've updated our page object classes, you'll know that we've updated our constructor, which

23
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,430
formerly had a parameter of web driver.

24
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,000
Driver.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:14,010
So now in a class, in our test class, now that we created a new home page object, it was expected

26
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,350
a driver object to be passed.

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,970
But as we updated our constructor in our page objects classes, we no longer need it so we can simply

28
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,140
delete driver.

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,580
In doing so, you'll see that another number of errors will be highlighted here.

30
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,380
But do not worry.

31
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,280
This is simply because we need to add a pharaoh's declaration.

32
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,710
And I'm going to add an Ohio exception and all those errors now go away.

33
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,560
So this is all the changes we required to our order.

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,730
Complete test.

35
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,090
So I'm going to simply say that.

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,790
And in the next lecture would then focus on the add remove item basket test.

37
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,440
Thank you for watching.
