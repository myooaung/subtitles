00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.520
In this lecture, we take a look at how to install test energy into Eclipse.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.920
It is very easy to install testing into our project in Eclipse.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.540
We simply need to go to the test energy download site.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.930
Review the install via plug in option.

5
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.560
Go to eclipse clips and use the install new software feature.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.350
Select the version of testing we want to use and then we simply complete installation.

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.230
So let me show you how to do this.

8
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.590
So I am going to open up Chrome.

9
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.850
In a search engine.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.120
I'm going to type test NJ eclipse download like so.

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.460
And the first result should be to test energy the org doc download and if I click this link.

12
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.680
I am then presented with the following page and I'm interested in the Eclipse plugin.

13
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.720
So in this section you'll see there's an install from update site option and it gives you some instructions

14
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.260
on what to do in Eclipse and it also provides you with a URL.

15
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.090
If I click that URL, you should be presented with the following page, which is the different versions

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.020
that are available.

17
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.280
So I am going to copy this address using control C on my keyboard and I'm going to go to Eclipse.

18
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.740
And in eclipse I am going to select help install new software.

19
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.880
And then I'm going to click the add button and here I'm going to type test in G and I'm going to paste

20
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.020
that you are in the location and then I'm going to click Add.

21
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.890
You'll see that.

22
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.880
Then I've got an option for testing.

23
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.570
So what I'm going to do here is take this and then click next.

24
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.180
And then that should start the installation of testing for me.

25
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.060
So I am going to pause this video now until that completes.

26
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.430
So this has now completed.

27
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.009
And you can see I've got an option to click next.

28
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.650
Well, I need to accept the license agreement.

29
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.340
And then I can click Finish.

30
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.110
And you can see in the bottom right hand corner is saying installing software.

31
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.150
And if you're presented with this following warning, just click install anyway.

32
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.730
It wouldn't ask you to restart.

33
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.770
Eclipse suddenly restart now.

34
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.950
So now we have test engines stored in eclipse.

35
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.570
So what I'm going to do is I am going to create a new package and prove to you test engines installed.

36
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.970
So remember in section ten of this course, I provided the framework overview.

37
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.050
So we're now in Section 11, which is the test engine section.

38
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.760
I'm going to right click the source folder, click new and then click package and I'm going to call

39
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.710
this section.

40
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.410
11.

41
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.090
Like so.

42
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.350
And then click finish.

43
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.570
So we are in the second lecture of the test then.

44
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.640
So the test thingy introduction was lecture one and this is the installation of testing.

45
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.200
So this is lecture two.

46
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.560
So I am going to right click that new package, select new and class, and I'm going to give it a name

47
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.820
of l02 for lecture two and I'm going to call it test and G install.

48
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.400
And then I'm just going to click finish so I'm not going to take public static with my.

49
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.490
This class wouldn't open.

50
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.390
And so what I'm going to do here is use test n g.

51
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.710
So I am going to run a simple method which is public void.

52
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.790
Hello World.

53
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:25.380
Open and close embraces and I'm simply going to use system dots out the print and when and in brackets

54
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.670
I'm going to write.

55
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.240
Hello.

56
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.250
Well.

57
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.730
It was semi-colon at the end.

58
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:41.130
So I'm now going to use Test N G and I'm going to use the at test annotation and I've place this just

59
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.110
before the method name and you can see that there's an error on the test.

60
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.970
And if I hover over it, you'll see that I'm given an option to import but only for all g unit.

61
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.860
But if we look closer down, we can see we've got an option to add test in G library.

62
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.290
So I am going to click that.

63
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.780
And you see testing now appears here.

64
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:15.330
Now, if I hover over test again, you'll see that I'm given an option to import from all test in g

65
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.320
annotations.

66
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.470
So if I select that.

67
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.000
That error now goes away.

68
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.620
So it's very important that you select the import for testing.

69
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.280
So now I am going to save this class.

70
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.340
And if I try running it, let's see what options I have.

71
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.140
So if I go to run, as you'll see, I've got the test energy test option.

72
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.840
So this is different from the usual job application that we usually see.

73
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.960
And if I run this.

74
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.410
You'll see an additional tab.

75
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.230
And it's provided an output saying that the total test run is one.

76
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.660
And the number of passes is one and the zero failures and zero skips.

77
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:11.520
And if I go up you'll see the hello world has been printed to console and it's saying that the test

78
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.900
of Hello World, which is the name of this method, has passed.

79
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.570
So if I try copying copy in this code.

80
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.010
And paste it again below.

81
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.670
And then changed method name to Hallowell to add in inside this.

82
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.900
If I try running this again as a test.

83
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.820
N g test.

84
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.650
Look what's been printed.

85
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.110
So the total number of tests run is two and both of them have passed.

86
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.820
And if I go up, you'll see.

87
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.660
Hello world and hello, hello world again.

88
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.810
And that's because both methods of printing hello world.

89
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.170
But if we look at the past section is saying hello world, which is the name of this method has passed

90
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.570
and Hallowell too, which is the method name.

91
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600
This one has also passed.

92
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.430
So we'll go through this a much more detail as we progress for the test n g lectures.

93
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.150
The objective of this lecture was to install test energy into Eclipse and then to prove the installation

94
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.020
was successful.

95
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.080
Thank you for watching.
