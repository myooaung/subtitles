00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.630
In this lecture, we are going to extend on what we've already written in the previous lecture, but

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.600
this time we are going to take into account the two destination field.

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.220
So we've already handled the from text field and now we're going to handle the two field and we can

4
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.850
do this using very similar code to what we've already written.

5
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.770
So I am going to simply copy and paste the class that we've used in the previous lectures, and I'm

6
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.320
going to call this l04 because this will be the fourth lecture and I'm going to keep the name is Travel

7
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.630
Website Part two and click.

8
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.170
Okay.

9
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.910
So in our code we're already using a list and searching for a particular value in the from text field.

10
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.790
And we do this by use a for each loop.

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.180
So I am simply going to copy.

12
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.390
All this code.

13
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.630
And if I add a space behind this close in bracket and paste it.

14
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.610
So I am now going to adjust this code to handle the two destination text field.

15
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.040
So the first thing I need to do is change the CSS selector, which is currently selected and send in

16
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.610
a value.

17
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.630
To the from text field.

18
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.030
So I'm going to right click and inspect the two destination field.

19
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.210
And if I get that selector and focus it, focus on it, and then go to an x velocity, you'll see I'm

20
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.130
provided with a recommendation.

21
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.700
So I am going to copy that CSA selector.

22
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.790
And I'm going to paste it here.

23
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.710
And I'm going to paste it here like so.

24
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.940
So what we're doing is we're clicking on the text field and then we pass in a value.

25
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.820
So I need to change London.

26
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.100
So if I go back to the website.

27
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
You'll remember that when I enter value.

28
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.260
So I'm selected.

29
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.830
Luton.

30
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.460
The destination of where we can fly to is dependent on the flights and the airports that are flown to

31
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.210
based on the from Origin Airport.

32
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.170
So London, Luton will only fly to certain locations.

33
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.340
So if I type the value at here, you see, these are the destinations beginning with way that you can

34
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.170
fly to from London, Luton.

35
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.670
So I am going to use or I'm going to be focus in this test on the value of Antalya.

36
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.250
So I'm just going to pass the value of IUI and then I am going to use visible text again to find the

37
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.390
intaglio value.

38
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.570
So if I go back to the code, I'm going to change London to eight and I will be entered in that two

39
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.920
destination text field.

40
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.870
I need to use a list again.

41
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.740
So I'm going to call this new list destinations.

42
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.300
And.

43
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.850
Where this list is populating the results for the for the coming from text field.

44
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.330
I need to adjust it for D2 destination text field.

45
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.810
So that means I need to change this locator.

46
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.870
So if I go back to the website.

47
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.930
And if I type in, I hear.

48
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.980
And right click and inspect one of these.

49
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.640
So if I widen this.

50
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.720
So we got a better view.

51
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.600
So you'll see that there is a span highlighted.

52
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.370
So if I type in a again and hover over these, notice the elements that are being highlighted here.

53
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.070
So.

54
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.800
This is the bit the first one.

55
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.000
One it's highlighted.

56
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.630
And if I expand this to the sort of span and expand the span you'll see to Aberdeen is the first result.

57
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.149
So again, using the method we did last time.

58
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.780
It's in a span which has a parent's ovary, which has a parent to their lawyer and the lawyer has a

59
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.800
parent of you'll.

60
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.250
And that you will has my expanded a little bit more so you can see an I.D. of new I.D. to.

61
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.300
So this couple has a different idea to the one in the previous lectures.

62
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.020
So I'm going to copy that.

63
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.090
And I'm going to go back to my coat and make that slight adjustment.

64
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.690
And I believe the structure is the same for the following after that.

65
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.860
So if I copy that and then go back to the website.

66
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.530
And if I open up runner ox velocity and paste that value here, click enter.

67
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.280
You'll see there hasn't found any values.

68
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.940
And that's because I'm missing the hash sign so far.

69
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.540
Try again.

70
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.090
You'll see that it's found a number of them.

71
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.550
In fact, it's found 85.

72
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:30.030
So it seems that this website has been designed in a way where there is is displaying a number of results

73
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.130
because there's probably a number of different locations you can fly to from London, Luton.

74
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.850
So I'm going to use this locator to see if our code functions as we would expect.

75
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.070
So I'm going to leave that there for now.

76
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.240
So what I'm going to do in the loop is I'm going to change the origin.

77
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.580
To destination.

78
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.930
And origins to destinations within it and.

79
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.080
So remember, this can be anything again.

80
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.220
But this needs to be the name of the collection, which is destinations.

81
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:15.380
And so I am going to be using if so, instead of Oregon now it's going to be if destination get text

82
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.720
contains and instead of Luton.

83
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.050
I'm going to be looking for an Talla at.

84
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.620
But then I spell it and.

85
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.180
Believes like that it can check.

86
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.470
anti-Al Anti Al.

87
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.090
Why?

88
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.750
That's correct.

89
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:46.320
So it's going to search him for text that contains Antalya and then I need to change origin again to

90
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.650
destination dot click and I'm hoping.

91
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.970
That it would swipe at him.

92
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.770
A look through the results.

93
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.310
You'll find a match for Antalya and it was selected.

94
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.510
So let's save this test.

95
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.870
And let's try running it.

96
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:26.900
And you will see that the test was able to handle the from text field by place in London, Luton and

97
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.950
then select in Antalya as the two destination text field.

98
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.500
So we've been able to reuse our dynamic code for a different scenario.

99
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.760
Thanks for watching.
