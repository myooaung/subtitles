00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.860
So let's create our first Jenkins job.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.980
So I'm going to go back to the dashboard.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.060
And I'm going to select a new item.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.980
So I need to provide an item name and I'm going to simply call this job one.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.360
I'm then going to select Free Style Project and then click okay.

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.570
This will then take you to the following page.

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.770
And here we have a number of settings that we can use.

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.130
So I'm going to select the advanced tab and if I scroll down, you'll see an option for use custom workspace.

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.150
If I take that, it's going to ask me for a directory.

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.790
So this directory is going to be looking for the location of my framework.

11
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.190
So I need to place my framework code in a particular directory that Jenkins can see.

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.860
So if I go to Eclipse.

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.690
And if I right click on my project.

14
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.970
So we're going to be using my project one.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.340
And go to properties.

16
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.760
You'll see the location of where that code exists.

17
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.700
So it's on my desktop.

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.470
Resources workspace like Project one.

19
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.660
So if I go to that location.

20
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.400
Resources Workspace Live Project one.

21
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.690
These are the files that are contained within my framework.

22
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.330
So I am going to copy live Project one using Control C on my keyboard and I'm going to place that into

23
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.060
a location that Jenkins is observing.

24
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.090
So that location usually is on the C drive and the users.

25
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.420
So this is my username.

26
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.150
And you should see a Dot Jenkins folder here.

27
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.100
If I double click that, you'll see that there is a number of folders and files.

28
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.820
So I am simply going to right click and paste that framework code or that folder into this Dot Jenkins

29
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.270
folder.

30
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.740
Once I've done that, I can close this.

31
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.680
And if I go back to Jenkins, I'm then going to provide that directory location.

32
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.890
But there is a come on that we can use for Jenkins to know to go to that Dot Jenkins folder.

33
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.670
And that command is dollar.

34
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.410
A brace or open embrace.

35
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.710
Jenkins underscore home.

36
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.960
A close embrace.

37
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.410
And then we need to provide a forward slash.

38
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.510
And the name of my project, which was Live Project one.

39
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.470
So all this is doing is is going to the Jenkins folder.

40
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.650
So that Jenkins underscore Home Command is looking at this Jenkins folder as a starting point.

41
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.110
The forward slash.

42
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.020
Then says to look inside that folder and look for a folder called Life Project One, which is here.

43
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.850
So once I've set that, I'm going to click save actually say a player and that will say that set in.

44
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.810
Then if I scroll down further.

45
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.270
You'll see that we have an option for build.

46
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.230
So far, select build, you'll be given a number of options and I'm going to be using invoke top level

47
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.370
MAVEN targets.

48
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.780
So what this means is that it's going to be looking for my profile.

49
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.480
So if I select this, you'll see I'm given an option to set a may even version.

50
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.950
So if I select that, you'll see that my Apache maven 3.8.1 is a value I can select.

51
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.550
I'm going to write that and then I need some of my goals.

52
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.370
So these are Maven commands.

53
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.700
So the first command is going to be compile.

54
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.810
So this means to compile my source code.

55
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.050
And then we've a space.

56
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.750
The next command is test.

57
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:21.390
So this tells me even to run my tests or to execute my framework.

58
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.120
So once those are set, I'm going to select Save.

59
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.910
And that would then take me to the project job one instance and we have a number of options here that

60
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.660
we can use.

61
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.550
So that is the job configuration created in the next lecture will try run in our first job.
