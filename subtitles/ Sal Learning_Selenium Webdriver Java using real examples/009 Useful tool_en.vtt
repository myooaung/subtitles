00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.400
So let's take a look at some useful tools that could help us identify locators.

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.550
So there are many tools that could be used to retrieve locator values for you.

3
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.870
These tools even allow you to modify the locator value to write custom locators.

4
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.620
Most of these tools come as browser add ons, and I tend to use Google Chrome partly because of the

5
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.440
great extensions and because of its popularity.

6
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.479
But approach with caution.

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.400
Do not become too reliant on such tools, especially as a beginner.

8
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.050
If you're starting out, then focus on write in manual locators first so they become familiar of how

9
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.710
they're written.

10
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.010
Understanding locators is a key skill to master in selenium.

11
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.420
So let's take a look at a tool that can help us.

12
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.050
So there are many tools out there that can help us find locators.

13
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.620
But the one I like to use is called Run Rocks Velocity.

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.290
And this comes as a Google Chrome addon.

15
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.930
So I'm going to open up Google Chrome and I'm going to search for Ran Rock Velocity.

16
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.540
And you should see there is a link here to chrome dot google dot com and if I click here you should

17
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.100
take it to the following page.

18
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.060
So here you can see some samples of this tool.

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.170
But I'm going to click this add to Chrome button and then click Add Extension and they will install

20
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.490
it on my version of Chrome.

21
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.050
Once I have that confirmation message, I'm then going to go to the address bar and I'm going to go

22
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.300
to the automation testing websites.

23
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.260
I'm then going to click on the Contact US form link and it's on this page.

24
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.520
I'm going to demonstrate trend rocket velocity.

25
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.600
So there are a number of ways that we can access the Ragnarok philosophy panel.

26
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.389
You can either press F12 12 when you keyboard, or I can right click the page and click inspect.

27
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.370
And if I click on this little arrow here, you'll see an option to run rocket velocity and on click

28
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.950
in that it will open up the runner box panel.

29
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.120
So this is the Ragnarok philosophy panel.

30
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.030
And you can see there is a list of selectors here and are some selectors that have been passed to me.

31
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.580
And there's also a text field here to.

32
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.930
So how to use this is quite simply to use a select the tool as we've used previously.

33
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.140
And if I click an element such as the submit button, take a look at that list of selectors.

34
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.380
You can see it have been updated and that's Ragnarok Velocity suggests in a list of selectors that I

35
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.650
can use in order to construct my test.

36
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.850
So you'll see on the right hand side here, there is a little pencil icon.

37
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.640
And if I click the pencil we can on the second row that value gets taken.

38
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.690
That is textbox.

39
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.680
And if I press into my keyboard.

40
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.830
You see, they found one element that matches this particular selector.

41
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.670
And you can see that there is a slight border around the element to.

42
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.820
So if I press enter again on my keyboard, take a look at the submit button on the left hand side.

43
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.080
So you can see it's been highlighted.

44
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.870
So this is a really good so that we can use to find selectors and if we wanted to copy a value of a

45
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.470
selector.

46
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.680
Also given this little copy icon which would compress and that means we can paste it into something

47
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.430
like eclipse.

48
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.110
The really good thing about this tool is that we can also write our custom locators.

49
00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:03.850
So for example, if I was to write inputs and click into my keyboard, you'll see they'll find all input

50
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.030
elements on this page and it's identified five of them.

51
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.190
And if I was to press forward arrow, each one of those will get highlighted.

52
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.839
So if I wanted to focus on the reset button and if I wasn't going to use a selector tool in this text

53
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.580
box here, I can write.

54
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.770
Open square bracket type equals and instead of submits.

55
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.600
I'm going to change that to reset and then press into my keyboard.

56
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.770
And you can see it's identified that one reset button elements.

57
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.850
And the reason for that is that there is five input elements on this page.

58
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.280
So I needed to focus on this reset button, but provided a unique value.

59
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.420
And that unique value is type equals reset.

60
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.580
Because if we look at the HTML in the document object model for this reset button, we can see is the

61
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.780
only input type on the page that has a type of reset.

62
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.550
So that's why this locator value has found one element, and that's the elements we was after, which

63
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.720
is the reset button.

64
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.840
So what I could have done is simply select the selected tool and then click on the reset button and

65
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.500
you you'll see that banner box has provided a list of suggested selectors.

66
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.120
But I wanted to demonstrate how we could write custom locators using this textbox.

67
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.750
So this is Ragnarok philosophy in a nutshell.

68
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.890
Don't worry if it seems complicated, as will be used it often.

69
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.800
But a key thing to remember is don't rely too much on this tool to begin with.
