1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,730
So before we start configuring Jenkins, it's important to understand how you can operate.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,930
Jenkins when you restart your machine or if you shut down your computer.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,500
So when we've installed Jenkins and run Wharfedale, you'll see that command prompt in the background

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,230
is continuously run in Jenkins for us.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:27,440
So if he wanted to stop Jenkins from runnin in command prompt if you hold down control C on your keyboard.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,390
You'll see that it will stop.

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,460
Jenkins for us.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,360
So if I was to go back to the Jenkins dashboard and refresh the page.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,900
We should find that the session has now been closed.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,670
And so what we need to do is restart Jenkins and we do that by following the exact same approach, by

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,840
running the war file.

12
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,830
But this time we haven't got through the admin set up or install the plug ins again.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,660
So what I would need to do is simply go back to the location of where my Jenkins Wolf is residing.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,730
Copy that path again.

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,750
And in command prompt.

16
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:11,440
If you're not already on in this path, you can simply see they go back to it and then we just run the

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,190
command again.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,560
Java Java Jenkins dot war.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,680
And on doing so, you'll see that it once again will start running.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,690
Jenkins for us.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,620
So if I go back now and refresh this page again.

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,350
You'll see that I need to log in, which is going to be the credentials I set up during the initial

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,890
set up.

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,980
And on doing so.

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,840
We're taken back to the dashboard.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,500
So that's how you can stop and restart Jenkins.

27
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,870
So now that we're on the dashboard, as do some configuration, so you'll see an option for manager

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,790
Jenkins for select that when in provided with the following options.

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,820
And I'm going to select global tool configuration.

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,660
So the first step that we need to do is add a JDK to our Jenkins profile.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,600
So I'm going to select Add JDK.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,020
And the following will appear.

33
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,850
So I'm going to antique install automatically because I'm going to point Jenkins to my job.

34
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,560
A home, a location.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,570
So if I open up another command prompt window.

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,990
And type in the command java python version.

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,670
You'll see the version of open JDK that we currently have installed, which is 11 .0.2.

38
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,370
So I'm going to copy that and I'm going to use that as the JDK name.

39
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:01,170
This Java home location is the location of that open JDK, which we know from our environment variables.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,260
So I'm going to open up the environment variables.

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,800
And if I double click on this Java home environment variable, I'm going to simply copy that path.

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,800
And I'm going to paste it like so.

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,580
So that's telling Jenkins where our JDK resides.

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,510
So I'm then going to click Apply.

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,970
And that will say that certain.

46
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,130
If I carry on scrolling down, you'll see an option for Maven.

47
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,580
So we need to do something similar.

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,040
So again, I'm going to click Add Maven.

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,670
This time I'm going to antique the install automatically.

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,160
And I need to provide a name, a maven, even home.

51
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,470
So in that same command prompt window, I'm going to run the command MVA in.

52
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Lengthen the.

53
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,460
And if I press enter, it will tell us what version of Apache maven we have installed.

54
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,650
So I'm going to copy that and paste as the name.

55
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,160
And if I go back to those environment variables.

56
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm simply going to double click the MAVEN Home Environment variable and take the variable value.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
And I'm going to pace that like so.

58
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm then going to select the player.

59
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,420
And then save.

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,150
So that is the configuration that we needed to set.

61
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:34,100
So in the next lecture, we're going to create our first Jenkins job, and we need to add some further

62
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,190
configuration to the job, which I'll show you how to do.

63
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,480
Thanks for watching.
