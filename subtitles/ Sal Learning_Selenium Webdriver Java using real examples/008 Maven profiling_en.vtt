00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.820
So now that we have an understanding of the sure fire plug in, let's take a look at something called

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.170
Maven profile in.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.600
So what is my even profile in?

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.040
It is similar to test in g groups where we can associate tests to a specific profile.

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.830
This means we can then run a specific group of tests based on our requirements.

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.020
For example, we may want to run more tests under regression test compared to fewer under a smoke test.

7
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.760
We set the may even profile in the punk file used in several takes.

8
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.110
We can in target to run the profile better come online.

9
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.670
So this is a screenshot of my file and as you can see, I've set up a profile and it's got an idea of

10
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.300
regression.

11
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.730
So these are the tags that I'll be explaining when I demonstrate the use of this.

12
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.560
But just take notes that we reuse in the code of the Sure Fire plugin.

13
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.870
And for this particular profile we are running run in testing example.

14
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.530
So at the bottom here I have tags for a second profile and it's not fully displayed on my screen.

15
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.700
But the profile is for smoke, which stands for smoke tests.

16
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:28.160
And this smoke profile can point to a different test g, x and or file and the test injects and all

17
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.190
files are what points to what class is run.

18
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.950
So how does it work?

19
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.610
So we set the maven profile in the pom file and give the profile an I.D. which has a unique profile

20
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.030
name.

21
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.560
We then point it towards a test engine.

22
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.510
Simple file.

23
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.740
The text injects simple file control is what tests are to run under the profile.

24
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.810
We can then instruct Maven to run the profile with the command line and order test within the test inject

25
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.100
smell will trigger.

26
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.000
So let's try this out.

27
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.290
So the first thing that I'm going to do here is create a new class by copying and pasting the one from

28
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.100
the last lecture calling this new 108.

29
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.250
And I'm going to give it a name of a profile.

30
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.660
And the code itself is going to remain exactly the same as the last class.

31
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.840
The next thing I'm going to do is create a new test in small file.

32
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.110
So to remind ourselves this current tests inject smell points to the l07 sure fire class.

33
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.880
So I am going to copy and paste that test and g file and I'm going to keep the name of test and G to

34
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.750
the x amount.

35
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.220
I'm then going to open up that file.

36
00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.600
And the key difference here is I am going to copy this line and paste it below and I'm just going to

37
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.680
change the name to l08 underscore.

38
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.520
Profile.

39
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.470
Like so.

40
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.960
So the key difference of this test in G2 file is that it points to two classes, this one and this one.

41
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.430
So I'm now going to save that.

42
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.170
The next thing I'm going to do is open up my profile and this is where I'm going to start coded the

43
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.860
profile.

44
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.810
So I'm going to scroll down until I find the end.

45
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.230
Dependencies.

46
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.730
Take.

47
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.400
And after that, I'm going to make some room and I'm going to use a tag called Profiles.

48
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.700
I'm then going to expand that and inside those profiles takes I am going to use it take you profile.

49
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.820
And inside those profile tags, I'm going to use a tag called i-D.

50
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.170
So this is going to be the name of the profile.

51
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.260
So I'm going to call this regression.

52
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.680
The next thing I'm going to do after the IED attacks is to use a build tank.

53
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.290
And again, I'm going to expand that.

54
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.270
And inside those build takes, I'm going to use a plug in management take.

55
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.660
And then I'm going to expand.

56
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.120
That's an insight that I am going to use a plugins tag.

57
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.380
So this is what we need to set up a profile and I now need to enter the remaining tags inside these

58
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.070
plug ins.

59
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.570
But before I do so, let me go back to the Sure Fire plugin.

60
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.370
So see if you can notice anything useful here.

61
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.930
So you can see that we have plug in tanks and we have the sure fire plug in code already here.

62
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.780
So all I need to do is copy that and paste that with inside the plugin.

63
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.620
Thanks.

64
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.380
Like so.

65
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.490
So if you hold control shift then eth eclipse will reformat that for you.

66
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:36.050
So this regression profile is going to point to the test edge example, which is this file.

67
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.710
So if I wanted to create a second profile, all I need to do now is copy this code.

68
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.230
Paste it.

69
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.570
Just below and withinside the profiles takes.

70
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.350
Like so.

71
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.400
So I can call this one here.

72
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.270
Smoke.

73
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.210
So this will be our smoke profile.

74
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.250
And this is currently pointed to the test inject smell.

75
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.210
So what I'm going to do quickly actually is change the regression 12.2 tests, MGE two, which is this

76
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.630
file.

77
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.630
This is because regression tests tend to have more tests than a smoke test.

78
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.630
So the regression test is pointing to the test in G to file.

79
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.480
And the smoke profile is pointing to the test in g file.

80
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.260
So now I am going to simply save my poem file.

81
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.750
And I am going to open up.

82
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.500
Come online.

83
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:52.070
And I am again going to see the into the directory of where my file, my project resides.

84
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.180
So resources workspace and Maven project.

85
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.810
So I'm going to copy that path.

86
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.610
I'm going to paste it and then select Enter.

87
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.780
So previously I ran the command envy n test.

88
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.020
And this will trigger the tests to run.

89
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.610
But this time I'll want to use a specific profile.

90
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.680
So the first one I'm going to use is the regression.

91
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.940
So I am going to place a spacer and I'm going to use a hyphen and a capital P.

92
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.040
And this is a flag which employers on providing a profile.

93
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.500
I'm then going to direct it directly provides the profile name.

94
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:46.590
So I'm going to try r e g r e ss i n for regression.

95
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.190
So now if I press enter, let's see what happens.

96
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.000
And you can see that two tests have run.

97
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.670
So what this means is.

98
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:13.670
The regression profile has run as it points to the test engine to fail, and that test entry to file

99
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.280
triggers two classes.

100
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.290
Now, if I was to go back.

101
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.080
And use a similar command, but this time provide smoke.

102
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.520
Let's see what happens.

103
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.750
And you can see only one test run.

104
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:45.480
And the reason for that is the smoke profile points the test n g x smell and test inject smell only

105
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.310
triggers the one class.

106
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.970
So that's how we know that may even profiles are working.

107
00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:04.510
We are able to trigger a particular profile income online by using the simple MVNO test hyphen P command

108
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.240
and then providing the name of the profile.

109
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.700
I hope this lecture has been useful.

110
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.200
And thank you for watching.
