00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,030
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,950
In this section, we're going to look at other advanced topics of selenium web driver.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,930
In this lecture, we're going to look at Chrome options.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,880
The Chrome options class can be used to set a number of browser options to Chrome when a test is triggered.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:29,110
For example, we can use the conventional code to maximize the chrome window and we've used this code

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,550
throughout the course so far.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,640
This is where I use driver dot manage.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,470
Dot window, dot maximize.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,770
But instead we can use chrome options by writing something like the below.

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,730
So I'm using the chrome options class and creating an object called options.

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,980
Then I add arguments to the options object such as start maximized.

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,340
Then when we create the driver instance, we simply pass the options object as a parameter.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,590
So why can we why should we change this?

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,300
Why not use chrome options?

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,940
The reason for that is that we have Chrome options.

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,390
We have a number of different choices that we can select.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,950
For example, if I wanted Chrome to open in incognito mode, then I have an option to do that.

18
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,710
So let's try this out.

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,070
So as we started a new section of this course, I am going to right click the source folder, select

20
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:38,750
new and then select package and create a new package called Section zero nine and then click Finish.

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm then going to go back to the default package and copy the chrome demo.

22
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,230
So control, seal my keyboard.

23
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,050
And then going to left click the new package in control V to paste it.

24
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,850
So now I need to rename this class, so I'm going to right click it.

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,190
Select refactor and then rename.

26
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,120
And I'm going to call this 1l01 since this is the first lecture of this section.

27
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,120
Understood.

28
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,250
Underscore chrome options and then click finish.

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,060
Click Finish again, and then it will be renamed.

30
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,160
So I'm going to double click this.

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,170
And now I'm going to begin writing code.

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,940
So here you can see I have driver don't manage the window don't maximize.

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,100
So I'm going to remove that because I'm going to use Chrome options instead.

34
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,840
So to use chrome options, I need to use the chrome options class.

35
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,040
So I am going to do this above the Web driver object creation.

36
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,090
So I'm going to do it here and I'm going to write Chrome.

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,600
Options.

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,790
Options equals new chrome.

39
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,390
Options.

40
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,390
Brackets and a semicolon like so.

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,240
So if I hover over chrome options, you see, I've got an option to import it from selenium.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,530
Then the error goes away.

43
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,540
Now I am going to add arguments to the options object.

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,240
To do this, I'm going to write options.

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,430
Thoughts and arguments.

46
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,330
Then in the bracket song we use double quotes.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,800
And I'm going to use two dashes.

48
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,420
Start.

49
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,150
Dash.

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,660
Maximized.

51
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,600
Like so.

52
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,060
And then it was semi-colon at the end.

53
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,930
So now I need to pass this object as a parameter here.

54
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,260
So I'm going through our options.

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,480
Our.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,570
And I'm going to save this class.

57
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,560
So now if I try running it, let's see if the chrome window opens.

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,340
Maximized.

59
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,650
And you can see that did.

60
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,380
So let me try another option.

61
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,959
So I am going to copy this line.

62
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,600
Like so.

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,870
Instead of start maximized.

64
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,020
I'm going to write in.

65
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,160
COG Nieto like so.

66
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,000
So if I say this class again.

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
Let's try running it.

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,560
And you can see that chrome this time has opened up in incognito mode because of the black windows.

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,250
So that's how easy it is to say options to Chrome.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,450
All we need to do is use the Chrome options class to create an object.

71
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,950
We then simply add arguments to not object, and then all we do is pass the object as a parameter.

72
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,100
When we create the driver instance.

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
So I hope you found this lecture useful.

74
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,590
And thank you for watching.
