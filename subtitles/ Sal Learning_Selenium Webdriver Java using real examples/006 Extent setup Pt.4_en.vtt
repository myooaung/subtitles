1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.530
So now that we've set up our extent manager class and we've made changes to our base page screenshot

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.510
method, we now need to make changes to our listeners.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.480
So I'm going to open up the current class which contains the following.

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.500
So at the moment we're using one method which is on test failure, and this method on a test failure

5
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.980
will be triggered which would take a screenshot using take snapshot method from the base page class.

6
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
So I'm going to be adding some additional methods here for different events.

7
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.510
So underneath the constructor, I'm going to write.

8
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.280
Public.

9
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.420
And again, I'm going to use the synchronized keyword.

10
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.360
Void.

11
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.690
And the method that I'm going to use is on start.

12
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.880
And in brackets.

13
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.740
And then at the end of that, I'm going to add I open and close embrace.

14
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.070
So as we use in or we implement in the only test listener interface, this interface has methods which

15
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.540
I think can be explained previously when we first started setting up this in this class.

16
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.210
But if I hold down, control my keyboard and then click on the interface, you'll see these methods

17
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.880
that belong to this interface for which we can use.

18
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.850
So if I go back to this listener's class on test start or on start, sorry is a method.

19
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.700
Which is defined.

20
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.460
Let's try and locate it.

21
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.390
Yeah.

22
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.170
So some method that we can use and you can see it context.

23
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.530
Context is used within that which is different from the other methods which uses test results.

24
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.450
So if I copy that, it takes context.

25
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.380
And paste it inside those round brackets like so.

26
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.990
You'll see us accepted.

27
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.720
And if I hover over its context, it gives you a brief explanation of why it does.

28
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.730
So this class defines a test context which contains all the information for a given test run.

29
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.160
So that is the key difference between that and the only test results.

30
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.380
And this is a class that describes the result of a test.

31
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.400
So the ISIS context itself contains all the information for a given test run.

32
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.800
So that is the key difference between this method and the other methods that I have created and will

33
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.820
creates in a moment.

34
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.410
Inside this method, I'm going to write the following.

35
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.690
So I am going to use the extent manager class.

36
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.730
And I'm going to call a method of get report.

37
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.770
And if I open up the extent manager and look at get report that is this method here.

38
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.710
And this method is checking to see if this filled is no.

39
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.540
If it is is going to call sets up extent report which is this method.

40
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.700
And this method is also responsible for creating the extent reports, creating the reporter, and assigning

41
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.690
a reporter to the Extent Reports object.

42
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.530
So underneath this line.

43
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.480
I'm going to write the following.

44
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.980
Extent manager again, Dot.

45
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.160
Create test.

46
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.870
And then these two parameters are predefined.

47
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.650
So I'm just going to remove those and I'm going to use context.

48
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.760
Dot get host.

49
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.100
And in a second one context dot gets name.

50
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.150
And at the end of that line, a semicolon.

51
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.240
So that's his the on start method now complete.

52
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.690
So when this on the stance of of when I trigger the tests, this is going to be triggered and is called

53
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.190
in extent manager and is called need gets report method which will get the reports and then extent manager

54
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.540
dot create test.

55
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.190
And that create test is another method in here.

56
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.390
Which is this one here?

57
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.360
Which will create the test object.

58
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.240
So it's set in the Fred.

59
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.080
So that's his that method now complete.

60
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.280
So the next thing that I need to do is make some amendments to this on test failure.

61
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.510
So the first thing I need to do is add this synchronized keywords to it.

62
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.750
To avoid my friends becoming confused.

63
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.390
So now that I've done that, I need to make some adjustments to the inner code.

64
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.750
So at the top here I am again going to use the extent manager class.

65
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.190
And I'm going to write thoughts, get test.

66
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.690
Which is called in a method.

67
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.010
Dot file.

68
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.510
And inside this foul.

69
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.320
I am going to write the following.

70
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.620
The result which is used in this here.

71
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.500
Get.

72
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.230
Probable.

73
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.000
And then at the end of that line, it's simple semicolon.

74
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.550
So if I hover over, fail.

75
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.390
You'll see that this logs in event with a status of fail and an exception.

76
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.130
And inside the parameters inside the brackets is return in result, which is the information for this

77
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:32.720
particular test and is used in a method called Get Froebel, which prints out the exception when a failure

78
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.410
occurs.

79
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.320
I'm then going to make some changes to this choice statement here.

80
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.140
So at the moment, we're calling the take snapshot method from the base page, and then we're using

81
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.950
this result to get the name of the test as filed.

82
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.580
So before calling that, I'm going to write the following.

83
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.130
I'm going to simply use system.

84
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.400
Dots out the print when.

85
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.340
And I'm going to report the following.

86
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.460
Test failed in the colon and in space.

87
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.710
And outside those quotes plus.

88
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.250
Result.

89
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.730
Thoughts get.

90
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.820
Name like so with a semicolon.

91
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:35.260
So this is going to simply print out to console that a test has failed and is going to get a name of

92
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.550
the test that has failed.

93
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.760
For this take snapshot.

94
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:46.660
I'm using results to get the name of the test that has failed and I'm passing.

95
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.100
It's at its base page method.

96
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.810
As he takes take snapshot requires a string to be passed to it.

97
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.620
But I'm going to make a slight change to this.

98
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.670
So well I've got take snapshots result get name.

99
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.260
I'm now going to use result dot get method dot get name.

100
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.820
And you'll see there's an error and they get name.

101
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.080
As I need to change.

102
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.890
Don't get named.

103
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.710
Two thoughts get method name.

104
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.620
And you'll see the error now goes away.

105
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.840
If a hover over get method.

106
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.970
You'll see that this is referring to.

107
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:38.669
A testing method which returns the method that this particular result represents.

108
00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:47.300
If I hover over get method name you'll see that it's they say returns the method name and this is needed

109
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.590
for serialization because methods are not seriously realizable.

110
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.080
So returns the method name.

111
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.700
Which is compatible with civilization.

112
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:06.910
So underneath this line I need to write one more which is going to again use extent manager.

113
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.370
But I'm going to use the attach image method.

114
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:13.750
Like.

115
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.210
So it was semicolon at the end.

116
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:23.460
So what this is going to do is it's going to call the attach image method from the extent manager.

117
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.580
Which is this method here?

118
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:26.900
I'm good.

119
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.130
Explained what this does.

120
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.760
So that is the changes I need to make to the onsets failure method.

121
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:42.030
So I need to now one more method and then the listeners will be complete.

122
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.430
And this is going to be a method responsible for calling the flush command.

123
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.910
So I am going to simply copy public synchronized void from above.

124
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.820
And pace to hair like so.

125
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.640
And I am going to use the method on finish.

126
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.530
And then brackets with an open and close embrace.

127
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.410
So again, on finish is another method which belongs to the it.s listener.

128
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.840
And I can show you that.

129
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.770
Which is here on Finnish.

130
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.120
It has context.

131
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.840
Context.

132
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.880
So if I simply copy that.

133
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.670
Paste it like so.

134
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.040
That will save us some time.

135
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:41.380
So all this method is going to do is again use extent, manager class.

136
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.220
Dot.

137
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.140
And if I go to the extent manager class.

138
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.040
I want to call the flash command, which is handled by this misfit here.

139
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.500
So I'm going to copy that name.

140
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.790
Plus reports.

141
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.310
And I'm going to add it like so with a semicolon.

142
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:10.230
And so what this method will do is that when the tests have finished, this unfinished method will be

143
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:16.290
triggered and it's going to use extent manager and called flash report method.

144
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.380
Which name cause the extent report the flush method.

145
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.160
And we've explained what the flush method does previously.

146
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.160
So that is the listeners class now complete.

147
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.900
So I'm going to save that.

148
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.260
And in the next lecture we can start amending our tests.
