1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,070
In this lecture, we're going to create our page objects.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,300
So the first thing I'm going to do and the source main java is right click select new and select package.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,050
And I'm going to give this package a name of page.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,010
Objects.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,120
So this is where we're going to store our page object classes.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:30,130
So I'm going to right click that select new and class, and I'm going to give this class a name of home

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,680
page and then click Finish.

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,930
So I am going to create the page objects for the automation test in home page.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,870
So I am going to get objects for all the elements that I may want to interact with in my tests.

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,360
So I am going to go back to Eclipse and the first thing that I am going to write here is a new public

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,450
field of type web driver, and I'm going to call it driver.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,310
And I would need to import web driver from selenium and that error will go away.

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,710
The next thing I need to do is create a number of fields which will reference the locator value.

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:26,240
So for example, I am going to write by and I'm going to give this variable a name of toggle.

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,360
And it's going to equal.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,370
Buyer and then the typeof located I'm going to use.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,170
So you'll see it as an error on the buyer.

18
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,930
And that's because I need to import it from selenium.

19
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,270
And this one here will go away once we finish writing the code.

20
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,910
So I'm going to go back to the home page and I'm going to get locator for this toggle button here.

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,170
So I'm going to right click it and then click Inspect.

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,270
And then if I go to Reynolds Velocity, you'll see that I'm given a number of selector values.

23
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,639
So I'm going to take this CCS selector toggle.

24
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,130
So I'm going to copy that when I go back to Eclipse.

25
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:24,090
And I'm going to write thoughts, success selector and in double quotes, I'm going to place a value.

26
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,780
The next one not going to create is by.

27
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,680
And it's going to be the home.

28
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,910
Page link and it's going to equal.

29
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:44,140
So if I go back to the website and press this toggle button, I want to get a selector for this home

30
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,860
page link.

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,280
So I'm going to get Select Tool and Select Home Page, and you'll see that there's a number of values

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
I can use here.

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,980
And this link text one looks like a simple value to you, so I'm going to take that.

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:07,250
So here I'm going to write by link text and I'm going to place that value like so.

35
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,230
And then going to do a crate.

36
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:22,150
Another one and this is going to be for the accordion link is going to equal buyer linked text.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,530
And if I go back to the website.

38
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,890
And select the accordion link.

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,380
I'm simply going to take that link.

40
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,420
Takes the value like so.

41
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,650
And I'm going to paste it in the double quotes.

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
So this is the concept that I'm following.

43
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:46,050
I'm creating a number of variables that are based on the elements that exist on the home page.

44
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,670
So this will mean I'll then be able to use these elements or these variables when I start construct

45
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,960
in my tests.

46
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,780
So I'm going to do one more just to demonstrate that once more to you.

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,420
So I'm going to do a browser.

48
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,560
Taps link equals boy.

49
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,080
Linked text and in double quotes for go back.

50
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,230
I'm going to select the browser tabs link button.

51
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,660
And I'm going to copy the link text and paste it like so.

52
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,390
So rather than bore you showing you this again and again, I've already written this code which I'm

53
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,160
going to simply copy and paste.

54
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,190
So this code will be available to you as an attachment on this lecture.

55
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,740
So I'm just going to override that like so.

56
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:51,150
So these are all the locators that I have sourced from the home page of the automation testing website.

57
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,020
The next thing I need to do is create a constructor.

58
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,580
And to do this, I'm going to write public.

59
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,490
And again, I need to use the class name which is home page.

60
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,020
Fill up my brackets, then open and close embrace.

61
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:21,450
So inside the brackets of this constructor, I'm going to provide a parameter of Web driver.

62
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,770
Driver.

63
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,850
And inside the construct itself, I'm going to write this thought driver equals driver.

64
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:42,020
So what this means is when I create an object based on this home page class, I have to provide a web

65
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,270
driver instance or an object.

66
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,550
The constructor would then use that to update this variable here with the object that I've passed.

67
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,940
So this will make more sense when I demonstrate it to you.

68
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:04,430
But the next step now is to create public methods, which will then get the value of these locators

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,370
and these on the public methods that we can use in our test using the page object model.

70
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,390
So the first thing I'm going to write is public.

71
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,320
Web element.

72
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,560
And I'm going to call this one get toggle.

73
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,810
And brackets and an open and close embrace.

74
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,390
And if a hobo hover over a web element, I'm given the option to import it from selenium.

75
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,390
So get toggle is expected in a return statement.

76
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,070
So I am going to write here return.

77
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,910
Driver.

78
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,690
To find elements.

79
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:00,010
And inside those brackets I am going to provide the toggle variable.

80
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,950
The semicolon.

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,420
So I need to do this for each of these fields.

82
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,810
So I'll demonstrate one more, and then I'll just copy the predefined code that I have available to

83
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,250
me which you can download.

84
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,770
So I'm going to write public.

85
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,480
Web element.

86
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,460
Get Home page link.

87
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,920
And again, an open and close embrace.

88
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,340
Return driver.

89
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,330
Find the buyer.

90
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,960
And I am going to provide the home link like so.

91
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,790
Semicolon at the end.

92
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,180
So I'm going to do this again for each of these.

93
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,240
But rather, like I said, I'm just going to copy these to save you some time that I want to bore you

94
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,840
too much.

95
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm just going to copy these.

96
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,820
Up to that point.

97
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,980
And I'm just going to paste it below.

98
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,970
So you can see that it's home page.

99
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:25,020
Objects class now contains variables for all the useful elements that exist on the home page of the

100
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,730
automation testing website.

101
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,310
And then use a constructor to pass an object.

102
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:38,850
And then these public methods simply go and return the value of these variables.

103
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:48,660
So this means that in my test I can call get home page link and this method will provide the link or

104
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:57,300
the value of the home page variable, which has been defined here, which contains a value of the selector

105
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,170
or locator.

106
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,830
So this is the first page object created.

107
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,350
And I hope it's been useful to you.

108
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,050
And in the next lecture will begin creating another page object for the next web page.

109
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,580
Thank you for watching.
