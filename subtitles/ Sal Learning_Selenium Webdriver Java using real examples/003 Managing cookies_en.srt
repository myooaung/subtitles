00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,820
In this lecture, we learn how to manage cookies.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,980
So what are cookies?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,860
Cookies are messages that web servers pass.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,840
Your Web browser when you visit Internet sites.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,460
Your browser stores each message in a small file called cookie dough.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,050
Text.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,910
When you request another page from the server, your browser sends the cookie back to the server.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,490
These files typically contain information about your visit to the Web page, as well as information

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,070
you volunteered such as your name and etc..

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
Cookies are used to maintain sessions between the server and the client.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,650
The below commands can be set by using driver.

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,370
Don't manage.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,320
We are able to add return or delete cookies based on our requirements.

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,120
So let's take a look.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,220
So first, let me walk you through the test.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm going to open up Chrome.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,260
Go to the automation testing website and I'm going to click on the test or link, which will take you

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,120
to this page.

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,980
Now, what I recommend, if you're following along, is to sign up and create a dummy test account that

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,330
you can use specifically for those of you that are following along.

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,420
The reason for this is if you use my account at the same time of another user, you'd log each other

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,050
in and out.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
So I am going to sign in.

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,280
And if you're going to create an account, click on this no no account button and you can sign up with

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,200
some dummy data and just remember the credentials.

26
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,930
So I'm going to go back because I've already created a account and I'm going to log in.

27
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,010
So you can see that I'm now signed in as test.

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,520
So I'm going to go back to the my store home page.

29
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,860
And I am going to click a product and I'm going to add it to my cart.

30
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,720
And click continue shopping.

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,600
So you can see that there was one item in my cart.

32
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,970
If I close the browser.

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,180
And then go back.

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,770
To the automation testing website and then click on the test store.

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,480
You can see that the item is still in my cart.

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,200
And this is done by using cookies.

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,020
So cookies know that I am the same user and it maintains the session.

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,340
And if I it right click and inspect this page.

39
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,710
And click on.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,220
Applications had.

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,870
And then click on the cookies button.

42
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,470
You'll see the cookies that are on this website.

43
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,090
So if I try and delete that, press the shop.

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,700
Cookie.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,390
And enclose his panel and refresh my page.

46
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,790
You'll see that that item has now been removed.

47
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,760
So this proves that my session to this web page is maintained by cookies.

48
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,250
And because I've deleted that cookie.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,520
This website no longer knows that I am the same user.

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,700
So I am going to minimize this Web page for now, and I'm going to open up the clips and I'm going to

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,300
create a new class by copying and pasting the class in the last lecture.

52
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,880
Call in this new one l0 free.

53
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,160
And I'm going to give it a name of cookies.

54
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,020
I'm then going to open up this class.

55
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,790
And I am going to delete the Chrome Option section and the set capabilities and Design Capabilities

56
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,300
section.

57
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,160
And I am going then remove the option parameter from the chrome driver like so.

58
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,240
So the first thing I'm going to do is get the.

59
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,170
Home page or at the store home page address.

60
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,310
And I'm going to Pacer in the get method.

61
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,850
So I now need to go to the store home page to source the locators.

62
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,840
I need to carry out this test.

63
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,420
So on the test or home page, the first locator I need is the sign in button.

64
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,730
So I'm going to right click it, inspect it.

65
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,400
And I'm going to go to runner up the Lost City, and I'm going to simply get this one here and copy

66
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,580
it.

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,570
So instead of going back and forth to Eclipse and this Web page, I'm going to open up a notepad and

68
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:57,410
I'm just going to make a note saying sign in link and then paste in the locator there.

69
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,420
So once I click on that sign in link.

70
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,940
It will take me to this log in panel.

71
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,140
So I am going to inspect the email textbox.

72
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,710
It's run across velocity and just get at first.

73
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,730
Yes, a selector and make a note, say an email text box and paste that.

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,430
And then I'm going to do the exact same for the password.

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,980
Passwords, text books.

76
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,540
And so once I log in, so I'm also going to need the sign in button.

77
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,530
So let me get that.

78
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,390
Sign in button.

79
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,790
And then once I do sign in, so I'm going to use my test account.

80
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,250
So once I am presented with this page, I'm then going to click on this clothes link.

81
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,290
So I'm going to right click and inspect it.

82
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,370
Coach Brennan Velocity.

83
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,910
And I'm going to use link text, so I don't know what these two characters are.

84
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,340
This is just based on how the website has been designed.

85
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,200
So I'm just going to copy it.

86
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,310
And I'm going to like close link.

87
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,000
But I'm just going to delete those two characters at the front of that because I don't need that.

88
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,280
So where we're using link text here.

89
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,640
I'm just going to make a note of the link text locator.

90
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,800
That should work fine.

91
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,540
So once I click on this close link on Presenter Buddy's this page.

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,960
So I'm going to right click the first image.

93
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,880
And I'm going to get that.

94
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,380
So yes, I select about.

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,640
It's the first product.

96
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,120
And once I click on that first product.

97
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,930
They'll take me to this page.

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,320
So I want to click on Add to Cart Button.

99
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,860
So I'm going to right click and inspect it.

100
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,190
And I'm going to take the.

101
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,020
First one.

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,950
So add to cart button.

103
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,700
And then when I add to Cart.

104
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,610
Its eight shows the following panel.

105
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,330
So I'm going to select continue shopping.

106
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,180
So I am going to take.

107
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,590
This one.

108
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:56,660
Continue shop in button like so sardines are all the locators we need in order to write the test.

109
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:04,040
So I am going to minimize the browser and I'm going to use this now to write my test.

110
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,620
So I am going to write driver the find element by the set selector.

111
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,050
Double quotes and a semicolon.

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,540
And I'm going to copy this line a number of times just to save me some time.

113
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,370
So in that first one, I am going to open up Notepad and take the first selector for the sign in link.

114
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,860
And I'm going to paste it.

115
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,870
And as it's a button or link, I'm going to click it.

116
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,250
So for the second one.

117
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
It's for the email address.

118
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,789
A text box on the sign panel.

119
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,620
So I'm going to paste that.

120
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,280
But as it's a text box, I need to provide a value.

121
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,740
So I am going to use same keys and I'm going to use the test account that I've created.

122
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,920
Test at test.

123
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,470
Dot com.

124
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,610
So here, use the email address you've signed up with.

125
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,280
If you've created your own mum, if you're following along.

126
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,130
So in the next line of code, it's for the password textbox.

127
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,370
So I am going to Pacer here and I'm also going to have to send the value.

128
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:24,330
So I'm using keys and the password that I've used for my test account is test one, two, three.

129
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,980
So next is the sign in button.

130
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,080
And as this is a pattern, I'm going to need to click it.

131
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,950
And on the next line, it's for the clothes link.

132
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
So remember, this is not CSI select.

133
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,310
It is time because we're going to be using link text.

134
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,830
So a link text, double quotes and I'm going to place clothes.

135
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,560
And because it's a link, I need to click it.

136
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,240
So I'm going to use the Click Command.

137
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,050
So I'm just going to copy a couple more of these because I know I need a few more than this.

138
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,390
So next is the first product.

139
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,960
So I am going to pay sat here.

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,780
And the product is an image I need to click.

141
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,940
So let me use a click command.

142
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,370
Next is the add to cart button.

143
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,280
So I'm going to pay sat here.

144
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,160
And as is the button, I'm going to click it.

145
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,500
And then finally, is the continue shop in button.

146
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,060
I'm going to paste that here.

147
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,930
And as it's a button again, I'm going to use the Click Command.

148
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:51,730
So before I run this, I am going to add some frayed sleeps just to slow the test down so that we can

149
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,620
see what's happening a bit better.

150
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,180
So I am going to add 1/2 between each of these steps.

151
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,330
So now I'm going to say this.

152
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,870
And try running it.

153
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,680
Let's see what happens so far.

154
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,150
So it's gone to the asylum page.

155
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,310
It's provided an email address and password.

156
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,810
It's logged in successfully.

157
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:39,520
Click the clothes link clicked image one added it to cart and then it closed the panel by clicking on

158
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,930
the continue shopping button.

159
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,340
So you can see that there is an item now in my heart.

160
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,560
The cart is shown one.

161
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,480
So I'm going to close this.

162
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,640
And I'm also going to maximize the driver because I know the browser, because I noticed the browser

163
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,660
wasn't maximized.

164
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,210
So I'm just going to do driver dot manage thoughts.

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,600
Win, though, not maximize, son.

166
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,180
Right.

167
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,850
So you've noticed that there is a item in my cart.

168
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:22,550
So now what I'm going to do is I am going to delete all the cookies after I've added that item.

169
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,320
So I am going to write driver, dot manage.

170
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,140
Thoughts.

171
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,940
Delete all cookies.

172
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,450
So if I do this now, let's see what happens.

173
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,940
So it's maximized the browser.

174
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,150
This time it's logging in.

175
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,630
Just click on the Clouds link.

176
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,440
Click it on the first product and adding it to the cart.

177
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,460
So it seems to have frozen.

178
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,680
So let's go to a clip to have a look at the console to see what the error has reported.

179
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,820
So design elements is not intractable.

180
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:21,230
So I suspect the reason for that is, is trying to click on the continue shopping button before it's

181
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,710
loaded.

182
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,150
So here would be an ideal situation to add a white.

183
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,030
But as we've already covered whites and it's not the purpose of this lecture, I'm just going to add

184
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,750
that extend that Fred don't sleep to 3 seconds instead.

185
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,880
So let me just say that again and try running it one more time.

186
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,560
So again, is logging in.

187
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,630
It can the clothes they think they can product adding it to the car.

188
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,810
This time it's clicked continue shopping and if you look at the cart is Scott one item now.

189
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,160
But if I was to refresh the page now.

190
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,210
You'll see that cart has zero items in there.

191
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,340
And the reason for that is that we have deleted all the cookies.

192
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,410
The cookie that was track in my user session has been deleted.

193
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,000
And so now I it's been signed out as a user.

194
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,230
So just to prove that works, let me comment in sli now save it and run it one more time.

195
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,360
And this time what I'm going to do is I'm going to refresh the page.

196
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,560
And prove to you.

197
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,880
That's my session without deleting those cookies is maintained.

198
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,780
So I haven't run the delete all cookies come on this time.

199
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,000
But if I click the refresh page.

200
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,240
Notice how it knows that I am the same user.

201
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,860
So by simply using this driver, Dot managed to delete all cookies.

202
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,820
I'm able to delete the cookies of my test.

203
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,420
I hope you found this lecture useful.

204
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,770
Thank you for watching.
