00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.840
Welcome to the next section of this course.

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.260
In this section, we focus on interacting with elements.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.760
And we do this by using something called locators.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.840
So this lecture is an introduction into locators.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.810
So what is a locator in selenium?

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.380
So it is a form of identification.

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.850
It is how we can tell our program to locate an element of our choosing and to perform a task against

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.050
it.

9
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.070
For example, say we had free buttons on a web page.

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.490
If each of the buttons had a unique property, say, a unique I.D., then we could say, Hey, go press

11
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.640
a button that has the idea of.

12
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.950
Selenium.

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.450
Then trawled web page.

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.180
Until it finds an element with a matching already.

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.740
Locators are also known as selectors in selenium.

16
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.380
So think of it this way.

17
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.540
How can we identify it?

18
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.960
The poppy highlighted with the red rectangle from the others.

19
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.820
Maybe we would say he or she is one of the two dogs that is wearing a pink bandana.

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.570
This narrows it down to just two.

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.490
We then might say out of the two, he or she has the dark hair.

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.200
Then the other.

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.610
Using this logic, we are able to determine what puppy we had in mind and locaters work in a very similar

24
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.060
way.

25
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.980
So there are different types of locators.

26
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.010
And the most commonly used ones are listed below.

27
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:52.370
So we have locate him by day, by name, by link, text by thesis, and by x path.

28
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.150
We'll go over this in detail in the next few lectures.

29
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.890
So find element command is use uniquely identifying a web elements within the web page.

30
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.450
Find element command takes in the by object as the parameter and returns an object of type web elements.

31
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.490
An example, say we had a link on a web page with text or sign up.

32
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.220
Then we could locate that elements using the below driver to find element by thought, link, text,

33
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.460
and then in brackets and in double quotes we provide the text of that link which is signup.

34
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.240
This will all make sense in the next few lectures.

35
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.330
So if that sounded complicated, do not worry.

36
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.690
So a big tip is to understand locators.

37
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.410
Well, locators are at the heart of selenium.

38
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.280
If you spend time now in locates as well, you'll be able to interact with any elements on a web page.

39
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.550
Sometimes finding a way to identify the elements and instruct in our program to interact with it can

40
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.930
be the trickiest part.

41
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.980
So do not rely on programs to help you.

42
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.860
Learn locaters by practicing before moving on to tools that can assist.

43
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.890
I also recommend to my students the following course.

44
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.010
So this is entirely optional.

45
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.000
You do not need to take it in order to progress on the current course.

46
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.690
But for those students who wants to gain a deep and advanced understanding of selectors, then I recommend

47
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.230
the following.

48
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.270
As you can see, it's rated 4.8 stars out of five at the time of this recording, and it's only three

49
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.560
and a half hours long.

50
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.240
But by the end of it, you would have mastered selectors and locators.

51
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.110
If you're interested in this course, you can find it by following the highlighted U of L.

52
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.130
But as I've said, it's entirely optional and it's not needed in order to progress with the current

53
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.580
course.

54
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.290
Thank you for watching.
