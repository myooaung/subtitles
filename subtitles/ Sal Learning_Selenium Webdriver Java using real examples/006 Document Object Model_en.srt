1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,689
Before we take a look at ex parte locators, I feel it's important to understand the document object

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:07,110
model.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,720
The document object model, also known as the DOM, is a document that stores objects of a web page.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,830
The web page is retrieved by the server and the browser then generates a dom of the page.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,880
You can use the objects from the DOM to make changes to a web page using JavaScript.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,490
Students often get confused between understanding the difference between HTML and the DOM.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,500
For now.

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,840
Just remember the html document and the DOM are not the same thing.

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:47,960
H.

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,210
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,570
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is a text document that has the extension dot html.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,970
It describes the structure of a web page.

13
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:13,400
It consists of a series of tanks, and the document is a structure where the symbol tag is the parent,

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,480
followed by two siblings, which are head and body types.

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,200
And additional tags often go within the parent takes is shown.

16
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,550
So we have small takes.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,590
And inside those small tags, we have head and body takes.

18
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:38,510
And inside those head and body tags we could have in attacks such as title for the head or h one and

19
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,040
P tags for the body.

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:50,550
The document object model treats a HTML document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing

21
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,840
a part of the document.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,760
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a document object model of the page, which is an object

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:08,350
orientated representation of a simple document that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the

24
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,430
document itself.

25
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,520
This allows the creation of dynamic web pages.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,840
We can then use JavaScript to add change over the move and the elements within the page.

27
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:30,000
Change this a styling of elements react to existing events or create new events and much, much more.

28
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,530
On this slide, I provide a process flow to try and demonstrate how the document object model is generated.

29
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,220
So a browser requests a web page.

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,900
The server then sends the HTML web page and RSS to the browser.

31
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,470
The browser then generates a document object model of the web page and renders it to the screen.

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,630
So let's see the dome in action.

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,550
I'm going to open up Google Chrome and I'm going to go to the automation test and website.

34
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,430
And then I'm going to click on the Buttons link to the Buttons page.

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,460
So I'm going to right click this page and select view page source.

36
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,630
On doing so you'll see the following document.

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,030
And this is the HTML source of the Web page.

38
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,910
So if we look at the top, we can see there is a symbol tag.

39
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,430
And if I go all the way to the bottom, you'll see there's a close in simple tag.

40
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:45,960
And inside those shell tags is an open in head tag and a in head tag and an open in body tag.

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,650
And a close in body take.

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,570
So this is the structure of the Web page.

43
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,570
So this is the actual hate mail itself.

44
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,090
If I close this and then press F12, it will open up the chrome developer tool.

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,300
So this panel here represents the document object model.

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,820
So this is a nodes and object representation of the web page.

47
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,990
If we look at the document object model and if I close down all these nodes here, you'll see that there's

48
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,110
an open in and close in h html tag similar to what I showed you when viewing the html source.

49
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,120
If I open up the head tags, you'll see there's an open in and close in head tag.

50
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,570
And if I do the same for the body, you'll see an open and close in body take.

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,470
And inside these tags are additional nested elements that we can see here, such as dips.

52
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:58,180
So when you view in a web page through a browser, you actually view in that web page through the document

53
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,070
object model.

54
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,720
So this is an important concept to understand.

55
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,220
Because when we use X path locators as our demonstrate in the next lecture, we're going to use the

56
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,860
document object model structure in order to focus on elements of our choosing.

57
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,880
So to prove to you that we use in the document object model, I want to write a command.

58
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,180
So this command is going to be written in the console.

59
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,260
And it's going to be written in JavaScript.

60
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,350
So before I write that, come on, I'm just going to get to select a tool and select bottom one.

61
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,220
So this command is going to be interactive with button one.

62
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,170
And you can see here is the HTML highlighted in the document object model.

63
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,420
So this command is going to focus on bottom one and it's going to remove it from the document object

64
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,840
model.

65
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,190
On doing so, the bottom will disappear from the web page.

66
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,790
So I'm going to write.

67
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,700
Var the variable.

68
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,270
My ob j said my object is going to equal.

69
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,680
Documents dot get elements by d.

70
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,300
And then in brackets and double quotes, I'm going to provide the idea of bottom one, which I know

71
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,710
is BTN underscore one.

72
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,550
And then a semicolon at the end of that line.

73
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,320
And then I'm going to move on to the second line and I'm going to write.

74
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,620
My O.B. j thought to remove.

75
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,720
Round brackets and a semicolon.

76
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:54,380
So before I press enter here, take note of the highlighted h html in the document object model and

77
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,970
also look at bottom one over here.

78
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,720
And you can see that that element has now been removed.

79
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,970
So this is how we have dynamic web pages on the Internet.

80
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,490
We're not actually changing the simple structure.

81
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:21,290
We're changing the document object model which is represented and what your view in through the browser.

82
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,220
So by writing that JavaScript command, I've actually removed that button and that button was removed

83
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,510
from the document object model for which we view in through the browser itself.

84
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,290
If I were to right click the web page and go to view page source.

85
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,620
You can see that.

86
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,150
But someone is still present.

87
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,220
So this proves that the hates HTML of the web page is not affected.

88
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,580
But it's not what we're actually viewing through the browser.

89
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:58,870
What we're viewing through the browser is the document object model representation of the web page,

90
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,600
which uses the HTML document.

91
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,000
So I hope that's given you a good overview of the document object model.

92
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's look at X Path locators in the next lecture.
