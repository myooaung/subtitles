00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.230
In this lecture, we take a look at the test energy enabled attributes.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.370
So what is the testing enabled attribute?

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.900
It's an attribute that can be used to prevent a method from executing.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.730
The method itself will skip when enabled is set to false.

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.880
There is more than one way to skip a test.

6
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.090
For example, we can exclude it from the test inject sample.

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.330
This option, however, provides convenience when we want to skip the methods to review the outcome

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.840
quickly.

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.340
The below image displays a method that has been given the enabled equals false attributes.

10
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.420
This method will now be skipped up on test execution.

11
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.680
So let's see an example.

12
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.010
In Eclipse.

13
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.290
I'm going to simply copy and paste the class from the last lecture call in this new one.

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.570
L 14 for lecture 14.

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.430
And I'm going to give it a name of enabled.

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.090
I'm then going to double click to open that class.

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.099
Well, you'll see the following code.

18
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.200
So for this test, I am going to remove the last test case.

19
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.740
Just leave in the enter email and enter password.

20
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.060
So I am going to set enabled equals false on this first enter email method.

21
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.580
And to do that, all I need to do is.

22
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.010
In brackets rights enabled.

23
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.200
Equals false.

24
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.250
Like so.

25
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.210
So if I save this class now and try executing it, I would expect this test not to run.

26
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.040
So let's give it a go.

27
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.870
So it's gone to lock in page.

28
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.330
And it's only entered a password.

29
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.820
So that has worked as expected.

30
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.740
And the reason for that is I've simply entered enabled equals false.

31
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.580
And I've set that flag in the test notation for that method.

32
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.780
Thank you for watching.
