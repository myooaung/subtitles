1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,970
So the good news is we only have three more page object classes to create before we can start writing

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,780
our tests.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,750
So as you're now familiar and comfortable with the approach that I'm using, I'm going to go through

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,200
these final free page objects in a faster speed.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,180
So we've just created one based on this page, and the next one we need to create will be based on the

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,140
addresses tab.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,600
So the only way we can access this tab is by filling in some dummy information here.

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,780
So I've selected Mr..

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,470
I'm going to test.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,190
Test and I'm going to provide an email address.

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,700
Now, you don't need to provide a password or date of birth, and these are optional fields.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:52,120
So what this will mean is if you do provide a password, it will save you account.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,440
So if you are returning customer, you can then sign into the website.

14
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,000
So I also need to take this agree to terms and conditions.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,290
An impressed continue.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,230
But the problem is here is I've used this email address before, so if I select continue, you'll see

17
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,120
this email is already used.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,200
Please choose another.

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,750
So I'm just going to use test one test dot com and then click continue.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,000
And then this will then move me on to the addresses section of the page.

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,190
So this is where I need to start capturing some information here.

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,850
So notice that the first name and last name has already been saved because we entered this in the previous

23
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,240
tab.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,560
So we need to get selectors for some of these fields.

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,130
So you could skip the optional ones as we do not need to provide values for these, but there are some

26
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,820
that are mandatory such as address city, state, etc..

27
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,870
So all I'm going to do here is get locaters for all these fields, including the checkbox and the button.

28
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,760
So I'm not going to show you these one by one, as we've seen a similar process before.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,240
But what I will do is show you how to create the class so that you have a consistent name to what I'm

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,690
using.

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,030
So I'm going to right click page objects, select new and select class.

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,490
And I'm going to give this a name of order form delivery.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,510
And then to finish.

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,990
So in this class, all I'll do is write very similar code to what you were saying before.

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
So I have this pre-written for which you could download.

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,640
So I'm going to copy that and I'm going to paste it here.

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,090
And there's errors because we need to import the classes.

38
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:03,650
And once that is done, we then have the locators which refer to these text boxes and dropdown menus.

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,360
Also the checkbox button and the continue button.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,940
And you can see this all listed here, but they've been named appropriately so you'll see that I've

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,740
added first name and last name here.

42
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,450
Which wasn't really required because it was predefined.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,620
But a customer may want to choose to change their first name or last name on this page.

44
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,230
So that's why I've added those two fields.

45
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,770
So please feel free to write this code manually.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,740
Otherwise you can download the code from this lecture.

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,480
Thank you for watching.
