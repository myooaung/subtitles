1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,260
In this lecture, I'm going to update the add remove item basket test.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,500
So our code company looks like the following.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,620
So the changes I need to make in this class are very similar to the changes I've made to the autocomplete

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,190
test.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,930
The first change is to delete the before and after test annotation code.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,370
The next change is to change.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,400
Extends base page to extends hooks.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,200
And I need to import that.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,050
I then need to delete the driver parameters as we no longer need this based on the changes we've made

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,810
to our page object classes.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,920
But there is one issue.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,740
So in this test, we've used a Web driver weight and this is an explicit weight.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,670
And the Webb type of weight is expected in a driver and a duration to be passed.

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,640
So if I went home, control my keyboard and open the declaration of Web Drive.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,090
Wait.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,400
Your see is expecting a driver to be passed and a time out in seconds.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,240
Now the problem we have with our code and because we've removed the driver instance from this class,

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,370
we cannot pass this.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,670
So we need to think of a different way of how we can provide the driver object and the duration.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,440
So a way we can do this is by adding a method for the web driver weight in our base page class.

21
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,250
So in my base page class, I'm going to scroll down to the bottom of my code and I'm going to make some

22
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,580
room.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,620
So I am going to write a new method here and it's going to be called public.

24
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,280
Static void.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,130
Wait for elements.

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,780
Invisible.

27
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,070
And this method is going to have to arguments.

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,840
It's going to sort of have a first parameter of web element elements and we have a comma.

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm going to provide a second parameter, which is going to be int timer.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,380
And then going to add a open and close embrace.

31
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,490
So I'll need to import web element from selenium.

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,580
And on doing so, the error will go away.

33
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,100
So in this method itself, I am going to define the web driver weights.

34
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:43,780
So I'm going to write Web Driver White and I'm going to give this object the name White equals new web

35
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,850
driver white.

36
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,490
And this is going to have to be arguments here.

37
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,720
So I am going to provide get driver, which is a method name followed by a comma.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,310
And here I'm simply going to pass the time, a parameter defined above.

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,260
And a semicolon at the end of it.

40
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,640
So our need to import web driver weight from selenium.

41
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,590
But you can see it as an error under the get driver method.

42
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,030
So if I hover over this, you'll see that it's got change.

43
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,680
Get driver to static.

44
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,730
And the reason this is happening is a mistake on my parts.

45
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,600
So if I go to the get driver method here, you'll see that it's not static when it should be.

46
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,580
So I'm going to correct that by adding the static to the get driver method.

47
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,580
You'll see that is still a never here, though.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,440
But this time, if I hover over, it is simply saying to add a froze declaration.

49
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,950
And when I do, that terror thing goes away.

50
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,800
So I'm going to explain what this method does in more detail once I finish writing it.

51
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,660
So I'm going to add one more line underneath this, and I'm going to write the following.

52
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,680
Wait.

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,550
So I'm using the white method to add to the white object that defined above.

54
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,430
Not until.

55
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,040
And in brackets expected conditions.

56
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,120
That invisibility of.

57
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:27,230
Which is a method name and I am simply going to pass this elements parameter here.

58
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,670
And at the end that line a semicolon.

59
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,120
So if this is confusing, don't worry.

60
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,350
And we did go over explicit ways in the weight section of this course.

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,730
But just to give you a further explanation here, all I'm doing is using a method in the base pace class

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,020
to take care of the weights that I need in my tests.

63
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,560
And this method takes two arguments, which is a web element and a timer.

64
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,810
So I'm using or defining a weight object here of web driver weight.

65
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:11,240
And if I hold control my keyboard and open the declaration of this particular web drive weight, you

66
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,360
will see this expect in a Web driver driver to be provided.

67
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,090
And a timeout in seconds.

68
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,490
So this is what I'm providing here because this set driver.

69
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:32,360
Uses this method here, and we know this method uses the web driver instance class that gets the driver

70
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,410
object.

71
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,610
And so that's what's been passed to this web tribe, white.

72
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:46,880
The second argument is the amount of time in seconds, an excuse in this parameter here to know what

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,780
time to wait.

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,220
So what I'm going to be doing now is I'm going to be using this method in my add remove item basket

75
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,790
test.

76
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:02,870
So I'm going to save this by space page class and I'm going to go back to my add the move item basket

77
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,350
test.

78
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,340
Now in here.

79
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,050
If I scroll down, you'll see this is the code to be amended.

80
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:17,070
So I am going to delete these two lines and instead I'm going to use that new method I've just created.

81
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,100
So here I'm going to simply go to the base page and copy this method.

82
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,150
And I'm going to paste it like so.

83
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,250
So this method needs a bracket here and it takes two arguments.

84
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,420
So I'm just going to place x, comma x here for now.

85
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,320
Because it's good to recap on what we're trying to do here.

86
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,570
So and this part, the test, we would be at the following stage.

87
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,350
So we'll be on the shopping cart page.

88
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,520
And what we want to do is we want to delete this item.

89
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,760
But we need to wait for this item to be deleted before we take the total price.

90
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,940
And you'll be able to know that by going through this code to see what exactly we do in up to this point.

91
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,510
So I'm waiting for the element to go invisible.

92
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,480
So for this element here, it's going to be.

93
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,000
Before we check on that price.

94
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,180
This is why I'm using explicit white.

95
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,950
So in my code for this first argument, I need to provide based on the method and elements.

96
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:34,680
So I'm waiting for the second item in the cart to be deleted.

97
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,980
And if we remember or if we look above, you can see that I'm using can't get the lead item to click.

98
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:50,540
So I've already defined a cart object here which is based on the shopping cart page object class and

99
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:58,610
I've used that cart object to get the lead item to which is finding the locator for that item to test

100
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,450
to be deleted.

101
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:08,680
So I am simply going to copy cards and get delete item two and paisa as the first argument.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,200
So that's simply using the cart object and it's getting the locator for the element that would delete

103
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,070
item to.

104
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,880
In his second argument.

105
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:28,230
I need to provide the weight, so I'm going to simply define a value of ten for 10 seconds.

106
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,730
And then all I need to do at the end of this line is add a semicolon.

107
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:39,909
And you'll see like the previous or the complete test that there's a number of errors here.

108
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,780
And this is because I simply need to add a froze declaration.

109
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,010
And on doing so.

110
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,920
We should see that those errors go away.

111
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,360
So this seems like a bit of a bug in eclipse if I save this.

112
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,420
You'll see those areas have all gone.

113
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,340
So I have now used a method from my base page to handle the explicit white.

114
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,950
And based on that method, it requires two arguments a web element and a timer.

115
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,070
And that's why it when I defined it in my test.

116
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,670
I provided the carts that get the leads.

117
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,930
Item two, which will get the locator for this here.

118
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,990
And ten is the duration in seconds.

119
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,610
The wait is to wait.

120
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,570
So this is good because it's flexible.

121
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,200
So if I ever need a similar weight in another test, all I need to do now is use this method again.

122
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,480
So this is all the changes that they needed to make in this class.

123
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,840
So I'm going to save it and I'm going to close it.

124
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,410
And those are all the changes we've acquired in our framework.

125
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,850
So in the next lecture, I'm going to try running our tests.
