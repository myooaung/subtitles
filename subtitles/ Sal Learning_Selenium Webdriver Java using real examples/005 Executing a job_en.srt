1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,910
So in this lecture, we're going to run our first job.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,820
So if I go back to the dashboard, you'll see that there is a new row here.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,240
And this is the name of the first job that we've just created.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,320
Good job one.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,860
If I select the name of Job one, it will take me to the job one page and I have a number of options

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,100
here.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,360
So I'm going to try run in my job one by selecting this build now button when doing so.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,820
We should see a new rather appear here on the build history, which is number one as it's the first

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,930
time we've done in this job.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,720
And if you look over here, you'll see two bounces just opened up and they run in my tests.

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,560
So again, we're using parallel execution.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,050
So it's running two tests at the same time.

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,720
So let's just wait for this to complete.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,580
So now let's complete it.

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,140
Sometimes Jenkins gets stuck, say a few refreshed page.

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,370
Your seat is being updated, but it has a red x.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,630
So that rate X is expected.

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,900
And that's because one of my tests purposely fails.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,010
So if I select that hash one.

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,960
It will take you to the following page.

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,160
Well, we've got an option for console output.

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,160
If I select that this is similar to the console that we have in Eclipse.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,210
So if I scroll down, we should see that two tests have run, but one failed.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,480
And if we look further, we can see that it failed because of an assertion error.

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,370
We're expected a $45.23 to be provided, but found 4524.

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,000
So to add remove item basket test found as we would expect it to.

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,070
So that's how we run.

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,540
We can run our first job.

29
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,460
So the good thing about Jenkins is that if you do ever come across Evans, all you need to do is select

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,600
this build history.

31
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,710
So this is number one because it is our first time running a job.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,220
But if I was to build again, you'll see the second one has now appeared, and that would do exactly

33
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,170
the same as what we just did last time.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,930
But for each of these instances, we can then review the console output.

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,920
So if you do come across any other errors, it will be a matter of reviewing the console output to try

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,630
and understand why it failed.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,880
Another useful thing is that if we click on the job again, we can look at the report output.

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,450
So if we go back to the council output.

39
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,570
And scroll down, you'll see that we should have a location where we can look at the report that has

40
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,530
been generated.

41
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,270
And this is found here.

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:07,110
So it's saying if we go to the Jenkins live project, one Target or Fry Reports voter, we should find

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,790
that report.

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,800
So let's take a look at that.

45
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,960
So I'm going to go to that location.

46
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,340
So.

47
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,680
Jenkins like project one.

48
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,360
If I go to test output, you'll see an index file.

49
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,860
If I double click that.

50
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:32,140
You'll see that there is a report here which is showing that my test has failed and one has passed.

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,960
And reasons why that failure occurred.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,660
So that's how we can run our jobs in Jenkins.

53
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,690
Thank you for watching.
