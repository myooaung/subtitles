1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,370
So let's continue building this test.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,610
So so far we've gone to the home page of the automation test and website and click the test or link.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,200
On the test or home page.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,540
We then selected product one, the next page.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,540
The report two is this page here, and this is the shop product page.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:28,640
And we have built a class which contains a locators and methods that would trade those locator values.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,950
So on this page, I want to change a size to medium.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,220
I want to increase increase the quantity to two.

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,430
And I want to add the items to my cart.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,960
So I am going to create a new object using the shop product page.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,930
I'm going to call the object shock product.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,430
And it's going to simply equal a new shot product page in the brackets.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to pass the driver object and I'm going to add a semicolon at the end.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,590
So I need to import this into this particular class.

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,650
On doing so, the error goes away.

16
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,100
So remember, the first element we want to interact with is a dropdown menu.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,400
And if you remember back to earlier in the course, I taught you how we interact with these type of

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,030
elements.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,090
We need to use the select clause.

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,840
And we do this by writing Select the Capital S.

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,630
And I'm going to call it option.

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,430
And it's going to equal new.

23
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,770
Select.

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,470
And in the brackets, we need to provide a locator.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,720
So if a hover over, select an import it.

26
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,770
That ever goes away.

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,220
But there's still an error on his second part.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,880
So what I'm going to do here is use this shop prod object.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
And then I'm going to call a method to get that locator.

30
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,210
So if we look at it, we have an option to get size option.

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,890
And all that will do is it will retrieve the value of size option which contains this locator here.

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,410
So by doing that I can then use the option object and I can call it a number of different methods on

33
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:31,560
it.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,740
So I am going to use a method of select by visible text.

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,970
And then by doing so inside the brackets and inside double quotes, I can simply pass the value to I

36
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,310
want to select, which is m for medium.

37
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,530
So that should select the sites.

38
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,820
So the next thing I need to do is increase the quantity.

39
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,900
So I want to buy two items to do this.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,290
I'm going to use the shop prod object.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,880
And I am going to add a dot.

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,340
Oops I spun out wrong.

43
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:17,270
So shop prod and if I add a dot I have access to a number of methods and I'm going to look for one called

44
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,130
get quant increase.

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,630
So this will find the increased quantity button.

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,830
And what I'd like to do as a user is click it, which will increase it from 1 to 2.

47
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,490
The next thing I'd like to do is add those items to my basket.

48
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,190
So again, I'm going to use the shop object dot to get.

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,350
And I am looking for add to cart button.

50
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,040
And again, I need to click this.

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,600
So I am going to demonstrate this test up to this point.

52
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:04,360
So before I do, just for demonstration purposes, I'm going to add afraid dot sleep to slow down the

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,150
tests so you can see what values have been selected and I'll delete this once I have run the test.

54
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,570
So I'm going to say this.

55
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,250
And I'm going to right click all the complete test and run it as a test in G test.

56
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,899
So let's see what happens.

57
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,900
And you can see that all the values that I wanted to select happened and added to and items to the basket.

58
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,050
So if I go back to the website, we can see that this is the next page we need to interact with.

59
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,460
So if I look at my page objects, we know that we have a page object we can use, which is shop content

60
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,940
panel.

61
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:59,520
And if we look at this is simply contains two locators and two methods to access those locators.

62
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,640
So in my mind test, I am going to create a new object on that shop content panel.

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,410
So I'm going to write Shop Content Panel.

64
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:23,530
And I'm going to call this see panel equals new shop content panel and I'm going to pass the driver

65
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,130
object.

66
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,330
And if I hover over an important that terror then goes away.

67
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,700
So I am going to make a little bit of room here so you can see what I'm doing.

68
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,390
So I need to simply select.

69
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,650
Proceed to check out.

70
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,830
So if I use that new object, see panel thoughts get used to.

71
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,770
I have got a method called get checkout button and all I need to do is click it.

72
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,750
By doing so.

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,330
This should then bring us to the fore page.

74
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,380
And so this is the shopping cart page.

75
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:11,250
So what I want to do here is select, have a promo code link which will then open a checkbox and a button.

76
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,560
I then want to pass a promo code of 20 off and then I want to select the add button which should deduct

77
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,750
20% from the total price.

78
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,940
Once that is done and then want to select the proceed to check out button.

79
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,960
So if I go back to clips and look at my page objects, see what one I can use.

80
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,980
So I have here.

81
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,050
Shopping cart dot java.

82
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,720
And if openness you see that as various selectors, I have methods to access these selectors.

83
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,200
So have promo code, for example, will select the promo code link.

84
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,180
So I am going to go back to my main test and I'm going to create a new object using shopping cart.

85
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,860
So I'm going to write shopping carts.

86
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,350
I'm going to give it a name of cart equals new shopping.

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,100
Can't.

88
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,600
And I'm going to pass the driver.

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,800
And again, only two important.

90
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,870
And those errors wouldn't go away.

91
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,380
So the first thing I need to do is select this, have a promo code link.

92
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,510
So I'm going to use the cart object along use dot get.

93
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,430
And I have a method here called get have promo.

94
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,790
And I'll need to click that link.

95
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,720
Amendments.

96
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,490
Use that cart object again.

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,100
And this time if a right gets.

98
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,810
I can see that I have a method to get promoted.

99
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,590
TextBox.

100
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,650
So this will get the locator for the textbox.

101
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,340
But as this is a textbox, I need to send the value.

102
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,530
So I'm going to use the send keys method and there is a promo code on the store that you can use to

103
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,630
20 off.

104
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,250
And that would deduct 20% off the price.

105
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,020
The next thing after entering that value is I need to click.

106
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,640
The ad promo button.

107
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,220
So I am going to use cards again.

108
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,770
Don't get.

109
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,179
And I have a method here of promo add button.

110
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,140
And I need to click this button.

111
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,059
So that should handle again ten of the promo code.

112
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,810
So the next thing I'd need to do is select.

113
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,980
Proceed to check out.

114
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,360
So again, using the cart.

115
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,570
Object don't get.

116
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,860
You see, I have a method of get proceed checkout button.

117
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,210
And all I need to do here.

118
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,370
Is cricket.

119
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,480
So I am going to add another friend dot sleep before I click that button just so you can see the test

120
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,440
run in.

121
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,000
So I am now going to save this again and try running it to see what happens.

122
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,240
So it looks like we have an issue here.

123
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,980
So if we go back to Eclipse.

124
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,170
And scroll up.

125
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,390
We can see that we've got an error.

126
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,530
If I scroll down to the bottom, actually, you'll see that there's one failure.

127
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,800
So if I scroll up, you'll see the details of this error.

128
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,930
So it says that, well, it seems to be implying something wrong with this.

129
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,940
Proceed to check out locator.

130
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,800
And it says at the top here, no such element.

131
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,480
Unable to locate element.

132
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,840
Method selector proceed to check out.

133
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,870
So this occurred on the shop content panel page.

134
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:29,650
So if I open up the shop content panel page object class, you'll see that it contains two locators.

135
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,430
So this is the one that the ERA is complaining about.

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,180
So this is good that this occurred because this happens regularly when we construct tests.

137
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,700
Very rarely do we get locators that work perfectly on the first time.

138
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,710
So I'm going to go to the shopping content panel page.

139
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,280
So if I go back one.

140
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,300
And can't.

141
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,040
So if I go back.

142
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,790
And.

143
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
Add another product.

144
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,670
This is the pages complaining about and unable to locate this.

145
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,230
Proceed to check out button.

146
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,480
So if I click it and inspect it.

147
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,440
And go to Ragnarok philosophy.

148
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,510
So this is the elements that I said we didn't need the question mark like them.

149
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,190
So it's possible that we do need this.

150
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,870
So I'm going to try copying that again and going back to Eclipse.

151
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,740
And pasted that value again in these shop content panel class.

152
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,680
So all you concede I've done is added that question mark like on.

153
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,490
So if I save this page object now.

154
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,300
And go back to my test.

155
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,160
Let me try running it again to see if we can proceed further.

156
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,550
And you can see that time it was selected.

157
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,850
So that confirms that the issue was to do with the locator.

158
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:24,670
And the good thing is using this page object is that by simply updating the locator in the shop content

159
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,770
panel page object class.

160
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,220
My taste didn't need to be amended.

161
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:38,620
And that's because we are using methods that belong to the shop content panel page object to retrieve

162
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,000
this locator.

163
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:47,720
So if we came across a similar issue where we had a number of different test classes and we find that

164
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,000
one of the locators had change, for example.

165
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:58,590
All it would would require us to do is find the page object class and simply update the locator.

166
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,120
And that change will be inherited by all of our test classes.

167
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,050
So this is the beauty of the page object model.

168
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,900
So our test seems to be working as expected now.

169
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,140
And if I go back.

170
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,610
And click proceed to check out.

171
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,540
If I delete this item added.

172
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,030
So we only have the two remaining.

173
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,560
So if I replicate AD in a promo code.

174
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,670
And then proceed to check out.

175
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,860
We then reach the following page.

176
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,490
So this is where we enter our personal information.

177
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:45,390
So I am going to stop this video here and we'll continue with developing this test in the next lecture.
