00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,540
In this lecture, we take a look at explicit ways.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,040
So the below process flow tries to explain how explicit whites work.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,990
And if we start here.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:22,060
First thing we do is we initialize an object using the web driver white class, and that object takes

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,170
two arguments.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,730
The first is the driver instance, and the second is the time out duration, such as whites up to 10

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,270
seconds.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,420
We then use the object to set an expected condition.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,180
And that expected condition could be a number of things because there's a number of expected conditions

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,960
we can use.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,550
But an example of one is visibility of all elements located.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,330
And what that means is that condition will check to see if an element is available on the page.

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,380
The test then starts and the browser navigates to the page and the page begins to load.

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,040
The test, then searches for the element using the locator and then it checks to see if the expected

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,270
condition is mate's.

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:19,030
If it's not, then it checks to see if the time out duration has expired and if it has it when the test

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,750
am from an error.

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,450
But if it hasn't, it'll once again go through the loop to see if the condition has been met.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,040
If the condition has been met, then the test proceeds.

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:42,630
So when used in explicit ways, we must import the following expected conditions and web driver weights.

21
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,180
We must then initialize a web, a weight object and an example below.

22
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,710
Of course, this object weights.

23
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:59,160
And I provided to arguments the driver instant and the amount of time I want the white to white, which

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,720
is 20 seconds in this case.

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,830
So if I use an explicit white command.

26
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,130
The Web driver is instructed to wait until a condition is met before proceeding to execute the code.

27
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:22,610
Web Java White by default calls expect the condition every 500 milliseconds until it returns successfully.

28
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,020
Sex and explicit whites is important when our case is where certain elements take more time to load

29
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:38,490
and others in order to declare explicit whites, one has to use expected conditions.

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,230
And some example of these expected conditions are below.

31
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,680
So we have elements to be clickable, elements be selected, visibility of and so on.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,970
But you'll find in the real world you probably only use a handful of the same type of expected conditions.

33
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:07,690
So that below code creates a new web tribal white object called white and sets two parameters the driver

34
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,110
object and a time out time of 20 seconds.

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,920
We then set the expected conditions of the weight to use, of visibility, of element located methods

36
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,320
and provide a locator to a button.

37
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,970
If the button is found, then the test will proceed to try and click that button.

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,370
So let's see this in action.

39
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,060
So the scenario that I'm going to use in this demo is exactly the same as last lecture, where we're

40
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,530
going to wait for the loader to finish loading before trying to click on the button.

41
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:51,490
So I'm going to go straight to Eclipse and I'm going to simply copy and paste the class in the last

42
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:58,000
lecture, but I'm going to call this l04 and I'm going to give it a name of explicit

43
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,580
white like so, and then click okay.

44
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,030
I'm then going to double click on that class and I'm going to remove the implicit white code from last

45
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,540
lecture.

46
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,780
Like so.

47
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,810
So we know that we need to use the whites before we try clicking on that button.

48
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,550
And so I'm going to show you how we can use an explicit white.

49
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:35,640
So the first thing I need to use is web driver wise and I need to give a object name.

50
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,120
So I'm going to call it white equals new.

51
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,020
WEBVTT Driver White and in brackets.

52
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,320
So this takes two arguments.

53
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,220
The first is the driver instance, which is this here

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,020
and then following a comma.

55
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,840
The next value is the duration of the time out, so the maximum weight.

56
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,870
So I'm going to set this as ten for 10 seconds.

57
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,970
So as you can see, Webb drive a has an error.

58
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,430
And the reason for that is we need to import it.

59
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,340
So if you hover over it, you should see web drive a whites import option and if we click it.

60
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,110
That area now goes away.

61
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,630
The next thing we're going to do is now use this white object.

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:36,320
So if I write white an adult, you'll see that I'm being given some options and I'm going to select

63
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,010
until.

64
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:50,340
And then within those brackets of until if I use expected with a capital A and in conditions if I follow

65
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,030
that with a full stop, you'll see I have access to a number of methods and expect the condition I'm

66
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:04,080
going to use is this and I'm going to select the one of visibility of element located.

67
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,330
So if I select that one.

68
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,370
The following should show.

69
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,120
Now what this will take is the selective value, the locator value.

70
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,310
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to simply copy this from below.

71
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,100
So this is going to locate the button.

72
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,950
So I'm going to copy it and replace now with that value.

73
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,150
And at the end of that line, just need a semicolon.

74
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,430
So I think I have one too many brackets.

75
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,710
I'm going to delete one and you'll see that error goes away.

76
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,210
So what we're doing here is we're using Web driver weights and creating an object where we where we're

77
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,040
providing the driver instant.

78
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:02,170
And also set in a time, maximum time of 10 seconds where they're using this object here.

79
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,880
Using you two until and then we use and expect the conditions and there are a number of different expected

80
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
conditions that we can choose from.

81
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,390
But a common one that's often used is visibility of element locate it.

82
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,020
So that's going to check the visibility of the element and it's going to be checking the visibility

83
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,170
of the element that we provide the locator for, which is the button in this case.

84
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,060
And then what is going to do is going to check for that condition.

85
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,010
And if that condition condition has been met, it will then move on to this line here.

86
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,620
So let's save this now and give it a try it.

87
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,300
And you can see that button was clicked.

88
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,770
And if I go back to Eclipse, you'll see there's no error here.

89
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,970
So you might be asking yourself, what's the difference?

90
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,560
And why do we need to use a explicit white over an implicit white?

91
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,740
And the reason for that is and this is the key difference is explicit ways are set against each locate

92
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,320
each element rather than global.

93
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,610
So for example, I could have two different elements on a web page.

94
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,990
Well, I know one of them might take 15 seconds to load where a second one might may only take 5 seconds

95
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,470
to load.

96
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:50,130
If we set an implicit weight of 15 seconds to account for the maximum white time of that of one of those

97
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:57,420
elements, then it means that all elements will have up to 15 seconds to load up.

98
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,620
And that might be a problem in a test because if there are multiple elements taking longer, so up to

99
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,950
15 seconds when they should take less time, such as 5 seconds, the test is not going to pick that

100
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,310
up because there's going to be a window of up to 15 seconds for it to load on every single element within

101
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,880
the test.

102
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,640
We've explicit, explicit whites.

103
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,510
We set the whites for the individual element itself.

104
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,770
So, for example, I can set this one here to wait 10 seconds, and if I've got another element which

105
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,230
takes 5 seconds, then I can use another explicit white for that particular element.

106
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:48,580
That's an important detail to remember, and that's why explicit ways are far more common than any other

107
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,990
type of weight in selenium.

108
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,500
So I hope you found this lecture useful.

109
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,580
And in the next lecture, we'd start looking at fluent whites.
