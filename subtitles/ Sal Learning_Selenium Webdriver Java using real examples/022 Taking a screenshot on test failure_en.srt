1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,030
In this lecture, we're going to learn how to take screenshots when one of our test failures.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,590
I'm going to do this using listeners.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,210
And earlier in the course I covered the eye test list, the interface.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,720
So this is what we're going to use in our framework.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,280
Under my resources package, I'm going to right click select new in select class and I'm going to give

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,570
this class a name of listeners like so.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,440
So this class needs to extends the base page and it needs to implement.

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,520
The owner test listener interface.

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,700
If I hover over the base page, you'll see that I'm given an option to import it.

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,350
Before hovered over the eye test listener.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,840
You'll see there isn't an exact match.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,270
The reason for this is that this class can't find the test engine dependency.

13
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:11,140
And if I open up my -- file and find the test in g dependency, you'll see the scope has been defined.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,580
So this was brought across when I copied this dependency over.

15
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,620
So we don't really need this scope dependency.

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,900
So I'm going to simply delete it.

17
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,950
And if I save this file.

18
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,860
And then go back to the listener's class.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,060
You'll see that now I'm given the option to import it, meaning the class can now find testing.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,750
So you can see there's an error on the underneath listeners.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,990
And if I hover over this, you'll see that I need to add the constructor because we use in the base

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,530
page.

23
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,890
So the next thing that I'm going to do is use a method that belongs to the I test list, the interface.

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,610
If I hold down, control my keyboard and select my test listener, you'll see the number of methods

25
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,110
that we have available.

26
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:11,110
So I'm interested in this on test failure because when a test fails, this is when this method will

27
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,710
be triggered.

28
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,710
So I'm going to copy this and I'm going to paste it into my class like so.

29
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,060
But I'm going to change default to public.

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,510
So the next thing I'm going to do is use a try a catch statement like so.

31
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,820
So China is what's going to be tried first when this effort is called.

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,620
So I'm going to it here.

33
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,580
Take.

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,730
Snap shots, which is a method that belongs to the base page.

35
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,510
And in the brackets, I'm going to use this result.

36
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,280
Which is the test result of the test that cause the method.

37
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,900
So it makes sense in a moment once I show you so I'm going to use results.

38
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,250
Dots get and is a method to get the name.

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,740
You can see, though, once I've added a semicolon, that is an error here.

40
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,990
And it says Change Method Takes Snapshot Web Driver to string.

41
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,690
So if I open up my base page and look at a take snapshot method, I've actually made an error here.

42
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,380
So I've used web driver.

43
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,280
Web driver here.

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,190
Really, what I should be using is a string.

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,090
So I'm going to changes to string and I'm going to change.

46
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,260
Web driver to name.

47
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,360
And here I'm going to change Webb driver to driver like so.

48
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,800
Once done, there should be no errors.

49
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,690
So I'm going to save my base page.

50
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,450
And I'm going to go back to my listeners class and you'll see that that era has now gone away.

51
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,080
So because we call in take snapshot.

52
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,820
Which is this MiFID here.

53
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,970
It's now expected in a string to be passed.

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
And this is why I am using result.

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,370
They'll get name.

56
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,760
So result is quite simply the test.

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,220
Result of the test that's been executed.

58
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:28,420
So if a test failure was to occur, this test result will contain the test that's currently being processed.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,770
I then use this result to get the name and that will get the name of the test.

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,710
The next thing that I'm going to do is once I've done that is I'm going to use a catch.

61
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:53,180
And in brackets, I'm going to use exception eight and in the open and close embrace and I'm going to

62
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,330
use a dot print stack trace.

63
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,720
So that's.

64
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,700
Is this list not completed?

65
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,620
So I'm going to save it.

66
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,740
And I'm going to close these classes.

67
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,400
So we need to do one more thing.

68
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,140
So for every class that uses the high test listener, we need to define its listener in each of those

69
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,190
test classes.

70
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:29,480
So if I open up and remove item basket test, we add this line after the imports.

71
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,340
And what you need to add is that listeners.

72
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,870
And then brackets.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,930
And then this will be the location of where the follow is.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,420
So it's in my resources folder.

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,380
And then I need to do a full stop.

76
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,470
And then listeners like so and at the end of that thought class.

77
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,770
So you'll see it as an error on the listeners.

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,700
And then I've got an option to import this from Test G.

79
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:15,980
So all I need to do now is save this class and I'm actually going to do the same and copy this line

80
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,470
in the order complete test so that this class also uses the list, this class.

81
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,630
And I'll say that also like so.

82
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,290
So we've done pretty much everything that we need to do is by adding this line, we're saying that we

83
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,070
want this class to use this list, this class.

84
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,330
So when this test is run in.

85
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,000
And if a failure was to occur, this on test failure method would be triggered.

86
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,470
And that particular test result will be stored in this parameter here.

87
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:01,190
We then trying to take a snapshot by using the method from the base page and we use in this result here

88
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,630
to get the name of the test, which is typically the name of the method.

89
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,220
So once this has been triggered, it will use this method from the base page.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,960
And the Take Snapshot method simply takes a screenshot.

91
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:25,710
And it stores it in a destination phone location, which is going to be the screenshots folder here.

92
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,930
So what we need to do is we need to make sure one of our test fails.

93
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,170
So in this ad remove item basket.

94
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,870
You may remember that we use an assertion.

95
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,970
So remember, the test itself should find a value of $45.24.

96
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,610
But by changing this to 4523, it should result in the test failing.

97
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,830
And that's when the listener should trigger the test failure method.

98
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,060
So if I was to say this class.

99
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,250
And now try running it.

100
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,230
Let's see what happens.

101
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,500
So we can see in the console that a failure has been reported.

102
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,090
If I scroll up.

103
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,420
It says the expected amount doesn't match the actual amount.

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,330
So if we look at my screenshots folder, you'll see there's no files listed.

105
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,700
So what we need to do is right click the project and click refresh.

106
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,850
On doing so.

107
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,159
The PNG file has now appeared.

108
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,160
If I right click this and go to properties.

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,270
Name.

110
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:47,700
Copy.

111
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,620
Location.

112
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,100
Path.

113
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,060
And open up a browser and pace value.

114
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,410
You'll see the screenshot.

115
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,150
And notice where the screenshot was taken.

116
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,560
It was taken at the point of the test where the failure was identified.

117
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:14,230
So because in the test I change your assertion to search and look for 4523 because a match was not found

118
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,050
and 4524 was found instead.

119
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,120
It failed the test and this is when the screenshot is taken.

120
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,690
So that's his.

121
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,740
The test proven that screenshot has been taken.

122
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,020
Thanks to the listeners.

123
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,000
So I hope you have found this useful.

124
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,100
And thank you for watching.
