1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.590
So in Eclipse, I am going to copy the last class and paste it.

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.630
And call this new class l06 for lecture six.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
I'm going to give it the name of eye frames and click.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.340
Okay.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.730
And then going to double click that class and I am going to delete all the code up to the driver dot

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.570
gets method.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.330
So the first thing I need to do is update the address.

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.550
So I am going to get the euro to the iframes age and I am going to place that like so.

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.740
So now selenium will go to this particular web page and I want to interact with this first iframe.

10
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.430
So the tests that I would like to do simply to begin with is to just click on this toggle menu button

11
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.000
like so.

12
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.860
To do that.

13
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.710
I'm going to go to Eclipse and I'm going to write driver thoughts switch to.

14
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.390
Dot frame.

15
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.150
And you can see there's a number of methods there.

16
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.430
So the two most commonly used is frame with iNts as a parameter.

17
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.100
And what this does is it takes a index value of the iframe or the string name of the frame itself.

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.350
So each frame has a unique IP.

19
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.790
So I'm going to use the first one.

20
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.920
So I'm going to be using index values.

21
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.870
So I'm going to click that and you can see the default value is zero.

22
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:45.580
So to explain how the iframe index him works on a web page as this is the first iframe on the page is

23
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.200
an index value of zero.

24
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.480
As this is the second frame, it's got an index value of one.

25
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.550
And if there was another one, then that next one would have an index value of two.

26
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.039
So this selenium code will switch the selenium driver focus to wireframe with an index value of zero.

27
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.790
So next, if I go back to the Web page, I'm going to right click and inspect.

28
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.400
And within this actual airframe itself, I'm going to get the selector tool.

29
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.130
Focus within the frame and click on the manual toggle button.

30
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.060
And you can see in the DOM is highlighted a section.

31
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.990
And if we look up and keep following it upwards, we will see that there's an iframe tag.

32
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.230
So that selector tool has just found a element within the iframe.

33
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.520
And if I look at runner ox velocity.

34
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.310
You can see that there's some options here.

35
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.940
Some selectors I can use.

36
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.600
So I'm simply going to take that second one and I'm going to copy it.

37
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.620
And back in eclipse I'm going to write driver dots find elements by CSF selector in the double quotes.

38
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.060
I'm going to place that value and I'm going to simply use the click command like so.

39
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.220
So now I'm going to save this class and try running it.

40
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.170
And notice it just interacted with the menu toggle within the frame itself.

41
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.900
Now, if I wanted to go back to the main web page, I would need to use a command such as driver dot,

42
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.450
switch to dot.

43
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.200
And if we look through here, we can see that there is an option for payment frame.

44
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.240
So if I select that.

45
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.470
It was semi-colon at the end and then copy that code.

46
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.940
Because remember.

47
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.610
The iFrame is a copy of the actual automation test and web page, so that selector will also exist here.

48
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.250
Policeman, you toggle button.

49
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.030
So if I go back to the code and try running this again.

50
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.270
Let's see what happens.

51
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.720
So it happened really quickly.

52
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.400
But what happened there was that the selenium a focus shifted to this first iframe and click this menu

53
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.910
icon.

54
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.370
It then switched back out to the parents eye frame, which is the main web page, and then clicked on

55
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.820
it here.

56
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.990
So we switched in and then switched out, and that was all done by the simple code.

57
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.720
Now.

58
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.970
How about if I wanted to interact?

59
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.250
With this I frame.

60
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.370
How about if I wanted to press the play button?

61
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.490
So remember what I said, and that is that we need to switch focus using the index value.

62
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.400
So this is the index for the first time frame.

63
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.580
So I need to now switch to.

64
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.450
The iFrame with an index value of one.

65
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:40.820
So I'm going to write driver dot switch to frame and pass the value of one.

66
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.020
I need to find a locator for this play button.

67
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.960
So I'm going to right click and inspect the page.

68
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.480
I'm going to get to select the tool.

69
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.150
And I'm going to focus on that button and click it.

70
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.100
And if I go to random philosophy.

71
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.820
I am going to take this second.

72
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.030
Let me just select it again because I don't think I've selected it.

73
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.330
Right.

74
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.530
Let me just open.

75
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.370
It's a little bit wider.

76
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.000
There we go.

77
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.940
So I am going to take the second CSC locator and copy it.

78
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.570
I'm going to go back to Eclipse and I'm going to write driver dot find elements by set a selector.

79
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.530
Pace that value and use the click command.

80
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.850
So I am going to slow this test down so we can see it better.

81
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.350
So I am going to add a friend.

82
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.340
Don't sleep here.

83
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.490
Of 2 seconds.

84
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.140
And I'm also going to add another one.

85
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.660
Just after this line.

86
00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.990
And you can see those errors.

87
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.350
And the reason for that is I need to add a froze declaration like so.

88
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.750
So I'm going to save this now and try running it.

89
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.510
And let's see what happens.

90
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.630
So it's interactive.

91
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.540
The first time frame when back to the main page.

92
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.450
And then it clicked the play button on the second frame.

93
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:37.070
So we was able to do that by using the switch to method and then using the frame method a pass in an

94
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.110
index value.

95
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.150
So just to quickly run through the code again, we go to the iframe web page.

96
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:52.210
We use drive a dot switch to dot frame and that frame is the index value of the first iframe on the

97
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.740
web page on an interact with an element within that iframe.

98
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:05.560
I then use driver dot switch to have a frame and that will take you to the main eye frame, which is

99
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.320
my automation testing web page.

100
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.180
I then interact with the toggle menu button of the main page.

101
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:22.750
I then use driver dot switched to again, but this time for the free method I pass the index value of

102
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:28.180
one and the youtube video is has an index value of one.

103
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.260
And then I interact with the play button and click it.

104
00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:39.200
So I hope that was a good introduction to life frames and you've learned how to handle them.

105
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.210
Thank you for watching.
