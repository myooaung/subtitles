1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.210
So continuing on from last lecture, the next thing I need to do now is find a locator.

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.860
Ford is from Tex Filled.

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.980
So I'm going to right click and inspect it.

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.630
And if I move this over for now.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.890
So if I get to select a tool and click on that field.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.940
And then go to a rocket velocity.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.690
You'll see that I've been given some options here.

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.930
So I am going to simply take the CCS one at the top.

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.750
And go back to the clips and right driver they'll find element by selector.

10
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.950
And provide the value.

11
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.920
So I also need to send the value of London to that field.

12
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.210
So I am going to do it.

13
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.040
Don't send keys.

14
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.280
And in double quotes, I'm going to write London like so.

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.489
So this should take us to this website and it should end to London like so where we would have a number

16
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.870
of results returned to us.

17
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.440
So the next thing I need to do here is I need to store all these values in a collection.

18
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.690
And I'm going to do that by using a list.

19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.510
So if I go back to Eclipse.

20
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.290
So I am going to write a list and I have pointy brackets.

21
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.840
I'm going to define the data type.

22
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.930
The list is going to school.

23
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.560
So web elements without.

24
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.710
Yes, so and I'm going to call this origins equals driver.

25
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.440
Dot find elements with an S at the end.

26
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.750
By.

27
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.470
CSA selector.

28
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.990
I need to provide the values in those quotes.

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.830
And I'm just going to leave a semicolon at the end.

30
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.960
So you can see I need to import less from java util so make sure to pick the java util one.

31
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.060
And I also need to import the web element from selenium.

32
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.120
And those errors will go away.

33
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.270
So at this point here, I now need to go back to the website to try and find a common locator for all

34
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.980
the results that appear in that list.

35
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.280
So I've closed that Web page.

36
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.840
Let me just open it up again quickly.

37
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.160
Okay.

38
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.820
So if I right London here, you'll see that there's a number of results.

39
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.780
So I need to find a locator that will return all these results that appear when I type London in the

40
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.410
text field.

41
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.440
So I am going to right click one of these results and then click Inspect.

42
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.500
And then what you'll find if I open it a little bit wider.

43
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.180
So you can see that is highlighted country, United Kingdom.

44
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.750
So if I get to select the talk, well, if I type in London again.

45
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.190
And if I hover over these, look at the noise.

46
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.750
They are being highlighted.

47
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.050
So that means these elements are within these particular tanks.

48
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.490
So if I expand one.

49
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.330
You'll see that there is an IP tag inside it and if I expand it again, you'll see it as a span tag.

50
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.790
And if I expand the span tag, you'll see London Gatwick.

51
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.350
So that's one of the results.

52
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.940
So you may notice that there is strong tags here which is surrounded in when all this means is that

53
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.770
the value of a loan will appear bold in the results.

54
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.910
But when it's actually displayed on the web page, London would be one word.

55
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:59.300
So now that I know the structure of the results, I need to find a locator that I can use to try and

56
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.900
retrieve all these values to install them in my list.

57
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.940
So what we can do here is that we can write a custom CC locator.

58
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.570
So if I open up runner ups velocity.

59
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.970
So I need to open this panel here.

60
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.620
And openness.

61
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.060
Why that?

62
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.320
Just so we got a better view.

63
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.510
So how I recommend approaching something like this is to first find the first tags structure tag.

64
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.750
So ignoring strong you'll see that this spend tax here.

65
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.830
So I'm going to write Spanish like so.

66
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.240
Then I'm going to look at the parents of this band take.

67
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.650
So the parent of span.

68
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.180
So if I collapse, suspend sake.

69
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.390
You'll see that span is inside and I'll take.

70
00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:01.740
So I'm going to write a book and to write or, you know, deceased structure to imply a parent and child

71
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.360
relationship in excess.

72
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.360
You can use a pointy bracket like so.

73
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.150
So this is saying I the parents and it has a child of span.

74
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.070
So if I look at the parent of the attack, say, if I collapse the attack now, you'll see that I.

75
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.620
Is a child of the elite like.

76
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.910
So I am going to write Elijah.

77
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.770
Forward potency bracket.

78
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.680
A 4.3 bracket span.

79
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.750
The NBA is the.

80
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.740
Grandparent.

81
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.840
I is the parent and span is the child.

82
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.650
So is that the next thing to look for is to see if there is anything unique that we can use to identify

83
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.740
it.

84
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.190
This particular ally.

85
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:05.180
So if we look above a lawyer, we can see that lawyer and all the allies actually belong to a fuel tag.

86
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.080
So if we look at it, you'll tag.

87
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.900
Let's see if there's any attributes that are unique.

88
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.330
So I can see that there's an idea here.

89
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.500
And this idea is unique to this.

90
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.970
You'll.

91
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.610
So if I copy this, I'd.

92
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.130
Like so.

93
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.670
And then go back here.

94
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.480
So I need to place a space in between this.

95
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.890
And because it's an I.D., I need to use the hash character.

96
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.600
And then I'm going to paste the value of the ID.

97
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.390
So all they're saying is that I'm providing an I.D. and the I.D. value.

98
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.860
Is this here?

99
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.910
Then I want you to go and find the NY tags.

100
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.280
Then find all the eyes that belong to an ally tag.

101
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.590
And then I want you to find all the spine elements that sit inside the eye.

102
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.250
Take.

103
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.970
So if I press enter now.

104
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.390
You'll see that it's found 16 results.

105
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:22.140
And we're going to use this locator for now because we would actually assess what values are being passed

106
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.390
back to us when we run our test.

107
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.560
But for now, I'm going to copy that selector and I'm going to go back to Eclipse and I'm going to paste

108
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.950
it here.

109
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:43.550
So now this origins is going to store all web elements for all the elements that are found using this

110
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.870
CSA selector.

111
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.400
So the next thing I'm going to do is use a for loop or for each loop.

112
00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.740
So I am going to write for Web Element.

113
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.490
Origin.

114
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.830
Colon origins.

115
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.100
So remember when we was you know, as we've covered this in the Java section, when you use a for each

116
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.820
loop, you provide the data type and then origin.

117
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.890
So this can be anything.

118
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.150
But I've called it origin.

119
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.790
Colon Origins is the name of the list.

120
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.600
So then I'm going to have opening and close embraces.

121
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.620
And here I'm going to write system.

122
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.820
Thoughts out.

123
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:38.539
Thoughts.

124
00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.020
Prince Owen.

125
00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.880
And inside this I'm going to use origin thoughts.

126
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.120
Get text.

127
00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:00.180
So what is this going to do is it's going to loop round through this list and for each instance, so

128
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.850
for each iteration through the loop, it's going to print out the text of this particular element.

129
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.480
So let me say this for now and try running it.

130
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:28.580
So take note that there's already text in the from text field it states London Gatwick London.

131
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:38.670
And the reason for that is that until you click on that text field, it doesn't clear and it contains

132
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.560
the default value of London Gatwick.

133
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.560
So when I've added London or I've sent the value of London, it was added to the end of that line.

134
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.760
So what we can do here is copy this line and simply paste it.

135
00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:01.940
So up to this point here and paste it and instead of sending the value straightaway, first we can click

136
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.780
the text field.

137
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.020
So let's try and run the test again.

138
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:19.290
And you can see that this time only London was placed in a text field and results have not been displayed.

139
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.720
So now if I go back to Eclipse.

140
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.140
You'll see that is printed a number of values here.

141
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.980
So it also contains the country.

142
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.270
And if we go back to the website.

143
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.650
We'll see.

144
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.000
The reason why it contains the country is because if we look at the span itself.

145
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.920
It actually also contains United Kingdom.

146
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.160
So if I was to expand this idea, for example, and then expand the span.

147
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.820
You see that?

148
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:58.240
It's got London Gatwick, but there's also another spaniel that's got the country name.

149
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:04.160
So that's why the number of results is 16, which is more than we were expecting.

150
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.390
So this is where I'm going to stop at this point, and we'll continue in the next lecture.
