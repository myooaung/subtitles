In this lecture, we're going to take a quick look at testing reports.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.770
So the test g report is a good way to see a summary of how our tests functioned.

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.570
So if we look at the left hand side here, we currently have a source and target folder.

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.230
What we need to do is right click our project and click the refresh button.

5
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.000
On doing so.

6
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.430
We now have a test output folder.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.090
If we expand this, you'll find a file called index that hates HTML.

8
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.220
If I right click it and click properties, you'll see a location path.

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.070
So I'm going to highlight this location path and copy it using control we see on my keyboard and then

10
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.560
going to open up Chrome and I'm going to pass that directory and then click Enter.

11
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.310
So these are test energy reports.

12
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.170
And if we look at the left hand side, we can see that two tests have run.

13
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.140
And if we look at the results section, we can see two methods run and two of them passed.

14
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.800
And if we click on this past method show button, you'll see the add remove item, which is the method

15
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.800
name of the add remove item test and end to end test, which is the method of the other test.

16
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.830
So this is a really good way of just seeing what tests have run.

17
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.680
And when I click on the information and the test link, you'll see test and test two.

18
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.570
So these are the names of the tests I have given in the test injection file.

19
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.730
So this is really a good way to see a quick summary and you can see some useful information here, especially

20
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.300
if you had a number of tests that run as part of your framework.

21
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.210
Later on in this course I'll show you extent.

22
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.190
Reports say extend reports are more advance weight of reports in so you can see more detail and you

23
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.260
can also add things like screenshots.

24
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.560
So I hope you found this lecture useful.

25
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.060
And thank you for watching.
