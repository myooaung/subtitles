1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,410
So in this lecture, we're going to create our base page for the project.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,520
So the first thing I'm going to do is right click the source main Java folder, select new and then

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,450
select package.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,960
And I'm going to give this package a name of base.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,110
So this is simply going to be a package where I'm going to store my base class.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,860
So I'm going to right click that package, select new and then select class, and I'm going to give

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,250
it a name of base page like so.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,530
So this base page is going to contain very similar codes to what we did in an earlier lecture.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:49,890
So I'm going to expand the intro folder, go to section 12 and in Open Up Lecture Firebase page and

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,110
you'll see all the code that we've written before which handles initialization of the driver.

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,110
It uses the config properties file.

12
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:06,820
And it also gets you a URL such as the automation test and website address and takes a snapshot.

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,420
So rather than point in all this code manually by hand, I'm going to simply copy all the methods and

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,810
the fields, and I'm going to copy those and I'm going to paste it inside my new base page class.

15
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,760
So you'll see that there is an error here.

16
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,110
And this is because I simply need to rename this base page.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,300
Like so.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,250
And you'll see that there is no other errors in our.

19
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:46,410
But remember that in this we were pointing to a config file that was specific to section 12.

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,480
So I am now going to minimize the intro package or project, and I'm going to close the lecture firebase

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,800
page from the earlier lecture.

22
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,040
And instead what I'm going to do is now amend this base page so that it's relevant to our new life project

23
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,440
one.

24
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,990
So the first thing is to get the directory of the new configuration file.

25
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,310
So I can simply right click the configuration file.

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,720
Go to properties.

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,900
And like we've done previously, we know that where we use user dots, the air is going to take us the

28
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,480
highest level for the project, which is live projects one.

29
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,630
So I need the following path that comes after that.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,190
To which I'm going to copy.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
And I'm going to paste in these quotes here.

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,450
So this will now point to this configuration file.

33
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,280
The next thing I need to do is also get the driver locations.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,470
And so I need to import these drivers into my project.

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:58,320
So I am going to create a new package which I'm going to right click Source Main Java, Select New and

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,740
Select Package and I'm going to call this drivers and then click Finish.

37
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,980
So the next thing I'm going to do is go to my desktop, to my resources folder and into my drivers folder,

38
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,410
and I'm going to copy those drivers.

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,130
And I want to go back to eclipse with the driver's package highlighted and press control V $2 drivers

40
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,840
in that package like so.

41
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,070
So these are the lines of code where we initialize the drivers.

42
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,210
So if I quickly review days we use in user directory which is the highest level.

43
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,400
And then it's looking at the source folder.

44
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,750
But as we use in Maven, we're going to need to change these directory paths.

45
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,510
So I'm going to simply right click chrome driver XY, go to properties and after Light Project one,

46
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,330
I'm going to copy the remaining path.

47
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,720
And I am going to simply replace this like so.

48
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,240
And for the gecko driver, I'm again going to paste it.

49
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,950
Changing chrome driver to get co-driver.

50
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,360
And then for my age, I'll just copy like so.

51
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,300
And then we had the Mercedes driver also listed.

52
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,000
So we've set our config file and we've also corrected the parts to the drivers that now belong to the

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,570
project.

54
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,070
So if I scroll down, you'll see that there's also a path that is to model at my local machine level

55
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,620
where I'm storing screenshots.

56
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,150
So another thing that we can do here is create a new folder to store these screenshots that belongs

57
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,900
to the project.

58
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,780
So I'm going to expand its target folder and you'll see there's nothing, nothing currently there.

59
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,700
So if I right click target select new and select folder.

60
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,370
I'm going to create a new folder called Screen Shots and then click Finish.

61
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:16,780
If I right click the screenshots folder, go to properties again, I'm going to locate Live Project

62
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,060
one and I'm going to copy the part that follows that like so.

63
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,790
And then I am going to update these double quotes to contain that new path.

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,970
I'm also going to add two more tax slashes.

65
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,320
And remember, I need to copy the user directory part.

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,540
So that the project knows or this method knows to use the project level as a starting point.

67
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,860
Like so.

68
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,930
So this is now our code for our base page.

69
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,210
So this is all we need at this point.

70
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,820
And we're going to start making use of this space page as we start constructing our tests.

71
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,650
Thank you for watching.
