00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.210
In this lecture, we'll take a look at how we can click on elements such as buttons.

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.810
And although you've seen this briefly, it's important to follow along as we'll be creating a code repository,

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.600
which you can then refer back to in the future.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.610
So how do we click on elements?

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.920
We use a command called Click.

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.560
The Click Command emulates a click operation for a link button, checkbox or radio button.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.050
A few examples we might want to do.

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.670
This is when we submit a form, go to a different web page by clicking the link.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.710
Let's put focus on an element.

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.280
An example of how we use this command is driver defined elements by name submit.

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.150
Act click.

12
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.960
So let's try it out.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.420
So the first thing I'm going to do is open up Eclipse.

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.710
And because we're in Section five, I'm going to create a new package.

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.560
So if you right click the sauce folder, select new and then select package.

16
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.600
I'm going to get this package in name of section zero five for Section five and then click Finish and

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.400
you'll see that package is now appeared.

18
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.410
If I right click that package and then select new and insert class, that will create a class within

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.160
that package.

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.050
And I'm going to call this class.

21
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.580
l02 because this is lecture two of Section five.

22
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.480
I'm the school.

23
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.300
Cricket.

24
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.030
Buttons.

25
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.170
And I'm going to select this public static web main and then click Finish.

26
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.030
Then that would open up the new class.

27
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.250
So rather than manually write in the setup code that we've seen a number of times previously, I'm going

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.920
to use the setup code from a previous class.

29
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.800
So I have opened the Locate in Boyardee class, and I'm going to highlight the following code.

30
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.430
And I'm going to switch back to my new class.

31
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.360
Now I'm going to simply paste it in the following section.

32
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.990
Mike So.

33
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.380
So we know that this code simply creates a new chrome driver.

34
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.360
It opens, it expands the window, and then it goes to the automation test in the button's web page.

35
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.780
So under this line I'm going to write driver dot find element by.

36
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.530
And I'm going to use CC selector.

37
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.800
And I'm going to provide double quotes.

38
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.890
And at the end of that line, I'm going to add a semicolon.

39
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.210
So I need to find a selector for the button that I want to click.

40
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.060
So I'm going to go and open my browser.

41
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.910
I'm going to go to automation, test the website.

42
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.110
Click on the Buttons page, and I'm going to find a CSF selector by open up, inspect the window.

43
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.830
And then if I go to Ragnarok, Philosophy Tab began to use this to find or view the select of my chooser.

44
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.560
So I'm going to use a select little.

45
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.930
I am then going to select button free.

46
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.620
And if we look at the suggested selectors, we can see a CSA selector for button free on the top line

47
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.300
now, which I'm going to copy.

48
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.770
I'm going to go back to the clips and I'm going to PACER select the value inside those double quotes.

49
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.840
And because this is the button, I want to click this button.

50
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.140
So at the end of that line and before the semicolon, I'm going to write a dot click.

51
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.450
He also appears to be too semi-colon.

52
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.190
So I'm just going to remove one of those.

53
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.600
So I'm now simply going to cite this class and I'm going to try running it.

54
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.990
So if I right click this class runner's drive application, let's see what happens.

55
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.780
And you can see that pop up has appeared saying you have clicked the third button.

56
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.550
So that proves that this code here was able to click that element by using the click command and by

57
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.230
using the selector provided.
