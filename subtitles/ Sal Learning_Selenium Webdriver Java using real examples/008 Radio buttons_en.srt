00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,500
In this lecture, we take a look at how to handle radio buttons.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,020
So what is a radio button?

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,300
Radio buttons allow a user to select only one of a limited number of choices.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,020
Radio buttons are normally written in radio groups where a collection of radio buttons describe a set

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,130
of related options.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,060
The group is defined by showing the same name, value and on the image on the left hand side.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,530
You see, the option one is ticked, and if I was to choose option two, it would take option one and

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,650
would take option two.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,280
If we look at the h timo on the right hand side, you will see that each option shares the same name

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,950
value and this is demo priority.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,120
So how do we interact to radio buttons?

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,740
All we have to do is find the locator for the option we want to select.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,170
We don't simply use the dot click command, for example Driver the find element by CC selector and I

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,720
provided a class name in this example and all I do is simply use a dot click command.

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,270
So let's try this out.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,400
So before we start writing code, let me first walk you through the test.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm open up chrome, I'm going to automation test in the code UK and I'm going to drop down link.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,080
And what we're going to focus on is this radio bottom section here.

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,890
So on page loads, no options are ticked.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,670
And if I select option one, you'll see has been checked.

21
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,790
But if I select option two, that focus then shifts to option two and so on.

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,520
So only one option can be selected at a time.

23
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,340
So the first thing I'm going to do is right click and inspect the page, and then I'm going to go to

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,390
the runner philosophy panel and then using the selected.

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,010
So I'm going to focus in option one like so.

26
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,640
And you'll see that runner x velocity has generated a number of selectors.

27
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,360
So I'm going to minimize this Web page for now, and I'm going to open up the clips and I'm simply going

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,600
to copy and paste the last class from the last lecture.

29
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:25,890
And I'm going to call this new 1l0848 and I'm going to give it a name of radio buttons and then click

30
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,370
okay.

31
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,610
And I'm going to double click on that class to open it and simply remove the code from the last lecture

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,420
that we don't need.

33
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,190
So the first thing to do is to update the address.

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,720
So I'm going to open up the web page, copy the address, and then paste it to replace the existing

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:45,930
one.

36
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:46,970
Right.

37
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,640
So.

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,330
So the first thing to do is if I go back to the Web page.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,140
So I've already focused on Radio Button one, so I'm going to copy a selector.

40
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,460
So I'm going to choose a second one.

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,960
And I'm going to go back to the clips and use in a comment.

42
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,030
I'm going to post it there.

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm going to do the same option to.

44
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,390
And I'm going to do the same for option three.

45
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,480
So now we have our selectors so we need to write to use these to click on them.

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:47,540
Options is driver dots find elements by the CSF selector double quotes for now and then doc click.

47
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,110
And what I'm going to do is simply copy.

48
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,440
Without the two forward slashes the selected value for one.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,920
And then all I'm gonna do now is copy that line a second time and a third.

50
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
And for that second line, I'm going to copy the second selector.

51
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,620
And for that third one, I'm going to copy the third selector.

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,360
Like so.

53
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,920
Now, when I demonstrate this to you, it's going to be really fast.

54
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,750
So I'm going to use a phrasebook sleep line again just to slow it down a little bit.

55
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,360
So I'm going to slow it down by 3 seconds before it moves on to the next line.

56
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,130
And then I'm going to use another friend.

57
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:35,700
Don't sleep.

58
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,910
So it slows it down again before it moves on to the next.

59
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,920
So that's the code.

60
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,930
And I'm going to say this class.

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,310
And then right click and then run it and see what happens.

62
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,430
So on page load, it's really clicked.

63
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,070
Option one.

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
It's now moved to option two.

65
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,470
And then it moved to option free.

66
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,310
So the code is fairly simple.

67
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,640
All you need to remember is when using radio buttons is to use a dot clip command to select the value.

68
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,380
Thank you for watching.
