1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,220
In this lecture, we're going to create a properties file which is going to store our global variables.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,700
So I'm going to store this properties file under a new package, and I'm going to call that package

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,540
resources.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,580
This resources package will store the resources we need in order to create our framework.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,400
So it's going to contain the properties file.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,410
And I'm also going to store the base page, which I'll write in a later lecture.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,880
So this is going to be created under Source Main Java.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,870
So I'm going to right click that folder, select new and select package, and I'm going to give this

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,850
package a name of resources, and then I'm going to click Finish.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,920
So on that new package, I'm going to right click select new and then select other.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,580
And then under general, I'm going to select file and then select next.

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:08,880
I need to provide a file name, so I'm going to call this config dot properties and then click finish.

13
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,070
And that config, the properties file will now be listed under that new resources package.

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,690
So this is the file open.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
So I'm going to create two variables.

16
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:29,840
The first one is going to be u, r, l, and it's going to equal and it's going to equally automation

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,250
test.

18
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,880
Then home page.

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,010
So I'm going to copy that address.

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,510
And paste it like so.

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,090
I'm also going to create a second variable and this is going to be called browser.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,480
And by default, I'm going to set it as chrome.

23
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,750
So that's all we need to do here.

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,800
And then when we start creating the base page in the next lecture, we'll start using these variables.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,300
So I'm going to save that file.

26
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,390
And that's it.

27
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:04,980
Complete.

28
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,880
Thank you for watching.
