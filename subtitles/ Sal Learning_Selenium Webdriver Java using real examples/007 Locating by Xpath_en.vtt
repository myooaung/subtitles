00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.780
In this lecture we look at locates in by x path.

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.050
So X path in Selenium is an example path used to navigate through the H2 most structure on a web page.

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.140
It's the language of find in any element on a web page using the XML path expressions.

4
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.480
X path can be used for both h html and email documents to find the location of any elements on a web

5
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
page using the HTML dom structure.

6
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.200
So the below diagram explains the basic structure of an X path locator.

7
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.250
So we have a current node which is indicated by two forward slashes.

8
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.740
We have a tech name which can be something like IMG, Div, P, etc..

9
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
We have a select attribute which is indicated by an ad sign.

10
00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.500
We have an attribute, so this can be an I.D., class type, etc., and the attributes will equal a

11
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.070
value.

12
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.800
So this will be the value of the attribute.

13
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.220
So if you imagine the attribute is I.D., then the value won't be BTN underscore one.

14
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.820
So there are two different types of ex parte locators.

15
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.770
Absolute and relative.

16
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.830
Absolute ex parte locators.

17
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.660
Contains the complete path from the root element to the desired element.

18
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.810
Absolute exports typically begin with a single forward slash, which implies the route node.

19
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.780
The disadvantage of an absolute path is maintenance, as you may need to update the path if a change

20
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.040
is made to the h html structure as it will break the existing path.

21
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.540
We also have relative exports and these are far more commonly used.

22
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.970
Relative X path doesn't require the full path to find an element.

23
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.200
It starts with a double forward slash, which means it can search two elements anywhere on the web page.

24
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.800
It's also less prone to h two more changes since it only starts looking from the point you specify.

25
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.920
So this is a high level overview of ex parte locators.

26
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.620
So let's look at an example.

27
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.620
So I'm going to open up Google Chrome and I'm going to go to the Automation System website and I'm again

28
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.790
going to go to the Buttons page and I'm going to press F12 on my keyboard.

29
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.080
And I'm going to click on the Elements tab, which is the document object representation of the page.

30
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.230
So as we know, we have hate smell, tax opening closing h civil takes an open and closed in head tag

31
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.820
which sits inside the original tag and also an open and closed body tag which also sits inside the cage

32
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.640
smell tax.

33
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.040
So I'm going to be demonstrating an absolute X path locator.

34
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.590
So I'm going to write an absolute x path to identify the button one element.

35
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.460
So to do this, and as it's a absolute x path, I need to begin from this start in terminal nodes and

36
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.700
draw all the way through until we get to the bottom one element.

37
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.930
So I'm going to do this by writing it as I go along in Notepad.

38
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.520
So the starting point is this Haitian oil tank.

39
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.010
So I'm going to write forward slash H HTML and then forward slash.

40
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.960
So this is where I'm started.

41
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.250
And then the next take is the body take.

42
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.230
So I'm going to write body like so and a forward slash.

43
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.900
I'm then going to expand the body.

44
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.450
And at this level we can see that we have a deep take here and there's only one deep take.

45
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.130
And when I hover over this on the left hand side, you can see the page is highlighted in blue.

46
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.260
So we know that button one sits inside this depth.

47
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.720
So I'm going to write.

48
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.560
Death and then forward slash.

49
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.260
So if I expand this dev.

50
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.440
At this level.

51
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.020
We can see there's two dips here at the main objective of an idea of sidebar.

52
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.240
So by hovering over Dave of an idea of mine, we can see that Batman is highlighted still.

53
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.660
So this is the debate that I need to use to assess, to debate at this level.

54
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.800
I need to write a slight different type of path here.

55
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.600
So again, I'm going to write div by the end of that div, I'm going to use square brackets with a one

56
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.930
in there.

57
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.750
And that's to say that because there's two divs at this level, I want to use the first div.

58
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.960
If I change that tattoo, that would indicate to you the second of.

59
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.850
And by default, if I didn't write a number here and just left it like so by default it would use the

60
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.590
first div that it comes across.

61
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.650
So I am going to write one just as a safety measure and then a forward slash.

62
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.090
So if I expand this mine.

63
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.510
If.

64
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.770
At this level, there is a single dev, so there's no other development at this level.

65
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.780
So I'm going to right dividend.

66
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.310
And I'm going to write a number forward, slash and expand this one.

67
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.560
And at this level there is a header.

68
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.370
A P tag, a Dave tag and a second div tag.

69
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.790
So I noble highlights initiative tag bottom someone is highlighted and this is it appears to be the

70
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.490
div which acts as rows on the web page.

71
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.450
So as this is the first event that I've come across at this level.

72
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.440
I'm going to write.

73
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.630
They've square brackets of one to indicate the first they've.

74
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.030
Because there is another div here.

75
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.520
So I am then going to expand this dev.

76
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.130
And at this level, there is one, two and three tips.

77
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.230
So we're not high like this first one.

78
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.110
You can see the bottom one is highlighted on the left.

79
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.010
So we know that the button one is within this div here.

80
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.700
So I am going to write forward slash.

81
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.110
Dave and because there's multiple Dave's at this level, I want the first Dave.

82
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.380
Which is this one highlighted.

83
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.260
And if I expand initiative at this level, we can see that there is an ally.

84
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.510
An ally, another ally.

85
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.640
But it was also a button here.

86
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.160
So this is the element that I want.

87
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.800
So it's bottom of an idea, but someone.

88
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.310
So I'm just going to use the element name, which is button.

89
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.400
So I am going to simply riot.

90
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.050
Button.

91
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.660
Like so.

92
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.200
And that is the absolute x path to get to bottom one.

93
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.150
So all we did was start in at a small note.

94
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.590
We trawled through all the elements until we got to bottom one.

95
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.150
So how can I prove that this absolute x path is right?

96
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.430
So later I'm going to write a test that will use this value, but is also another way that we can fetch

97
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.800
the absolute full X path.

98
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:47.100
And that's quite simply by using the selected tool to select the element of interest.

99
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.690
Today's highlighted.

100
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.320
And if I right click, you'll see a option to copy.

101
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.200
There's an option to copy full x path.

102
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.970
If I select that and in Pisces value below I can then compare.

103
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:11.280
And we can see that the absolute X path that I've written matches the one I've just retrieved.

104
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.230
So that's how I know that.

105
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.920
That's correct.

106
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.740
So that is absolute ex parte locators.

107
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.290
So the problem with these absolute ex parte locators, as I've explained, is that if a web developer

108
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:32.559
came in here and added an additional dev earlier than the one I've used to get to button one.

109
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.610
So, for example, say if there was another innovative place before this one here.

110
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.530
Then that will mess up the absolute path to get to this button.

111
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.170
So instead of.

112
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.310
This first festive.

113
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.190
At this level.

114
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.670
I might need to change that too too, because it would be the second device if another tape was placed

115
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.470
before this one.

116
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.340
So this absolute X path is prone to change.

117
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:10.750
So if a web developer did make that change, I would then need to change my absolute x path to get to.

118
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.480
But bottom one.

119
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.230
So that can be an issue if you're dealing with websites that change often.

120
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.860
So luckily there is the option to use a relative x povs.

121
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.230
So relative parts don't care about the force structure to get to the elements.

122
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.440
So it doesn't start from the old L.A..

123
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.110
With a relative x path.

124
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:42.050
We start with two forward slashes, so this means to search anywhere in the document.

125
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:50.260
And what we can do is find a element or something unique about the elements that we can use to structure

126
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.630
or create a relative X path.

127
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.680
So if we look at this element here, we know it's a button.

128
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.730
So we can write quite simply, button.

129
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.430
And then we know it's got an idea of button one or button underscore one, which we know is unique.

130
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.970
So what we can write here is.

131
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.750
I'm opening square brackets.

132
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.600
At.

133
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.140
My D, which is the attribute.

134
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.260
Equals.

135
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:30.490
And in single quotes, I'm going to provide a value for the I.D, which I know is BTN on the school

136
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.740
one and at the end of this line.

137
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:40.710
I close in square bracket so that right there is a relative X path locator.

138
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.010
So what we're saying is search anywhere in the document for a button.

139
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.190
Search, search in this whole document for a button.

140
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.050
And here is found one.

141
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.780
But how do we know this is the correct button?

142
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.820
Because there's a second button here.

143
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.740
So we've used a unique attribute.

144
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:07.400
So we've used the idea attributes and we're looking for one that has a value of button one or B ten

145
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.330
underscore one.

146
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.210
And we've written this like so.

147
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:19.030
So we use ads and then provided the attribute type, which is ID equals.

148
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:26.020
And in single quotes we provided the value of the attributes, which is BTM one, and it closes square

149
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:26.560
brackets.

150
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.550
So this is a relative ex parte locator.

151
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:39.780
And the good thing about this is that if changes were made to the Web page by Web developers say say

152
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.360
they've added a div because we don't care, because we're not using the full, absolute path to get

153
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.170
to this element.

154
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.810
This will still be valid because they'll still be a button on the page.

155
00:11:52.240 --> 00:12:00.720
We have an idea of beating on the score one, and that will be true unless the actual element itself

156
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.410
was changed.

157
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:06.390
For example, the order was changed from beating on score one to a different value.

158
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:13.650
So that is the difference between an absolute and a relative x path locator.

159
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:22.480
And it sees relative X path locators that are commonly used when we construct Selenium web driver tests.

160
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.960
So let's write some code to test both scenarios.

161
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:40.260
So in the clips I'm going to copy the class in the last lecture and paste it, and I'm going to call

162
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:47.400
this new 1l07 as we in lecture seven locate him by X.

163
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.580
Path like so and then click.

164
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.090
Okay.

165
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.520
I'm then going to double click this new class to open it.

166
00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.410
So I need to change the bottom line here.

167
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.760
So this is going to be the only difference.

168
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.160
So we're still going to be going to the Buttons page.

169
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.620
So once I'm on the Buttons page, I want to click button one and I first want to try doing this using

170
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:19.980
the absolute X path locator, and then I'm going to change the test again to use the relative.

171
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.740
So I'm just going to use these two that we've written here.

172
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:35.170
So I'm going to write driver thoughts, find elements, buyer thoughts, X path and then within the

173
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.670
brackets and double quotes.

174
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.490
I'm going to pass this first one.

175
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.330
Like so.

176
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.130
And as is a button.

177
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.600
I want to click it.

178
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.460
So I'm now going to save this class and I'm going to try and run it to see what happens.

179
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.640
And we can see that the button has been clicked.

180
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.180
So we know that the absolute x path works.

181
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:15.910
So now I'm going to close this and I am going to highlight and copy and paste this line below and I'm

182
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:23.080
going to add two forward slashes to comments out just so that we have a reference to the absolute X

183
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.470
path.

184
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.720
So now I am going to copy this relative expert locator.

185
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.310
In these double quotes like so.

186
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.720
And to see if this works.

187
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.230
I'm going to save this class and try them on this one, too.

188
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:50.110
And we can see that the button was clicked again proven that the both the absolutes and the relative

189
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.790
X path locators work.

190
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.890
So that's it?

191
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.630
It's fairly simple.

192
00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:02.950
The difficult bit about understanding ex parte locators is understanding what we need to do in order

193
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.480
to get to the value we require.

194
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:12.760
So for an absolute expert locator, we trawl through the document object model till we get to the element

195
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.660
that we require.

196
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.050
If a relative x locator we use something like unique attribute.

197
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.050
So we provide the element and a unique attribute to get to the elements of our choosing.

198
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.880
So we're going to see this far more often as we progress through this course.

199
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.830
So you'll become very familiar with it.

200
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.140
But for now, I hope that's a good high level overview of X Path locators.

201
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.340
Thanks for watching.
