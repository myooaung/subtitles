1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,580
So we're now in a position to generate our tests to see if a report gets generated.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:14,200
So what I'm going to do is right click my testing file run as a managed test in G suite.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,530
So let's see if the code generates.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,510
So you can see that no tests were run.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,670
And the reason for this is that there is a slight tweak that I need to make in my code and it's to do

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,200
with the listener's class.

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:41,390
So if I open up the listeners class, you'll see that on the on start method I've used extents.

8
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,260
Manager They'll create test contacts.

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,200
Host So this is an error in my part.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,380
What I should have used is context dot get name again like so.

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,370
If I save that now.

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,160
And try running again.

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,480
Let's see if that resolves the issue.

14
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,480
And you can see that the Chrome drivers have opened and the tests are running.

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,870
So now that's completed.

16
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,480
If I go over to my left hand side here.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,250
You can see it.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,470
I've got a report folder, but it's nothing inside it.

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,090
So if I right click and click on refresh on the project.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,310
You'll see that there is now a report listed there.

21
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,850
And if I right click and go to properties.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,680
And then click on this icon here.

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,920
It'll take me to the location of the report.

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,480
And if a double click it.

25
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,260
You'll see that the tests are now displayed in this report.

26
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,580
So I've got two tests here.

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,170
So this first one is the add remove item basket test.

28
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,750
And you can see there it was pass in.

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,130
But it reached a failure.

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,920
And that's because the cuts amount totals did not match the expected amount.

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,990
And you can see that the screenshot has also been attached which of a click.

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,250
It will show you the exact point of where the failure occurred.

33
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:33,300
If I click on this second test, this one refers to the start in or the complete test, and you can

34
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,160
see that all those messages that I added have been placed within the report itself.

35
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,450
And this one passed.

36
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,920
If I click on the second tab, which is the exceptions page, you'll see where the failure has occurred.

37
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,530
And it's to do with the first test, which is this one here, which is add remove item basket.

38
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,280
If I click on this third tab, you'll see that we've given some useful information.

39
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,860
Such as?

40
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:09,270
Such as the start time of the test and the end time the one has passed, one failed and you'll see all

41
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,950
useful information listed here.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,670
If I scroll down, you'll see a system environment where I've got a name as tester value my name.

43
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,290
And you may remember this was defined when we're setting up the config in the extended manager's class.

44
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,130
So if I close this report.

45
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,800
And go back to my framework and open up extents.

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,340
Manager.

47
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,120
Let me just show you what happens when we change some config here.

48
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,120
So instead of theme got dark, I'm going to select theme dot standard.

49
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,810
And then instead of my name, I'm going to write John Smith.

50
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,780
So if I save this.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,100
And try running the test.

52
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,240
Inject smell again.

53
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,780
Let's see the differences.

54
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,580
So again, those tests have completed and if I go up and refresh the project again.

55
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,420
You'll see that second report has been generated.

56
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,160
And more importantly, it hasn't overwritten the original report.

57
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,460
That's because we're using the date and time to differentiate between the files.

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,300
So that's the importance of using the date and time in the name of the file or the report.

59
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,640
It is generated and that's done by this method here.

60
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,070
So for right click and go to properties on that second report and then try opening it.

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,200
Let's see the differences that I've made based on change in those config settings.

62
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,390
And you can see used a different theme.

63
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,670
And also if I go on to this third tab.

64
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,620
You'll see that John Smith has been entered here based on the change that I made to the extent managers

65
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,160
class.

66
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,500
So that is how we can set up and implement extent reports into our framework.

67
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,550
I apologize for it being quite confusing as there is a number of code changes we need to make, but

68
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,010
hopefully the end result was worth it.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,380
If you have any issues during this set up or if you find then that you extent reports are not generated

70
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,220
as expected.

71
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:42,660
I've attached the code files to these lectures, so the best thing to do is to compare your code to

72
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,870
the code that I have written to see if there's any differences.
