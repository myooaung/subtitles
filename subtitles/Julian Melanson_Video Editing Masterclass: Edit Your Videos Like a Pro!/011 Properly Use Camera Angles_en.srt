1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:09,300
Let's continue to move forward in this edit and see what else we can focus on and learn from this project.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,740
Now we have this part of the video where we can clearly see our music track is going to fade away.

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,980
The reason I decided to do that at this moment for this whole sequence is because this is the part of

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,200
the video where it's an actual teaching moment.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,090
It's not fun, flashy, inspiring lines that the character is delivering, but it's an actual minute

6
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,570
and a half sequence where we wanted to demonstrate what an actual video lesson would be like in this

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,110
project or for an online course specifically.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
So let's go in and play for a little bit.

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,830
We'll have our music fading out.

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,950
As you can see right here, we have the key framing to bring our track audio down.

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,970
So oh, captain, my captain by Walt Whitman, I love this poem because I love the sound quality of

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,150
it.

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,990
So pay attention to the moments that are getting stressed and you can call us, you know, our poets.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,120
We're trying to build our Pulitzer.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,100
Oh, Captain, my captain are fearful.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,600
Trip is.

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,960
So you can see that sinking going on where we did what we did before, creating the same exact kind

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,040
of motion graphic, the same way we are to explain.

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:32,800
We have a nice sound effect that's going and our music drops out right here as she's going into this

20
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,560
brand new style of speaking.

21
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,770
Oh, Captain, my captain are fearful.

22
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,760
Trip is done.

23
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,070
The ship has weathered every rock.

24
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,690
That size we saw is one.

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,670
The port is near the bells.

26
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:52,150
I hear the people all exulting while falo eyes, the steady meal, the vessel grim and daring.

27
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,510
So we have again, this Viorel sequence.

28
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,310
Now, if I save this real quick.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,520
Right click and reveal this in our project.

30
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,730
We have a one minute raw clip of me directing her through the secrets.

31
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,889
So we took this.

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,509
You know, there's a lot of pauses.

33
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,220
There's a lot of waiting to get the framing right, telling her, OK, do the marking.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,460
And we took that raw sequence and we cut it down.

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,710
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,810
Only two the great moments we needed that were synched up to her audio.

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,700
One.

38
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,430
And then after that, we went to the beacom side angle.

39
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:44,800
I personally do this because I felt like this captured a lot more the cool snapping motion that she

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,460
was doing.

41
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,230
And if I didn't do that, here's what it would have look like.

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:59,860
People all exulting while falo eyes the steady Neil, the vessel grim and daring so vs. the bells I

43
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:06,280
hear the people all exulting while falo eyes the steady Neil the vessel grim and daring.

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,080
So in those first four.

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,070
So that's another great use of when to use which camera angle you always want to use, the one that's

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,080
telling your story the best.

47
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,060
Sometimes it's going to be the angle from the side.

48
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,650
Sometimes it's going to be a straight on angle.

49
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,800
It really depends in each moment.
