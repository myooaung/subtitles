1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,890
And if we want to fine tune this even more, we can take these key frames that we created and we can

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,780
right click on these key frames.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,050
Right now, they're set to linear.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,090
Linear means right angles.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,360
Right.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,600
It's something that's OK if we do Bezier, I think, as you say, I don't know.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,010
I think it's French, but we can actually smooth those curves.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,130
So rather than say it goes.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,860
So I hope you like that interpretation of it.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,240
But let's right click the key frame, click bezier.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,240
You can see how it instantly makes it more curved.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,320
See that?

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:40,890
OK.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,190
And then we're going to do that same thing on the second keyframe.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,650
Now, what this is going to allow me to do is to drag the little ball and line icon.

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,330
So I can really adjust the amount of curve that the keyframe itself is going to have.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,870
So that's really interesting and something to play around with.

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,270
And a little bit of a protip just to get your audio design to a further level of really fine tuning

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,630
something.

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,770
So it's not too much of a drop off, but it of goes I don't know, I keep doing the score, but I think

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,240
you understand what I'm trying to say here.

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,800
So let's take a listen.

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,490
Perfect.

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,590
There is.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,930
OK, so let's take a listen to what we got.

26
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,740
Now that is a waterfall.

27
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,200
Yeah.

28
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:16,870
Okay.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,050
Whenever you guys are ready.

30
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,170
OK, perfect.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,360
So that looks pretty good.

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,760
And it's sounding pretty darn good.
