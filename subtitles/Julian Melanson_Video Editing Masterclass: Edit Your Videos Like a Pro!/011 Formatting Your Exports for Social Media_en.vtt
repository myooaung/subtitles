00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.090
So let's say we went ahead and we exported these by, say, setting an endpoint, going to the end,

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:13.440
setting an outpoint, hitting command and or going up to file export boom, you know, setting the right

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.300
preset for wherever it was going.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.540
Let's say this one is going to YouTube.

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.720
So, boom, you two that four k max out the settings, all the stuff that we've done earlier in the

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.390
course, making sure that the audio is at three hundred and twenty bit rate.

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.080
Perfect.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.570
There we go, titling it properly, putting it in the proper folder, hitting export or adding it to

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.410
the render queue.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.740
But now let's say we've done that process with our 16 by nine aspect ratio.

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
This is a standard 16 by nine, which all video cameras shoot at.

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.110
But if we want to do a square or a nine by 16 for an Instagram story, let's first do that.

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.080
Now, what we want to start with doing is taking all of our shots and nesting them into one single sequence.

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.400
That way we have everything from that whole sequence.

15
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.150
We can move and manage all as one shot.

16
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.370
So if I scale it down, it's scaling down that whole amount of footage.

17
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.510
So let's undo that.

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.380
And let's go to the actual sequence itself.

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.870
This is our sequence right here that we're working with this one, with all of our 15 second cut downs.

20
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.090
I'm going to go to the settings by right.

21
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.220
Clicking it, go to sequence settings.

22
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:42.480
And now we can change the aspect ratio and the amount of pixels, the height in the width of our sequence.

23
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.090
So what I'm going to do is go ahead and scale this down, and we're going to start with doing a square

24
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.900
aspect ratio.

25
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.780
So I'm going to copy the vertical and I'm going to paste it into the heiss or the horizontal.

26
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.800
What that's going to do is make the horizontal and vertical the same exact ratio.

27
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.070
This is great for normal Instagram posts.

28
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.800
Now, if I play this through, there is going to be a good chance.

29
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.860
It's some of these shots will need their framing adjusted.

30
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.510
So what we can do is play it.

31
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.800
Take a deep breath.

32
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.640
OK, so for that first shot, her body is really out of frame, so I'm going to make a cut just so I'm

33
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.950
working with this clip, skewed it over.

34
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.720
Take a deep breath.

35
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.110
Close your eyes.

36
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.510
Breathe it all the way out.

37
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.210
Let's say we want to do that same thing for this one.

38
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.140
Boom.

39
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.190
Make a cut.

40
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.040
See, the world will come back.

41
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.600
Boom, right there.

42
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.320
And scoot over.

43
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.070
That all the way up.

44
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.220
And I actually want to mention something you can do a cool thing once you start changing the aspect

45
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.050
ratio for, let's say, an Instagram post.

46
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.070
You can actually take the nested sequence that you made and do a keyframe for, let's say, the position.

47
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.660
Let's go to the end of the clip.

48
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.250
Make another keyframe now.

49
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.120
Go to the beginning and let's scoot it over.

50
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.720
So that now when we play it back, there's going to be a nice panning motion for me.

51
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.370
And boom, you see that.

52
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.700
So before we have.

53
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.360
And with that panning motion, you could do the same thing with Zoom.

54
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.210
But let's keep moving.

55
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.190
All these are looking good.

56
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.580
But by.

57
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.080
Open your eyes, see your star.

58
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.940
OK, perfect.

59
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.250
Yeah, we can even add, let's say we wanted to take this final shot.

60
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.020
You can scoot it over and we can go to the beginning of it.

61
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.600
Create a scale keyframe and let's see the scale and position key frame.

62
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.760
Go to, let's say, the end.

63
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.770
Create another key frame.

64
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.390
And we can zoom in.

65
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.600
Boom, one 10, scoot it down and move, let's say, over here so that when we play it and boom, you're

66
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.750
moving and zooming out so that it didn't really work.

67
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.970
It doesn't look amazing for this one.

68
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.610
So I would fine tune that a little bit.

69
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.340
But just a little cool addition that you can do.

70
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.470
Now, let's say you're super happy with that.

71
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.120
You're ready to share to Instagram.

72
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.190
Let's go to export.

73
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.130
You know, do the proper settings.

74
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.710
Let's say we want it for a mobile device at 10 ATP.

75
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.010
Now we have these black bars on the side.

76
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.340
So what we need to do is have our video sequence, not at 19, 20 by 10, 30, that's standard 16 by

77
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.640
nine.

78
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.980
And we want to match our new sequence settings, which is going to be this square aspect ratio.

79
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.330
Now we have this edit, this cut down, ready to go directly to Instagram.
