00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.920
So now our edit is ready to be exported, I was super excited about the demo reel that we've created

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.160
together, and now I want to show you we're going to export this in three different ways so that we

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.220
can share it online, where you can share it online with your audience on all platforms.

4
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.140
So like we talked about, the main aspect ratio for YouTube and Vimeo is going to be sixteen by nine,

5
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.850
which is standard across all videos.

6
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.970
If your project is at 10 ATP boom export of that 10 ATP, if it's at four K, you can export it at Fourcade.

7
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.260
So let's go over to our edit and let's go up to file.

8
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.360
We're going to hit export.

9
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.870
We're going to go to YouTube.

10
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.770
The preset for YouTube, if it's going to Vimeo, you can go to the preset for Vimeo.

11
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.320
It's going to be an export at 10 ATP.

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.730
Let's just go ahead and do Vimeo.

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.640
And we want to make sure that for our audio settings, we're at the highest quality possible and that

14
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.510
our bit rate of sea is our bit rate is going to be at 320.

15
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.400
That's just means the maximum rate is the best.

16
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.840
It's just all you need to know.

17
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.810
We're going to go to render at maximum depth as well.

18
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.040
This is for the video side and use max render quality.

19
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.960
Now we're in our exports folder and we're going to table this demo reel final Vimeo.

20
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.120
Or you can do the date.

21
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:45.630
So you can do let's just say the date was for twelve two thousand sixty and we had save and then we

22
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.760
can either export or added to the queue.

23
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.250
Let's just go ahead and add it to our queue.

24
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.410
That way we can kind of do multiple things here at the same time.

25
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.220
So while that's doing its thing in the background, I'm going to take our main sequence, which is our

26
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.050
demo reel, main select sequence.

27
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.520
I want to duplicate it.

28
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.080
And I'm going to title this demo, Real mean insta gramme.

29
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.560
OK.

30
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.370
Because the previous edit they were doing is for standard like Facebook, YouTube, all that stuff.

31
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.820
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and nest everything in this sequence.

32
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.310
So I'm going to select all my video.

33
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.810
I'm going to hit Nest.

34
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.450
And now we have all of our video files as one in our video.

35
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.610
Now, what we can do is go to our demo reel Instagram version of our sequence that we just created.

36
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:59.770
And we can change the aspect ratio from 16 by nine to I believe the ratio is yes, four by five, which

37
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.430
is going to give us that vertical video aspect ratio on Instagram.

38
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.960
So four by five.

39
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.300
To do that, the pixel count is twelve hundred by 1400.

40
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.690
So you can see it shows the ratio now.

41
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.070
And what's that?

42
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.740
What that's going to do is now make our sequence settings perfect for viewing the really cool vertical

43
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.170
video on your Instagram feed.

44
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.450
But you can see there's a problem.

45
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.630
And that's why we nested our sequence first, because now we have to scale up our footage to properly

46
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.580
fit this new sequence.

47
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.730
But once we do that, then this is ready to be shared on a platform just like Instagram.

48
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.800
So I'm going to go ahead and do that same process that we did for the previous edit.

49
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.760
But I'm going to go for mobile device because it's going to be played on a mobile device to get rid

50
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.850
of these black bars.

51
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.770
I'm going to hit match source.

52
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.970
That's going to create the proper aspect ratio as our timeline.

53
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.890
I'm going to go to max settings.

54
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.980
I'm going to make sure that the audio is set at 320.

55
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.210
It's not.

56
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.340
It's set to 128.

57
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.090
We don't want that.

58
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.640
That means there's not as much information in the soundtrack.

59
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.769
We want max information there.

60
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.029
I'm going to go here.

61
00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.740
I'm going to go man Instagram.

62
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.300
And we can date this one, too.

63
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.010
Let's do six.

64
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.490
Seventy years.

65
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.270
Three thousand.

66
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.110
OK.

67
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.470
And I'm going to add this to the queue as well.

68
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.700
And market place so that these can start exporting in the background.
