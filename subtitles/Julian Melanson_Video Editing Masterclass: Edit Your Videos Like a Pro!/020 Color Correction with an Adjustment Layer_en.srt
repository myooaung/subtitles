1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:07,020
So for the final portion of really enhancing the video side of this section, I want to go over one

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,310
more thing that we're going to go even more detail in throughout this course, which is color correction

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,170
and color grading.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,040
Now, because you've been working with more footage that's been shot from your phone from a past event,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:29,220
the phones these days do a pretty darn good job of optimizing the images that's coming through the camera.

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,050
So they color, correct?

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,100
Automatically, they brighten up in contrast and sharpen things and bring more clarity automatically

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,030
whenever you shoot anything.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,910
So for this scenario, we're not going to really go through and upgrade clips one by one.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,330
I want to show you how you can quickly after you've done an edit like the one that we've worked on,

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,570
how you can do a layer across the whole thing that brightens up the whole thing, saturates the whole

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,680
thing, and can create a kind of cool or interesting tone that you're looking for across the whole video

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,370
itself.

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,440
Later in the course, we're going to go through and individually learn how to color great color.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:10,920
Correct.

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,430
And really stylized and create a very unique look for each individual clip in our videos.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,730
So let's first start here with creating a new adjustment layer, and I'll explain why we're going to

18
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,900
do it this way in a moment.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,300
So we're going to create a new adjustment layer.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,790
You're going to have a window that pops up that just asks you if you want to keep the settings of the

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,680
adjustment layer the same as the settings from your sequence.

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,920
Of course, we want to do that.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,630
So we're going to hit OK.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,430
And we're going to drag that adjustment layer into our timeline.

25
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,760
Now, right now, this is not doing anything, OK?

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,880
This is just a layer that sits on top of your footage and it basically says whatever is on this layer,

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,220
I'm going to give or put onto the footage below.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,240
OK, so it's a really easy way to kind of paint your whole timeline, regardless of how many video clips

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,470
are in the timeline.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,490
You can easily paint that whole timeline with the same effects.

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,000
So now I'm going to drag this adjustment layer so that it's covering our entire timeline here.

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,130
And I'm going to go to the effects tab and I'm going to type in new Metry color.

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:32,210
Now, regardless of whatever you're editing software is, you're going to have a color correction effect.

34
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,000
That's the main color correction way to really adjust the colors and exposure and contrast.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,570
And all those different details of your image might be called color corrector and might be called something

36
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:45,960
else.

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,620
But in premiere, it's called luminary color.

38
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,490
Now, I just dragged on to the adjustment layer, and I'm going to go to the effects control tab and

39
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,650
I'm going to open up these toggles here.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,040
See, we have basic color correction.

41
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,260
This is going to allow for us to change the color temperature, the tint exposure, contrast and so

42
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,590
on.

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,830
And the only other thing we're going to kind of focus on here is the creative tab.

44
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:19,160
This allows for us to do some interesting things with coloring and the shadow tint and highlight.

45
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,100
OK.

46
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,430
So now I'm going to scroll over to kind of our opening image here automatically.

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:34,020
I can see just through the whole video itself, it could use a little bit more contrast and definitely

48
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,400
some saturation throughout.

49
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,430
So I'm going to take the saturation function here.

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,470
Right now, it's set to hundred, which is basically means nothing is being added and nothing is being

51
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,160
taken away.

52
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,170
So I bring it down below a hundred.

53
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:52,050
You can start to see this image turn the black and white if I bring it above a hundred.

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,050
You can start to really see the effect that it's doing it.

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,630
OK.

56
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:04,830
We definitely don't want to be adding too much saturation because that will make the viewer have a oh,

57
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,450
this is a cheesy video opinion.

58
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,080
Right.

59
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,830
Of the edit.

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,880
So we want to undo that.

61
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,330
And we want to find a happy middle ground here.

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,300
So I just bumped it up to 116.

63
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,510
Now we can kind of play through the video and see how that's looking.

64
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,610
So I'm really liking that.

65
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,400
But I'm actually going to boost this year a little bit more.

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,230
So let's say one thirty.

67
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,270
OK, that's going to bring just some more colors back into our edit.

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,300
And now I'm going to add just a little bit of contrast.

69
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,490
This is going to create a more dynamic looking image.

70
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:47,130
So if I decrease the contrast, you can see the image is going to start to turn really gray.

71
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:56,220
That's because you're getting rid of the contrast or the difference between the darkest part of the

72
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,350
image and the brightest part of the image.

73
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,430
So you can.

74
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,620
That's super gray.

75
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,300
Right.

76
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,680
But let's bring this back to 10 just to have a little bit more contrast.

77
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,580
OK, that's all looking pretty good.

78
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:19,720
And I think we can over all here add a little bit more sharpening.

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:28,870
Now, what sharpening is going to do is going to really make the image appear to be a lot more crisp

80
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,370
and clear.

81
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:40,540
So, for example, if I reduce the sharpening all the way down and play through, you can see it feels

82
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,540
kind of blurry and a little bit hazy.

83
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,500
OK.

84
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,870
Now, if we go.

85
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,470
Here.

86
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,870
And we set that back to zero.

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,450
Now our image is looking good, but we can actually increase and just bump this up a little bit, 10

88
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,770
to 15 points.

89
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:07,000
That's going to give all of our images, especially when we're shooting on a smartphone that has decent

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,030
sharpness but doesn't have that razor razor sharp look when you're not shooting at four K.

91
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,540
If you take a 10 A.P. image, which is what this is, it's 19, 20 by 10, 80, technically 10, 80,

92
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,380
19, 1920.

93
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,080
But basically, that's the same amount of pixels in the image for kids, about four times that.

94
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,670
But we can take a 10 AP image like this that comes right off your phone.

95
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:39,400
And if we increase the sharpness just a little bit, it's something that you won't necessarily see right

96
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,910
away.

97
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:46,030
But after looking at everything, it's just going to give it a little bit of an extra pop.

98
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,140
So you can see like the images looking really clear and really crisp.

99
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,710
And that's what the goal of color correction is for.

100
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,420
So there you have it.

101
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,230
Super easy way to kind of do a final layer on top of your footage just to give it that little extra

102
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,520
special sauce.

103
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,930
Later in the course, we're going to go really into detail on color theory, on doing a little bit more

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,040
or actually a lot more of intricate ways of using color correction.

105
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:23,470
And in the next lecture, we're going to see how much we can change our edit by now adding a soundtrack

106
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,630
to the project that we've been working on.
