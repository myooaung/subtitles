1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,720
So now that we have the area where we know we want this title to go, next up would be to do the similar

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,530
process that we did with this first graphic.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,100
And let's go ahead and see which font we use.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,720
OK, I never know how to pronounce this one.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,400
Mont Serat.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,830
No.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,420
Yes.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:19,810
OK.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,100
I called it monster at for the first few years.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,840
I was using it Monsoor.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,240
OK, I still don't even know how to say it.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,890
But Emmo and I know it starts with emulating a T..

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,440
Let's see it and and let's go ahead and do a similar thing that we did before we can make this light

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,590
and add a little bit of a stroke so that it's not too wiry.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,240
It's got a little bit more weight to it and we can shrink this down a little bit.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:51,960
Yep.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,030
And because there's a lot going on in the background, it's really helpful for these kind of title cards

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,210
to add what's called a drop shadow.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,310
Now, I know we've talked about this already, so I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but you're

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,310
basically creating a shadow behind the font.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,490
So that is going to help it stand out a lot more if I were to move it away.

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,420
You can see what that job shadow is looking like.

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,410
If I were to turn up the thickness of the drop shadow, you can start to see.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,330
And there's really a fine line.

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,390
Like I personally don't like seeing a drop shadow.

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,680
I like to really have it there subtly in the background.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,850
So you don't notice it, but it just barely helps to keep the text separated from the backdrop so that

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,000
you can clearly read the words that are on screen.

29
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,150
Because if you can't if it's not legible, then there's no point of it even being there.

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,260
It'll be more of a distraction than anything else.

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:02:00,060
So we have a little bit of a drop shadow, and I'm going to go ahead and do something similar with adding

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,410
a line just like what we did with our previous edit.

33
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,449
Now, there's just something about having a line.

34
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:19,500
I don't know what it is, but with text and when you add basically some type of line, it kind of helps

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,180
to frame up the text and helps it to sit in your image a little bit better.

36
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:34,590
It feels a little bit more that it's placed properly so we can kind of experiment here and we can like

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,180
try the line at the bottom.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,110
That's not that great.

39
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,210
We can try to at the top.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,800
That's OK.

41
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,390
It's not looking too good.

42
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,220
We can even try rotating it 90 degrees and putting it up.

43
00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:01,330
And put it up, cheese cut and put it kind of vertically, which I definitely like doing some time,

44
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,880
so let's get it the proper length.

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,740
Let's move it over.

46
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,370
And I like that.

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,300
So this is without kind of you know, it's there, it's OK.

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,270
But as soon as we add that, it just adds a little bit more purpose and a little bit more structure

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,080
for what we're seeing.

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,680
So let's go ahead and see what we have.

51
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,840
I want to put this to zero so that the line expands.

52
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,070
Yep.

53
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,630
Perfect.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,040
OK.

55
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,530
And we can see that expansion up just a little bit.

56
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,040
OK.

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,460
Now, let's add a fade in, just like what we did before.

58
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,200
In a FETO, we can make that fade even longer.

59
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,620
OK.

60
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,640
And you know what?

61
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Because we have this cool vertical line now that's happening.

62
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,110
And we want to add a little bit more of an animation.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,250
You know, just like what we did with this first one, just to kind of create a little bit more of a

64
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,240
professional feel.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,870
We can totally do that Mersch motion blur thing again.

66
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,610
You know, that's definitely a go to that I use a lot is adding that motion blur.

67
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,310
It always looks elegant and it always looks clean.

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,920
But for this one specifically, I want to, you know, try something different so we can go in to our

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,400
effect's tab and type in white.

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,160
And this is going to be a transition, kind of an intro transition effect.

71
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:48,980
So what it's going to do is it's going to have the clip just like that scroll sideways.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,450
So you see how it's coming in from left to right versus before, where it's just fading in all at once.

73
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,870
So in this way, it kind of goes out of this vertical line that we added.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,330
So there we go.

75
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,050
That's looking pretty good.

76
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:12,100
Now, if we wanted to have a little bit more control, I don't like how this isn't feathered.

77
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,400
It's just a solid line.

78
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,210
You can see there's no feathering.

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,930
It's just like one really harsh line that goes across.

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,380
Now, if you want to take it a step further, have a little bit more control instead of using a preset

81
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,840
wipe transition.

82
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,600
We can go in and type in Krog.

83
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:42,160
And this is going to allow for us to have a little bit more control over this transition.

84
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,510
So if I go to the middle of the clip, we have left top, right bottom.

85
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,940
Now, if I scale up the left one, you can see, OK, we're scrolling from the left.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,270
And if I scale up the right one, you can see that we can do this wave, but manually.

87
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,750
And the thing is about doing it manually is in we can add this edge feathering.

88
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,550
So now that is looking a lot better.

89
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:18,190
We have more of a gradual effect that this transition is going to have versus the kind of harsh, hard

90
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,610
line.

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,670
So let's go to the beginning of the edit or the beginning of the title.

92
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,060
Third.

93
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,320
Turn our stopwatch on with the effect fully engaged.

94
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,050
And let's go to where we want the text to be seen fully right there.

95
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,080
And let's see what we got.

96
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,650
OK.

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,570
That's looking a lot better.

98
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,900
So it really just kind of gradually comes out and gradually displays.

99
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,480
And now we can do that same exact thing to the outro.

100
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,290
So where are opacity starts to go down and we have the natural fade out?

101
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,180
Let's do another keyframe.

102
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:09,720
Go to the end and put our crop all the way back up to 100 so that it comes back in gradually.

103
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,290
So.

104
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,510
And then it'll go.

105
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,690
There we go.

106
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,160
And we can even add, you know, how the line expands and comes in.

107
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,060
Now we can add the line going back.

108
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,940
So let's go to our heighth of our line, just like what we did earlier with the uniform scale kind of

109
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,500
hack that I've discovered.

110
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,280
Go back and hit a key frame.

111
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,020
Go to where we want it to disappear fully and put this at zero.

112
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,990
Now put this at zero.

113
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,200
So let's see what that looks like.

114
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,880
OK, so that looks really clean, right?

115
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,530
We're getting the information, it's legible, it looks professional.

116
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:14,000
And there's even an intro and outro animation so that it doesn't look just like so that it doesn't look

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,450
just like a really simple, plain looking title card.
