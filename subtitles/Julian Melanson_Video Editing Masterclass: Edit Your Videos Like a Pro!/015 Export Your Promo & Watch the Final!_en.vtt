00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.090
Great, so we have our endpoint at the beginning of our edit set right there, and then we have our

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.240
outpoint at the end of our edit set to right after when the end of our edit ends.

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.260
OK, so we have everything selected that we want to have in our export.

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.320
Now I'm going to hit command M or you can go to file for export and export media.

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.890
And because this was shot at four K for me, I'm going to go to the YouTube for K because in this situation,

6
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.810
that's where the video would be living.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.190
I wanted outputted at full resolution for K living on YouTube.

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.600
If it's for you, you know, can be the ten ATP version, whatever it is.

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.590
But I'm going to click this.

10
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.210
I'm going to go to render out maximum bit depth and I'm going to go do render at maximum quality.

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:58.680
And as you can see, this preset is a slightly different aspect ratio of our original source material.

12
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.030
Now, to get around that, we can either scale up our video to fill the frame, which is going to get

13
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.160
rid of those black bars on the top in the bottom, or we can match the source original pixels, which

14
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.630
is what I'm going to do in this situation.

15
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.250
So I'm going to hit match source.

16
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.250
Then you can just see you went to four thousand nine hundred and four thousand ninety six pixels by

17
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.870
two thousand one hundred sixty pixels pixels, which is the original aspect ratio of these actual files.

18
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
And I'm going to set the destination and output name.

19
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.390
So we're going to go to the project where this is I'm going to create a folder, twilit exports, and

20
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.550
it's going to save promo video, version one.

21
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.420
OK.

22
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.940
And then I'm going to hit export and we will check out our final edit.

23
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.460
And that does it for our promo edit chapter.

24
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.550
So in this chapter, we learn how to use multicam.

25
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.900
We learn how to use unusable viro footage to create really cool, fast transition cutaways.

26
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.009
What else do we do?

27
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.200
We did remapping.

28
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.700
We did speed and duration changes to our clips.

29
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.140
We flipped some clips to reverse the orientation.

30
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.200
We learn more about scaling up and scaling, zooming in and zooming out at certain times.

31
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.740
We did masking and created more glitchy stuff.

32
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.290
Right, because it was really perfect for this kind of high energy video that also looks professional.

33
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.670
We didn't get too far with adding the stylizing, but they look pretty unique.

34
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.970
And then we synched up some of those distorted overlays to a really cool audio visual marriage between

35
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.750
those two things.

36
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.370
And we did our lot and we did an ending card with a little bit of mini sound design at the end to cap

37
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.500
off our promo video.

38
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.890
So now let's take a second or a minute to watch our promo edit that we created together.

39
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.520
If yours is done, be sure to export it and share it so that the rest of the students can see the project

40
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.360
that you can created.

41
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.820
And I can give you some feedback on the project.

42
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.480
If you didn't download the footage, you know, footage is there with the same audio that I used, with

43
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.070
the same overlays that I added.

44
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.090
So you can grab that.

45
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.770
Use it for this project.

46
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.010
Use it for other future projects, however you like to do it.

47
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.300
Yeah.

48
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.910
Let's hop into looking at the final edit that we did and then we'll move to the next chapter.

49
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.190
Let me just.

50
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.060
Whoo!

51
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.370
Yes, so there you have it.

52
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:35.240
I hope you took away a lot from this chapter, and I'm excited to hop into the next chapter where we're

53
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.300
going to do another professional level project where I'm going to be supplying you again with the footage

54
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.320
and assets.

55
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.390
And together we're going to edit a high end real estate walk through.

56
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.570
I think this place that I shot this walkthrough of is like a 30 million dollar real estate property.

57
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.180
So it should be really fun.

58
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.180
EDIT We're going to choose the music, we're going to choose the shots, we're going to assemble the

59
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.730
edit together and should be a lot of new learning and techniques in this chapter.

60
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.320
So I will see you there.
