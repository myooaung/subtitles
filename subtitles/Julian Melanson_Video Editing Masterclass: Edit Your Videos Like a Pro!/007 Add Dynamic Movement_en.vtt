1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.100
So our edit is looking pretty good.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.360
I see that a lot.

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.950
But we make a lot of pretty good edits.

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.360
So what I did since the last time I saw you a few seconds ago was I labeled a few of these clips in

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.350
this timeline yellow.

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.470
And what I want to teach in this lesson is and we've turc we've touched on it before.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.330
We're not going to do warp stabilization for this edit because we've already done that a ton in previous

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.720
edits.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.130
But I want to dive even more into scaling and using the position parameters, among other things, to

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.920
add a little bit of extra sauce to our edit.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.650
So all of these yellow ones, we're going to do a little quick pass on scaling attribute.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.310
So we have our intro bio shots.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.950
These are great.

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.910
We don't need to touch them.

15
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.080
But let's think of this first shot.

16
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.540
So you can see it's a push in shot on a Steadicam.

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.640
And there's a few things going on.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.800
There's Vtes photographer shooting photos, so you can kind of see the flash right here.

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.780
So I want to actually use that moment to scale up the image.

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.190
So I'll explain what I mean.

21
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.390
So we have this image and then now we have two clips.

22
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
So on the second one, let's put this to let's say one 20 ANGAU here.

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.270
So now we have.

24
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.060
So it kind of adds to the actual edit, it takes, you know, that flashiness, there was kind of a

25
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.070
distraction like this.

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.530
And when we scale it up.

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.190
OK, cool.

28
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.120
That's looking really good.

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.980
That's adding some style and some feeling.

30
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.430
So what I'm also going to do is go to the beginning of this clip, add a scaling keyframe.

31
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.790
Go to the end of the clip.

32
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.910
Scale it up to, let's say, one seven.

33
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020
And we don't want to cut off his feet.

34
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.970
So let's do a position key frame as well.

35
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:11.660
And go down as we're scaling in, and now that pushing is even more intense at the top, you can see

36
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.830
these moving as we go forward.

37
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.990
So let's do that same thing to this next.

38
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.660
Part of the clip, we'll go from 120 to 127.

39
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.570
And let's see.

40
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.710
OK, cool.

41
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.540
I'm liking that.

42
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.360
And we have our next one right here.

43
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.360
Yes.

44
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.460
So for this moment, let's try and do is zoom out.

45
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.030
I don't know.

46
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.630
Let's see.

47
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.710
So I'm going to go to the beginning of the clip, go to, let's say, 115.

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.070
Go to the end.

49
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.140
Go to a hundred.

50
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.470
OK.

51
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.960
That's cool.

52
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.430
So without this and then with.

53
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.760
There's just a little bit more electricity and energy in that shot with that movement.

54
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.340
Now I could bring it up even more by adding a position key frame at the beginning.

55
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.190
Have it start over here.

56
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.940
And zoom in even more.

57
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.070
OK, I'm liking that.

58
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.240
So let's scrub forward.

59
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.170
Yeah.

60
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.570
So we have this shot, this one right here.

61
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.280
This one I know I want to have a zoom out because we kind of have this pause in the song.

62
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:58.910
He stops the performance and then we go right back into a striking point in the track.

63
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.710
So we go to the first part hit scale, go to the part where right before we cut to this next shot,

64
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.600
do another scale keyframe.

65
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.900
I'm going to zoom way in like, let's say one 30.

66
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.840
OK, too much.

67
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.420
Let's do 120.

68
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.920
OK, that's a little too much.

69
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.130
I still say it's too one 15.

70
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.860
OK, cool.

71
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.600
I'm liking that.

72
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.160
Now, this shot.

73
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.480
I know I want to have a zoom in for here, and it's really amazing what just a simple zoom in, zoom

74
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.850
out additions can really just add because, you know, there's a nice little push and you can see the

75
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.660
camera is slowly moving towards our subject.

76
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.070
But we're going to take that movement that's naturally there in camera when we were actually shooting.

77
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.560
And we're just going to multiply its intensity by adding this digital zoom and movement and post-production.

78
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.870
Nice, so those flow way more, you can see the animation that's going on there, the key framing that's

79
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.320
happening.

80
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.590
So if I go ahead and take these off by right clicking and removing the motion attribute.

81
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.490
And if I put it back

82
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.690
way cooler, way more juicy, is I right?

83
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.810
So now I think the last one that needed a little extra something.

84
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.170
Yeah.

85
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.290
Is this final zoom.

86
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.580
Is this final ending shot so.

87
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.280
Yeah.

88
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.700
I don't know if we necessarily need a zoom out, but I think that what I want to do here is a time remapping

89
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.090
shot.

90
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.750
So we've done this before together.

91
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.650
I'm going to go to right click the clip, go to show click keyframes, go to time remapping.

92
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:24.550
And right on that ending note, I want to have a cool just hyper fast.

93
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.610
This is kind of pull out because there's a natural that I just want to speed up this motion so it has

94
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.780
a little bit more intensity.

95
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.800
So.

96
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.170
Let's see.

97
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.880
OK, let's make it a little bit more gradual.

98
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.820
OK.

99
00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.660
OK, cool.

100
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.180
So that just adds a little bit more of a cool kind of glitchy ness a little bit at the end.

101
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:13.210
So we have a fast kind of whip zoom out at the end and we have a really cool zoom push in at the beginning.

102
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.620
Perfect.

103
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.370
So we just went through and updated about five or six of these clips that were lined up with important

104
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.730
striking moments, important beats in our track.

105
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.330
And by doing these updates, we made those moments in the track feel a lot more cool.

106
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.660
And so let's hop into the next video lesson where we're going to continue to refine this edit.
