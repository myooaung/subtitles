00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.810
Now, we have a lot of takes for the end of this intro sequence of me doing the snap thing where I'm

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.890
going to show the beginning, the before and after of here and here.

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.870
You can see here, we've got a lot of takes of this, OK?

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.280
Ooh, such a big difference.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.180
And that's a good thing to do.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.270
So that while you're filming, you do multiple takes so that in this editing process, we have different

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.380
ones to work with.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
And you want to find the one that has the right energy and the right vibe, kind of like picking the

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.080
right music for your track.

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.350
The music sets, the tone, the different takes that you have.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.900
Each take kind of has its own mini tone.

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.690
That's adding to the larger tone of the overall video.

13
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.150
So you can choose the proper take.

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
I'm not going to bore your ears with going through all of these different takes that I did.

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.640
But what I want to show you is something that you can do temporarily while you're building out your

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.750
rough edit or pulling your selects and map out what your video is going to look like before necessarily

17
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.300
having the shots ready to be dropped in.

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:12.360
So clearly by my dialogue, you can hear that I'm going to show right here this on that snap, I'm going

19
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
to show up before a shot of my studio like this.

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.170
So I just cut out the video.

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.270
I made a blank screen and made it look like this.

22
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.660
And clearly on that second snap, it's going to be an aftershock.

23
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:36.690
Now, temporarily, we can put in text where our video would later be dropped in that way when we're

24
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.890
going through our rough edit.

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.710
We know ahead of time that when we find that proper clips later in the edit boom, we can drop it in

26
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.270
where the text is acting as a temporary placeholder for that shot.

27
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.810
So I'm going to type in before shot.

28
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.810
OK, we can kind of scale this down.

29
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.230
We don't need to be so big.

30
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.630
And I'm going to select it in the effects panel.

31
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:13.440
And I personally like to bring down these temporary placeholder shots down to the bottom middle of the

32
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.920
frame.

33
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.250
You can put it in the center.

34
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.130
You can have it centered in the center of the frame.

35
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.940
You can have it low.

36
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.730
You can have it high.

37
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.050
I like it at the bottom.

38
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.410
It makes it easier for me, my brain, to kind of compute that.

39
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:34.500
But let's go ahead and put it down and then we'll have it just filling the empty space this and made

40
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.300
it look like this.

41
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.560
And for that, we can go ahead and copy this text layer by holding all clicking and dragging, and then

42
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.230
we'll put it for the text tool.

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.080
And I'm going to change the text to after shot.

44
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.950
OK.

45
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.550
And because we changed the amount of characters.

46
00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.430
OK, this now I'm going to put the take that I think fits best from these different examples.

47
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.440
Who are the magic of film being able to time travel?

48
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.170
Yeah, I got a lot of work to do.

49
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.830
And then, boom, the music would start.

50
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.560
The actual video itself would start, and that would be kind of the intro hook of the rest of the YouTube

51
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.980
video.

52
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.490
So if you wanted to, you can even put me in sequence, just so you know that that's where the bulk

53
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.320
of the video is actually going to start.

54
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.540
So the real takeaway here is choosing the right takes, using the waveforms to really ninja your way

55
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.760
forward quicker in your edit to get rid of what you don't need rather than mindlessly scrubbing through

56
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.020
and just looking at the visuals.

57
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.720
And it's a great technique as well, to use text title cards as a temporary placeholder of what you

58
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.240
want to add in later in the edit.
