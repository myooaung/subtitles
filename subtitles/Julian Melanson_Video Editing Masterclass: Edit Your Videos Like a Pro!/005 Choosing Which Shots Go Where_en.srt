1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,720
Now we are at a party in the edit where we're about a minute in, so we've been working on everything

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,770
up to a minute now.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,350
And yeah, we're at a part in the song actually, where the energy gets picked way up.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,180
There was like the mysterious intro, and then the bee kind of came in and we started to pick up the

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,830
pacing.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,340
We did a few things with film burns, and now we're at a song which I actually marked here Yellow.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,540
So here's the track, this yellow part you're going to hear.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,780
So I want you to listen and hear the audible change.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,000
So actually, let's listen to it before we actually see what happens.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,910
So pay attention to what happens here as you sift and sort through them like clouds passing in your

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,450
sky.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,860
See the sun setting and twinkle lights near?

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,450
Another sky full of lights, TerraMar.

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:01,290
OK, so it just dropped in to a completely different, you know, different kind of dreamy, mystical

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,260
ness that wasn't this kind of low thing.

16
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,840
This is how I feel things as an editor.

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,970
Like when I hear a sound, it either goes up or goes down or it's spiky or it's soft and it's round.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,680
Write it down.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,490
So, yes, you want to be sensitive to these kind of vibe changes.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,600
And let's see what we chose to add as our visual.

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:34,210
To further tell the story of the change that happens right here in this part of the video as you sift

22
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,060
and sort through them like clouds passing in your sky.

23
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,370
See the sun setting?

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,590
And twinkle lights, mirrors.

25
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:51,960
Another sky full of lights, Jeremih remained where she and North Star.

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,010
OK, so there's like some symbology stuff going on here.

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,110
We have these exciting sparkler shots.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,130
And if you look at these and I don't know why it's having this weird glitch that's not in the final

29
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,520
edit, that weird graininess, not supposed to be that.

30
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,200
So for me, it is doing something weird.

31
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:20,640
But anyways, this you know, this looks like what this sound in the audio sounds like and twinkle like

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,360
two mirrors.

33
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,540
Plus she is saying and twinkle lights here.

34
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,740
And these are twinkle lights.

35
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,610
So, yeah, there's a metaphor thing going on and then there's a literal thing going on.

36
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:36,270
But this is a subtle vibe change that we are paying attention to at this level of being a video editor

37
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,070
to create that special moment.

38
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,060
So we have boom, this electric excitement in the track and twinkle.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,990
Others and then a more introspective curiosity line that she delivers right here.

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,990
Either sky full of lights.

41
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:06,690
Germany made very similar style, and then we have this crazy looking dear mermaid shot, so we're not

42
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,710
showing this at Mermaid Dear Mermaid, we're not showing this a dear mermaid.

43
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,570
We're showing the frickin mermaid like amazing shot at that point.

44
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,230
Right.

45
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,840
And then she's talking about where is your North Star?

46
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:26,550
We have this very star esque looking reflection of light coming in through the water as she's touching

47
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,660
it.

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,390
So that's the kind of metaphoric thing that I was talking about.

49
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,220
By doing this, you make people feel what the audio is wanting them to feel.

50
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,670
Right.

51
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,340
So and if we go here, we also have a little bit of subtle overlays.

52
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,770
Now, these are different than film birds.

53
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,130
These are much more of like filming something through a glass type of prism.

54
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,490
There's no burned red orange tones like a traditional overlay.

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:05,010
But they have this really cool crystal type of appearance and they are overlaid on top of these shots.

56
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,170
So if I remove them.

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,060
To Mary.

58
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,170
And twinkle like to Mary.

59
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,670
Either, Scott, you can see this whole sequence loses its energy and twinkle nightmarishly.

60
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,950
Scott?

61
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,340
Full of lights.

62
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,500
So like I mentioned, you don't put film burns and overlay it just on every shot.

63
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:37,640
You do it consciously to further make the specific shots look better.

64
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,310
Whether they need it for a transition into a different kind of sequence or the shots just feel a little

65
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,840
bit dull.

66
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,560
So let's keep moving here and we'll get more into some overlays.
