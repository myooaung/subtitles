1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,970
So you've taken the fire footage that I've supplied and you've edited it together, you have a music

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,540
track.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,110
Don't worry if it's not a masterpiece yet.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,660
Don't worry, we'll get to creating a masterpiece as we go through this course.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,150
But now I want to have you see the edit that you created.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,360
And I want to show you edits from other students that have used the same exact footage as you.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,120
And let's see what kind of conclusion we come up with after viewing some of these other examples.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,420
Get ready.

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,690
OK.

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,280
Super high energy edit this one is kind of the exact opposite.

11
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,500
Very slow, very thoughtful.

12
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,800
Super Bowl track on that one, I love the laidback style.

13
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,890
Now let's get into another edit name for me.

14
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,980
Remember the name?

15
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,150
Nancy?

16
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,150
No.

17
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,910
The.

18
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,740
OK, so we just saw a few of those submissions, and you should probably be seeing a trend here.

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,810
Same exact footage.

20
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,610
Different editor.

21
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,100
Completely different final product.

22
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,390
So there's two reasons that I wanted to put this at the very beginning of the course.

23
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,630
One, to give you something fun, easy and quick to do to get, you know, a little bit of serotonin,

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,880
a little bit of dopamine hit, a little bit of excitement, you know, on the psychology side, so that

25
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:57,670
you are incentivized to continue to go to the cause and then to it's a long roundabout way of explaining

26
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:06,400
and giving you the realization that every person has their own unique taste, aesthetic and sense of

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,870
what they feel.

28
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,540
Looks good, sounds good and feels good.

29
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:19,480
So the whole goal of this first exercise is for you to really embody and lock in that realization and

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,250
find out that your specific unique look style and feel the more that you hone in on that, the more

31
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,230
that's going to become your trademark, your your ability and your persona as a video editor.

32
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,220
Regardless, if you do like blogs or tutorials or documentaries, you're going to find a specific look

33
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,410
in all great artists have a specific look, and that's what made them rise to fame.

34
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,010
It's not about being famous, but you you develop a certain characteristic that when someone sees that,

35
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,860
they see, oh, yeah, that's so and so's painting.

36
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,770
And then people really start to resonate and like that specific look that they get regularly from that

37
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,310
person.

38
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,910
Your favorite directors, your favorite films have a specific look that that director or producer usually

39
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,650
has across all their videos.

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,240
And you come back to them and you view their art because you love that feeling.

41
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,029
So the feeling that you love, naturally, the more you can hone in on that throughout this course,

42
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,320
the more other people see that they'll resonate with it.

43
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,930
And then there's a lot of benefit from that.

44
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,540
You get to create art that inspires you.

45
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,030
You don't have to go and follow other trends and the other things that people are doing because it's

46
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,350
popular at the moment.

47
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,890
No, you want to create your own personal trend in style that other people will see and be inspired

48
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,210
by.

49
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,540
That's the first part.

50
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,830
The second part is that you develop that look style and feel clients will see that and they'll say,

51
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,580
hey, I loved what you did with this video, in this video, in this video.

52
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:06,520
I want to pay you to do that style for my product or service or website or any kind of thing that that

53
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,130
client has and that they're willing to pay you for to create content and a video for.

54
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:21,610
So I really hope that this beginning exercise really opens you up to the type of expansion and exciting

55
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,770
stuff that we're going to learn together in this course.

56
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,000
So that wraps it up for this first chapter.

57
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,800
And in the next chapter, we're going to dive into some beginner level exciting editing fundamentals.
