00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.450
Now, let's continue to move forward in this edit, and now I want to talk about overlays so we can

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.330
see here and actually you can also just take notice of looking at our pacing change.

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.240
We're going shot cha cha cha cha cha cha shots compared to the intro where here you can actually see

4
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.590
in the timeline that you can see these beats, right.

5
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.300
These moments where she's speaking.

6
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.620
Boom, boom.

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.280
They look like big mountains in our audio.

8
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.180
And you can see this kind of smooth audio at this park.

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.880
And we have a lot slower or less amount of shots at this smooth part.

10
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.620
And as the energy picks up in her voice, boom, boom, boom.

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.210
So that's just something to take notice of.

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:58.320
We're analyzing, watching and listening to the audio and reading that audio waveform almost as a I'm

13
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.190
doing this a lot now.

14
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.540
I don't know.

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.910
I almost as a sheet of music that's showing us how the edit should come together.

16
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.380
Now, that's not always was we talking about, but what we want to talk about is overlays.

17
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.170
So let's take a look at this shot, taking a deep breath and bring honor and dignity to your spine.

18
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.460
Breathe out.

19
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.080
Without.

20
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.990
OK, so I'm sure you noticed these nice, cool looking.

21
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.770
I'm going to have to turn down the resolution because these are such high res files, it's starting

22
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.960
to make my computer all the fan on my computer is going crazy, but it's actually starting to make the

23
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.620
screen capture.

24
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.550
Lagan and I don't want it.

25
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.240
Lagging for your enjoyment is not good.

26
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.640
So I'm going to turn that down to half.

27
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.300
And yeah, let's take a look at these overlays.

28
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.790
So if I double click this overlay, it's going to bring it up over here.

29
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.000
And this is essentially what I'm adding on top of the footage.

30
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.750
This one is another one that we have right here.

31
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.440
It's filling this part of the frame.

32
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.759
Looks really nice.

33
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.870
But by itself, it doesn't look all that interesting.

34
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.510
So what are we doing here?

35
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.790
So basically, I have this overlay.

36
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.360
And by itself, it just has a black background.

37
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.840
But if I click it, go up to the effects control.

38
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.390
Go down to the blending mode, which we've discussed.

39
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.970
Oh, I promise it was not going to repeat that.

40
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.980
OK, but yes, go to the blending mode.

41
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.610
And my favorite is you screen for film burns and other overlays that are similar.

42
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.780
We can use lighton.

43
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.360
It'll just slightly change the way it looks.

44
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.850
It isn't ever look as natural to me.

45
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.180
For me, like I don't like that.

46
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.960
If we did darken, it would completely change the vibe completely.

47
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.870
We don't want that.

48
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.220
If we did add I don't like that because it over exposes the footage too much.

49
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.160
You could see all this green and that's just not a good look.

50
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.750
So for film burns, I always use screen as the blending mode.

51
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.460
That's what's creating this really cool, sunny, warm kind of feeling.

52
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.930
Now, you don't want to just put film burns wherever in the edit.

53
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.730
You want to do it intentionally.

54
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.130
Same with all transitions it with all overlays.

55
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.190
The reason I decided to add it here is because the coloring of this footage is like, look at the warmth

56
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.480
and the light in this shot.

57
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.440
And if you see this shot, it's got plenty of feeling and color going on.

58
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:57.530
But if I were to remove these two overlays when it comes to these shots, there is just something missing.

59
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.670
Even with the color correction, I mean, this is without color correction.

60
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.530
There's a lot missing there.

61
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.850
But with the color correction frame on intimidators, we just needed something.

62
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.890
So, boom, we drop in these overlays to your spine.

63
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.150
And it takes a little bit of fine tuning, you know, you can, you know, drag them out and find the

64
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.350
right moment of the visual that you want to have.

65
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.860
Like, you know, there's different moments with the film burns that you can move around and sync them

66
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.100
up so that they come on into screen, you know, synched up to the words or to the music.

67
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.940
Without.

68
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.060
So that was the process there.

69
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:59.490
Now they do work well also for creating a kind of transition between shots.

70
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.960
So this is going to come up and boom, as the flash from the film is going away.

71
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.180
That's a perfect time to go into your next cut, boom.

72
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.770
So without.

73
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.650
It's OK.

74
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.830
Not bad, but, you know, we're stinking up the movement of our legs here, too, as well.

75
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.340
She's stepping forward and then she's stepping forward here.

76
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.950
So we're completing her motion in two different shots, very similar, actually, to the match cut that

77
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.060
we were talking about between the hand in the hand, little details that make this flow really well,

78
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.910
like these flow seamlessly into each other.

79
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.980
That's why the Matko.

80
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:52.000
What else benefits or takes that to another level is having something like a film burn that's flashing

81
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.540
and right as these to transition into each other.

82
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.670
Wash.

83
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.650
Right.

84
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.220
And we have another film Burn as well, if we scoot forward in the edit.

85
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.220
So close your eyes.

86
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:23.270
OK, so the reason I did that is because this shot is actually is stock footage shot.

87
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.440
So it had the perfect kind of framing that I wanted.

88
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.840
It's a really cool macro kind of feel where all of a sudden this big, beautiful eyes in frame when

89
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.470
she's talking about closing your eyes creates a powerful moment.

90
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:45.380
Now, I did this film Burn, because this is a stock footage shot that didn't really match up with the

91
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
rest of the footage.

92
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.330
So if I hit play.

93
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.180
So we're at the beach.

94
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.940
This has a certain kind of softness to it and coloring.

95
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:04.340
And then we cut to this studio lighting shot of someone's eye is pretty abrupt, especially when we

96
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.890
go to, again, sunny daylily beach footage.

97
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.200
And so, boom, boom, it's OK, you know?

98
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.920
Song.

99
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.690
And close your eyes.

100
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.520
It's OK.

101
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:36.250
But this just seems really out of place, so if I turn back on our film Burns and let it play some and

102
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.310
close your eyes.

103
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:45.290
It really does a good job of blending together and making it more of an artistic cutaway shot than what

104
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.230
the heck, what is this friend am I doing here?

105
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.580
That's definitely not at the beach.

106
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:56.600
So you can use the overlays to create more of a blending between shots, and then you can also use it

107
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:05.630
to warm up the footage, especially because most almost all film burns have that orange reddish tones

108
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.760
that when you drag it in turn the blending mode to screen.

109
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.830
It's going to do a great job of adding those warm tones on top of your footage.
