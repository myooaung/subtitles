1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,410
And I'm going to do one final version of this, which is going to be for more of the tick tock or Instagram

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,880
stories style.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,040
So I'm going to take this sequence that we have.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,650
I'm going to duplicate it one more time.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,120
And the reason we're doing it is so that we have a version of each one.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,570
Here's our 16 by nine.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,310
Here's our four by five.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,900
And then now we're going to do a story slash tick tock.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,510
I'm going to open it up.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,710
I'm going to right click or see Quid's.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:38,220
I'm going to secret settings and I want to type in the proper pixels, which is 80 by 1920.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,080
Boom, nine by 16.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,860
They're really vertical video aspect ratio.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,670
So now we have that same problem that we need to fix.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,420
Boom.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,710
There we go.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:58,050
Now, I will say that when you're going from 16 by nine to nine by 16, you're going to have to manually

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,160
kind of go in and scooch a few things around.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:11,580
For example, a lot of these are looking good, but let's say let's say let's say this shot.

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,680
We don't want to just see our characters laig.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm going to go to the beginning of this clip.

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,240
Create a cut

23
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,650
scroll to the end.

24
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:34,250
And just independently scoot over this clip to let's just say they're OK.

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,480
And for this one as well, we could scoot this over.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,670
Boom.

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,920
So it's going to be a trade off.

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:54,240
Like it'll be a perfect ratio with no black bars on the top or bottom like some people do on their posts.

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,160
It's going to fit perfectly.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:03,030
But the tradeoff is that you're going to lose a lot of what's on the side, because we're changing the

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,310
aspect ratio so drastically.

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,020
So let's say that we went through and manually did this process of updating the individual shots that

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,920
needed to be moved.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,090
And we're ready to explore it.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,930
We can do the same process.

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,800
So we're going to go to Mobile 10 ATP.

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,280
We're going to make sure that the audio is set too high and the bit rate is at 320.

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,930
We're going to match our source sequence settings when you use maximum random depth and quality.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:46,500
We're going to go up and we're going to take this into story story.

40
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,500
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,840
Story in Tic-Tac.

42
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,240
And the year is three thousand thirty, which is perfect.

43
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,380
Add it to the Q.

44
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,230
Hit play, so that goes.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,350
And now what we're going to have is our costume demo reel that we created together in three different

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,400
formats, ready to be shared on three different platforms.

47
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,840
So if I go to my exports folder, you can see we have our main Vimeo version.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,020
Ready to go?

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,030
And we have our normal Instagram post version.

50
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,360
And then we have our tick tock Instagram story version as well.

51
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:50,080
Perfect, so that wraps it up for our demo reel lessons.

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,060
I really hope you enjoyed it and I really hope you have some new tips and techniques and that you're

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:02,470
able to land higher paying clients and make, you know, overall a more impressive demo reel that shares

54
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,520
your work in the absolute best light possible.
