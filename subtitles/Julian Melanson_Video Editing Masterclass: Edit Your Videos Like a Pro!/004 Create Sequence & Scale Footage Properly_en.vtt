00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.580
Let's now start from the very beginning by creating our secrets.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.850
Now, there's a few different ways you can do this.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.430
If I enlarge the project panel here on premiere, we can see that the frame rate of our footage here,

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.140
mainly it's twenty nine point nine seven.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
That's the average frame rate for most smartphones.

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.880
Some of them in here are slightly different frame rates.

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.820
I think that's because they came from.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.790
OK, yeah, that's because they were boomerangs from Instagram.

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.290
So it's going to be a different frame rate.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.000
That's not that big of a deal.

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.630
And then we can also see here our resolution.

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.980
See for this scenario, I shot all this footage vertical.

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.490
So yours will either likely be 10, 18 by 19, 20.

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.090
That's 10 18 pixels wide by nine, 19, 120 pixels vertical.

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.450
The standard 16 by nine aspect ratio is the exact opposite, which is 19, 20 by 10 eight.

16
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.660
I know that I'm going to want to do it as a vertical aspect ratio so that it'll show up on social media

17
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.290
as the vertical format, just like the way you hold your phone vertically.

18
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:24.690
So what I'm going to do is choose the video file that has the frame rate and the resolution that I know

19
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.850
I want the rest of my sequence to be.

20
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.240
And the reason we're doing that is because whatever sequence settings you have when you drag in your

21
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.530
other footage, it's going to basically adhere to those original sequence settings.

22
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.270
Makes sense.

23
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.410
OK.

24
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.290
So what I'm going to do is click that video file that I want the sequence from.

25
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.940
I'm going to right click it and I'm going to click new sequence from click.

26
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.970
So now what this did is two things.

27
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.530
It brought in my video file into my new sequence.

28
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.110
And it default labeled my sequence the name of the video file that I used to create that sequence.

29
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.700
So we want to do something here.

30
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.540
And that thing we want to do is title this sequence, as you can see with the little symbols that these

31
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.040
are all video files.

32
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.120
That's a boomerang.

33
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.240
So it shows up as a slightly different video file icon.

34
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.290
And this icon here is the sequence icon.

35
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.800
Now, it's a little bit confusing, just taking a glance at this.

36
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
We can't really find our main sequence very quickly.

37
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.440
So what we always want to do is title our sequence generally.

38
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.030
I personally title it main sequence.

39
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.110
You'll see why we do that.

40
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.440
But you can title it main edit, you know, main footage, whatever you want it to be.

41
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.240
And now what I'm going to do is drag that sequence outside of the footage folder and to keep things

42
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.590
even more organized.

43
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.560
We're going to make a sequences folder, because as we build this out, you're going to find out that

44
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880
we're going to have multiple different sequences, especially the more complex your edits get.

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.120
OK.

46
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.720
So let's go to our main sequence here.

47
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.080
You can see we have our first video file that's dropped into our edit.

48
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.300
Now, if we go to our footage or simply going to highlight the rest of our video files from our footage

49
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.240
folder, and we're going to drag that in as well.

50
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.080
OK, so as you can see, like I was mentioning, some of the video files are different settings.

51
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.610
That's why we chose the sequence, the that's why we chose the file that we wanted to create the sequence

52
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.330
settings from.

53
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.820
But the ones that were different aren't fitting.

54
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.550
So the next step to fix that is to highlight these files.

55
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.410
And the easiest way to do it is to scale it, to frame size.

56
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.470
What that's just saying is you're saying that I want the computer to take the size of this other stuff

57
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.000
that doesn't match the sequence settings.

58
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.340
So this is confusing, but it all makes sense.

59
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.920
Doesn't match the sequence settings you click.

60
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.800
Scale this frame size or set the frame size.

61
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.660
Boom.

62
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.350
That's going to automatically snap it to fit the rest of your sequence.

63
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.399
OK.

64
00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:26.160
And I'm going to kind of just skip forward ahead here and see if there's any other ones that aren't

65
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.610
matching.

66
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.340
And yet we have this one here.

67
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.230
It looks like it was shot on a different phone.

68
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.050
So I'm going to hit scale to frame size.

69
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.600
And I think there's one more here.

70
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.120
And I'm going to hit scale to frame size.

71
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.480
Now, you can see that this did something interesting here, because this is a normal horizontal aspect

72
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.650
ratio clip here.

73
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.700
What it did is it scaled the edges of the video to the edges of the sequence.

74
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.450
Now, that's a problem in this case, because if it was rotated this way and it scaled it up, it would

75
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.680
have fit perfectly right.

76
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.890
But this is shot at a different aspect ratio.

77
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.070
So when I hit scale to frame size, it's still leaving these black bars at the bottom and the top of

78
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.670
the screen.

79
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:22.410
So in this very specific scenario, this is where you will select that clip, go up to motion and you'll

80
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.880
scale it up manually.

81
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.380
As you can see.
