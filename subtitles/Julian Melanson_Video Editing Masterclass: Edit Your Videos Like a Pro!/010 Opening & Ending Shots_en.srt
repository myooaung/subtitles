1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:08,730
And so depending on the type of travel video you've been editing during, this whole portion is really

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,490
going to dictate what your opening shot is going to be.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:21,150
And something I want to mention is the same way that every single shot has a beginning and end, every

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,550
single video that you create has a beginning and end.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,280
I know this sounds obvious, but the reason I'm saying is because we just went through on how the beginning

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,340
cut and the ending cut is so important because you're showing the person where is important, what is

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,650
important to start looking at, and then what is important to end looking at or end hearing.

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,970
It can be an audio thing.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,340
A dialogue thing can be a visual thing.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,760
Our whole video is like a zoomed out view of what happens in one edit.

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,770
I don't want to get too abstract here, but we want to start with the shot that really like sets things

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,720
into gear, sets things in motion.

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,860
The opening shot of your video, regardless of if it's a music video, commercial comedy documentary,

14
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,840
YouTube video, Instagram video.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,370
Take that video.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,950
Does it matter?

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,620
The opening frame, the opening shot dictates the tone and the vibe and the feeling that the viewer

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,000
is going to have for the rest of the video.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,700
The ending shot is kind of the conclusion.

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,890
It's what they walk away with.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,360
So something a little bit deeper to really ponder and think about that.

22
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,670
But let's get more back into the practical side.

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,260
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to scrub through and I'm going to find the shot that really

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,150
grabs me, because if it grabs me, yeah, OK.

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,810
If it's grabbing me and my attention, it's a good sign that hopefully can grab someone else's attention

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,590
and get them interested in your video, because that's the whole point.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:51,870
Right.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,610
So this is definitely a contender.

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,260
I like this.

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,660
I think it's a unique type of shot.

31
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,240
I mean, the scenery is like just ridiculous.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,650
We don't want to get too much down into like, uh, too low here.

33
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,030
So maybe we'll start the shot.

34
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,110
Let's say there so that we get the vibe, the kind of point of view feeling.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,060
That's an example of continuing to refine when we did this first pass, like, OK, in and out, in

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,750
and out, in and out.

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,910
Now, on the second time when I'm looking at that shot, it was starting with a little bit too much

38
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,490
leg, a little bit too much leg action going on.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,420
So what I'm going to do is because this one catches my eye the most, I'm going to slide this over to

40
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,860
the very beginning of our edit.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,760
That way, we open up on this shot and it really sets the tone and the feeling for what the rest of

42
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,760
the video is going to look like, and if it's obvious the clip is too loud, we can bring that down

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,880
a little bit by clicking and holding that white bar.

44
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,060
But I don't want you to worry too much about getting the audio levels perfect, because that's one of

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,370
the final stages of creating the edit.
