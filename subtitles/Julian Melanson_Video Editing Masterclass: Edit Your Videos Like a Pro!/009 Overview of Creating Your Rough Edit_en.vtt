00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.490
So how is your edit been going so far?

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.330
Good.

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.920
OK, perfect.

4
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.320
So now we've made it to our next step.

5
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.830
Now that we pulled our selects successfully, we're going to be moving to creating our rough edit.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.760
Now, in this phase, this is the stage where we're going to put shots roughly where they're supposed

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.120
to be.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.420
And we're not going to focus too much right now on fine tuning, on things like coloring, on things

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.110
like exposure or matching or getting any of the real nitty gritty.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.440
Right.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.890
Yet we're just really going to build a basic foundation.

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.600
OK, we're going to build the skeleton with the low frequency of cutting so that the main concept of

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.610
the overall video can be seen.

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.690
So if we were editing to a soundtrack, if we were editing to a storyline, we want to try and get all

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.310
the spots in our timeline.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.630
Hopefully the correct order and fill any blank screens.

17
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.650
So we want to line things up.

18
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.910
For example, like I mentioned a voiceover, we're not going to be doing a voiceover for this one just

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.120
yet, but we're going to place our B roll on top.

20
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.070
This specific example doesn't really have any role.

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.110
We'll get more into that.

22
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.170
And we want to get our right shot ordering together.

23
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.760
And next, because, you know, I love doing these backups.

24
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.940
Then I've learned time and time again over the years doing these little extra copy, duplicate paste,

25
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.100
put in the folder.

26
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.430
Nothing to worry about.

27
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.300
You're good.

28
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.770
We're going to do a another backup of our rough edit sequence.

29
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.950
Once that's done, because, of course, it's always a good idea to duplicate your sequence before going

30
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.360
in and making big changes.

31
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.340
And once the rough edit is done, that is the perfect time to step away from the project and take a

32
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.890
little break and come back with fresh eyes.

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.690
It's also an optional time where you can get client feedback, team feedback, friends and family feedback

34
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.290
on the edit.

35
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.320
Just to get another perspective of how the basic, basic rough edit is looking.

36
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.230
Before going into fine tuning, there's a.

37
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.620
How do I say there's a phase of editing down the road on the more refining side, when you start really

38
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.720
spending minutes, hours, days, sometime on 10 second sequences in this rough edit phase before we

39
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.380
get to that.

40
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.930
We want to make sure the whole thing cohesively is making sense and is telling the story that we want

41
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.400
to be told before getting to that phase.

42
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.540
So that's why after we finish this next section, it's a good time to take a break, come back with

43
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.790
fresh eyes and look at it with a brand new perspective, because once you're sitting in front of the

44
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.150
laptop for a while and you've been looking at the same frames, you start to go blind in certain ways

45
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.160
and you start to go deaf in certain ways.

46
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.400
So as we go deeper into that, you'll start to see.

47
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.840
But we're not quite there yet.

48
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.180
So in this next step, we're going to create and assemble our rough edit.
