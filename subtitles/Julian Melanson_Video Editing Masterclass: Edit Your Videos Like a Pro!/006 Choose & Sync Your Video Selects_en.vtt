00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.670
Now that we've learned how to change the frame rate for our slow motion clips and we've created our

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.290
proxies if needed, it's time to pull our Selex of our content.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.140
So I'm going to go to the footage that I want to start with.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.820
For me in particular, it's going to be my intro shots intro, because it's going to be at the beginning

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.360
of the video.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.150
So it makes the most logical sense, Stent's.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.640
It makes the most logical sense to start with.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.250
That content, depending on what footage you're working with, is going to dictate which footage you

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.870
start to edit with.

10
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.580
So I'm going to select all these files in our intro folder.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.290
I'm going to right click.

12
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.160
And I'm going to create a new sequence from all of these clips.

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.860
That way it's going to drop all my intro shots into one timeline.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:58.910
Now, you can see that the clips that we previously labeled as our slow motion buro shots are already

15
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.660
separated by color and they're slowed down, which will be perfect for our edit now, because we've

16
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.780
already done a lot of work in real time of this pulling Selex process previously in the course.

17
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.990
I'm probably going to speed this up because we don't need because you don't need to be sitting through

18
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.480
me pulling Selex on literally over two hours of footage.

19
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.920
So I'm going to add a little time lapse here while I'm getting to work and throw on some good music

20
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.700
for you to listen to.

21
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.220
Perfect.

22
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.110
And as I'm pulling Selex here, this is actually the perfect.

23
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.800
I just said perfect twice.

24
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:58.810
This is a great opportunity for me to share an excellent technique for synchronizing shots from different

25
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.070
camera angles.

26
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.170
Now, remember, at the beginning of this project, when we waiting for our editing software to generate

27
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.300
our peak files, that's these files right here.

28
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.570
These are the waveform files that show you the information in the audio layer.

29
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.920
Now, what we're looking at here is angles from the same scene from two different shots.

30
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.420
OK.

31
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.090
So if we go here, we have our top layer.

32
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.030
And if I turn off that top layer, we have our bottom layer.

33
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.450
Now, these are from the same scene.

34
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:41.980
But what I want to do now is to go into this scene and sink these layers so that our audio lines up,

35
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.560
because from one layer, we have the visuals.

36
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.140
We want to use the wishes, this one.

37
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.780
But the audio from that layer of creating the content is really bad, because on the other layer of

38
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.410
footage we have where my lavalier mike that I was wearing was connected to creating the content.

39
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.310
And I want.

40
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.110
So what we want to do is sync up this footage with this great visual, with this footage, with the

41
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.410
great audio that we want to use.

42
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.750
So the process of that is to select the two layers that you want to synchronize.

43
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.850
We're going to right click.

44
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.260
We're going to click synchronize.

45
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.910
And boom, now we have.

46
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.330
I'm going to mute the layer that we don't want the footage from.

47
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.060
I'm going to mutilator that.

48
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.440
We don't want the audio from eating the content.

49
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.610
And I wanted to show and we have the proper angle with great sounding audio.

50
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.810
Now, if I only eat that one and now mute this one.

51
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.240
Behind the scenes, that's original.

52
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.100
We're working with that we want to use.

53
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.470
So we got our job done.

54
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.260
But now there's a problem.

55
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.950
If I undo this and we go back.

56
00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:02.170
You can see that when we synched it, this layer hopped over and actually overwrote, deleted, you

57
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.600
know, this layer footage that we don't want to delete.

58
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.370
So the way around that is to always make sure the top layer you're working with is in front of the layer

59
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.570
you're synching it with.

60
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.709
Now, if we do that same exact process I had synchronize it scooting over the top layer.

61
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.190
We're not deleting anything behind it.

62
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.750
And we still got to sink how our clips.

63
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.430
OK, so now what I'm going to do is that same process.

64
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.170
So I'm going to go ahead and scoot everything over.

65
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.210
Bring over our top layer.

66
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:47.020
Put it in front or before chronologically this clip so that it doesn't push back this clip into what's

67
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.510
behind it.

68
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.670
So no go.

69
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.030
And I'm going to right click it, synchronize boom.

70
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.170
And there we go.

71
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.800
As we can see, it's lined up the audio waveforms.

72
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.930
And the reason I don't just go and select all of these clips and just hit synchronize is because in

73
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.920
premiere specifically, I'm not sure about Final Cut Pro, but you can only do two audio waveforms at

74
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.480
a time to synchronize.

75
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.930
So I'm going to go ahead and do this process to the rest of our clips that we want to sync.

76
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.770
Perfect.

77
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.500
So now I have all of our intro shots for the beginning of our vlog with good audio and get all the shots

78
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.800
needed.

79
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.020
So.

80
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.180
And they're synched up and ready for the rest of our selects to be pulled.
