00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.420
So as I've been going through and continuing to pull Selex, I got to a place in the timeline where

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.640
I did a really long recording of one tripod shot.

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.730
Now, you can see here this span, the length of four separate movie files.

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.380
Now, this is a perfect time to dive back into another use for creating a nested sequence.

5
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.690
So first off, what I'm going to do here is create some space in our edit.

6
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.280
I'm going to duplicate these clips because there are some shots in here that I want to just pull out

7
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.320
and have on their own.

8
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.830
Now, the next step is going to be we're going to create a time lapse out of these cliffs.

9
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
And the trick is going to be because we're working with multiple clips this time for the time lapse

10
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.120
instead of one recording.

11
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.470
We're going to nest these four clips together.

12
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.060
So I'm going to select the clips.

13
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.600
Right click hit, nest hit, OK.

14
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:14.160
Now I can go and right click and adjust the speed of all four clips as one main clip.

15
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.430
Otherwise, the process would be selecting all the clips.

16
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.780
You would have to go in, change the speed, move things around.

17
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.200
I already know that I want to treat these as one long time lapse.

18
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.080
So the nesting, what it simply does is allow for me to globally treat the clip as one.

19
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.620
And I can go into the duration and go from a 29 minute clip to, let's say, a 10 second clip.

20
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.760
It OK.

21
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.710
Now, that's going to speed up and create that time lapse or wanting.

22
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:53.640
And the second benefit for nesting it and creating one clip is that now we can smoothly add a change

23
00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.100
in scale or position to all four clips as one.

24
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:09.180
So I'm going to do a keyframe at the beginning and then go to the end and add a 10 point increase in

25
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.420
scale, and then a little bit of a tilt up as well.

26
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.180
So it looks pretty cool.

27
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.520
And we have that nice steady zoom in that we created by scaling up and adding these key frames.

28
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.680
Now, if I didn't do this nesting step, then adding that zoom would be really difficult because I could

29
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.130
go.

30
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:38.460
And then, let's say, put these at the highest speed, close the gap in between them, which would

31
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.200
kind of be doing the same thing.

32
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.840
But if I then wanted to go in and add some change in positioning or scale, once I go to the end of

33
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.170
this clip, finish the scale.

34
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.340
Then when we get to the next of the scale would reset, which, you know, then I could go in to the

35
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.030
beginning of this one and put this scale where the scale ended on a clip like this.

36
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.620
But then I wouldn't have a smooth, gradual key framing change between all the clips, because the clips

37
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.060
are different lengths and so on.

38
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.740
There's tons of problems you would run into.

39
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.730
But the bottom line is, using the Knesset sequence in this way is another great alternative and technique

40
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.940
for putting together a more intermediate level timelapse.
