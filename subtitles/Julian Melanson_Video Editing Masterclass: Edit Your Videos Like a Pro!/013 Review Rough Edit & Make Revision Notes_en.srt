1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,750
OK.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,360
And so now it is time for us to go back and actually watch our full rough edit for the first time.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:15,090
So by now you should have your Selex pull your shot, ordering me your overall pacing, no blank black

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:25,020
screens in your edit, and a decently cohesive video that's ready for you to watch with a neutral perspective

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,830
as if you were a viewer seeing it for the first time.

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,990
OK, so go ahead now.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,340
Pull up your edit, start at the beginning and we're going to play it all the way through.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,450
And we're going to take mental notes here on what sticks out that is working and what sticks out.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,730
That's a little bit more important on what isn't working.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,210
Anything that's distracting, that's a little bit.

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,660
Ooh.

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,510
OK, now I need to change that or that's really not working or this really isn't going to make it into

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,170
the final edit.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,350
You want to sit there and really keep an eye of some squeaky.

15
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,880
You want to sit there and really keep a little mental note, keep track of that.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,110
So in some stuff, that's a little bit more complex.

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:20,560
I personally will start a notes tab on my phone and on my laptop, so I'll go in and let's say Mount

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,310
Shasta.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:32,020
Edit and I'll start a bullet point list of, let's say, for example, 14 seconds, remove shot, and

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,150
then, for example, 30 seconds.

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,370
You know, writing.

22
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,420
So you can kind of either go through pause and put the notes down or watch it all the way through.

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,570
But that's just a little bit of a side protip there that depending on how complex your edit is at this

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,460
beginning stage, we're not getting too complex yet.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,920
So with that said, let's really keep track here mainly of the visual elements that need to be changed.

26
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,190
We're going to do another pass together and work more on the audio.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,940
Fine tuning.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,169
But anything that comes to mind, feel free to take a mental note or jotted down in your notes with

29
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,030
the timestamp.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,870
So let's go.

31
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,110
Now that there's a waterfall.

32
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:54,520
Yeah.

33
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,410
Whenever he has a ready.

34
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,770
OK, cool, so not too bad for a rough edit.

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,170
I feel like it gets the point across and hopefully for your edit as well, you're getting the general

36
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,600
gist of what you want to share across your audience.

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,060
I think this does for the audience.

38
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,890
You get a few of what Mount Shasta is like, what it's like to get out and immerse yourself in nature

39
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,300
out in this location.

40
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,810
Experience the amazing like waterfalls that they have, all that good stuff.

41
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,550
So there were a few things that really stuck out to me.

42
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,950
The first main one besides the audio was this definitely needs some motion.

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,440
This tripod shot at 25 seconds, need some motion.

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,020
So I'm going to say add motion.

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,640
Twenty five seconds.

46
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,220
Definitely at four seconds.

47
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:53,980
I want to replace the audio with something a little bit more Chave like and a little bit more, I don't

48
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,890
know, Mystikal versus people just talking in the background.

49
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,080
That's good.

50
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,660
That's good.

51
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,740
And then as an overall note, that doesn't really need a timestamp, but that I can tell is needed.

52
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,830
Is adding a crossfade of the audio between the different cuts.

53
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,570
So I'm going to add a note in here.

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,240
Add audio.

55
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,820
Cross fades.

56
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,500
OK.
