1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,230
Now, I want to mention one more thing before we go into our next video lesson, so we have this shot

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,870
boom, and then we have these birds that are moving to the upper right part of the frame.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,600
So it's like there's a line, a curve being drawn like this if you watch this image.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,680
There's a curve in your tummy.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,810
And in the following image, see this curve, your eyes are going to be along this line.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,250
I guarantee you're not looking over here on the top left.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,880
I guarantee you're not really looking over here in the top middle.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,150
Your eye is going to be drawn to do this.

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,170
Push your house.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,920
In the next image, we have a curvy line made by our subject's body.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,590
This is another great example of a matko.

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,940
So these shots really blend together with the Filburn with the match cut.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,650
The motion of the subject is also going to the top, right?

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,060
So we're going to the right, to the right, to the right, basically.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,780
And then.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,600
And the other thing that we're doing here, like what we mentioned before, is she's doing a movement

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,320
but doesn't complete the movement, which leads into the movement of the next shot, which leads into

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,610
the movement of the next shot.

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,210
If you want to make it clunky, you can skew things over, skew things over, skew things over.

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,650
Let it play.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,480
Allow your tummy to relax in your breath, to flow naturally.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,390
Which so that was not terrible, but it just didn't have a very good flow.

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:48,770
This movement looked OK, but didn't lead into the next movement, and that movement didn't really lead

24
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,550
into this movement.

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,100
So let's undo that and check it out again.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,870
You're telling me to relax.

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,850
In your back to flow naturally.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,640
What's showing up to you today?

29
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:09,080
Perfect, so you don't always have to do that, it doesn't mean that your edit, it needs every single

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,470
shot flowing into the next shot, but it's cool to do it in moments where there's a sudden smoothness.

31
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:22,550
And then like, for example, this shot is kind of abruptly not matching these other bright fluffy shots,

32
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,570
which I mean, actually.

33
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:32,600
But it works because in this part of the video, her vocals are asking a specific question that's very

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,730
separate from what we just saw.

35
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,710
So she's telling you to relax, flow, see what comes naturally.

36
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,700
And then she's asking a very direct question, what's showing up for you today?

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,800
And we see this much more bluish tone.

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,870
She's not moving.

39
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
She's more in a meditative posture.

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,700
That's pretty deep right there.

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,310
But I'm hoping that you can grab some.

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm really.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,050
Yeah.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,890
Wow, OK.

45
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:06,290
Hopefully you can grab some insights from the subtleties that you can really get into with this kind

46
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:06,760
of edit.

47
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,200
And I will see you in the next video lesson.
