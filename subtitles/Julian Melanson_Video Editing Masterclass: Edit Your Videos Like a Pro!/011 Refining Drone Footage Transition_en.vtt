00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.280
OK, so we have our edit looking pretty good now let me just render this real quick, and we're still

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.680
working on this glitchy part towards the end right before the transition.

3
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.500
OK, so we want to like use these cool kind of transitions in this edit for the glitchy part that I

4
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.460
keep talking about.

5
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.930
So let's kind of scoot this over and I'm going to lock our audio tracks.

6
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.980
Hmm.

7
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.530
Actually, that's not working.

8
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.140
So what I'm going to actually try is this clip has a cool beginning like that.

9
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.280
Boom.

10
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.650
I'm going to try reversing this.

11
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.440
So let's go reverse.

12
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.700
Boom.

13
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.350
And now.

14
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.310
Hit play.

15
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.580
I'm just going to speed that up.

16
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.500
Go to Hondo.

17
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.340
OK.

18
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.740
OK.

19
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.790
Now, I think we're good.

20
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.620
We just needed a few more clips to fill in some extra space.

21
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.790
OK, cool.

22
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.400
Now let's watch back.

23
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.950
There is a few pacing changes that need to be made.

24
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.340
OK, actually, it's not too bad there's like audio stuff.

25
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.430
You know, we can turn up the audio on these first drone files.

26
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.050
So.

27
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.890
And of course, to I would also add like a crossfade between these so that the change of audio is just

28
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.480
not so abrupt.

29
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.760
This will kind of smooth out the difference in all of this audio.

30
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.710
Perfect.

31
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.740
OK, yeah.

32
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.140
Now we should be looking good.

33
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.560
Oh, yeah.

34
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.350
Perfect.

35
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.130
Just a little bit of change I'm going to make here, and then in the next video lesson, we're going

36
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.100
to hop into getting the remaining footage on our second audio track.
