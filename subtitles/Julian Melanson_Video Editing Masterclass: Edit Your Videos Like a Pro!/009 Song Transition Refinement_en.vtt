00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.550
So I'm going to go ahead and delete this one.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.430
And let's not worry.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.100
Well, actually, yeah, let's let's find our next track.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.950
So I'm going to copy this one and let's go ahead and lock that off so we don't paste on top of our sound

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.650
design drone footage.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.410
And I'm going to bring this down.

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.450
And what I want to do is I'm going to try and link up.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.110
I know these are going to be different tempo, different beats per minute.

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.670
The BPM is going to be different.

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.070
But you know what?

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.570
We're not deejaying here or video editing.

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.880
It's similar, but different.

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.500
So I'm going to try and match up these two drops.

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.550
So I want this drop to match up with our new track.

15
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.000
So let's go ahead and solo our track so we can find that's exactly where we want to start it.

16
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.130
OK, which is pretty much already right there.

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.270
So.

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.420
Now it's going to take a listen if he fail in this track and see what it sounds like.

19
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.150
It's

20
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.580
not bad for a first playback.

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.550
I mean, we didn't even really like skewed anything around, just kind of dropped it in.

22
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.950
I'm not to a mad at that, especially if we add a sweep for the sound design.

23
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.870
Kind of having a show is going to help that audio transition even more.

24
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.310
But I want to hear that back again and hear how it sounded.

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.740
OK.

26
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.710
Not bad.

27
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.510
So we did a little bit of a risk.

28
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.820
We're going to choose to do two tracks instead of one to spice things up a little bit.

29
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.430
And in the next video lesson, we're going to really chop up our drone footage to be a cool mini montage

30
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.600
that just fills this area where we added this really cool high pass filter to our first audio track.
