1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,260
So now what I want to focus on is using multiple angles in an interview kind of scenario just like this,

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:15,150
and how cutting multiple times while someone is speaking is going to bring up and excite what they're

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,610
saying.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,930
We did this with our montages where the faster pace of cutting that we did, the more interesting and

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,190
exciting the footage felt.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,390
So let's hop over to the screen cap and check out this portion.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,670
My college students would come up to me on the first day of class and they would say, you know, I'm

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,840
really worried about this class.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,950
I'm a science person.

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,820
And that person is not a literature person.

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,070
And I would say, OK, you're saying first, so you love questions, you love identifying evidence to

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,060
support an argument.

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,830
It's not to give everything you need.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,420
Great.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,320
So at this part, we have no bureau that we're working with because she's saying and I labeled this

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,570
all this kind of purple magenta color.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:04,790
She's kind of seeing a definitive final statement before we transition from our music track here.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,200
We have a smooth transition, which, you know, as by now, you know, that's our favorite.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,270
And then we go to this new track and OK, but let's not worry about that.

20
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,630
I want to focus on the visuals here.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,330
So we have the purple is her speaking footage.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,720
So if a double click this, we have this layer.

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,490
And if I double click this, we have this side layer.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,190
So we had one main camera facing right in front of her.

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,950
And then our B camera off to one side.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,290
So you can see we're here how she's speaking.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,260
We cut to this one and she's speaking.

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,130
We cut to here.

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,870
We cut back and then we zoom in slightly, zoom in again and zoom in one more time.

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,220
Now, now that you know what's going on, let's watch it one more time and then we're going to break

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,580
it down.

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,160
My college students would come up to me on the first day of class and they would say, you know, I'm

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,330
really worried about this class.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
I'm a science person, math person.

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm not a literature person.

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,460
And I would say, OK, you're science person, so you love questions, you love identifying evidence

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,570
to support an argument.

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,340
Sounds like you've everything you need.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,990
OK, so we're using the cutting between these angles to create kind of a suspense and to kind of zoom

40
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:30,150
in chronologically or one after the other to create a moment that is matched up with the words that

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,750
she's saying.

42
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,250
So if we were to take out this side layer and let's say put back this layer here, take out this one

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,760
and only use one camera angle, my college students would come up to me on the first day of class and

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,140
they would say, you know, I'm really worried about this class and the science person and that person.

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,190
I'm not a literature person.

46
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,530
And I would say, OK, you're a science person.

47
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,770
So, you know, it seems like it takes a long time just for us to get to this part of the edit.

48
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,460
So when we put these two angles back in these side angles, college students would come up to me on

49
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,660
the first day of class and they'd say, you know, I'm really worried about this class.

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm a science person.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,660
And that person is not a literature person.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,880
And I would say, OK, if it helps us to further keep listening to what she's saying, when we're looking

53
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,280
at one static shot, it's like, OK.

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,340
Uh huh.

55
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:30,510
Every time we cut anything in our edit and we change angles, we're creating a new brand new start of

56
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,770
thinking for our viewer.

57
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,930
So we're doing that here.

58
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,470
Consciously.

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,200
With the words she's saying, and then we let this front angle stay.

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,590
Once she really goes into the important part that we really want the viewer to listen to, and the way

61
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:58,290
that we intensify that moment is by holding this same exact angle and we take out our music later.

62
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,230
So I have the music layer with multiple tracks in the bass.

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,080
We have the beat and then we have kind of these additional sounds.

64
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,900
OK.

65
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,579
So as we're listening, you're going to hear the base is going to drop and then the beat is going to

66
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,670
go away as well.

67
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,560
Let's say, OK, your science person, so you love questions.

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,410
You love identifying evidence to support an argument.

69
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,210
So like give everything you need.

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,970
So she's listing off something.

71
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,050
OK, you love questions, OK?

72
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,000
You love identifying, yada, yada, yada.

73
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,970
That's why we're cutting to these close ups now.

74
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,040
So we go wide shot, close up closer and then boom.

75
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,240
Now, what we could have done is maybe brought back this side angle.

76
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,980
And let's see what that looks like to person.

77
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,360
And I would say, OK, your science person, so you love questions.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,180
You love identifying evidence to support an argument.

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,980
Want to give everything you need.

80
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,340
It's not bad.

81
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:12,390
It doesn't look bad, but when we're holding this same shot that we have but pushing in, we're creating

82
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,350
a huh?

83
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,460
OK, boom.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:23,520
OK, and then that creates the moment where we can transition into our next track.

85
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:32,700
So that's a creative way to use scaling up your image in a proper moment consciously to create that

86
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,450
kind of effect and having some fun playing between different camera angles to find out that, OK, the

87
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,160
beacom works for the beginning.

88
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,250
The ACAM is perfect right here.

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,240
The beacom is great again here.

90
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,870
And then when she changes what she's saying, she's going to do something definitive.

91
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,610
Let's hold this shot for longer.

92
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,290
Let's drop out the music.

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,120
Let's push in on each important point that she makes and then push in all the way on the very last moment

94
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:10,080
to create the most dramatic moment in that part before we use our all time favorite swooshed transition

95
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,030
into our next track.

96
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,230
Everything you need.

97
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,560
Literary analysis now that should give you some cool insights on some subtleties and hopefully some

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,820
ideas for you to further maximize the different camera angles that you're working with in your future

99
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,480
edits.
