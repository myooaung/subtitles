00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:08,039
So now that we are nearing the very end of this journey together, I want to actually give you a creative

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,180
challenge.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,820
Now, my challenge that I'm giving to you as a graduate of this course is for you to take all these

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,600
techniques.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,340
Take the knowledge, take the techniques and actionable takeaways.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,490
And I want you to create one video every single month, week or day.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,690
Whatever works for your schedule, whatever kind of content you make that fits into whatever time frame

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,670
doesn't matter.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,210
But I want you to commit to a certain time period and create regular content in that time period and

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,520
make videos that you are proud to share with the world.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,880
So with that said, now it's your turn to go out there and create an wiki's, new awesome videos that

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,290
I know you're going to be putting together.

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,160
Make sure you tag me in your posts.

14
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:13,860
And keep in touch with me at Juliane Discovers on Instagram is honestly the easiest and best way to

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,420
keep in touch and to keep me updated on your projects.

16
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:28,380
So this is the final time I get to say, OK, and now above Oblo or so, now we're looking good, or

17
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,750
now this edit is looking pretty good.

18
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,490
This is the last time.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,850
So let's see.

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,700
Thank you so much for joining me, for editing alongside me, for taking the time to grow, change,

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,700
evolve and improve your creativity and your skills.

22
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:57,660
So with that said, I will see you in the next online course.

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,190
Thank you.
