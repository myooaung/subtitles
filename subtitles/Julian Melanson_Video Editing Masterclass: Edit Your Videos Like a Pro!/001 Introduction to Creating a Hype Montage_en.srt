1
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,800
And we are back.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,850
So welcome to this new chapter in this section, we're going to be learning how to take what we've learned

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,680
so far and get a little bit more complex, get a little bit deeper into the editing process.

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,760
So we're going to be learning how to create a height edit.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,180
And what I mean by that is just a short 30 second edit.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,120
It's high energy, high speed and really something that's exciting.

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,530
So what we're going to do here is use the key techniques that we've learned so far, which are workflow.

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,040
We're going to organize everything back, everything up, create a clean workspace.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,210
We're going to then pull our selects to decide what's going to go in our content.

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,340
We're going to create our rough edit and then we're going to find the best sounding track that really

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,120
fits our edit.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:05,010
And finally, we're going to learn some new techniques around stylizing time remapping, post-production

13
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,330
stabilization and how to take.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,220
Looking footage and really edit it in a way that makes it look more professional and more creative.

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,510
So go ahead and get your editing software ready to go.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,820
And you can either edit past content that you already have or you can download the same exact footage

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,590
that I'm going to be working with and whether you want to use your own or the footage that I'm supplying.

18
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,400
We're going to gather around five to 15 different shots from that footage and turn it into a really

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
exciting montage.

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,530
And of course, we're going to transfer that footage on the device that we're going to be editing on.

21
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,390
And we're going to build on the techniques that we've already learned and get into newer techniques.

22
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:55,230
And then you're going to export and share your video URL link, whether you uploaded to YouTube or Facebook

23
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,330
or wherever you want to share it.

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,310
You're going to post that link in the student Q&A section for feedback and to share with your fellow

25
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,030
students.
