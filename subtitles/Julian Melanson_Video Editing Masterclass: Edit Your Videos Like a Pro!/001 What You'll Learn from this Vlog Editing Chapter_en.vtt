00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.750
So congratulations, you've made it past the beginner level of this course and you've now graduated

2
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.600
to the intermediate level of this course.

3
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.800
And I'm really excited about this, because now we're going to be moving from our basic editing techniques

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.360
where we've been working to build the foundation of our understanding to now techniques and projects

5
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.130
at an intermediate level.

6
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.360
So some of the key techniques from this section are going to be an updated and more complex level of

7
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.400
workflow, pulling selects, creating our rough edit, adding a more complex level of music, using

8
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.050
new techniques to create an updated and more refined secondary edit.

9
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.930
And then we're going to learn how to use montage in a brand new way to create special moments in our

10
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.739
videos.

11
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.170
And finally, we're going to take our video refinement on the visual and audio level to a brand new

12
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.950
standard.

13
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.320
So get your editing software ready.

14
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.490
Grab some coffee and I will see you in the next lecture.
