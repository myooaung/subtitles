1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,780
Now, there are two main types of montage, a musical montage and a sound driven montage.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,160
Now a sound driven montage is going to be an edit.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,390
It's driven by the actual audio from the scenario you were shooting in.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,280
And a musical montage is going to be a compilation of visuals that are edited to a musical track.

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,630
So we've done a bit of both of those.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,650
But we're going to do one for this specific video.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,520
But this is really a great technique of creating mini montages in your videos, especially for YouTube

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,630
and social media content, because it really separates the video into different kind of chunks and makes

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,720
multiple videos into one video in a kind of way.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,220
It's great for people with a short attention span.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,860
It's great to really spice things up.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,240
And the way we're going to be learning how to do it in this edit is to cut down about five minutes of

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,540
this footage that we have here with audio from our scene of this whole opening the boxes.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,140
So I'm going to go ahead and undo the audio track for these shots that we have here, because we're

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,050
actually, like I mentioned, you're going to be using the audio.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,160
Hopefully it's good.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,150
So let's go ahead and skip forward to the first important moment.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,720
Basically, I'm going to be opening up this knife and then opening up all the boxes.

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,230
So let's go to this moment.

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,430
We can read our waveform and see this is our moment right here.

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,190
OK.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,000
And what we're going to be doing here is really cutting a.

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,250
We're not going to be wasting any time.

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,010
We're not going to be doing things in real time.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,100
We're going to do short, quick cuts.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,770
And I want to just grab for the first draft of this montage.

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,250
Every moment that has a sound to it.

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,810
So the throwing down, the opening.

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:18,340
And as you can hear, we have sadly, the lens of the camera was pulling focus.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,660
So there are these these moments we're obviously going to do our best to cut around, ideally if we're

31
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,180
recording something like this in production.

32
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,300
We are using an external microphone.

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,260
Apparently, I wasn't using one for this situation.

34
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,440
So that's on me.

35
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,020
Now, we got to fix it in post, as some might say.

36
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,120
But let's continue to pull the cool moments from this sequence.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,490
So I'm going to go right in front of the moment.

38
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,320
We want make a cut.

39
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,200
Before.

40
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,660
OK.

41
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,070
And now.

42
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,620
What we have is all the cool shots that have a cool sound to it.

43
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,950
Back to back in a quick succession succession, a succession of edits.

44
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:51,230
OK, we're going to leave that for now, but we can adjust the pacing, speed things up on the next

45
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:57,620
pass of this edit, but let's continue to go through and pull the rest of all this footage in the Tann

46
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,160
sequence.
