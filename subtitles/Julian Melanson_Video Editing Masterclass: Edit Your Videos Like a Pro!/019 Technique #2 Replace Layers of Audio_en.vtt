00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.210
And that brings us to our second option when it comes to fine tuning our audio.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400
Now, there's a few ways to do this, but to be honest, the way I used to do it back in the day would

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.650
be to go on YouTube.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.390
OK.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.640
And I would basically type in like cave sound effect, because that's the look that we're going for

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.840
in this scenario.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.120
It's this really cool cave underground.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.530
And we don't really have the right sound.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.630
OK.

10
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.650
As an editor, you have to listen to this and ask yourself, is this what the audience should hear right

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.950
now?

12
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.400
This is a little bit Lord of the Rings like it sounds a little bit too haunted.

13
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.530
Yeah, it sounds like there's some weird Dracula like that's it's that's too much.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.080
But the goal is to find.

15
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.290
A sound that makes the visuals look better in the visuals, make the sound sound even better if that

16
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.980
makes sense.

17
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.320
The same way we made our visuals of our ending shot looked better by adding updated sound.

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.950
Right, that helped to transport the audience to that specific place.

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.690
So you can go through here if you find one you like.

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.210
Generally, these people that are giving it away for free will have a download link in the description

21
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.930
of the video.

22
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.100
I personally used to do it that way, but now I use epidemic's sound for all of my sound effects.

23
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.620
So I would search cave.

24
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.550
Sound effects.

25
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.430
And I can't say that I would recommend ripping stuff off YouTube or SoundCloud or any of the platforms

26
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.420
when you're not paying for it.

27
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.210
So what I'm saying, do what you need to do, but do it legally and do it with permission from the owners

28
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.700
of the material.

29
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.920
I use epidemic because I'm paying for it, and that's giving the usage to these sounds for my projects.

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.000
So I would do the same process.

31
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.340
So the process is the same.

32
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.800
I'm going to go through this list of sounds until I land on the one that feels just right.

33
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.720
It's got the right amount of vibe, but it's not too fake sounding.

34
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.530
And it really feels right when I drop it in with my visuals.

35
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.270
And so now I went through and I found the sound effects that will match up perfectly for my scenario.

36
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.900
So what I'm going to do is create a new folder, because these are new media assets going into our edit,

37
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.230
and I'm going to title this sound effects.

38
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.430
Now, this folder is in the original folder that we create at the very beginning of this edit to keep

39
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.570
everything in one place.

40
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.020
Because when you move stuff around and then you reopen that editing session, if stuff is missing and

41
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.940
not in the original folder, you're going to have missing content and it's not going to be able to be

42
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.110
in your actual video.

43
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.460
So that is another reason why we keep everything organized.

44
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.050
So what I'm going to do is drag in the sounds that I downloaded.

45
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.740
OK.

46
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.730
And then now I'm going to drag this sound effects folder into my actual editing session.

47
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.880
Now we have our sound effects here.

48
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.890
So we have one sound.

49
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.120
It's a bit of a water sound, OK?

50
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.180
And I'm going to drag that in and you can be doing the same for your edit if there's something that's

51
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.780
not really matching up and you need better audio.

52
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.700
Drag it in, bring it in, and let's do this side by side here.

53
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.700
So I'm going to create our key frame so we can create a smooth fade in and fade out.

54
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.070
I'm going to bring the audio levels way down.

55
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.030
I'm going to delete the old talking that was attached to the original video because we don't want that.

56
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.400
Let's see how this water sounds with the cave.

57
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.750
Let's move on to the second layer of sound.

58
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.590
Now, I'm mixing two sounds here because I want people to really feel what I'm showing on screen so

59
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.060
you don't have to restrict yourself to just one layer of sound for any kind of shot.

60
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.280
You can have multiple layers to create more depth to create more of a dynamic kind of sound design.

61
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.530
So let's see what the second layer sounds like.

62
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.580
So kind of a cool win going through a tunnel kind of sound.

63
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.700
And the key here is subtlety.

64
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.370
If it's like on in your face, it's going to feel fake and it's going to instantly be heard as something

65
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.280
that feels off to your viewer when they're watching your video.

66
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.200
So the key here, subtlety.

67
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.450
OK, we're going to bring this level way down.

68
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.800
We have a crossfade in.

69
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.060
OK.

70
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.250
It's still too high.

71
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.810
OK, let's play that back.

72
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.530
If we take a look at how this feels when we look at it.

73
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.620
Compared to the original.

74
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.740
Pretty big difference, and of course, you can really fine tune this as much as possible, as much

75
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.160
as you feel needed to really lock in that look and feel that you're going for in the next lecture,

76
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.600
we're going to do a very basic overall color correction, color grading, pass on your footage.

77
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.580
And we're going to keep it simple for this one.

78
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.540
And we're going to see what we can do just to kind of boost the overall coloring and the overall brightness

79
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.460
and sharpness of our image.

80
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.900
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
