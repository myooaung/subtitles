1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,719
Let's look at a few more tracks and see if we find anything interesting.

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,970
OK, perfect.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,150
I love the style of that track.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:20,610
So let's go ahead and take the other one that we got from Epidemic or put this into the music folder

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,960
that we created at the beginning of this edit inside of our project files.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,580
And now let's bring this music folder into our actual editing project.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,450
And now what we are going to do is double click either one of these tracks.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,210
I'm going to do this little squiggly.

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,820
I don't know what the heck this key is called, but it's going to enlarge the top left window.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,040
And we're going to skip forward here.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,270
And I'm going to make an end point right there.

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,680
So what I did is I created an endpoint by hitting I write on this drop, OK?

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,560
And it's going to create another outpoint there.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:07,080
And I'm going to drag it down so that before we start refining or before we really start diving deeper

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,820
into this edit, I want to first put our two possible soundtrack's below our footage to see which one

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,090
matches up the best.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,180
So let's do the same thing for the second track here.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:31,230
If I'm going to put an endpoint right there and I just put a marker by hitting M on the drop, that's

19
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,160
another way to kind of mark things can go here in an outpoint.

20
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:46,200
Hit the squiggly to get rid of the big screen, drag over the sound icon to drag the clip into our timeline.

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:55,950
And now what we can do is we have both of our tracks really rough, not synched up yet to our footage,

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,920
but we can mute one of our tracks so that we can now play our rough edit and see what it looks like.

23
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,930
OK, cool.

24
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,730
Sounds good, that's a cool song.

25
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,970
I think it sounds pretty good with the footage, if not super in love with it.

26
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,710
Of course, we're going to sync everything up to the striking points in the beat of the track.

27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,180
But let's now listen to our other option.

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,270
OK.

29
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,100
I can already tell I got the feeling in the body, so that's something that you want to be looking out

30
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:05,440
for when you're going through your content, is what is that thing that's creating a resonance in you

31
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,500
as you're absorbing the information from your edit?

32
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,410
So the audio and the video is speaking to you.

33
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,410
And as soon as there's that resinate match between the two things, you're going to feel it in the body.

34
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,620
There's going to be some excitement in this scenario.

35
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,440
There's excitement because that's the type of music and footage in more of a maybe heartfelt video that

36
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,170
you might be working on in the future or something that's a little bit more on the creative side or

37
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,090
artistic side.

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,840
Whatever the emotion that you're trying to draw from your audience, you're going to feel that sink

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,140
in.

40
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,050
So it's not just happening here.

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:47,410
You really want to feel your edits in the body as a response of something that is lighting something

42
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,310
up inside of you.

43
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,990
So we definitely want to move forward with this second option here.

44
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,790
The next step would be to go ahead and get rid of this extra track that we don't need.

45
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,690
And now we're going to lock down our musical track to keep it in place.

46
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,350
That way we can cut and move around all of our video footage without accidentally cutting or changing

47
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,160
the musical track, which doesn't need to be changed or edited in any way.

48
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:22,029
So now we're going to get into some more a little bit more slightly complex video editing techniques

49
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,010
where we're going to be doing time remapping, we're going to be speeding up clips, and we're going

50
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,350
to be doing faster cutting style and using different shot choices.

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,190
And then once we do that, we're going to stylize our footage, stabilize the shots that need to be

52
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,890
stabilize and get a really cool looking edit.

53
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,200
So you should now have your footage selected and organized.

54
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:50,080
You should have your music picked out and cued up, and you should be ready to start synching up the

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,140
cuts and the pacing of your footage to your track.
