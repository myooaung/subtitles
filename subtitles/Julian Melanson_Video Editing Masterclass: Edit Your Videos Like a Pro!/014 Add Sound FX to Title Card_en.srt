1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,710
Now we can just have it like this with the sound.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,980
But I really feel like it's missing something.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,580
This whole area is really full of Saland.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,720
And when we cut to this at the end, it's just kind of feeling boring.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
So we need some kind of sound effect here.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,500
So I'm going to go and grab a kind of swoosh sound effect.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,530
This is going to make the ending a lot more definitive.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,600
So it's just a standard high hat.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,780
But if I reverse this highet, it's going to be like.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,350
OK, so that's going to make this ending way more definitive.

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,520
And I already kind of know this is going to be too slow.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,770
Just by hearing it when we just played it, someone to speed up 160 percent.

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,770
And let's see.

14
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,190
OK.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,450
Cool.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,410
Looks pretty good.

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,050
So without.

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,430
Kind of boring.

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:15,990
And with.

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,750
Perfect.

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:28,060
So just in a few minutes, we put together an ending title card for our promo video that gives information

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,620
about our client or our personal project about where the viewer should go, and that is the purpose

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,550
of the promo video.

24
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,580
So now I'm going to export this video.

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,900
We'll watch it back together and we will see our masterpiece.
