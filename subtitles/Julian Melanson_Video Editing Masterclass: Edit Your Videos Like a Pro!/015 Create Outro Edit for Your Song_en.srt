1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,660
Yes.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,990
So let's go ahead and find out how we can end this track, we want this view and around this one and

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,800
a half minute mark.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,110
Because if we don't end it here, we're not going to get a chance to end it for a while.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,130
As you could see, the track is going to go for another, you know, two and a half minutes.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,000
So let's find our mark where we want to have this ending.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,020
Boom, right there, right where I put the marker.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,810
OK.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,940
Now what we can do is go to the end of the track and grab the ending, and we're going to kind of splice

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,350
these two things together.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,120
The.

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,610
OK, so right about here.

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,260
Boom.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,060
It's honestly a little bit of a weird ending.

15
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,150
So we're going to have to get creative.

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,670
There's like this weird bup bup bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,940
We don't want that because that's not in the previous part of the track we're actually using.

18
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,380
So it's getting a real feel real funky if that comes out of nowhere.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,020
And then there's just kind of a weirdness.

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:42,580
Yeah, it kind of sounds distorted, but not in a bad way, just in a stylized way that the artist that's

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,710
just how they created the track.

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,910
So it's going to be a little bit harder for us to do this, but we're going to make it work.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,590
Now, let's sync these two up so that the endpoint here is synched up with this beat that we can see

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,850
right here.

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:11,110
OK, now let's go ahead and cut, and we don't want to have an abrupt ending, actually, let's go ahead

26
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,700
and feed this down so that we still get that final beat.

27
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:17,830
OK.

28
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,840
And we can kind of fade this one into.

29
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,320
We might actually want to try to bring it in right there.

30
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,020
So let's bring that in.

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,030
It's OK.

32
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,460
It's going to take a little bit of massaging, so let's go ahead and just bring the volume down a little

33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,620
bit.

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,080
There's this high had to go slow and the abrupt stopping of that high hit high hat is what's making

35
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,850
this transition a little abrupt.

36
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,830
So let's kind of see if we can repurpose this high hat that we.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,090
OK, we might be able to do something here, so the pitch is different.

38
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,720
That's lower and this is a higher pitch.

39
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,500
That the short.

40
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,690
OK.

41
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,610
So since the picture's different, I'm going to go ahead and speed this one up, just a touch.

42
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,970
OK.

43
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:56,430
And I think this kind of reverb is going to smooth out the transition between because this one, this

44
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,550
ending the end of the song is really kind of hard to work with.

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,160
OK, so not so bad for what we're working with, that's really not too bad.

46
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,220
I'm just going to scoot over this, Phil, or sweep that we have.

47
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,310
Oh, there we go.

48
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,300
Let's hear it again.

49
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,470
Perfect.

50
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,480
OK, now we can end our video just in that minute and a half mark.

51
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,660
So now let's find what footage we want to go right here for this last bit.

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,320
We got plenty of this kind of footage.

53
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,040
Let's go ahead and get this out of the way.

54
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,680
Let's see what else we have.

55
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,830
Oh, yeah.

56
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,160
I want to get some filmmaking stuff in here for sure.

57
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,130
So let's drag that in.

58
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,890
Hopefully this is going to line up.

59
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,420
Oh, yeah, I like it.

60
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,640
OK, we don't really need this final one, I'm thinking for this ending.

61
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,350
We can have a title card that has my website because.

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,630
Yeah, with a demo reel, you want to end it with some kind of call to action, because the purpose

63
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,040
of it is for someone to see it and for them to do something afterwards, whether that's higher, you

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,910
buy your product, follow your account, share the video, whatever it is.

65
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,000
So we're going to end this demo reel with a call to action.
