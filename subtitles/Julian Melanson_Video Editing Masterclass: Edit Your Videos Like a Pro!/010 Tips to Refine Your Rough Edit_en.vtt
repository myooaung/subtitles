00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.890
So I'm not super into the these two shots, they don't really cut together too well for me.

2
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.480
And that's part of, you know, the rough edit phase is the shots that you pull in your Selex and you

3
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.220
think you're going to make it into the final edit.

4
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.260
You don't want to get too attached.

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.400
You want to definitely keep an open mind on what's working and what's not working.

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.190
Not what you thought was going to work when you started the edit, because where the edits started compared

7
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.119
to the final product.

8
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.900
Like I said, is multiple, multiple refinements and changes.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.680
And the more open you are to that, the more you know, the more of a better final product you're going

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.260
to have and the more the edit is going to flow.

11
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.240
So I think what I want to do instead is skip forward on this shot.

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.530
So we're going to make a cut.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.570
And right here we want to skip forward.

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.150
So, OK, right here on this beat, we want to go to our final closing shot.

15
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.550
So let's bring this shot over.

16
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.430
I have a feeling we're going to also do some time remapping because we like this intro and then the

17
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.230
ending of the song of this song.

18
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.420
We like the beginning of this shot.

19
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.290
And then the middle is not super necessary, but the ending is pretty cool.

20
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.300
So it's right click to clip time, remapping, click speed.

21
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.740
So right on that snare.

22
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.620
So I'm going to put a marker where I want the timing mapping to start.

23
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.460
And I'm going to hit up to create the first key frame.

24
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.230
And right around there is when the shot starts to feel like it's in the right place.

25
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.470
So let's create our second keyframe.

26
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.860
Hit the to get back to our arrow tool.

27
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.370
Secuity up to speed up the shot and smooth it out.

28
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.770
And let's see.

29
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.210
Cool, so that looks pretty darn good.

30
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.460
I want that to be faster.

31
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.050
I'm going to also speed up the beginning here because I wanted to feel a little bit quicker.

32
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.070
That's looking pretty good, so let's take a look and see what this whole edit looks like from Monteagle.

33
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.390
So there's a few little things were just off beat.

34
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.330
Real quick, I'm just going to change that over and I don't want to get too far into refining this one

35
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.100
like crazy, because we've got a lot of other edits to get to.

36
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.040
But this is feeling really good as a rough edit.

37
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.680
And I think we're ready to go on to the more stylizing process of doing some color changes and seeing

38
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.140
what else we can do to kind of hype up the edit.

39
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.720
So I will see you in the next lecture.
