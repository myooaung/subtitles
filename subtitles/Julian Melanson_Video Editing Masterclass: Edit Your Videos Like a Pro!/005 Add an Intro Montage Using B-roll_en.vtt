00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:09.450
OK, so we have our main sequence with our a roll coverage, and we've cut it together using this really

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.780
cool multicam sequence.

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.880
Now, you don't need to do the multicam.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.680
You could have done it the old fashioned way like we've done previously, but this is the way we did

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.400
it for this edit.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.910
Now, what I also did was I went and I pulled together the various shots.

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460
I pulled the Selex on the cutaway shots.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
And if you're like, hey, what the heck, I didn't see that process.

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.460
I want to know how you did that.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.630
Go back to the previous lectures in the previous chapters towards the beginning to see how to pull the

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.940
Selex, just in case you've forgotten or maybe you missed it.

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.890
We've covered that extensively.

13
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.150
So I went ahead, pulled these selects for the B roll, and then I did this nice color labeling.

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.980
This is kind of one scene you can call it.

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.300
This is all very similar.

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.780
B roll.

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.830
This this color, they have this cool kind of wide shot in this window.

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.180
That's these purple ones.

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.970
Then we have, you know, the ceiling stuff.

20
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.930
That's these green ones.

21
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.870
And then this tan one is outside stuff.

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.970
Now, this is kind of, you know, if someone were to see this, this could be seen looked upon as unusable.

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.390
B, roll.

24
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.310
It's like, what am I even looking at while I'm looking at a window, really shaky footage.

25
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.240
It doesn't make sense.

26
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.960
So like I kind of mentioned before, this kind of gritty street kind of grungy feeling with a lot of

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.640
the shakiness is gonna match up perfectly as accent cutaway shots for this type of project.

28
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.200
So let's do this.

29
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Let's go ahead and look at the edit we have so far.

30
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:54.090
And if you're seeing you have all these green clips, I went ahead and I added these violet pink colors

31
00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.180
in my timeline for areas where I wasn't happy with the Ayro coverage.

32
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:09.900
And I felt that at these specific moments here, it would be beneficial to use the visual coverage in

33
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.920
those moments to further create a cooler looking promo video.

34
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.840
So let's watch the edit all the way through, and then we're going to find the technique to add in this

35
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.410
B roll.

36
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.130
OK, so pretty cool so far, that's just the first pass.

37
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.330
So as you can see, let's just start from the very beginning this moment.

38
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.120
I want to that's why I labeled it this kind of violent pink color.

39
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:37.740
I want to use some of these shots with that cool beat that we have this touch.

40
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.100
So I'm going to do a marker.

41
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.140
So one, two, three, four.

42
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.780
What I want to do is go ahead, any raised this and we have these there's going to be one shot here,

43
00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.190
one shot here, one shot here, and OOPSes, one shot here.

44
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.330
And we're going to use Viorel for this cool intro.

45
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.330
So I'm just going to kind of scan through the shots that we have.

46
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.890
And look for some cool moments that catch my eye.

47
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.790
I like this moment.

48
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.360
Because it kind of goes from dark to light, and that's going to be kind of cool for an intro opening

49
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.910
shot, so I'm going to pull it up and that means I know that that's a shot that I want to pull in to

50
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.570
my timeline.

51
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.070
OK, that's kind of a cool balance right here.

52
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.260
I'm going to grab that as well.

53
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.680
Yep.

54
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.580
And I like that.

55
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.820
Let's push that up and then.

56
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.940
Let's get one of these.

57
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.250
Let's go ahead and grab right there.

58
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.120
So now we have these four shots and we go back to our sequence now before I paste these shots in here.

59
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.830
I'm going to lock off this video layer so well so that when I hit paste, it doesn't overwrite and delete

60
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.910
some of our stuff.

61
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.880
And now I'm actually going to lock this bottom video, layer two so that I can cut down.

62
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.730
These viral shots, without changing any of the rest of this edit that we've put together, and I'm

63
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.300
just going to kind of place these roughly where they're going to go.

64
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.080
I'm not going to worry too much about fine tuning.

65
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.660
OK.

66
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.210
OK, and with this one, what I actually want to do is I want to mess with the speed, and that's kind

67
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.250
of one of these things why I was calling and kind of unusable.

68
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.210
Varosha, it's I mean, like you look at this, you don't see anything special.

69
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.870
But if it's a quick cutaway shot and you have, you know, something that's kind of interesting and

70
00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.030
more artistic and you can't really put your finger on what it is, but it just adds character, that's

71
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.170
going to be a win.

72
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.210
So that's really our goal here.

73
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.100
OK.

74
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.950
I'm just going to ask you this little bit.

75
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.720
And I'm going to speed up this shot as well.

76
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.580
Let's go to Hondo.

77
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.160
Just to give it a little bit more energy, the faster the clip, the more the energy or the more quick

78
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.330
everything is happening.

79
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.120
So this last one was a little too fast.

80
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.040
Let's do 150 instead of 200.

81
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:46.270
And you can use the why slip tool to change where the clip is.

82
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.510
OK, I'm pretty happy with that.

83
00:06:53.230 --> 00:07:00.140
So that's a cool little intro that adds Caird some got a cool little intro that adds some character

84
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.120
and personality if you take these way and we just have the original clip underneath.

85
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:15.660
Yes, it's cool, you know, but it's just a lot cooler when we have something like that.

86
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.930
It also adds to add a little bit of information for the viewer about the locations, like, OK, whoa.

87
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:28.560
Looks like a kind of sketchy warehouse, but it just matches with the crunchiness of the video.

88
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.960
So let's play forword.
