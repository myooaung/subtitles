00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.710
So we're cooking away, and I want to take this moment to now dive into Maskey, because I guess this

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.140
is the chapter where we get to talk about a lot of the stuff that I've been trying to squeeze in and

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.640
fit into the course somewhere.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.180
So masking this is a really cool technique with a lot of different applications.

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.160
So I highlighted three points of the edit with this baby blue ish color where we're going to use masking

6
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.720
as a cool kind of overlay transition between shots.

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.810
So I went ahead and I just kind of did one real quick.

8
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.340
So we'll see what that looks like and we'll break it down and then we'll create it together.

9
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.470
So these cool little split frame moments.

10
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.970
So let's look at it again.

11
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:15.050
OK, so what's going on here is basically, if I go ahead and reset this, let's go ahead and delete

12
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.550
this clip, we'll start from scratch.

13
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.180
So we're going between this shot and this shot, and I'm looking for similarities between the two.

14
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.740
Now, there's pretty much this line, this horizontal line.

15
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.470
If I were to draw calls like that, and that pretty much goes between these two shots, it's a little

16
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.120
bit different.

17
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.910
The the angle of the line kind of changes, but it's OK.

18
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.110
It's a little bit different.

19
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.080
What we want to use is the slight similarities between shots that we can create a cool overlay with.

20
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.820
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag over similar to when we were doing the screen and darken

21
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.630
blending mode.

22
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.660
We're going to create an overlap between cuts.

23
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.500
So it's not going to be a clean cut where it goes from this shot to that shot.

24
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.820
There's going to be a slight overlay between the two, and I'm going to take this overlay and I'm going

25
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.950
to hit the pen tool under opacity to create a masking layer.

26
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.330
And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go ahead and carve out this wall and I'm going to use that as

27
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.320
kind of an overlay point between the two shots.

28
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.260
So there's a little bit of that similarity that I mentioned.

29
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.530
This wall going across is going to go to that wall and it's just a few frames.

30
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.810
So it looks cool, but it's a cool way to transition between the shots.

31
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.400
It has a lot more of a stylistic look than that.

32
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.990
So let's go to the second one and this one.

33
00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.280
What I started to do was instead of using the background, I wanted to use what was going to be the

34
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.280
main focus of the foreground in the next shot.

35
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.370
So if we delete this, we have this clean cut.

36
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.140
And what I want to do is create a little bit of an overlap.

37
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.300
I'm going to go ahead and create a cut here.

38
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.130
So we're just selectively adding this mask to just this part of the clip.

39
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.160
I'm going to hit the pen tool for mask.

40
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.750
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to click in around the main focus.

41
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.210
Of what the next part of the image is going to be.

42
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.640
And you can really fine tune this as much as you want, because it's only in frame for a few frames.

43
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.740
You don't have to get too crazy.

44
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.340
But of course, you know, I could work more on this, but let's see it.

45
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.080
So let's drag it out one more frame.

46
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.740
Cool.

47
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.580
So it has a cool look to it, right?

48
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.720
And if I wanted to, because you could see there's a little bit of an issue going on here.

49
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.390
I go to the beginning of the clip, hit the mask, past stopwatch.

50
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.490
This is going to allow for me to keyframe.

51
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120
Just like what we did previously in the course.

52
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:37.600
And that will allow for me to track with this object to create a cleaner mask, which is going to create

53
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.690
just a better looking use of this technique.

54
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.820
And we could experiment, too, with adding a little bit of a feather.

55
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.380
You can see what that does.

56
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.780
That's with a feather that's without.

57
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.170
So let's see it with yeah, it looks and like it better without the feather.

58
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.510
OK, now let's go to later in the edit.

59
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.040
And let's go ahead and do this technique again, where I'm going to take the clip we want to go into.

60
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.650
I want to make a cut.

61
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.070
So there were only working on this.

62
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.680
And let's go ahead and use our background here.

63
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.640
Let's use this difference between the wall and the floor.

64
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.090
Just like that.

65
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.260
OK.

66
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.450
And let's say I wanted to actually have this part of the frame and lose this part of the frame, I can

67
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.700
actually hit the invert and then change, which I actually like that better.

68
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.650
For some reason, that one actually flows more with the edit.

69
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.550
OK, cool.

70
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.850
So you can really experiment, let's say I didn't like that I could do the opposite where we use this

71
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:13.480
clip and let's say I want to use the big line and what I'm doing, why I'm choosing to do this line,

72
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.290
because this is a big contrasting part of the image.

73
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:25.030
And that's going to allow for me to create a cool shape that's going to overlay in a more clean way

74
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.030
rather than just a random shape.

75
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.970
You know, I can go and do this and then go there and then go there and have this come down here.

76
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.310
And I could overlay that, you know.

77
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.990
And that's cool, too.

78
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.220
But it just looks cleaner overall when there's a little bit more of a purpose and a line that you're

79
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.120
using in the actual footage itself makes it more cohesive.

80
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.450
Look.

81
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.760
OK.

82
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.510
Now, let's go to the end here.

83
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.250
OK.

84
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.450
And what I want to do is take this clip and I want to mask out this part, so I'm going to drag it over

85
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.390
a few frames, select this part, create this mask.

86
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.070
Well.

87
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.050
OK, cool.

88
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.050
So that's looking pretty good.

89
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:41.020
Now, if I want to spice up the ending a little bit here, we can also extend out a few frames and maybe

90
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.930
follow something like that.

91
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.950
And even we can make this more of a gradual like a change.

92
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.430
So I want to take this and I'm going to go to this mask on this one.

93
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.690
Right click.

94
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.870
I'm going to copy and I'm going to go to the clip in front of it.

95
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.800
I'm going to paste.

96
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.470
I want to choose opacity, which is going to grab the mask from this shot and put it on this shot.

97
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:29.390
And I'm going to drag it down so that we kind of get a stairstep of the blackout frame coming versus

98
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.200
just a cut the block.

99
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.179
So to go, boom, boom, boom.

100
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.280
So just a little bit more of a stylized look that we're creating here.

101
00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:43.159
And when we create our distortion overlays and when we drop those on, that's going to make these moments

102
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.330
even cooler.
