1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,300
Now we're going to move on to the other filters that I add to my voice overs, which is going to be

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,300
a hard limiter.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm going to double click to add it on.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,460
Now, what this hard limiter is going to do.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,240
You can see an input boost and a maximum amplitude, maximum amplitude.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,270
So the input boost is going to boost the input of the sound, a.k.a. bring up the decibels, bring up

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:34,200
the volume, and the maximum amplitude is going to create a ceiling that's not going to let you go above.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,310
The reason I like to do this is if I set this to minus three and then I boost this up, let's say four

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,320
points, four decibels.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,030
It's going to boost.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,630
You can see with any audio, you have a waveform and there's peaks.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,790
This stops the peak from going to high where it gets distorted.

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,690
And then the boost is going to boost all these lower regions that aren't quite as high as these higher

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,680
regions to make parts where you speak a little bit quieter.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,300
It's going to boost those up so that all of your voiceover has a very much more unified actual volume.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,530
But then it also, I've noticed, adds a more presence of voice, because everything that you're saying

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,420
is kind of not at max volume, but at a very boosted volume.

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,410
So it can be good for people who speak quieter.

19
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,550
It can be good for really anything.

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:38,700
But I've just noticed with voice overs, it does a lot more depth of field, more narrow of a frame,

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,160
but a little bit more of a documentary field.

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,550
So as you can see, it's bringing up the sound of all my different parts of my words.

23
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,080
Parts when I go quieter, parts when I'm louder are not going to loud.

24
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,810
And the difference between doing something like a hard limiter, which is also called a compressor,

25
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,140
it might be called a compressor in your editing software, is that if I bring up the volume, that's

26
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,020
going to bring up the volume of everything and things will start clipping and boom here.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,260
But if I use the hard limiter, it's going to boost everything but put a ceiling so it doesn't go too

28
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,100
high, which keeps the high parts not too high and then boost the low parts.

29
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:21,750
Makes sense.

30
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,470
OK.

31
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,140
So it looks at 50 ml next.

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,720
What I do is add a mastering filter.

33
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,780
It could be called different things in your editing software, but what this is going to do is do a

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:47,260
final pass on boosting and widening and what's called adding an exciter, which kind of boosts the highs

35
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,530
as well to your voice.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,190
So my favorite filter to use is this bright hype filter.

37
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,500
What I'm going to do is take off the reverb.

38
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,760
We never want to add reverb to a voiceover.

39
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,230
You really always want to remove it.

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:12,310
So there are some situations where if you do a lot of sound processing on your audio and you removing

41
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,620
sounds and you're moving hums in the background and removing buzzes in the background, it can make

42
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,510
your audio sound a little bit too polished and kind of computer.

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,530
And when you add reverb back, it kind of makes it more spacey.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,160
It adds more like space between the words.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,290
But we don't need to worry about that.

46
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,470
That's very specific.

47
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,930
So we're not going to be adding any reverb to our audio today, but we're going to take away that.

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,210
We're going to take away the loudness maximizer.

49
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,130
We're already doing that with the hard limiter.

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
And let's take a listen to what this sounds like.

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,550
Oh, this is a great focal length for documentaries and short films, but we really need so you can

52
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,930
see it as even more of that kind of interesting.

53
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,770
There's more of a electricity to my voice.

54
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,420
So let's take a listen.

55
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:08,710
Is the feeling of the background and it doesn't feel as much that we're now let's remove these filters

56
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:16,000
focal length for documentaries and short films, but we really lose the feeling of the background.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,320
And it doesn't feel as much that we're sitting with the person on camera.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,959
That's a huge difference.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,320
Let's hear that one more time.

60
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,700
Is the feeling of the background and it doesn't feel as much that we're sitting with the person on camera

61
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,200
who.

62
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:34,810
OK.

63
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:42,780
That's why I had to stop in the middle of my phase of pulling these selects for the rough edit and fix

64
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,620
the audio.

65
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,740
So you could also see, as I was playing this and that it is red lining.

66
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,050
Just slightly.

67
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,080
It is red lining just slightly over here.

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,930
So the way to combat that, because we had everything at a pretty good level, but when we put on this

69
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:10,240
mastering final layer of our filter that brought up the highs even more, what that did was increase

70
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,450
the overall decibels.

71
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,010
So we need to go to a hard limiter and bring down the maximum amplitude.

72
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,580
Let's say two decibels to negative five.

73
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:27,040
Is in short films, but we really lose the feeling of the background and now our audio is coming in

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,620
right above negative six, which is perfect.

75
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,510
That's going to leave room for music in the background, sound effects in the background.

76
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:41,320
And that's really the benchmark that I go for with all videos that I've done.

77
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,400
So that should give you a really good understanding of how you can use your filters.

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,430
There might have different names in your editing software, so take the time to Google it, do a little

79
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:02,020
bit of research on how you can find how to do a compressor to boost your footage footage, to boost

80
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,320
your audio and also add a ceiling so it doesn't clip.

81
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,450
And then also a mastering filter so that you can increase the highs.

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,800
And something similar to a parametric equalizer filter like this so that you can see what's going on

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,420
in your audio.
