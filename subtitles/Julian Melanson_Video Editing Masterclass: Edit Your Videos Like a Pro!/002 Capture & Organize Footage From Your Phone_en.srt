1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,230
So we are now going to dive into your editing workflow.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,350
And basically what we're going to do here is I'm going to show you how to create a clean workspace,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,780
OK?

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,120
It's really important to have the laptop that you're working on, computer that you're working on,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,310
phone that you're editing on, whatever it is.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,500
We're going to have things organized so that as you build that skill level, you're going to really

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,350
build a good structure and a good routine now so that that can grow with you.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,610
And you really have good habits.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,600
So it's really important.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,900
We're going to spend some time to now organize our footage so that our edit starts to flow seamlessly.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,880
So let's do that now.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,150
The first step is to pull the footage off our cards that we've already shot.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,610
In this case, because we're doing something we can all edit together with is that we're going to be

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,760
grabbing the footage off our phone.

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,790
So I'm going to do that now.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,510
All right.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,480
So as you can see, I have my footage already in an album.

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,790
So if you haven't already kind of collected the video files that you want to use for this learning exercise,

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,030
you can go ahead and pause the course and you can go ahead and do that now.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,420
So now that I have all of my video files selected, this is just kind of a little bonus tip on how I

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,160
transfer content.

22
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,550
Like I said, so much of us are shooting now in our phones, photo and video.

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:29,250
And the best way I found to transfer that content is to airdrop rather than having to plug in your device

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,450
and go through all that stuff.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,780
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all my videos here.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,970
I'm going to hit share.

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,760
And then I'm going to go to air drop and then boom, there's my laptop.

28
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,440
OK, I'm going to click the device and this is going to start sending all the footage that I'm going

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,250
to edit with.

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,510
Right.

31
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,550
The very first step, which is capturing the content that you've shot.

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:05,310
It's going to transfer it from my filming device to the equipment that I'm going to be editing on perfec.

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,830
So that just finished transferring to my laptop.

34
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:14,040
Now that we did a little mini saiid course tangent on how to actually get the footage from our phone

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,370
to what we're editing on.

36
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,320
You can see here I have a different kind of content I shot on a recent trip to Mount Shasta.

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:32,610
So the very first thing we want to do is to create a folder where our whole edit is going to take place.

38
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,060
So I'm going to title this Mount Shasta edit, OK?

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,840
And inside this main folder, this main folder that we create is going to encapsulate all of the content

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,460
that's involved, the audio, the music, the visuals, the pictures, everything.

41
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,230
OK, so inside this folder, we're going to create some folders that keep everything very organized.

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,810
So inside that folder, I want you to create a footage folder and then I want you to create an editing

43
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,320
folder.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,790
I'm using Premiere.

45
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,390
So I always personally title the folder that is holding all the editing assets because these are going

46
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,110
to be separate.

47
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:23,250
Your original video and audio files is one asset for your edit, and the editing files are the basic

48
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,800
like signpost and little connection.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,560
Things that you're editing software is doing, you're editing software is always using the original

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,370
footage.

51
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,380
So you have to keep them organized and safe in their own respective place.

52
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:44,730
So going to make a premier file, you can name this something like project files, editing files, whatever

53
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:52,680
helps you instantly know that this is the folder with all your important editing assets belong in.

54
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,200
If I hop back over here to our slides, you can see we created our folder with our project name, our

55
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,900
editing folder, and there's a few other folders that because this is one of our initial edits we're

56
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,720
doing together.

57
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,930
It's much more on the simple side.

58
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,420
So we don't really have all these different complex sub folders to create.

59
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,980
We don't need to really mark the day, the scene, Ayro coverage, buro coverage.

60
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,420
Those are things we'll get into more as we get on to more complex edits.

61
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:30,000
So the next step that I'm going to do here is highlight all of the footage that we dragged on to the

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,730
laptop.

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,670
It's now ready to be categorized.

64
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,120
So throwing all of that in the footage folder.

65
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,130
And next up, we're actually going to create our actual editing file.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,000
So like I said, I'm personally using premiere, but this is going to be the same exact process for

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,220
whatever editing software you're that you're using, whether that's final cut or premiere or any of

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,910
the other ones.
