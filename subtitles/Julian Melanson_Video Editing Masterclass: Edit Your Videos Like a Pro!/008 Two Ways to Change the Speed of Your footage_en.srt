1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,780
All right, so let's start by first speeding up some of the extra space that we have here in our first

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,260
shot, because I like this first part where we can see the light changing on the camera.

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,730
We can see it pulling out the actual camera.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,070
And then we kind of want to skip forward to get to this transition between this shot and then cutting

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,940
to the next shot.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,770
So what I'm going to do here is show you two ways to time, remap your content or your footage for any

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,450
of your projects to really kind of.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,550
Yeah, do a cool effect where you speed things up.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:45,390
So the first option, which is kind of the more basic style, is to choose where you want your cuts

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:45,810
to be.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,270
So I'm going to play and then right here on B, I'm going to create a cut and then I'm going to scrub

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,720
forward.

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,970
And right as he's opening the whatever that thing is called, I'm going to make another cut.

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,780
OK.

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,750
So we have one clip is now cut into three clips on this center clip.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,080
The part I want to speed up.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,520
What I'm going to do is right click that center clip.

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,720
And I'm going to choose the speed and duration function.

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,410
OK?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,370
This is going to allow for me to take the clip that's playing at 100 percent, 100 percent speed, which

21
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,540
is normal speed.

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,910
If I do 90, that's 10 percent slower.

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,170
If I do 110.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,180
That's 10 percent faster.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,010
OK, we're going to speed this way up because we want this to be a really cool quick motion.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,140
So let's try three thousand percent.

27
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,010
And now we have this empty space that got created.

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:52,570
So what we need to do is select our clips and drag everything over or right click our empty space and

29
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,470
hit REPL delete.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,780
Let's see what that looks like, for example.

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,240
OK, perfect.

32
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:07,490
So what I'm going to do is move the rest of these clips to this first big hit, because we know we want

33
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,479
the edit to start there.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,160
We're following what the music is telling us to do in this situation.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,000
So this space here, we want to fill with this intro shot.

36
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:20,670
OK.

37
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:31,160
So what we're going to do is kind of scoot things around a little bit so we know that we want this clip

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,700
to end.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,760
OK, that's perfect.

40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,720
So.

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,120
I want to scoot this over, skip this over and add a little bit more of an intro time into this clip

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,330
and let's see what that does look for, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

43
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,630
blah.

44
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,900
OK, so that actually is flowing pretty dang nicely right out of the gate.

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,030
What we're doing is making sure we have some continuity.

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,540
We're breaking a lot of continuity here by skipping forward ahead in time, different shot times facing

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,290
different ways.

48
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,670
So we're not too worried about continuity, but what we do want to create is cutting on action, which

49
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,050
is a form of continuity.

50
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,040
So the action of him opening, whatever this thing is called, the battery door, we're cutting into

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,650
that smooth movement of him doing that same movement motion in the next shot.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,690
OK, so let's see that again.

53
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,420
Florida, far more detail.

54
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,730
OK, looking pretty good.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,920
That is option number one.

56
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,640
Now I want to show you option number two.

57
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,620
So what I'm going to do is duplicate this intro shot and I'm going to go to where we want to cut it.

58
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:57,010
As if we were starting from scratch with this original shot, and I'm going to highlight that clip,

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:07,390
right click it and go to show clip keyframes, then instead of it showing the opacity, which is what

60
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,350
it's currently doing.

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,880
So right now.

62
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:19,399
This selector is changing the opacity level, zero opacity is how much you can see it, opacity is another

63
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,649
word for transparency or opaqueness.

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,520
It's the same thing.

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,620
So zero transparency.

66
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,950
It's not.

67
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,730
There are 100 percent.

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,770
You know what I'm trying to say here?

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,990
OK, well, we're in this situation.

70
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,880
We're not going to be messing with the opacity.

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:40,670
We want it to show the key frames for time, remember, which is really similar to this process of cutting

72
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,990
it into three individual clips.

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:50,240
But we're going to be able to do the time speed changes in a more gradual way, similar to when we made

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,240
those audio crossfade of it went smoothly from 100 down to zero.

75
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,880
We're going to now go from 100 speed up to three thousand back down to 100 with Slope's.

76
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,400
So it'll be slightly different.

77
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,590
But if you can imagine a clip being 100 percent going into a cut of a thousand and going to cut up a

78
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,540
hundred, it's boom, boom, boom, boom.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,070
What we're going to create is boom.

80
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,300
Sure, sure.

81
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,890
I love my sound effects.

82
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,990
So let's skip forward here and let's create a keyframe.

83
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,330
I'm going to hit piece for the pen tool.

84
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:30,560
OK, that just created a key frame for the speed and duration of our clip.

85
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm then going to go to where I want this speed change to stop, right as he's opening that camera latch

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,650
on to create another key frame.

87
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,340
And now, instead of cutting our clip into three, we have one clip with the speed function changed.

88
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,310
What I'm going to do is take the area of the clip between our two key frames that we just created.

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,770
And I'm going to scooted up.

90
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,780
And as you can see, the percentage of speed is increasing from a hundred.

91
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,210
It's at two hundred and four percent.

92
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,010
Three hundred percent.

93
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,360
Up and up and up.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,370
And I'm going to keep going until we hit.

95
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,920
Let's let's see how it looks at two thousand.

96
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,650
And what that just did was it shortened our clip because what was that?

97
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,180
One hundred percent playing for a long time.

98
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:24,380
Now I was playing at two thousand percent, very short, only on this middle portion of the clip.

99
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,790
So what that looks like

100
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,550
is basically what we had done here.

101
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,380
So no big difference yet.

102
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,200
But the extra step is when we zoom in and we change

103
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,550
our slope of increase between one hundred percent speed to two thousand percent.

104
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,800
So it's going to slowly climb and be more of a gradual change in speed.

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,710
So it's not a too quick of a stutter.

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,560
So I'm going to gradually increase it and gradually decrease it for.

107
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,270
You can see it's more of a gradual time change.

108
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,790
This is far more detail compared to this far more detail.

109
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,140
You can see there's a little extra cash, so I'll play that again.

110
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,260
The original first way we did it, more choppy.

111
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:33,900
And then the newer way with more of a smooth transition from Florida is far more so really subtle,

112
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:40,370
but you can see there's more of a gradual change which can create more smooth looking edits.

113
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,310
So do you want more of a punchy style?

114
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,290
It looks a little bit more fake in some ways, or edited in some ways.

115
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,340
Or do you want more of a smooth style that can look a little bit more organic?

116
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,110
Both are doing the same thing.

117
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,190
We're speeding up our content to get more information in a short amount of time.

118
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,770
But one has maybe a bit of it, more hip, a bit.

119
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,130
But I personally prefer the aesthetic of the second option, which takes a little bit more time.

120
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,510
But I think it's worth it.

121
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,070
So let's keep moving here in our edit.
