00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.620
Perfect, so we're going to start right from the top with this for these first few edits that we do,

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.910
these first few learning lessons.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.210
I want to do the whole process from beginning to end so you get more of that repetition building that

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.670
new habit and that new process to really cement in and really get concrete on these new habits for a

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.860
faster and better workflow.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.290
If you haven't already gather your content, you just want to have stuff.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.630
It can be shown on your phone, your destler, wherever you shot.

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.590
It's totally fine.

9
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:39.390
It should be in the more exciting, faster paced 30 second video kind of hype genre if you want to use

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.290
any content you have.

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.220
Perfect.

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.320
If not, download the supplied footage.

13
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.530
I'm going to be editing the supplied footage, which is the footage or the edit that we shot in the

14
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.990
cinematography masterclass course.

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.270
So let's now hop over to the screen caps so we can start capturing our content.

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.730
I'm going to first start with creating a brand new folder.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.260
I call this hyp edit and I'm going to create a sub folder called Footage.

18
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.560
I'm going to create another folder called Music

19
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.250
and another folder for my editing files, which I'm going to call premiere.

20
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.620
You can title this whatever you want.

21
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.470
And let's start with that.

22
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.440
So here's the content that I'm going to be working with here.

23
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.530
We have pretty straightforward drone footage shot on my phone here.

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.530
OK, so as you can see, we have the character Vlad's our friend here.

25
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.990
He's doing one movement of loading the camera up.

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.290
And we're going to take that same exact set of movements that he does, but we're going to introduce

27
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.850
different shot types.

28
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.730
So if we take a look at these shots, we have we have some close ups raising the camera, changing the

29
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.350
battery, some moving shots, some wide shots.

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.730
And we're going to see how we can take this pretty mediocre set of movements at footage and turn into

31
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.930
something that's exciting.

32
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.600
So let's start by dragging in our footage into our editing assets folder.

33
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.650
Then we're going to open up our editing software and we're going to create a new project.

34
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.710
And I'm going to title it Hype Edit.

35
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.680
And we're going to hit the browser to choose the location, just like we've done before.

36
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:34.970
We're going to go to where our folder is, navigate to our editing assets, folder it, choose it,

37
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.550
OK?

38
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.450
Now it's going to put all of our editing files in the proper location.

39
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.100
And now I'm going to drag our footage into the timeline, into the project window.

40
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.080
So now we have all of our video content.

41
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.570
And now what I'm going to do, because all this content is from the same location, the same character,

42
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.060
the same time of day, there's really no separation between a rule and B rule and different types of

43
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.330
separate shooting locations.

44
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.960
I'm going to drag all this stuff into the same exact sequence.

45
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.410
So what I'm going to do is highlight all my footage.

46
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.890
I'm going to right click the top clip and I'm going to create a new sequence from that clip.

47
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.080
Now, what that did is dropped in all my footage.

48
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.210
I'm going to be working with into the same sequence with the proper sequence settings that is linked

49
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:41.160
up to the settings of my actual footage, which is twenty nine point nine, seven frames per second.

50
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.350
And at 10, 80 by 1920, just like our previous project that we edited together.

51
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.550
Now, what that also does is creates a new sequence and it defaults the name of that sequence as the

52
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.830
name of the video file, which we don't want.

53
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.010
So we're going to name this hyp edit and I'm going to take that sequence out of the footage folder,

54
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.180
because it's not footage.

55
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.010
And I'm going to create a new sequences folder by right.

56
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.820
Clicking, selecting Ben and typing in sequences.

57
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.829
And I'm going to drag that sequence into the sequences folder.

58
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.079
We are organized over here, baby.

59
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.040
OK.

60
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.370
OK.

61
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.820
And as a good practice, before we really get into this edit, I'm going to create a backup of our editing

62
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.910
files on a separate hard drive.

63
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.220
Right now, we're editing on the hard drive built into the laptop.

64
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.850
And I'm going to drag that content and duplicate it onto a separate hard drive, which will do right

65
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.270
now.

66
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:48.870
So I'm going to select hyp, edit, copy, paste it onto this external hard drive, and I'm going to

67
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.530
title this back up hyp edit backup.

68
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.920
So by now you should be at the same process as I am, either with your own footage, you've created

69
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.440
your folders, your editing file, and you're ready to start pulling Selex on your footage, or you've

70
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.580
downloaded the example footage and you're at the same step as me.

71
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.920
So now let's get into pulling Selex and see what shots we're going to actually use here.
