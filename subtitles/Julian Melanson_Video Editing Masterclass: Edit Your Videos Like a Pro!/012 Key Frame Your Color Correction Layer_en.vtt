00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.840
Now we go to the beginning of our clip where we want to start the mask.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370
We turn on the key frame tool by clicking the stopwatch.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.300
Click our mask so that it shows up in the timeline, that's a little bit of a trick here.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.420
If we don't have our mask selected, the wire frame, which is what this is called that we just created,

5
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.530
won't show up.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.880
So if you have your mask on your footage and you're like, what the hell, where where is it at?

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.750
I'm clicking my color correction layer and I don't see where my mask went.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.340
You physically have to click it.

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.200
Now it's going to make the wireframe show up.

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.090
And now we can move it around.

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.370
So we set a Kiffmeyer beginning.

12
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.510
We could go as far as to move point by point if we wanted to.

13
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.690
But we're not going to really get too crazy on this example.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.250
But what we'll do is now go to the end of the clip and move the mouse to the proper place, and we can

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.239
kind of move a few points around here, just so it kind of contours a little bit more of where our subject

16
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:04.810
is.

17
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.830
Fix any areas they're sticking out that we don't need to be lit.

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.080
And now we have, as you can see here, a point at the beginning and a point at the end.

19
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.130
So if we scrub through, we'll see our masks start to transform and change and follow our subject.

20
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.750
Now, what I've found is the most effective way to really create these key frames is.

21
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.460
When I used to do is go like, OK, scart, scrub for scrub for it.

22
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.240
OK, now the person is in a really different position.

23
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.420
Make a change and then I'll go forward, scrub for it, scrub forward, and then, OK, now make a change

24
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.780
to contour a little bit more and scrub forward.

25
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.950
And again, I would keep doing that.

26
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.610
Boom, boom, boom.

27
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.860
But if we'd go to the end.

28
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.480
Now, it's only been tracking her in between from key frame to key frame.

29
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.260
If I undo that and now imagine going every single few frames and trying to do that, you have to show

30
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.440
you're editing software where she's being on those frames and you're doing it.

31
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.440
If you don't do that and you do it first at the beginning.

32
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.420
And then add one to the end.

33
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.560
Now, what it's going to do is, like we saw before, transform with our subject a lot more.

34
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.190
Easily.

35
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.750
It's moving with her.

36
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.890
And now instead of going frame, frame, frame, change, frame, frame, frame change, we're going

37
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.730
to go to the middle.

38
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.510
OK.

39
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.010
And then we're going to change it.

40
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.950
And what we do is we start.

41
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.220
Breaking these moments in half, so the key frame is telling it where to be here, where to be there

42
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.090
and where to be there.

43
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.310
Now we're going to split that in the middle again.

44
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.300
And this will allow for you to create less key frames and do a lot less work in the long run because.

45
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.170
If I go here to create a key frame, it already has a reference of here where to be and here where to

46
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.310
be, which is perfect.

47
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.740
If I were to go here, here, here, here, here, it doesn't have a reference from.

48
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.810
Further in the video of where it should be.

49
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.830
So this is a lot quicker of a way, I'm hoping that that makes sense.

50
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.100
At the end of the day, we're just saving a little bit of time and having to make less key frames.

51
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.140
Because the ordering were choosing to put these key frames in is making our mask naturally go to the

52
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.760
areas where we wanted to be.

53
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.770
Rather than having to tell it every single time.

54
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.760
So we've created one, two, three, four, five keyframes, which is good enough for this example.

55
00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.620
Let's kind of see.

56
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.970
So as I'm playing this back, I can kind of see some of the especially right here, if we go here,

57
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.720
we can see almost like a ghostly halo.

58
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.910
So what we're going to do is we're just going to feather this out even more.

59
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.880
That's going to blend the edges of where the effect is versus where the effect isn't, which is going

60
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.880
to make anything that's kind of distracting from our layer disappear.

61
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.060
So I'm going to hit 250 on the feather and let's hit play.

62
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.980
So that looks pretty good.

63
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.150
If we don't have the laser, here's our original with our laser.

64
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.150
We've got a pretty well lit subject.

65
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.240
So you don't want to rely on this by saying, oh, no, we all need to put a light there.

66
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.050
We'll fix it in post-production.

67
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.810
No, you want to get the best footage in the production process as possible.

68
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.440
But when there are some things like this, we can do a little bit of ninja action to get a good looking

69
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.860
shot.
