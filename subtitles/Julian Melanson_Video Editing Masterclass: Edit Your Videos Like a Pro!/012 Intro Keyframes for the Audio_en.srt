1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,620
All right, so before we move forward, I want to just take a moment to watch back the edit that we

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,530
have so far, so let's check it out.

3
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,160
Awesome, so there's a few things that stick out to me so far that I want to fix before we move forward.

4
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,710
I think it'd be pretty cool now that we're adding some sound design already.

5
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,650
We have this background audio going on.

6
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,230
We have a filter that we added to this song, which was a high pass filter.

7
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,040
I want to actually take this low pass filter that we didn't use.

8
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm going to copy it and I'm going to paste it on to the beginning, because remember, we were going

9
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,360
to use a low pass and it didn't work well because we were underwater.

10
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,800
Well, that's perfect for this intro.

11
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,720
So here's our.

12
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm going to paste it here and I want to.

13
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,460
Start everything.

14
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,990
And I'm going to turn it on and I'm going to start it so that it sounds like it's underwater and actually

15
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,700
it would be kind of cool if it slowly came back to normal sounding audio.

16
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,300
Right.

17
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,040
As we made this transition, we have this match cut with the hand touching the water from below the

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,210
surface and then the hand touching the water from above the surface.

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,780
Perfect opportunity to try and pull off a little bit of a cool audio transition in this moment.

20
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,120
So let's just test this out.

21
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,530
OK, so we got to tweak this a little bit here.

22
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,550
OK.

23
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,540
And I'm going to turn down the intensity by raising up the frequency, I know it's a little confusing

24
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:06,370
with a low pass filter, but basically the higher this value, the less effect and the less the the

25
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,020
filter is cutting out of the audio.

26
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,690
OK, so still going to need to tweak it a little bit.

27
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,820
Now I'm noticing, because we're cutting so much of the audio, everything to the left of this key frame.

28
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,490
It's kind of quiet.

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,170
So I want to create a audio keyframe.

30
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,930
I can do it up here by doing this or I can do it down here by clicking with the pen tool.

31
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,070
Same thing.

32
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,560
But we're going to turn it up and turn it down as this audio filter is getting disengaged.

33
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,690
OK, cool.

34
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,930
Perfect.

35
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,100
So we ended up actually using that filter, that's perfect.

36
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,410
Now that we have that taken care of.

37
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:38,050
Now, I want to add a little bit of a sound design element to this transition right here to help us

38
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,120
get from track one to track two.
