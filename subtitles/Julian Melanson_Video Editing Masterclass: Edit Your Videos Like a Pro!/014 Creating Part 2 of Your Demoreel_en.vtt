00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:08.700
So I feel like we've been ready to hop into the next bit of this, into the second track, but keep

2
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.820
getting sidetracked.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.300
Now let's listen to this real quick.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.520
Super cool, high energy track.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.300
And you know, when you're going through the memorial, you want to keep in mind where the high energy

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.090
footage is that you have now.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:35.550
I know I have this fire stuff, so let's go ahead and try that first, because I want this to be a big

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.060
boom.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.010
We're having a switch in song.

10
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.590
We're coming out of this like drone, very elegant, you know, slow moving, far away shots from the

11
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.120
aerial perspective.

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.140
Now, I want this to be a big contrast.

13
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.170
So I think the fire footage is going to be perfect for that.

14
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.610
Oh, yeah.

15
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.910
Each.

16
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.750
Now, I'm just going to kind of clean this up a little bit by making this clip come in sooner.

17
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.740
Now, we don't necessarily need that clip.

18
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.510
Let's go ahead and move that back.

19
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.580
Now I want to go into more fire because I know we have a different project that has some really cool

20
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.210
fire footage.

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.870
So just like how we did with similarities earlier in the edit, like Hand Hand and then a few other

22
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.620
things that we did.

23
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.650
I'm going to try to do that here.

24
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.300
So I want this first shot is great, but because this has so much fire, I want to find one.

25
00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.470
Yeah.

26
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.550
Let's do this one.

27
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.490
Just so we are matching the at least a little bit, the amount of fire in the shots.

28
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.960
OK.

29
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.770
You know, I don't think we need this one.

30
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.110
So I'm going to take that one away.

31
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.030
It's

32
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.090
OK.

33
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.870
I'm actually liking that.

34
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.290
There's like a similar this shot is like leading the eye down and then boom, these just kind of cut

35
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.850
together really nicely.

36
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.250
So it's kind of skewed this over.

37
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.900
Chop this down.

38
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.050
Let's see if this will cut in right here.

39
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.620
Mrs..

40
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.640
I think that's enough fire footage.

41
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.360
Let's see what else we got.

42
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.820
Oh, yeah, let's get into some of this cool stuff, so go ahead and drag this in.

43
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.060
Perfect.

44
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.550
So this really cool effect that I did in the after effects fits perfectly with the core audio cue that

45
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.870
we're hearing at this moment.

46
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.460
OK.

47
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.530
And I believe, yeah, I did some more duplicating cloning effects from this past project.

48
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.850
So let's do that similar thing.

49
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.040
We have fire, fire, fire, and then a clone, clone, clone, clone.

50
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.840
OK.

51
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.770
And let's just kind of take a look at what we just did there.

52
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.670
Now, I want some things kind of off here on the pacing.

53
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.170
Yeah, I'm going to put this shot first, actually, and then we're going to kind of scoot this over.

54
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.350
So this is just the editing process.

55
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.130
You try you undo command Z, whatever.

56
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.270
Old Z, undo.

57
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.140
Undo, undo.

58
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.980
Try again.

59
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.570
Try again.

60
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.050
So we're going to get this flowing.

61
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.440
Good.

62
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.810
And then we're going to move to the next section.

63
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.000
OK, perfect.

64
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.710
So now we are at about a minute and 20 second mark.

65
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.320
And if we listen to the end, it is looking good.

66
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.880
And if we listen to the audio here, there's an opportunity at this part of the song to actually potentially

67
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.170
finish the song.

68
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.560
It's.

69
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.160
Perfect.

70
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.580
OK, I'm loving what's coming together here, and in the next video lesson, we're going to edit down

71
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:59.440
this soundtrack, because there's a part here where we can actually potentially end the song here and

72
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.310
keep this demo real short and sweet.

73
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.840
So I'll see you in the next video lesson.
