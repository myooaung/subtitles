1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:08,700
And one thing I actually wanted to add before wrapping up this lesson is to kind of summarize this idea

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,670
of continuity and compressing time.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,550
So let's take a look at continuity.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:23,970
This idea of continuity ensures that your video has matching position of objects in your frame space,

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,210
a.k.a. where you're shooting and time, a.k.a. the flow of normal time.

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:38,820
So in most videos, the goal is to create a smooth flow of space or location, even when parts of your

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,470
film are not necessarily even shot in order or at the same time.

8
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,770
So what we're going to talk about is can be a little bit tricky.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:55,110
Now, if we break continuity or compress time on a dialogue scene and characters in your video start

10
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,190
skipping forward, in the words that they're saying, instead of saying the whole sentence from front

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,130
to back, they say the first word and you edit to the last word.

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,190
That's not going to make sense.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,980
That's not a proper break in continuity, and that's not a proper way to compress time in your edit.

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,480
In that scenario, this exact principle would actually be distracting and bring down the quality of

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,050
your video.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,410
But in other scenarios, we can use this technique to skip forward in time and purposefully break continuity

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,610
to create an effect.

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,900
So if we just look at the first few shots of the montage we just created.

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,080
This is the perfect example of a scenario where it makes sense to break continuity.

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,610
There's information that simply doesn't need to be shown here.

21
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,500
That's why we skip ahead.

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,010
So one of the beauties of film is that twenty four hours in the film or video world doesn't have to

23
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,340
equal.

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,020
Twenty four hours in real life.

25
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,420
So if we take the same exact shot without any breaks and continuity, without any compressing in time

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,910
and just play it as it was in real life, let's see what the clip looks like.

27
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,390
OK.

28
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,610
Not a whole lot to talk about there.

29
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:44,110
Right, but I think it's pretty clear your goal is to find those moments where you can bend the rules

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,550
and use your blade tool, use your edits to enhance your footage and create something that wasn't there

31
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,330
originally.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,760
Now, the techniques aren't going to be one size fits all for every single video.

33
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,390
It's about your discernment that you're starting to really cultivate from this course, and that's how

34
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,950
you're going to be able to make the right decisions in all of your future edits.
