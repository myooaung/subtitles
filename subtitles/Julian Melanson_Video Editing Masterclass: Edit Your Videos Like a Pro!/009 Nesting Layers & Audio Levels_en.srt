1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,020
So once I had those, I pre composed it or nested that sequence or those clips, rather.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,970
And that's what became this.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,870
Then I could independently or actually then I could move all of the clips as one.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,100
Because if I try to do that without testing the clips, as soon as I try to move this one, then I got

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,230
to move the rest of them.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,380
So once I had the alignment properly, I had this exactly where I wanted.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,960
I had this exactly where I wanted.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,950
And I had the definition thing exactly where I wanted.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,630
I nested that.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,460
And then that's what we got right here.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,990
And that's what allowed for me to.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,810
Originally it was this big, so I scaled it down 80 and I could put it literally wherever I wanted and

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,680
or wherever I want.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,540
And group them all together.

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,280
Now, that's what's going on.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,540
On the visual side.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:01:00,430
On the audible side, you can see our music comes down here because her speaking comes in right here.

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,930
So we want the music to go from the primary thing to the secondary thing as the primary.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,990
Her audio, a.k.a. her audio, comes in.

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,860
And then we have this sound effect in the background, which is simply a little sound effect.

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:22,200
I got line of a chalkboard of a person writing on a chalkboard sound effect.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,480
So if we look at all those elements together.

23
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:35,870
Literary analysis is analysis, this little sound effect helps to provoke or just, you know, make

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,380
this moment a little bit more realistic with what's happening on screen.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,700
So if I were to remove that.

26
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,220
Literary analysis.

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,360
OK, I'm going to put it back.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,250
Literary analysis.

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,580
It just has a cool little shop.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,120
Right.

31
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,560
And that's really the key with these little subtle sound effects.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,810
We have vocals, music.

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,010
Sound effect layer.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,480
Sound effects, layer.

35
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:05,880
And you want to only use a sound effects layer in proper moments where stuff needs to be.

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,610
You know, if I do this and you hear it, that's very normal.

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,490
But if I did this.

38
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,320
And I took out the sound or it didn't add the sound in, when someone sees that, they're just like

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,640
that doesn't really make sense.

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,800
That's a really good way to explain when you should add sound effects and why it's actually helping.

41
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,180
So if we move forward a little bit more, it's about assessing, cataloging all the pieces of a text.

42
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,540
And we have a lot going on.

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,590
But all this is is the same exact process that I just explained.

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,890
We have the audio sound effect right here.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,260
We have our music right here.

46
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,340
We have her speaking right here, and then we have our nested sequence that is all of these overlays

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,470
very similar to what we just worked on.

48
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,240
So we have a color mat that's just blocking out a part of the image that we don't want to show up.

49
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,210
We have our screen capture that is of the website.

50
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:16,950
And then we have if I double click that we have all of the elements that we dragged in on top.

51
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:27,780
So this is basically just a really complex version because there's so many layers to have all this stuff

52
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,380
coming in.

53
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,700
But it's the same exact process.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,190
I use a ramp to change the color.

55
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,230
OK.

56
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:41,840
Right there, I change the scaling height and with to get the right ratio and proportion on all these

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
different elements.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,210
I move them all into place exactly where I wanted them to go, just like that.

59
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,570
And then I stacked them on top of each other and had them all come in at their own moment to really

60
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,030
make a complex looking piece.

61
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,800
Once I had that, then I nested that sequence just like this.

62
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,100
So now I have all of what's inside here.

63
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,020
I selected everything right click went boom nest.

64
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,040
That's what created this sequence.

65
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,050
And now they're all right there, boom.

66
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:24,910
And then I overlaid that crazy complex sequence on top of a screen cap of their website that look like

67
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,070
this, which is the background.

68
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,700
Right.

69
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,820
And nested that again.

70
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,960
And that is what created this one single clip with all of that motion.

71
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:46,240
And the reason I did that final nesting was so as you can see this zooming effect originally, if I

72
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,980
go to the effects and let's say I cancel these and we just hit play, it's about the Stassi cataloging

73
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,840
all the pieces of the text.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,450
It's very stagnant.

75
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,360
It's very still.

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,150
There's no movement.

77
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,880
So if I put that back, then you'll see as we play through, there's this nice zoom in.

78
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,240
So nesting and having multiple media assets.

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,070
Yeah.

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:15,130
It really will allow for you to create a lot of cool stuff because then you can take 13 layers that

81
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,070
you created for this two second sequence, nested and then changed the function of the parameters of

82
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,020
all those clips at once.

83
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,370
So another cool, really advanced technique to take a lot of content boom, upgraded as much as possible,

84
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:38,530
use audio in this kind of moment and create a really cool looking overlay, high end asset for your

85
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,010
video.
