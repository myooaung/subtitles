1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,820
Now, next step, which might be applicable to your footage if you shot your project in four K.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,960
This was not.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,830
But if you did, the next step would be to create your proxies.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,560
That way, it wouldn't employ your computer.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,680
Create a black hole and suck everything in where you're working in.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,870
Do I know I'm going with that.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,790
But so let's go ahead and create the proxies, even though I haven't shot in four k.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,540
I still want to show you the process again so that you really lock it in.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,250
So let's select the clips.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:38,400
You want to create proxies of right click those clips, go to proxy, create proxies and you can choose.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,270
I recommend either medium or low, depending on your computer's speed and editing capacity.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,800
And before we hit, OK, we want to choose where we want to save these proxies, too.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,860
So we're going to navigate to our original folder.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,620
Create a new folder title at Proxy's, select the folder, and then hit, OK.

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,450
Now, what that's going to do is automatically pop up Adobe Media Encoder and it will automatically

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,690
add all those files to queue and start generating the low resolution proxy files once those are done.

17
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,090
You can get back into premier.

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,230
And if it doesn't show the proxy column already in your project panel, you can right click the top

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,750
click metter display type and proxy highlight the proxy function.

20
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,620
Hit OK.

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,040
And now it'll show you which proxies have been created and attached.

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:46,260
Once those are done in that footage is in the timeline, you can then engage and disengage the proxies

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,780
by toggling on and off the proxy function in the program panel.
