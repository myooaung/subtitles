00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.550
So let's dive right in here.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.250
What we're going to be doing is learning how to edit a vlog or YouTube video.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:16.440
So the idea of this section is that we'll be using the editing process of an actual YouTube style video

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.000
to learn more about intermediate level editing techniques.

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.010
It's a little bit more on the complex side.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.590
So I'm not going to be able to transfer all the footage that I have for you to download.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.549
So you either be using your own footage that you have.

8
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.820
If you have a vlog that's ready to edit a YouTube video, that's ready to edit or footage that you have,

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.840
that's of a more complex level than the footage we've already worked on.

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.990
Perfect.

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.390
You'll be able to use that edit along with me, or you can follow along and absorb the information and

12
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.190
techniques that I'm going to share.

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:01.770
So by the end of this section, the goal is for you to be able to 100 percent on your own edit your

14
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.420
own highly produced YouTube video from start to finish.

15
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.470
So sorry for that.

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.610
Intro is a little bit lengthy, but I really wanted to set the stage of what we're going to be working

17
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670
on before we really dive into the process.

18
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.270
So let's get into it.
