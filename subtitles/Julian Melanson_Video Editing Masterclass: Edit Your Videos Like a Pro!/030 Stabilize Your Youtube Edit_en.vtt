00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.820
So look at this thing, we're really starting to build a proper complex edit here.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:16.930
Now, next thing that I want to hop into is refining this final sequence that we have.

3
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590
Now, I'm going to let this play through.

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.890
It's like 45 seconds.

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.660
And I want you to tell me if you can tell, if you can see what you think we're going to refine in this

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.020
part.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.590
And as a little bit of a bonus, final touch, I added some PVC pipes to hide the cables.

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.150
It did all for you.

9
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.310
Oh, yeah, OK, OK.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.990
And I added some artwork on the walls, replaced by more bulky professional tripod with a much slimmer

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.330
small footprint.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.610
Tripod hid all these extra cables.

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.250
God knows we needed to do that and added these super led strips that allow us for me to change the feeling

14
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.020
and the vibe of the room.

15
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.520
One click of a button.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.099
So there you have it.

17
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.380
All of your hard work has paid off.

18
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.570
This is where we started with.

19
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.240
And let's see that beautiful before and after shot while he bavin.

20
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.190
That is a work of art right here.

21
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.940
I completely love how this space came together.

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.530
All the little details.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.460
Perfect.

24
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.920
I really enjoy working here.

25
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.220
I really enjoy editing in here, and I really enjoy just sharing in this space.

26
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.330
So I hope this video really gave you some insights.

27
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.740
So I hope that you're seeing what I'm seeing.

28
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.860
All these shots are great, right?

29
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.710
But they're shaky as hell.

30
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.670
I mean, I hope you can see this through your screen because it's pretty clear on mine.

31
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.810
I mean, like this shot, you see that?

32
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.300
Oh, God, yeah.

33
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.100
When you full screen it, you can really see it.

34
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.490
So when people are watching it full screen on their phone, when they're watching it full screen on

35
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.050
YouTube or whatever it is, the warp stabilization and the stabilization phase of the editing process

36
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.770
is huge.

37
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.340
And that's really what's going to make this final montage of all these great shots really come together.

38
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.290
So we've done it before, but I wanted to touch on it for this style of video.

39
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.780
And I'm going to go ahead and type and warp stabilizer.

40
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.450
You can type in whatever kind of stabilization filter you're editing software has.

41
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.120
And I'm going to go through here and select all the clips that need it.

42
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.440
This one does not.

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.900
All the ones after it do.

44
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.010
This is a tripod shot.

45
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.360
There's nothing to stabilize.

46
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.680
But all these need help.

47
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:58.620
So I'm going to select all the clips about a boom, drag that on and see what else in this montage is

48
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.240
going to use of stabilization.

49
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.210
That's another tripod shot.

50
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.180
It's another tripod.

51
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.880
This one definitely.

52
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.180
OK, so all of these now we're going to let the filter analyze this footage and then we're going to

53
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.750
go and fine tune the intensity of the filter so that you can't really tell it has a filter on it.

54
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.630
But it should just look like a really steady, smooth shot.

55
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.750
OK.

56
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.990
Now, this filter finished analyzing the clips and apologies.

57
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.810
It kind of heated up my computer a little bit.

58
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.850
So it's got the fan crank in.

59
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.070
And if you hear in the background, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.020
But let's take a look at these shots.

61
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.490
That looks good.

62
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.460
OK, looking good.

63
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.930
It all these extra teams.

64
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.200
God knows we needed to do these look great.

65
00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.520
Normally there's a little bit of warping that you have to take out by decreasing the intensity.

66
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.830
But all of these are looking pretty good so far.

67
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.860
So there you have it.

68
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.100
And you're just paid off.

69
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.410
This is what we started with.

70
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.960
And let's see that beautiful before and after shots.

71
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.760
He.

72
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.000
David is working on right there.

73
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.140
I completely love.

74
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.740
OK.

75
00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.800
This one is having some issues.

76
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.050
So let's go ahead and turn it down from 50 percent to 30 percent.

77
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.430
And let's turn and I explain this early in the course.

78
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.000
But, yeah, the smoothness is the intensity that the filter is applying and scaling up to remedy the

79
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.810
shakiness.

80
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.970
Subspace warp is the default.

81
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.140
If you're getting too much warping, it looks like the footage is underwater.

82
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.880
You can try doing perspective.

83
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.070
That's generally what I do.

84
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.130
And that does the trick.

85
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.100
Still getting a little bit.

86
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.290
It doesn't like that.

87
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.610
I see the look here and here you get these weird wobbles.

88
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.490
It's subtle.

89
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.870
But in this kind of situation, rather than trying to fine tune it, what you can do is, you know,

90
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.970
if you know that the filter is having problems towards the beginning of the clip, go a little bit later,

91
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.230
scrub, take it over and now reanalyze the clip.

92
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.750
And now it's not going to have to try to analyze and deal with that really hard part that it's not having

93
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.680
an easy time with.

94
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.580
So let's check that out.

95
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.370
OK, Alex, pretty good.

96
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.490
A little bit too much on this one.

97
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.410
Thirty.

98
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.600
The these sites and inspired you to go out and create your own space.

99
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.130
Oh, yeah, that one's got a little too much.

100
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.880
So let's put it on perspective.

101
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.110
Turn it down your own space, OK?

102
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.570
It's going to warp is see, like I mentioned, it doesn't like stuff in the foreground.

103
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.710
I like having stuff in the foreground because it makes a shot more dynamic.

104
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.870
But I don't think it's going to work for this filter.

105
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.540
So let's scoot it, reanalyze it in space.

106
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.880
This uniquely yours.

107
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.580
If you like this video, be sure to check out the rest of my games and where I share my other tips and

108
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.240
techniques of how to become a better video creator.

109
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.510
And I will see you in the next video.

110
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.800
OK, you're sweet, so I'm not even going to show up before and after of with the stabilization and

111
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.440
without because we already know this a thousand times better, and it's an excellent final step in the

112
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.580
refinement process.

113
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:04.040
In the next lesson, I'm going to show you how to, you know, add a little bit of extra oomph on special

114
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.090
shots in your edit.

115
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.360
And I'm going to show in the way that I'm going to show you is what I'm trying to say is this transition

116
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.240
is really like the money shot of this entire project.

117
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.620
So I'm going to show you how to connect your editing software with after effects in the next lesson.
