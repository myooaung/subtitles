1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,689
Awesome, so now we're towards the end of our edit, and I want to spend this last video lesson for

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:13,140
this project, specifically on deconstructing the outro, the final sequence of this edit.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,880
So let's hop into it.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,390
You were suddenly thrown into a Virgin Sea, and that's where the angst of this poem lives.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,550
Each one of these quizzes, premium learning lessons in study diets is going to give you the tools you

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,930
need to totally transform the way you experience literature.

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,350
So if you're ready to get started, you can choose your membership plan and become an email member today.

8
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,800
OK, cool, so let's start at the beginning here.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,340
We have the final words, the final line of this sequence, and we just went over this whole brown sequence.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,270
She delivers her final words right here.

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,710
We have our favorite swoosh transition going.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,800
You can see it's negative.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,280
One hundred.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,910
So originally, you know what we're using it for.

15
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,810
Sounds like this.

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,980
But in all honesty, the original was this.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,180
So I reversed it because I wanted the intro of the sound to be longer, I want it to be short versus.

18
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:37,230
Right now that in a sense, you can reverse your sound effects to either bring, you know, this part

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,900
to the beginning of or to the end.

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,290
It's a really cool way to do it.

21
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:49,730
So I wanted a little bit more lead in the use of this sound specifically to go into our new song, which

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,450
is right here.

23
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,080
Each one of these twists and we're using the same technique of bringing our sound to the forefront right

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,220
here, dropping down the audio just as the vocals are coming in.

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,170
And, you know, you can see this gradual.

26
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,670
We're not doing this where it's just like.

27
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,890
Each one of these.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,670
That's too abrupt.

29
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,160
We want to gradually always be working gradually with sound and music.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,590
Rarely are you going to do any key framing.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,010
It's like sometimes, but very rarely you want it to be as smooth as possible.

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,440
Now, we're going to have some sound effects right here and we're going to have more screen caps.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,000
Each one of these.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,670
Oh, and by the way, yeah, we did the same style where we had our audio.

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,030
I mean, excuse me, we have our title card right here.

36
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,050
OK.

37
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:56,680
And then we have a little bit of a B shot behind with very low opacity secondary in the background so

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,570
that it doesn't look too plain like that.

39
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,310
But we're adding a little bit of character.

40
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,290
We cut to our screen cap.

41
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,720
You can see there's a pretty consistent zoom in throughout all of these shots.

42
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:15,070
So if I let it play, each one of these quizzes, premium learning lessons and study guides is going

43
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,500
to give you the tools you need to.

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,070
So, yes, we have this subtle kind of zooming in.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,670
That's really nice for each one of these clips just to create a little bit more movement, especially

46
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,860
on this last one right here.

47
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,680
You see, we have like we scroll down that's moving.

48
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,680
I didn't have to add in.

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,440
That was actually from being on a website and physically scrolling.

50
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,160
But you see, we have this nice give you the tools you need, kind of pan or tilt down.

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,620
So these things are key.

52
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,110
Like the reason I keep repeating is sharing these, because when I do that now, I take it away.

53
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:51,830
Look at that.

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,170
It has not nearly as much of a good vibe.

55
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,560
This is with it, Boonchu.

56
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,820
Right, so these little techniques you use multiple times in one video that build up to a much cooler,

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,510
better looking final product and final edit.

58
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,070
Totally transform the way you experience literature.

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,070
So if you're ready to get started, you can choose your membership plan and become an annual member

60
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,519
today.

61
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,500
And again, we have this zoom out with her.

62
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,770
I chose to zoom out at the end because we're leaving.

63
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,390
We're ending our sequence.

64
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:36,470
We're not zooming in like in the beginning of the video where it's like a fun, exciting, exhilarating

65
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,370
kind of intro.

66
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,210
All these beautiful shots, we're ending our video or ending our project.

67
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,910
So what did I do here?

68
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,930
I did a scale out, boom, we're moving away.

69
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,810
And then we have our very simple titles come in and we have the client's logo.

70
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,990
That's right here.

71
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,460
You can see that's originally what it looked like.

72
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:05,540
What I did was I created a color matte down here at the bottom, and I made it the same exact color

73
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,570
of the logo.

74
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,990
So if I take away the logo, here's the color matte.

75
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,650
If I just have the logo itself.

76
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,700
That's what it looks like.

77
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,090
OK, so caller, Matt, same color as the background of the logo that you can see right here.

78
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,280
And then we have our title.

79
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:35,730
Now, the logo kind of has a nice little slight blurriness that helps it come in a little bit more elegantly.

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,380
So if we take away this blur, you see it's a lot more sharp, but we don't want that for this kind

81
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,520
of scenario.

82
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,680
So at the beginning, I put a fast blur.

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,330
We talked about this earlier in the course.

84
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,420
I keyframe it up to 50 percent and then down right here to zero percent, just as it's fading in.

85
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,050
And then let everything else on the fade out.

86
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,010
There's no fast when everything else fades out the same way.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,640
But just to yeah.

88
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,130
Create a little something else, this just kind of does a nice blur fade in Denver today?

89
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,560
And I also did a fade in on our color minute.

90
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,330
So what it does is it kind of comes in from a black screen to the branding color of the client.

91
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,980
Now, if I take that fade in a way and let it play, you'll remember today.

92
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,590
It's just too abrupt to just go to this big purple bluish Barney, whatever kind of color scheme it,

93
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,110
it didn't feel right.

94
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,140
So I added just this little right here you can see it, opacity is at zero percent and it fades in right

95
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,740
there.

96
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,580
It hits 100 percent.

97
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,600
It's become an annual number today.
