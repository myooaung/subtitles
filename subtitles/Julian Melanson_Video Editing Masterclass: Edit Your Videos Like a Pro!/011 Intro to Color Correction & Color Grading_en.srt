1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,810
Perfect.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,540
So we've learned so far together how to really create a first draft edit using the much more foundational

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,500
and straightforward techniques and tools as an editor.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,280
Now, we could technically call the edit done at this point.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:26,490
A lot of people do, but it is the final fine tuning and little extra aesthetical aesthetical, I hope.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,630
I don't know if that's a word, but stylistic choices and changes that.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,640
Is that less 10 percent.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,450
That creates a final edit that really looks different.

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,370
So what we're now going to be moving towards in this next learning lesson is how to add that final glossy

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,680
layer to an edit like this.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,470
For each edit, that final glossy layer is different.

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,670
For some projects, it could be more adding motion graphics for other projects.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,520
It could be adding a specific transition throughout the piece that makes it look more cohesive and stylized

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,980
for this particular project.

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,150
We're going to color correct all of our clips individually to get the levels right and the exposure

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,660
correct.

17
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,060
And then we're going to do a pass across the whole timeline where we're going to actually colored grade

18
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,350
our footage.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,310
Now, people kind of mix up the words color corrected color, great color.

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,700
Correct.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,380
Is you're correcting the color, the levels, the highlights, the darks, the blacks, the whites and

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,210
the tint and the tone of your content.

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,540
Sometimes you have a random green shot in there.

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,210
And when all the other shots are pretty neutral color temperature, or there's a very blue shot or an

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,240
overly orange shot in the color correcting process, we're balancing all the shots of the whole timeline

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,260
is equalized.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:55,020
And then in the color grading process, where then stylizing a layer of a specific look on top of the

28
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,470
footage.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,580
So we're going to do that.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,740
And then we're also going to add some more key framing and motion changes to some of our clips in our

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,140
timeline so that it matches up a little bit more with the beat and adds a little extra character and

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,860
stylizing.

33
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,479
So let's get into it.
