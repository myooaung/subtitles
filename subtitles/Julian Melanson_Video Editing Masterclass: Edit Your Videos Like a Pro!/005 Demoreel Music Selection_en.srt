1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,300
And I'm going to grab our possible music tracks now.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,780
What I did here to gather these tracks and let me go ahead and put them all into one sequence so we

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,500
could talk about what it did here was I knew what I wanted in mind for my specific kind of demo reel.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,910
I know I don't really want vocals because that can kind of have too much emotion behind it or the words

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,920
of the song can be a little bit too dissonant to what you're showing.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,570
So if the song is singing about a breakup, it's not going to work for a demo reel.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,450
You want to be careful about how much emotion your song is going to have.

8
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,920
So you want it to be right amount of energy without being too high.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,610
OK.

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,860
So we definitely talked about this early in the chorus, but let's see what our options are.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,320
OK, yeah, that's pretty cool.

12
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:16,510
It's a little bit on the not so bright side, more on the dark kind of trap music side, but we're going

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:16,990
to save it.

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,040
I'm going to do blue.

15
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:27,970
OK,

16
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,840
that was kind of cool.

17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,120
It's got a little bit of a quirkiness to it.

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,020
I don't know how much I'm feeling the Corke, but I'm going to do the maybes orange, so.

19
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,310
And what I'm doing here is we're going to go through because when you pull possible tracks, you know,

20
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,160
you want to have at least three to choose from for a video like this where I really want to nail the

21
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,270
track perfectly.

22
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm going to do more than three options, like maybe six.

23
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,400
And we're going to just go ahead and try to get rid of what we definitely feel like.

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,020
It's not going to work that way.

25
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,180
We can kind of narrow it down a little bit easier.

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,580
Oh, man, I'm feeling like all of these are just maybes.

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,380
So I haven't found one yet.

28
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,640
That's like a Helius.

29
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,720
Now, there's one more track that I actually also have that.

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,160
Let's see what this sounds like.

31
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,350
OK, let's try this one out.

32
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,980
So in the next video lesson, we're going to drop in our track.
