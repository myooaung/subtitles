00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.110
And now if we navigate to our project files, go to our editing folder.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.060
We have both of our versions here.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.400
So you can see we have our story post.

4
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.660
Now that is a waterfall.

5
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.270
And then we have our secondary version where we did a little bit of experimenting with adding a soundtrack.

6
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.840
I hope that that gave you some insights on the techniques and the strategy on keeping your workspace

7
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.830
clean, using a good workflow that's going to speed up your editing and really learn how to use the

8
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.180
different options that you have of using different audio styles, using music and cutting your footage

9
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.580
in a way that actually creates the feeling that you want in your viewer.

10
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.980
We clearly have the same exact footage.

11
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.820
We use different editing techniques to create a different final product.

12
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.900
And then we exported those different edits in different formats that matched up for different ways of

13
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.400
sharing that content.

14
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.979
So to summarize what we did in this chapter, we first started with our workflow where we learn how

15
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.890
to organize back our content, as you know, one of my favorite parts, and keep a clean workspace,

16
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.990
which is going to really come in handy as we go through this course and our edits get more and more

17
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.260
complex and we learn more high level techniques.

18
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.010
After we captured and gathered all of our content, we then started pulling our selects inside of our

19
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.300
editing software.

20
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:40.060
This allowed us to really organize our editing timeline and create a really rough but organized and

21
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.310
color coded structure so that we didn't really have to worry about what the final edit would look like.

22
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.480
But we got to kind of put things in places and experiment a little to find out the ordering and the

23
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.610
overall flow of our edit.

24
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.020
After that, we went into creating our first draft edit.

25
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.370
This is where we really focus more on pacing rhythm, honing in on the shots that we were going to use,

26
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.510
and started to really get an idea of what our edit was going to look like.

27
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.940
Then we moved into refining our audio.

28
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.990
We use Crossfade to make our cuts a lot more seamless.

29
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.140
We balanced out the levels of our audio between our clips, and then we tried a secondary edit where

30
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.340
we used music instead of our background audio from our footage.

31
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.200
And this is just the beginning.

32
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.730
We're like, honestly just scratching the surface on the post-production process.

33
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.260
So we're going to grow a lot.

34
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.820
We're going to learn a lot during this course.

35
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.720
So I'm excited.

36
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.270
And I will see you in the next chapter.
