1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,550
And as we go through this, now that we finished our Selex, we're going to start making our rough edit.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,460
Now, we're not going to use any music yet because we want to first get this sequence down from right

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,670
now.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,100
It's at six minutes and five seconds.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,730
We want to get it a lot closer to kind of that 30 second window that the actual edit is going to be

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,980
before we drop in the music track.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,610
OK.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,200
So let's now scrub through our Selex and see which shots are going to be the best.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,920
OK, so if we look at the beginning of the sequence is going to be our opening shot.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:45,250
OK, so I'd imagine that by the time we get to here, we have plenty of other coverage, simply meaning

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,950
by coverage, I mean other angles that are covering what we're shooting.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,880
So more coverage means more shot options, less coverage means less shot options, since it's going

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,110
to be a really quick paced, high rhythmic pacing.

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,770
We're probably going to have a cut by the time we get to here.

15
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,440
We have plenty of other shots to choose from, so I'm going to delete.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,360
Right there and I know we have better coverage from the Selex we polled.

17
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,440
This is kind of a wide, boring shot.

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,630
It doesn't look too dramatic.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,550
The batteries kind of, you know, sadly falling to the ground.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,330
He's reloading, but I know we have better reload shots from the process we just did.

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,590
So I'm going to delete that.

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,560
And now I'm going to see if this intro shot is better or if this one is better.

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,830
So let's go ahead and delete the access from both of these and let's play these back to back.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:39,910
OK.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,690
I like his posture there and the way he kind of pulls around the camera.

26
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,120
It looks like the camera's got some weight to it.

27
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,640
This one is not as interesting the way his body's angled.

28
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,240
This one seems to be a little bit more appealing with the camera movement.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,880
Versus this one.

30
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,140
OK, so let's go ahead and make the decision to delete the second one, because it's likely that we're

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,990
not going to use it, and we always do have it as a backup in our SELEX backup sequence.

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,190
OK, that's a little bit out of order, we're not going to use that one yet, so we're going to the

33
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,140
opening the camera.

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,090
Which means that.

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,040
We can actually put these at the very end.

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,760
And this set of orange clips is going to be the next four hour sequence.

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,760
So let's see which of these three is the best take.

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,360
OK, looks like the battery gets caught up on that tape.

39
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,970
I don't think we're going to be using that.

40
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,980
That's OK.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,580
That one is really cool.

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,460
Let's delete this middle shot that we don't need, so then we have opening the battery thing, pushing

43
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,160
the button and then throwing it whenever you're skipping forward ahead in time and kind of breaking

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,260
continuity by speeding up a process.

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,810
You're automatically making that process kind of jump forward and feel a bit more exciting.

46
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,030
So that's really the goal on this style of it, is if we were doing something that is more smooth,

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,310
storytelling with a voiceover would be a completely different style of editing, which we are going

48
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,380
to be doing in the next exercise.

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,980
So let's leave this as a rough edit the way it is.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,950
Boom, love that shot and notes.

51
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,660
Now, as this is falling out of frame, that's the perfect cutting moment when you're looking at when

52
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,100
to cut to transition to this now coming into frame.

53
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,280
Oh, so you always want to, as an editor, go for a seamless style of editing.

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,140
So here we can see that he's bringing in the battery.

55
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,940
And just before we cut, there's a little bump you see right there.

56
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:09,210
There is an extra few frames where his motion pauses and it creates a little bit of a like a little

57
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,220
bit of a jerkiness into the next shot.

58
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,790
So there's extra space there.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,149
So we're going to take this shot and we're going to scoot it over.

60
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm going to hold command and do the left arrow a few frames to scoot over this shot closer to this

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,140
one.

62
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:26,850
Boom.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,800
So there's still oh, that little pause right there.

64
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,070
So we're going to take even a few more frames by moving this clip over to the left.

65
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,900
OK, that's a lot better.

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,700
OK.

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,570
And now there's a little bit of an extra pause on this shot.

68
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,880
You see how where we start the clip.

69
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,920
It's waiting, boom.

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:53,210
So what we want to do to create an even more seamless, smooth cut is cut on the action versus cutting

71
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,320
on when there's pausing.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,330
We want to transition the action here of the movement into the action here of that movement.

73
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,600
So there's a few extra frames here.

74
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,830
So let's go ahead and scoot to where the action starts and we'll create a cut.

75
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,390
And now look at the edit.

76
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,430
Boom, that's a lot better.

77
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,720
I would even move over this clip even further to the left, so let's one to three.

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:29,430
Oh, so this is really the key and one of the main benefits of using multiple different shots and having

79
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,040
those different shots in your SELEX sequence is that we can really easily navigate the scrub through

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,110
and find the best shot like this one is so much more smooth and kind of interesting, even though it's

81
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,630
such a simple little thing of just closing this little camera hatch, it's going to make a big difference.

82
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,720
So boom, boom, boom, that one we don't want.

83
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:03,870
And we just found that the very last take that we did has the best real close.

84
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,070
So let's go ahead and trim that or hit save and we'll see our three options here for the ending shot.

85
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,920
So that's looks a little bit blurry.

86
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,450
Is that intro?

87
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,740
Yeah, I'd like to see one with the camera and the lens in focus.

88
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,670
So it seems that one's looking a lot better.

89
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,130
Oh, I think this one is the one.

90
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,950
So can you see the difference in these three options?

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,350
That was, OK, this one's a little bit better, and I think we nailed it on this one.

92
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,820
Right.

93
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,330
The performance is great, even though he's just lifting the camera.

94
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,950
But it's in focus.

95
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,820
Good framing.

96
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,710
And the motion is great.

97
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,300
So let's delete these extra ones.

98
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,280
Get rid of this empty space.

99
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,300
And cut in.

100
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,320
And we'll probably probably do some time remapping, which I'm really excited to show you how to do

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,560
that.

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,800
Perfect.

103
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,540
And now that we have our super rough edit ready to go.

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,700
Next up is to find the perfect song to match our edit.
