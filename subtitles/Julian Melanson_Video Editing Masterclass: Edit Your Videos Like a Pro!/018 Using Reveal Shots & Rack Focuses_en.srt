1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:09,030
And we are just about done pulling our Selex here, and I wanted to just share a little bit of an insight

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,530
when it comes to choosing where to begin your shot.

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,970
Now, on this example, you can actually see here that we're physically starting our shot where it's

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,720
out of focus.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,050
And what's in focus is technically behind the main focal point of what we're showing, which is this

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,000
piece of equipment.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,470
You can clearly see the logo.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,390
You can clearly see the title and the name of the equipment.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,880
And we're actually starting the shot just before we're pulling it into focus.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,490
Now, on paper, this would make no sense.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:48,000
But visually, as you can see, it's actually a bit of a nice introduction into this shot.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,940
It has a little bit more depth, this shot.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,070
There's no intro focus.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,440
There's no there's nothing at the beginning of it that kind of introduces what the viewer's looking

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,640
at.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,550
Now, if we come back to this shot, we have a nice little introduction.

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,490
So you can do this in a few different ways of a different shot types.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,090
You can do a rack focus, just like what we're seeing here.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,820
You can also do what's called a reveal shot, where something in the frame is covering and slowly moves

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,120
out of the way of where the viewer is going to be looking.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,530
So let's see what that looks like.

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:34,830
As you can see, we have some foreground and it smoothly moves out of the way as our camera moves to

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,820
the main focus point of this, the main focus point of this image.

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,150
So on paper, like I said, again, this is another scenario where it doesn't make a whole lot of sense

25
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,900
to start the shot here from everything that we've learned up to this point.

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,330
This would kind of be breaking the rule of finding the endpoint, finding the outpoint, not having

27
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,280
any extra space or information that doesn't need to be there if it's not offering value.

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:08,699
So technically, this is a little bit of a rule breaker, but as you can see, offers depth and a little

29
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,650
bit more of a dynamic image.

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,410
So let's keep looking at some of the examples here.

31
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,260
So on this next shot, as we're setting up, we have the foreground camera in focus.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,680
And we do a rack focus, go to the rest of the setup that's in the room.

33
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,960
So this is a perfect other example.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,920
I can actually there's a bit of an extra wobble in here.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,740
That right there is when we start.

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,670
So let's actually scoot that over.

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:36,990
Yep.

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,480
A lot more depth versus if I just started the shot from here.

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
Of course, everything in frame looks great.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,650
But adding that extra few bit of frames consciously is what's giving these shots, that little extra

41
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,070
oomph.

42
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,770
Now, I think I cued up a few more examples here as well.

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,990
So as I was pulling these Selex.

44
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:15,190
I decided to keep those few extra introductory frames of these clips where I'm actually moving, what

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm showing to the audience into frame, or they're coming into focus just as the clip comes on.

46
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,190
So as you can see, a little bit of movement there with my hand and the item that I'm holding coming

47
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,840
into focus, adding a little bit of that depth versus just starting right here.

48
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,440
We get a little extra moments.

49
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,280
Not too much, though.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,090
Not too little.

51
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,900
Just a little bit.

52
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,980
Same with here.

53
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,630
I move the item into frame.

54
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,540
Same with that.

55
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,620
There's a little bit of a rack focus and with this as well.

56
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,550
That is just a little extra insight as you're building your skills, getting to these more intermediate

57
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,140
level techniques and ideas.

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,030
That's just something I want to add in there.

59
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,820
Now we're almost done pulling all the Selex.

60
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,650
And I'm excited because this is where things are really going to start to get interesting.
