1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,440
Now, if we were to put this edit that we just worked on together in a theme, I would say nature travel

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,440
outdoors.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,750
OK, it's not a crazy action sports video.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,680
It's not an artistic moody music video.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,180
OK, so yours is probably in the family friends outdoors memory type of genre.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,600
So that's the kind of feeling that we want to cultivate even more through the music that we're going

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,410
to choose.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,680
OK, so there's a few ways of getting your music for your edits.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,800
Like I mentioned with, you know, getting sound effects in the past through just kind of ripping and

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,150
ripping them off YouTube.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,310
You don't really want to do that unless you have permission.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,730
OK, you can get in trouble.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,320
You get flagged copyright.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,070
You don't want to get any strikes on any of your channels.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,130
So the two main ways are to reach out to the artists directly.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,129
And you can ask for permission to use the video that you're not selling it, you're not repurposing

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,460
it, and you're not using it to really for any monetary gains.

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,750
Generally, if you ask people for that, that it's a passion project or something that's not of a professional

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,270
nature, kind of, you know, people are pretty nice about it.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,310
If the artist is nice.

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,600
That's one way to do it.

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,560
The other way to do it is to use content pools, for example.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,740
Of course, I use epidemic's sound because of their library of stuff, you know.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,690
But in the past, I have definitely gone through SoundCloud soundtracks and I like reached out to the

25
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,770
person directly.

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,380
There's plenty of other sound libraries as well that you can try.

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,560
So have an idea of how you want to get a hold of your music for whatever works best for you.

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,690
And I'm just going to personally go through some past downloads that I have and find maybe four or five

29
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:04,560
tracks you really want to know that you're working with and pick four or five ones that might five and

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,840
might make your edit even better.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,259
And then we're going to go to the next step of pulling that in and testing them out.

32
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,960
So if you haven't already gathered four to five tracks that you think might work for you, edit, you'll

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,600
either instantly know right away or you have the perfect song or you'll go through this process that

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,270
we're about to go through, flipping through, skipping ahead and seeing which one catches your ear,

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,930
remembering what the visuals are of your video and keeping that in mind.

36
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,120
So let's just kind of scroll through here.

37
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,400
So I would put this in like a Christmas category.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
That's not what we're looking for.

39
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,440
OK, this one's got like an inspirational kind of vibe.

40
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,020
But a little bit, too, on the inspirational side for my taste.

41
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,070
And vocals aren't going to work for this type of video.

42
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:22,140
And this is a little too like late night drive in the car.

43
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,740
And you know, this is not going to work.

44
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,810
Uh huh.

45
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,510
And kind of cool.

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm going to market just in case.

47
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,690
OK, I right click it.

48
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,600
And then I went and just tagged it with the color.

49
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,880
Two dramatics.

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,270
We're looking for something with the right amount of energy.

51
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,510
Maybe possibly a moment that just in case.

52
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,180
That's kind of cool.

53
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,740
Let's mark that one that my work.

54
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,630
OK, I once got it kind of an adventurous vibe, I would put the video that I've been working on in

55
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,100
the adventures category.

56
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,570
So keep that in mind of what category you'd put your video in.

57
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,470
Too much energy.

58
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,680
OK, so we have four tracks here, so I'm going to highlight these four tracks and I'm going to create

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:11,220
a new window and I'm going to go to our original folder that we worked so hard to organize and put together.

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,330
And I'm going to create a new folder called Music.

61
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,880
You see how this is all coming together.

62
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,110
We've got everything in one place.

63
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,790
Don't need to worry about where things went.

64
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:28,140
And I'm going to copy these tracks and I'm going to paste them into our wonderfully place music folder.

65
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,320
And now I'm going to go over to my editing software and I'm going to drop it in there.

66
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,880
OK.

67
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,690
So now we have footage, music sequences, sound effects.

68
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,630
And here's a little side tip here.

69
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,280
Any kind of layers or things that you create in your edit are going to start stacking up in your project

70
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,760
window.

71
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,850
So what I actually like to do is make an assets folder, because you're going to have different things

72
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,940
that you start dragging in that don't go under music or footage or go under other categories.

73
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,370
Maybe you drag in a few photos or still images.

74
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,630
You can drag those kind of miscellaneous things into an assets folder.
