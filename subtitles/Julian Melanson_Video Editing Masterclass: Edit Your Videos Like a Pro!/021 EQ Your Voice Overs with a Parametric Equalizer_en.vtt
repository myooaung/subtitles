00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.720
So I'm continuing to go through and pull the legs and, you know, you can do this process I'm about

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.740
to share with you.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.670
Towards the end of your edit, technically, you know, you really want to get all your video stuff

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.700
done first and your edit and then handle addressing filtering your audio towards the end.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.240
But I'm hearing my voice over and I'm hearing all of what it's missing.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.220
You know, of just like the frequency and the way it's sounding.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:38.070
I generally have go to solid gold in filters that I always, always add to my voice overs and to any

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.810
voice overs for any of the projects that I use that I want to share with you in this lesson.

9
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.060
So where we're going to start with is and I'm sorry to my laptop.

10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.560
It sounds like the Death Star, like speeding up sounds like a drone a little bit.

11
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.080
So I do apologize for that.

12
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.830
But let's take a listen here for reference of where we're starting with with our voiceover that was

13
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.420
recorded, recorded with a great mike in a great scenario.

14
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.470
So there's no echo, there's no reverb, but it just sounds so bland.

15
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.140
This the sound you're hearing right now.

16
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.240
Actually, if I take out the filters off this sound right now, this is actually the original way this

17
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.880
sounds in this very moment with this microphone.

18
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.410
So when I add it back, it's so much better, right?

19
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.310
I can't stand hearing it without boosting certain sound, certain frequencies, a spectrum.

20
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.200
And that's what we're going to get into.

21
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.110
So rather than me keep talking, let's get into it.

22
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.010
So what I always start with doing is, OK, we want to select our voiceover and here's what it sounds

23
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.310
like.

24
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.670
Splash of color in the background.

25
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.530
This is going to play a little bit more here.

26
00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:02.940
And to kind of show what is going on here, I'm going to put on a what's called a parametric equalizer.

27
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.400
It sounds really fancy, but it's simply just this type of filter that shows you the spectrum of the

28
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.850
frequency.

29
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.420
And that's what I meant by frequency is all the way over here on the left, we have our low end or bass

30
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.560
sounds right.

31
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.870
And then all the way here on the right, we have a high end score.

32
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.780
It's like a high hat.

33
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.130
Right.

34
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.830
And then a bass stumblebum.

35
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.920
That's how it works.

36
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.560
And this is what my voice looks like if it's being analyzed by the frequency.

37
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.270
OK, over here is 40 hertz.

38
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.190
Over here is 18000 hertz.

39
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.280
So if I turn the volume on and we play this twenty eight millimeters, I really feel that.

40
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.780
And if I move up the high end, the high frequencies, this is the best for YouTube, Instagram, any

41
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.870
kind of online content you hear out now has a snappin.

42
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.040
This where it's coming out of the speakers and it's not sounding so.

43
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.440
And here's what it looks like at twenty.

44
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.700
That's it sounds like it's a little bit underwater.

45
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.230
OK.

46
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.030
So what I always do for voice overs is I do always boost the highs.

47
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.140
Now, you can see if I kind of mess with this a little bit, even more of an example of how this filter

48
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.150
is working before.

49
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.730
Mm.

50
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.510
It's OK.

51
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.060
I always feel like it's a little bit too wide.

52
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.540
The shallower you go with the focal length, the more professional it's going to look.

53
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.480
So twenty four is it's a little bit too wide for my taste.

54
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.740
And here's how it looks at thirty five millimeters more depth, the fields more narrow.

55
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.660
So that's pretty cool.

56
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.580
It's taking the frequency of your voice.

57
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.220
And you can add this to any filter or you can add this to any noise, will take the frequency of any

58
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.450
noise and boost the specific frequency that you want.

59
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.760
So I always boost the highs.

60
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:58.050
You do always want to take down the very low and low frequency because.

61
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.070
In the human voice, if you have this low end, it'll actually add just extra bass that doesn't need

62
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.860
to be in the recording, especially if someone plays your voice back on not so good speakers.

63
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.750
You ever get that rumbling noise when you're streaming a movie legally?

64
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.550
Not illegally, because I know that you pay for your movies like a good abiding citizen.

65
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.520
But when you're streaming a movie and you're hearing like, you know, there's a lot of sound design

66
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.470
in the movie and there's a lot more, and it doesn't sound good.

67
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.320
It's kind of a crackling, uncomfortable sound to not ever let that happen to your voice.

68
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.240
It's actually good to take out the low end of your voice.

69
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.040
And that actually creates space in the sound spectrum of your video for the music to take up that space.

70
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.570
So if I'm taking this away here, that means that there's all this frequency that's now free to be used

71
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.600
by sound design, by a musical track.

72
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.690
And let's say, if I don't take that away and I have a song that's taking up a lot of bass and it has

73
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.260
like a beat.

74
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.260
Right.

75
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.040
And it's taking up the lower end because it's all songs have.

76
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.450
Bass are.

77
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.270
Two tracks are going to be competing with each other.

78
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.800
My voice is going to be vibrating at that same tone, and then the music is going to be vibrating at

79
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.460
the same tone.

80
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.510
So with that said, it's always a good idea to take out the very low end.

81
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.980
I'm afraid of your voice over.

82
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.800
So now let's take a listen in.

83
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.270
But a little bit more of a documentary feel.

84
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.000
It sounds way better already.

85
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.580
The Voice is really coming to life and a good kind of way to think about it.

86
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.330
Or a good.

87
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.660
Oh, man, it's hard for me to find words today, man.

88
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.310
A good key.

89
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:59.470
A good thing to keep in mind is the higher you bring the highs, the more exciting and the more.

90
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.340
Dang, it is really hard for you to find words today, man.

91
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.970
The more you increase the high frequencies, the more energy the person's voice is going to have in,

92
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.230
the more presence it's going to have.

93
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.790
So if I bring this down, it's going to sound like I'm in the other room and it's really muffled.

94
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.920
Oh, here's how it looks at 50 Mill.

95
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.210
This is a great focal length for documentaries and short films.

96
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.790
And when I bring it up, but we really lose the feeling of the background.

97
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.880
And so this is a great place to start.
