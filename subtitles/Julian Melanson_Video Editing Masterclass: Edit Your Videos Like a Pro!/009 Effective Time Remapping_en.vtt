00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:07.530
OK, so the area is looking really good, and the last thing I'll mention about what we just washes.

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.060
There's a lot of subtle time remapping throughout this sequence.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.820
So you can see where there's these diagonals.

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.310
That's where I was changing the speed at some of these clips.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.650
So if you watch it back, just pay attention to where you're seeing.

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.120
Yeah, here we have one right here.

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.490
We have one right here.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.080
We have one right here.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.080
So you'll see that it'll be normal speed and it'll go right before a cut happens.

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.600
So if I have you're seeing the visual and it goes for the next visual that I cut to.

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.230
We'll go.

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.090
Does that make sense to one's going to speed up into the next shot and then the next shot is going to

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.500
slow down to normal speed?

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.080
So with that in mind, watch the sequence again.

15
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.790
Oh, OK.

16
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.840
And why was I doing the time remapping speeding up of the footage is because, like I said, this is

17
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.940
the highest energy part of our clip.

18
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.060
The faster the editing pacing in this edit, the faster the speed in the clip, the more energetic the

19
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.220
clips feel, especially because everything in this project specifically was shot in slow motion.

20
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.320
So when we speed that up, it feels like extra energy moving forward.
