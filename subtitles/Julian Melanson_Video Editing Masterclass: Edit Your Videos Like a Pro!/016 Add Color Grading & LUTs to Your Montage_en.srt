1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,450
So what we're going to do is start by creating an adjustment layer in our project panel hit adjustment

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:06,930
layer.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,770
I'm going to hit OK, because we don't need to change any of these parameters.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,230
We want it to be the same settings as I sequence.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,920
And now I'm going to drag this adjustment layer on top of all of our footage.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:30,370
I'm going to drag it out, so it's covering the footage and nothing is happening yet until we add another

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,250
color correction layer to this adjustment layer.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:46,060
So now what we can do is globally change the look of all of our shots with one single layer.

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,570
OK.

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:56,860
And this is a perfect time to now hop into adding luts or preset looks to your footage.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,910
What we do here is scroll down to our creative tab.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,680
We're going to go ahead and open that up.

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,400
And we have our looks function.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,150
OK.

15
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:16,450
This has a handful more than Annville, actually a Kwanten Ethereum or a veritable plethora and quite

16
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,470
a few preset looks that we can scroll through.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:29,320
Now, what creates the deciding factor of the look that you go for is the tone of your video.

18
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:37,930
Now we have kind of a cool, bad -- filmmaker, James Bond ASQ tone here.

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,080
So we want something that's punchy and we want something that's maybe a little bit more on the gritty

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,820
side with a pretty punchy edit and a really in-your-face song.

21
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,900
So we're not going to want some like emotional blue nighttime feel.

22
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,030
We're going to probably want pretty contrasty.

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:05,020
More of the comic book saturation punching is for this look.

24
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,830
So let's see what does work and let's see what doesn't work.

25
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,810
So here we scroll to the Blue Day tonight preset.

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,100
Let's go out and play that.

27
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,560
OK.

28
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,320
It's a cool look, but we're not really looking for this blues and purples because this is not like

29
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,790
a vampire movie like Twilight fans.

30
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,200
So let's find a different look here.

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,900
Let's keep scrolling down.

32
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,760
So these have some greenish tones.

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,780
Kind of that matrix vibe that we mentioned before.

34
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm really looking for a coloring that matches with the tone that we're working with and our musical

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,060
track.

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,250
That's OK.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,790
Too much greens, I think we're wanting more of a punchy golden here for this kind of edit.

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,220
OK, so I like the tone of this, of course, is way too contrasted, and this is God, just way too

39
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,400
much crushing of the blacks, the dark's are too dark.

40
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,680
And it just looks too fake.

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:30,070
So what we can do is change the intensity of our actual preassigned lutt.

42
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,960
So if you go to zero, that's our original footage.

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,880
If we start increasing this, then we can see our transformation happening here.

44
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,240
So that's looking pretty dang cool.

45
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,390
Let's put this at 40.

46
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,050
We don't want it to be too saturated and too colored.

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,930
So let's see.

48
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,310
Without with, without, with.

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,010
And this is a little bit red in a little too orange for my eye.

50
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,650
So what we can do is adjust the temperature.

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,070
This is going to change the blue to orange and yellow shift of our image.

52
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,520
So if we have it at zero, we can scoot it down to maybe negative 10.

53
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,640
And this is going to kind of neutralize the overall orange and overall redness that we are having now

54
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,650
if it's still looking a little too red.

55
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,990
We can also change the tint.

56
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,740
Now, the tint, instead of blue to orange or a little bit of yellow, the tint is the greenish to purple.

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,050
Now, purple is similar and close to the red in the color spectrum.

58
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:44,100
But if we go to the opposite side and start increasing the green, that's going to actually balance

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,350
out the excess redness in our image.

60
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,180
So this is now having more of a golden feel if we go back to zero.

61
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,950
There's more red if we go to negative 10.

62
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,720
It has more of a slight green.

63
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,840
OK, we don't want to go too far in the green.

64
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,510
But let's say we put that in negative four.

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,070
OK.

66
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,990
And everything is starting to look pretty darn good.

67
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,530
If I want to bring a little bit more detail back up from the dark parts of the frame like here, you

68
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,020
can't see any detail in these parts here.

69
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,680
You can see detail in the camera, which is what we want.

70
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,800
That is a little bit dark, I would say.

71
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,100
That could be a little bit brighter.

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,030
And this is well, so what we can do is bring up the shadows.

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,540
And you can see as I'm bringing out the shadows, we're getting more detail.

74
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,120
Back in the dark parts of the frame, of course, we don't want to put it at 117 here because this is

75
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,650
not the look they were going for.

76
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,710
But if I put this back in zero and I push it up just slightly, let's say 15 points.

77
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,430
You see that shift of where we're getting detail back in these parts of the frame.

78
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,430
We can maybe even go a little bit more.

79
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,250
Let's go 20.

80
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,190
That's going to give us a better overall exposure.

81
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,890
We want our blacks to feel punchy, but we don't want to lose too much detail in our image.

82
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,900
So there's a fine tuned balance as an editor where you want to color correct it.

83
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,150
So look stylized and even better than real life, but you don't want to go too far where when someone

84
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,400
sees it, it's like it's like almost one.

85
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,380
A dish is too salty or too seasoned.

86
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,970
There's a fine balance there.

87
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,610
And that's kind of a final last change here.

88
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,180
We can add a little bit of sharpening.

89
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,350
Now, what this is going to do is going to chris up our image a little bit, because a lot of these

90
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,390
shots, they're a little bit soft.

91
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,850
So they don't have that super clear, crisp clarity that, you know, you really want your videos.

92
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,440
So I'm going to increase this.

93
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,250
Let's try 20.

94
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,080
We want it to be subtle, but it's just basically going to make our footage look a little bit more high

95
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,840
def, a little bit more of a higher resolution.

96
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,060
And I'm really liking that.

97
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,050
So let's see what it's looking like with our music.

98
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:11,250
And ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba,

99
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:11,730
ba, ba.

100
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,100
Awesome, so that wraps it up for this part of the learning lesson, where we delve into color correction

101
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,540
and color grading.

102
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm like really excited to see your edits and what you put together.

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,490
So you'll be able to share that in the student Q&A section.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,040
And I will see you in the next lecture.
