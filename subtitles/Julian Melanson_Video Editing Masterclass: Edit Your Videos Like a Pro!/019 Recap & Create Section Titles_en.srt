1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,760
Whoo!

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,420
OK, so I wanted to take a second to just recap what we just did because we went pretty deep there.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,870
This is a pretty in-depth YouTube video, and probably most of your YouTube videos aren't going to have

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,079
this.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,890
Many cutaway shots are not going to have this much B roll.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,020
But it's good to dive into a project like this so you could see how complex things can get.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,150
So that way when you're doing a three minute video with a few cutaway shots and maybe one location with

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,990
one music track.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,530
It's really easy to do compared to what we've been putting together.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,800
With that said, let's take a look at the screen cap here to see where we are now in our edit.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,430
We've whittled everything down from, you know, four hours, I think it was three or four hours of

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,800
footage to now having just a little bit around 30 minutes of footage.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:07,310
And what I did is organize the main parts in their own category and a really good way to do this.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,720
Like I was mentioning, this is a pretty complex edit.

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,650
So I know going into this that there's going to be multiple chapters where I'm walking someone through

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,190
step by step process on how to create their own filming space.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,210
I mapped out ahead of time that that's like 10 steps or 11 steps.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,530
So in here, I translated what I had written down to text form, as you could see right here, which

19
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,970
I'll show you how to do in a second.

20
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,290
But that way, all my footage that goes in the right step is in chronological order, and it has the

21
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,730
title of the step that the footage belongs to.

22
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,570
So to do this, let's say we want to start from scratch here.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,890
I'm going to move this out of the way and I'm just going to delete this.

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,420
So I'm going to hit T.

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,100
Which brings up the text tool.

26
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,750
And I'm going to type in chapter and actually three.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,930
So I'm going to type in four.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,350
Create your purchase.

29
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,710
It's want to center it.

30
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,220
And then I'm on.

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,090
Drag it down.

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,150
OK.

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,150
And then we can stretch it out so that it's filling all the footage and then we simply label it.

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,040
And I'm definitely a color person.

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,090
I learned with color.

36
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,420
I get organized with color, which is easy, easier for me.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,330
So when I see this timeline, this is like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of shots, but they're

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,380
more easily labeled.

39
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,090
You can navigate to OK.

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,890
Step 11, here's where we are.

41
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,720
So now that we've got that situated, we are caught up.

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,850
We undo this real quick.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,720
Yes.

44
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,070
Now we've got that situated.

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,810
We're caught up with where we are in the edit.

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,980
Now, what I'm going to do in the next lecture is drop in the voiceover.

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,560
And now we're actually really, really going to start getting into the nitty gritty of the editing process

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,730
for this YouTube video.

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,190
So I will see you in the next lecture.
