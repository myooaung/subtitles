1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,070
Let's say we're super happy with that.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,760
We're ready to export it.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,160
We're going to save our project.

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,370
We're going to make sure our endpoint is set at the very beginning and we're going to make sure our

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,270
outpoint is at the end.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,730
We're going to hit.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,230
Oh, it's perfect.

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,850
I'm going to go up to file.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:25,630
Go down to export media, make sure short two, six, four is clicked, go to presets.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,290
Now this is going to a mobile device and we want the resolution to be the same as the sequence itself,

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,659
which is 10 ATP.

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,200
So we're going to click that and we're going to go down to our audio tab.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,500
Make sure our bit rate is set to the highest setting.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,140
We're going to make sure our basic video settings are matching to get rid of these black bars.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,830
We're going to match our actual sequence by hitting match source.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,920
We're going to render at maximum video depth.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,050
Use the maximum render quality.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,000
And finally, we're going to choose our destination that our at is going to go to.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,850
And the name of the export itself.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,210
So in our original hyp edit folder that we created at the very beginning, many, many moons and days

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,940
ago, we're going to create a new folder there called this the exports folder, where all of our different

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,190
exported versions will reside.

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:26,800
And we're going to go hyp edit, let's say insta stran post version one save.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,590
And we're going to hit export.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,930
Now we have our final video here.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,990
We have our thumbnail at the very beginning.

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,470
And we have the final product.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:47,010
And if we wanted to send this to something like Instagram, we can queued up, go to the cover and it

29
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,470
always default chooses the very first frame, which is perfect.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:58,290
And we have a really cool edit with a nice looking thumbnail ready to be shared online with the world.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,080
That does it for this extra little bonus lesson that I want to throw in here with a little extra ninja

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,260
technique hack for all your future projects.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,410
I will see you in the next video lesson.
