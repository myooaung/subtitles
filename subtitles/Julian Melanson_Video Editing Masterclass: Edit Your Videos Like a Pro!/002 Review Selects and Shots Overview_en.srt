1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,320
All right, so let's get right into the edit now, what I have already done here is taken my main footage

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,930
and I've dragged into my timeline.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,210
This is my Viorel timeline.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,600
As you can see here, we have the B roll shots, just kind of cool environment or footage.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:28,200
And I filmed it in a way, knowing that this was going to kind of be a gritty Urbani kind of more city

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,890
downtown and gritty vibe.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,670
So the way I filmed it was kind of shaky, handheld way.

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,680
And we're going to get into the real thing, not of this lesson, but in I think the next one, which

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,430
I'm really excited because a lot of these shots would be unusable from an outside perspective or maybe

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,430
initially looking at it.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,790
So we have that set up and ready to go.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,030
We need to pull these Selex, which I'm going to do.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,820
And then we have the promo song.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,730
So that's going to be our backing track.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,870
Our main audio for this edit, and yet if you don't have this footage downloaded yet and you want to

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,650
edit this with me, make sure you download that, because we're going to get into everything here.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,500
The song is in the folder, the B Roll, and then the main footage is in the folder as well.

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,360
So here's our main footage performance.

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:27,460
One performance, one B for performance, two performance to be because I shot everything at four K.

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,970
What my camera specifically does is when it hits a certain point, a certain amount of gigs, whatever

21
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,210
it is, or a certain length, it'll cut up the clip into two things.

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,370
So that's not a problem, but that's just a little bit more of a complexity.

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:51,710
But basically to A and B is one performance, three Amys, one performance and so on.

24
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,030
So I basically shot this same performance six different times.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:03,580
So if we take a look, we have this first one that's shot on a Steadicam and I shot wide and some close

26
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,020
ups if we go to the next one and a shot even wider.

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,990
And if we go to the third one, I think this is.

28
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,510
Yeah, some more close ups on what he's doing with the hands.

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:25,350
And if you go to the before, I think this one I think the next one is hand-held.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,460
No, OK.

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,500
The last one is handheld.

32
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,870
Cool.

33
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,920
So once I got his performance perfectly or whatever perfect means, but once I got his performance done,

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,620
well, five times on the last one, I was getting more artistic shaky shots that it's going to be quick

35
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,980
little cutaways that we're going to really put to use.
