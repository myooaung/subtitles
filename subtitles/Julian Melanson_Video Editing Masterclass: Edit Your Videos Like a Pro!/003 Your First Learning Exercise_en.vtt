00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.760
Now that we've gotten the main course introduction out of the way, you know who I am, you know how

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.930
to navigate this course.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.640
You know the information that's going to be taught and you know the transformation you're going to have

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.680
by the end of the entire course.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.970
I want to hop into a quick, fun learning activity to get the ball rolling and to get your creativity

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.900
flowing.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.920
So what we're going to do here is find out more about your skills in places that you can improve as

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.580
an editor.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.730
So here we're going to spend no more than 20 minutes creating an edit.

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.840
This is going to be less of a tutorial and really more about self discovery.

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.940
So what I want you to focus on during this exercise is these main points you're going to be playing

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.000
with footage you've never worked with before, you never seen before.

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.970
And so you have no reference to the project.

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.070
So you're going to have really a clean slate going into it, which is perfect as an editor, which we'll

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.670
talk about.

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.880
I want you to learn more about your own personal style, your own personal editing choices and your

17
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.820
own music taste during this exercise.

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.620
And you can also share your final edit in the student Q&A with the other students and compare your edits.

19
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.290
Lastly, I want to frame this exercise for you to find out what you want to improve and achieve by the

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.310
end of this course.

21
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.410
So you can go ahead and download the fire footage that I'm supplying you from the course resources tab.

22
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.410
The downloadable link is going to include the fire footage to practice with some different music choices

23
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.220
to play around with.

24
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.440
You can use your own track.

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.340
You can use a favorite track you've been wanting to edit with, or you can use one of the supplied tracks.

26
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.520
And all the footage that I'm supplying in this course is going to be compressed in size and it's going

27
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.310
to have a watermark on it for learning purposes only.

28
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.860
So it's compressed.

29
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.410
So you can download it quickly.

30
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.240
It's not going to take 40 gigabytes and 40 days to get to download.

31
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.669
But it also has a watermark on all the footage throughout the course that I'm supplying you, because

32
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.520
it's for learning purposes only.

33
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.850
I don't want to see any of you guys using these and saying that it's one of your projects.

34
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.680
Look at this project.

35
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:28.080
I did only use it, please, for your evolution and upgrading of your skill set during this course.

36
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.880
You can share it, but please be clear about where the footage has come from.

37
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.300
OK.

38
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.110
OK.

39
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.820
With that said, now you can pause my video and you can download all the assets and put together just

40
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.600
an initial edit.

41
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.820
Don't spend more than 20 minutes on it, but put something together that feels right for you at this

42
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.360
stage.

43
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.820
Then I'm going to show you some other students edits and then we'll see what kind of information we

44
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.110
can learn from having multiple editors editing the same exact content.

45
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.660
So I will see you in the next video lesson.
