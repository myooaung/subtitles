00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.180
If we hit play here and I'm going to go ahead and zoom in to the timeline, the question is not how

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.370
to get them ready to do it.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.200
And the question isn't even how do we go?

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.060
OK, so a lot of stuff is going on just in this first two seconds.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.010
So let's kind of deconstruct this.

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.070
So what we have and I'm going to go ahead and scoot this, we have more to work with over here.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.250
Now we have the exact type of audio filters that we added to our previous edits.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.130
So we have the hard limiter that's boosting the sound of the dialogue, making it very clear, which

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.460
is incredibly important for all videos, but especially a video where you have a teacher on camera teaching

10
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.940
things.

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.720
So we have the hard limit.

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.760
It's boosting it's creating a ceiling so that the audio doesn't go too loud.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.340
But it's bringing up all the all the pieces already.

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.060
Kind of explain that.

15
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.900
So you understand it.

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.390
Then we have the mastering filter.

17
00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.280
This is brightening up our audio by boosting the high is boosting everything in the high frequency.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.810
And then we also have the parametric equalizer where we're selectively what frequencies we're cutting

19
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.530
out like here.

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050
We're cutting out all the low end.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
Just like I mentioned earlier in the course, we don't want a whole lot of lowan in the voice because

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.930
it's going to clash with our music in the background.

23
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.590
If there's bass in the music and bass in the voice, you can that can create the kind of bad rumble

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.050
in your speakers, especially with older speakers.

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.530
So that is the overall that we did to really clean up our audio here.

26
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.390
So if I take these off.

27
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.820
The question is not the question is not versus putting them back on.

28
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.280
Question is not.

29
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.020
A question is not right.

30
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.460
So it sounds like she's underwater without with.

31
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.680
We boosted it up if you want to learn more about that.

32
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.660
We did it in a previous lecture.

33
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.960
Now we have this cool kind of visual transition that sound a transition, but a quick cutaway shot to

34
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.880
break up her speaking.

35
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.540
The question is not how to get back.

36
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.770
So let's keep focusing on our audio for this.

37
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.900
Let's see what we have.

38
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.510
And so we have this sound.

39
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.800
Which is a book opening sound.

40
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.650
So that's one layer of audio.

41
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.570
We have our music that comes in.

42
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.920
OK.

43
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.150
And then we have our swoosh.

44
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.050
OK.

45
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.180
And altogether, it's not how to get better.

46
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.950
Those all work in harmony.

47
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.970
If we were to take one out, I'm going to take out the sound effect from the book.

48
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.090
OK, it's OK.

49
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.910
Now I'm going to take out the swoosh.

50
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.690
Question is not how to get better.

51
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.480
Not nearly as much impact there, right?

52
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.410
So like this?

53
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.060
No swoosh, no sound effect.

54
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.210
We just go straight into the music, which would totally be acceptable for most edits.

55
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.400
But what we're really focusing is those advanced final techniques.

56
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.950
That really creates a really cool moment in your edit.

57
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.820
So just going in from the vocals to the music, which is what most people would do.

58
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.120
The question is not how to get.

59
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.570
And if we unmuted these tracks so that we bring back our sound effect and we bring back that really

60
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.830
important swoosh.

61
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.050
Gene is not how to get better.

62
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.820
Perfect.

63
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.750
So what that does is the audio cue gives you a visual feeling that something is going to change with

64
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.560
what you're looking at.

65
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.750
And it leads in to the sound effect.

66
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.480
And it helps the soundtrack overall by really just creating more of a cohesive moment, even though

67
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.710
it's look to.

68
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.060
It's one second.

69
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.380
One point.

70
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.450
One seconds, or I'm looking right here.

71
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.900
So it's one second and 16 milliseconds.

72
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.400
And then it's, you know, OK, this is about one second of a thing.

73
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:13.550
And this little addition into the audio really just overall helps this moment how to get better at it.

74
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.279
And the question is, even how do we go from being high school level readers and writers to college,

75
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.420
then really decent writers?

76
00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.990
The question is and we have a similar effect going on here.

77
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.540
We have the talking footage here.

78
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.130
We go into this cutaway shot.

79
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.200
I want to make this a little bit bigger.

80
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.060
And so if we solo, we got this, OK?

81
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.750
And you can see I also raise up the decibel range.

82
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.280
So it it kind of leads in to the next sound.

83
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.110
OK.

84
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.670
So and then we have our second sound, the closing of the book.

85
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.600
And if I solo this, we've got the swoosh, a different swoosh.

86
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.640
And you can see what I did here is I use the same exact to swooshes, but this one and we learned this

87
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.870
early in the course as well, is that a hundred and sixty percent speed.

88
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.020
And this one is at 200 percent speed.

89
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.420
So same exact sound effect with the different speed.

90
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.890
And here's the difference in the sound compared to.

91
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:31.030
OK, so that kind of hack we also discussed and what this swooshed does is it allows for the music to

92
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.930
cut out.

93
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.060
Well, in a way that doesn't sound abrupt, it sounds purposeful.

94
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500
Only Prisonaires.

95
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.030
The question is, so if I were to take away the swoosh, OK, I'm going to mute it and now listen to

96
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.810
the soundtrack and it's just going to kind of drop out readers and writers to acknowledge them.

97
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.860
Some writers, the question is actually it actually works OK, still, because we have what's called

98
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.720
this would be a hit sound, this part of the book closing the question.

99
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.030
So that makes the end of the sound work.

100
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.420
Right.

101
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.750
But if we actually muted that as well and just had the audio and the music, here's what it would sound

102
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.020
like.

103
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.010
Its level leaders and writers to college, then some writers.

104
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.180
The question is actually so there's a lot missing there.

105
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.140
It doesn't quite have the juice that it does with these different audio layers.

106
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:33.010
So let's get one more example in this video lesson and then we'll move on to the next interesting part

107
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.670
of this edit.

108
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.180
Lee, how can we see stories?

109
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.570
The question is actually, how can we see stories in a more accurate way?

110
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.340
I'm getting better at reading requires seeing the written word differently.

111
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.300
What?

112
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.000
OK, so more on the audio side.

113
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.150
We have a very subtle, much longer swoosh.

114
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.100
And as you can see, the swooshes are big when you have music dropping in, music coming in, cutaways

115
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.210
that are really quick.

116
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:16.840
The show just really helps to guide the audience and give that final polish on the edit.

117
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.780
All professional editors use this technique.

118
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.690
Now we have this really subtle swoosh leading into our track accurate way.

119
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:40.960
And you can see that when we just see the title come up and the audio from the music is boosted at its

120
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.680
highest.

121
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.880
Why are we doing that?

122
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:49.390
Because in the other circumstances, when there's speaking and the music track, the speaking should

123
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.970
always be the loudest and clearest and at the forefront.

124
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.440
It's the primary sound.

125
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.450
The audio is there backing up the speaking, and it's quieter in the background.

126
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.830
But when she delivered her line, here we go to the title screen of the video.

127
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.020
There's no speaking.

128
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.720
Then we bring up our audio, our music layer to be the primary sound.

129
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.250
And there's no backing sound there in the background.

130
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.280
So it sounds like this more accurate way.

131
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.650
And there's a fullness to the sound.

132
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:29.320
And then it, as you can see, goes down when her speaking comes in.

133
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.039
Getting better at reading requires.

134
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:38.230
That means that her audio takes primary space for the viewer to be listening to.

135
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.419
Again, if I were to take out this really simple boost in our audio.

136
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.640
You're going to see.

137
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.080
That we're going to lose the fullness of our audio track in this specific moment.

138
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.990
See stories in a more accurate way.

139
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.980
Getting better.

140
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:10.780
So the audio doesn't really quite have enough push in that moment when it's just the music and it doesn't

141
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:17.170
really give a fullness and an excitement when we're seeing the title card come up.

142
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:24.430
So that's another point that in the first 20 seconds of this edit, we've got a lot of complexity going

143
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.410
on audio wise and visual wise.

144
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:33.040
But I really think that's going to help deconstruct a little bit those little specific techniques.
