1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,420
So what is up and welcome to this video editing masterclass.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:14,070
My name is Julian Melanson, and I'm going to be the instructor at teacher for this journey that we're

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,750
about to go on together.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,670
Now, I'm super excited.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,120
I've been wanting to put this course together for a while.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,220
I've done preproduction courses, production courses, the business of filmmaking courses.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,140
And the editing is something I've really been excited to get to.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,880
So let's not waste any time.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,300
We're going to do a brief introduction on the overview of this course, how you can get the most from

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,200
the content, and then we're going to go right into the actual learning lessons.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,630
So let's get started.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,680
Now, I've packed this course with tons of information.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,670
And really the goal of this entire course is for you to have a massive transformation from when you

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,580
start to when you finish the content.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:06,510
Now, that transformation is going to be that you're going to be able to edit and create incredible

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:14,040
looking and sounding videos with any software that you're using and footage really from any kind of

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,390
phone or camera.

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,530
Basically, the information that I chose to focus on the most is going to be applicable across any kind

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,040
of footage and any kind of piece of technology that you're using.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,090
Why?

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,450
Because you want to be able to use this information a year from now, five years from now, however

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,960
long, with whatever kind of content, with whatever kind of client, and not be restricted to the equipment

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,370
or technology that you're using.

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,900
That's not very interesting to me.

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,850
What's interesting is upgrading you as the creator that way.

26
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,920
Whatever you're holding, whatever you're using is automatically improved from your knowledge.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:01,320
Now, the information that we are going to be diving deep into is perfect for beginner to intermediate

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,110
video creators.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,750
So if you're just getting started, don't worry, we're going to go over the fundamentals.

30
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:14,610
If you've been editing for a while and you want to upgrade your edits to be better, more cohesive,

31
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,080
expansive and inspiring.

32
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,440
Perfect.

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,860
This is going to give you those tools that you need.

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:28,320
Now, even if you are a pre intermediate to advanced Ed, I guarantee there's going to be amazing tidbits

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,920
and lessons in this course that you're going to walk away from and be able to use to enhance all of

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,200
your more higher end advanced edits, because we're going to start from the beginning.

37
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,180
How to master the fundamentals.

38
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,980
And then we're going to move into more advanced techniques and processes together.

39
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,670
So a bit of a micro overview of some of the main steps we're going to be doing is first, starting with,

40
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,070
like I just mentioned, the fundamentals.

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,610
How do we capture our footage, label it, organize it, back it up, make sure all of our content is

42
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,850
safe and really learned how to do this the right way at the beginning, so that when you do advance

43
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,430
and you're still editing and creating videos years from now, you have a really solid foundation and

44
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,070
workflow that's going to allow for you to spend more time on the creative side and less time on the

45
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,880
more logistical fundamentals side.

46
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:30,420
Next, we're going to learn how to pull our selects, how to create our main edit, how to choose our

47
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:39,510
music, how to do all of the beginning processes of creating a really good looking mean video edit.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,970
Then we're going to go into the refining steps.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,630
So this is really important because we're going to do the fundamentals.

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,200
We're going to get really good at the main bulk of the process, all of that workflow.

51
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,320
And then we're going to learn all the techniques that I've gathered over the years to really refine,

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,430
polish, upgrade and just create something that is unique and special and stands out.

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,370
This happens in the refining process where we take a bit of a rough stone and we polish it into this

54
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,160
really beautiful looking final piece.

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:22,500
And lastly, there's going to be editing prototypes throughout the entire process, which are essential

56
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,220
bits of wisdom, knowledge techniques on top of what we're learning throughout that are just going to

57
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,180
give us a little bit extra fuel and skills to continue to improve beyond this course.
