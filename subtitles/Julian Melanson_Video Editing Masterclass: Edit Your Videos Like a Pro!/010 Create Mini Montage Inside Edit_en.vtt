00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.830
All right, so our double music track experiment is working so far, and I hope that your Demario is

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.720
coming together and that you're able to do something similar here.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.500
So now what I want to do is take this big chunk of awesome drone footage that we have of awesome drone

4
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.390
footage that we have and brought it down so that it fits in this shorter time frame.

5
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.590
So I'm going to be listening to the beat of this track and I'm going to cut things up.

6
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.580
We're going to do pretty quick cutting here, because we got a lot of shots that we want to fit in and

7
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.370
we want to actually feel to feel a little bit kind of overwhelming in a good way that it's like, whoa,

8
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.220
look at that.

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.870
Look at that.

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.260
Look at that.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.570
That's kind of a cool technique you can use to kind of overload so on when you have just a bunch of

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.760
majestic shots back to back.

13
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.160
But when I'm doing this, I'm definitely cutting to the beat.

14
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.720
Ooh, Stonehenge, let's go to Stonehenge, baby.

15
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.440
Get all the elements here, we got ice, we got snow, we got waves, this is great.

16
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.230
OK, so I actually want to switch up the vibe, I feel like after we get to the ocean and we go back

17
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.150
to here, we've already kind of seen this color palette of footage, but this is kind of more surprising.

18
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.890
So I'm going to just remove those shots because they match the color palette a little bit too much of

19
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.080
the stuff we've already seen.

20
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.620
So it kind of loses its magic.

21
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.700
So we're going to take that away also.

22
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.040
Yeah, like this is still too loud, so I'm going to drop that down.

23
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.090
And I have no idea what we're going to do at this part.

24
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.290
OK, so we're pretty good on that drone footage.

25
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.470
Maybe I know that these kind of have a transition.

26
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.090
So maybe we can use one of these.

27
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.490
There's this like, you know, this glitchy part of the sound of the soundtrack right here.

28
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.800
So this like phloem waterfall doesn't really match up with that kind of style.

29
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.110
So that's something we got to change.

30
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.010
And then also to smooth out the transition between this from being the high pass filter to this, not

31
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.580
having one.

32
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:32.670
Why don't we bring back by bringing down this high pass filter?

33
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.360
Some of the key frame it, and then we're gonna bring it the intensity of it down.

34
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.240
And let's just see if that helps things.

35
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.720
Oh, yes.

36
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.280
So what that did is it made the transition between these two songs better, because this one has all

37
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.310
of the base, all of the frequency.

38
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.850
This one was cut on the lower half of its frequency.

39
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.110
And when we brought back in the full spectrum of frequency by bringing down this high pass filter.

40
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.140
So originally it was this that allowed for it to blend better.

41
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.130
Hopefully that makes sense because this is a little complicated to explain.

42
00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.870
But essentially, this high pass filter when it comes in, it goes from sounding like this or here to

43
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.280
what you'll hear over here.

44
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.930
It sounds like it's coming out of an old radio, right?

45
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.290
I'd like an old vinyl recorder and then we're going to make it sound normal again at this part, just

46
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.180
as it's transitioning into the other songs.

47
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.070
OK, I'm liking it.

48
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.750
Our experiment worked.
