1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,830
All right, so now I went through and I pulled all my Selex, so we went from an hour of footage to

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,700
now just about four and a half minutes of footage.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,560
So I have all the best shots.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:23,610
And next is to well, first of all, we're going to go ahead and drag in our possible music tracks.

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:33,180
But what I also want to mention is it's a little bit tricky to organize or at least order a demo reel.

6
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,640
You know, when you shoot a project, you have an overall rhyme and reason for the ordering of shots.

7
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,860
You have a beginning, a middle and an end in a demo reel.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,800
It's just this huge collage of different shots.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,450
But you want to keep in mind that you want to try and find some kind of intro opening shots, some maybe

10
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:04,560
middle, exciting high energy shots and somehow find some kind of good conclusion ending the video type

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,160
of footage.

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:15,930
So right off the bat, I know that I do have kind of a handful of these eye shots.

13
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,160
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy that shot.

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,500
I'm going to scroll to the front.

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,390
I'm going to create some room here.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,160
And I'm going to put this shot at the beginning and this one as well.

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:37,880
And we're going to try to do some kind of cool multiple eyes opening to open the beginning in the video.

18
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,690
So I'm going to just scroll through here real quick.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,910
We're this shot.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:55,040
So you can do this similar process for your footage, if you have multiple styles or multiple of the

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:04,100
same type of shot, like if you were doing some kind of sports demo reel and you had a bunch of maybe

22
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,730
dunks, you know what I mean?

23
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:13,580
Or you're doing some kind of clothing video and you had a bunch of shots where you're tying the laces

24
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,510
on your shoes on multiple like 10 different pairs of shoes.

25
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,940
You could put that at the beginning, like boom, boom, boom.

26
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,230
And that could be the opening.

27
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,620
If that was the type of Demario you were doing.

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,870
So let me just finish going through here.

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,470
I feel like there's one more.

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,880
Oh, yeah.

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
There we go.

32
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,210
Boom, baby.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,870
All right.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,610
So, yes, we got.

35
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,060
Yes.

36
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,010
OK.

37
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,650
Now, in a place this at the beginning.

38
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,840
So we kind of have a rough maybe set of opening shots.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,640
Of course, the pacing and the the timing is like not set yet, but we have some kind of similarity

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,830
between this grouping of shots.
