1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,540
Now that we have that exported, what I want to do is take that second version of the edit that we made.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,870
And I want to change the aspect ratio so that it can be used for a slightly different post.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:20,520
So if we bring this up here and check out for Instagram, for example, the aspect ratio that we were

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,600
just working in is this 10, 80 by 1920.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,970
That's the vertical format that we just did.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,690
And that's the verdel vertical format of our second version with the music track.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:41,280
And what I want to do is walk you through how you can very easily change the same video to fit different

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
types of posting or sharing mediums.

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,100
So we're going to take this 10 by.

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,650
So we're going to take this nine by 16 aspect ratio, the average.

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,000
So we're going to take this nine by 16 aspect ratio that we were originally working in.

12
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,450
And we're going to change it to make it a four by five aspect ratio so that you can very easily take

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,230
a vertical video and turn it into a normal Instagram post.

14
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,420
So as you can see, we need to change our sequence setting to 10, 180 by 13, 15.

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,260
This is going to give us the proper ratio so that our video fits perfectly in a normal Instagram post.

16
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,750
So let's go into our editing software.

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,230
You're going to find your sequence that you created.

18
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,980
If you don't have a secondary sequence that you've already duplicated to try and add a musical track

19
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,470
to what you can do now is take the sequence you have been working on and duplicate it right now.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,560
So I'm going to do copy paste.

21
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm going to take this sequence and title it four by five insta grand post.

22
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,540
OK, I'm going to double click to open it, and then I'm going to right click the sequence and I'm going

23
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,820
to go to sequence settings.

24
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,860
Here it brings up a panel where I can see all of the actual settings that my sequence is using.

25
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:18,600
And if we go back to our different Instagram ratios, we can see we need to switch this to 10, 80 by

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,860
13, 50 instead of 19, 20.

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,170
So I'm going to type that in and I'm going to add, OK.

28
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,040
Yeah.

29
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,970
This is going to ask you, do you really want to make this change to your sequence settings?

30
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,100
It's going to change some previews and it's going to just simply remove any of the previews that you

31
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,290
had already possibly had rendered.

32
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,230
No big deal.

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,150
We're going to hit, OK.

34
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,420
And there we go.

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,570
Now we have our edit with the proper aspect ratio.

36
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,220
But if you scroll through here, you can see that there are some changes that need to be made.

37
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,490
We're also cutting off the top in the bottom of our video because we went to a very vertical format,

38
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,560
to a much more shortened format.

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,240
So the way to really kind of get around that and fix that is to go to these clips.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm going to select this first one and I'm going to go to the Effects Controls panel on the top left.

41
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,400
And I'm going to click the motion function and I'm going to take the position and I'm going to drag

42
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,640
and skewed the video itself.

43
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,680
So that's what it's looking like now.

44
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,750
What it was before was there.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,910
So you're simply just kind of reframing the shots to match this new formatting.

46
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,990
It's a little extra step that you're going to have to do.

47
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,870
But the cool thing is, is that you can take one piece of content and repurpose it to multiple platforms.

48
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,880
So we'll kind of play through the rest of this video and see what other shots need to be reframed.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And that actually brings me to another tip for this kind of scenario.

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,760
If at the beginning of your clip, now that we've changed the aspect ratio, it's well framed at the

51
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,200
beginning, but you don't like it at the end.

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,770
For example, I'm framed OK in here, but then we get to the end and we don't really end of that clip

53
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,900
and we don't really get to see the full waterfall.

54
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:18,510
We can set a key frame at the beginning of the clip where we like the framing, go to the end and move

55
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,060
the framing to where we want it to be.

56
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,830
And what's going to happen is, as that clip plays through, because we created these two key frames,

57
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,320
it's going to progressively get to that point at the end of the clip.

58
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,440
So let's play that through.

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,580
So you see it tilt it up so that we could see the waterfall because these key frames that we created

60
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,460
by using this little stopwatch function.

61
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,940
Let's see these next shots now.

62
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,060
OK.

63
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,910
Looks pretty good.

64
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,480
So for this final shot, if we wanted to add a little bit more motion, we can go to the beginning,

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,750
select the clip, go to the effects control panel.

66
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,190
Go to the motion tab.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,810
Hit that stopwatch.

68
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,890
Move the beginning of the shot all the way to the bottom.

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,630
Go to the end of the shot.

70
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,590
Scooch the end of the shot all the way to the top.

71
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,990
And now if we play through it.

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,820
We have that natural handheld movement, but then we added this movement along with it, just to add

73
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,040
a little extra dynamic layer.

74
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,040
And now that we have that, let's go ahead and export this version, we have the endpoint set at the

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,990
beginning, the outpoint set at the end.

76
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,900
I'm going to do command end to bring up our export settings aged up to 64.

77
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,010
We're set with that.

78
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,480
And because it's going to be going to a mobile device, we're going to do mobile device 10 ATP.

79
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,920
And just like the other edit you can scrub through here to preview what it'll be looking like.

80
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,820
And again, we have these black bars on the side here because we have not yet worked in the 16 by nine

81
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,910
aspect ratio.

82
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,950
So we're going to click match source boom.

83
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,210
That gives us the exact four by five aspect ratio we're wanting for Instagram post.

84
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,760
We're going to do render at maximum depth.

85
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,400
We're going to hit maximum render quality.

86
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,740
We're going to scroll down on the audio tab.

87
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,120
We're going to make sure our bit rate is set to 320.

88
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,560
That's the highest audio settings we can have.

89
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,110
And finally, we're going to go to our output name, click that, and we're going to set our name and

90
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,820
our destination for export.

91
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,280
Now, what I do, if I'm exporting something that's similar to a previous export, I'm just going to

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,480
click on that previous export, because that's going to pop up a similar name.

93
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,850
It's going to save me a little bit of time.

94
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,220
And I type quite as much Mount Shasta V1.

95
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,530
And this is going to be Instagram post.

96
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,400
OK.

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,580
If we had made changes in our edit and updated or changed shots or music, this would be a version,

98
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,060
too.

99
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,910
But because no physical changes have been made except for that aspect ratio change, it's technically

100
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,020
still the same version.

101
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,980
So we're going to keep that V1.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,060
We're going to hit save and hit export.
