00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.330
OK, so we have our edit, we have multiple soundtrack's, we have some sound design, we have an end

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.930
card.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:14.700
We have some film burns in overlays some time remapping some filters that we've added to the visuals

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.810
and to the audio.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.270
And let's see.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.220
And we've plugged in our version one rough edit notes.

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.820
And let's say we've had more time to refine our edit.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.780
Now, there are some further things that we can do to upgrade the overall look and feel.

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.300
Now, something that you can do and that feature films have is a very specific aspect ratio.

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.350
You'll notice if you go to a film or you download a movie and you watch it on Netflix, download a movie.

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.630
Oh my God, this is twenty twenty one.

12
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.970
If you stream a movie and you watch it on Netflix or any other website and you full screen it.

13
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.220
It's not going to fill the screen.

14
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.740
There's going to be a lot below it and a lot above that screen that's going to have black bars.

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:10.440
Now, that's because that's the type of aspect ratio of films are shot and we can mimic that aspect

16
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.750
ratio, which naturally creates a more cinematic and aesthetically pleasing image in most scenarios.

17
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.070
So what I'm going to do is go ahead and take this overlay.

18
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.380
So this is a two two by thirty five aspect ratio.

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.040
So we're going to go from a sixteen by nine to this new aspect ratio.

20
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.140
And you're going to see it's going to drop on these black bars across our edit.

21
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.220
And instantly we can see now it is going to cover some of these things and we can totally reframe shots.

22
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.030
All we have to do is click on our shot, shoot it down.

23
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.290
Boom, we're good.

24
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.420
Now, I'm just going to go ahead and click through so we can see an example of what this is doing.

25
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.090
So we have this shot with the bars.

26
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.740
And let me actually make some more room here to make it bigger with the bars without OK, with it just

27
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.500
looks more framed.

28
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.750
It frames things up a little bit better.

29
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.550
So let's kind of fix some of these and let's move her up.

30
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.710
And it has more of a film quality when we have this ratio.

31
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.910
So we have it without width and there's a bar at the bottom because I moved this one.

32
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.530
So let's actually move to a different one.

33
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.300
Let's actually let it play.

34
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.760
Just so you get a feel for what that looks like now.

35
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:45.880
In my opinion, this looks really good on full screen when you're showing your video on a projector

36
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.290
against a big wall.

37
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.380
The video is being watched full screen on a big computer screen or a television screen.

38
00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:04.360
It doesn't look so good when it's just being viewed on a, you know, small iPhone screen or in just

39
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.470
the little screen on Instagram, because that's just the nature of how it's being viewed on that kind

40
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.000
of screen or scenario.

41
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.899
So I wanted to throw this in here, because it is it a little professional extra sauce that you can

42
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.230
overlay on top of your footage, because for this specific project, we're not doing any color correction.

43
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.900
We're working with footage that's already been color corrected and refined.

44
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.320
But the letterboxing or changing the aspect ratio, just like this is a great way to get that more cinematic

45
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.930
documentary feature film.

46
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.520
Look, I mean, like this shot looks so cool with it, especially.

47
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.810
So, yeah, it makes a really big difference, but it really depends on where your project is going

48
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.860
to be viewed.

49
00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:03.280
Now, you can go and find these online just these simple pages that have a transparent center or, you

50
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.860
know, you can even make it yourself.

51
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.310
So let's go ahead and delete this.

52
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.130
I'm going to go to our project panel.

53
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.770
I'm going to create a new item and then do a black video.

54
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.150
I'm going to drag it on top and it's going to fill the whole screen, of course.

55
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.420
But what we can actually do is create a mask right over here.

56
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.660
I went to opacity.

57
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.040
I clicked mask.

58
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.320
And then we can drag out this box that we just created.

59
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.430
So I'm going to drag it out and I'm going to invert the mask.

60
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.430
And now I'm going to expand the layer that we have.

61
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.450
So and I need to turn off the feathering.

62
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.550
You don't want to feather because then you're going to have more of a vignette than anything else.

63
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.320
So I want to turn off the feathering.

64
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.980
Now, we actually have a lot of control.

65
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.470
We could really make it stylized, which will look great.

66
00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:02.740
Like I said, if it was going to be viewed full screen on a big screen, or we can make it really minimal

67
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:13.000
by adjusting the expansion of this black video adjustment layer that we just dropped on top of our footage.

68
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:21.160
So that's a great way to add a little final refinement if your project needs it and where it's going

69
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.220
to be played, make sense for this type of process.
