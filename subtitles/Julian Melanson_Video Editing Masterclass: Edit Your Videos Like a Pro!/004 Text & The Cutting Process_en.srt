1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,939
So we just talked about audio cues just in this first 20 seconds of our edit and we're going to talk

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:12,060
more about audio, but I now want to dive into some of the visual stuff that's going on towards the

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,090
beginning of this edit.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,880
So let's look over here at a screen cap.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,530
And by the way, I know we spent a lot of time upgrading our motion graphics or upgrading our text to

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,710
look more professional.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:33,690
But, you know, you can still do a lot with just really clean font with a black screen that has the

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,010
right size, you know, and the right with and the right amount of information on each line with a nice

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,590
little fade in and just a little bit of movement can go a long way and still create that professional

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:46,770
look.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,090
So don't think you have to always have these crazy motion graphics with glitchy eage transitions in

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,850
and move in and different colors and all that stuff that we worked on to create together.

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,970
You can do really great looking stuff with very clean looking font.

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,980
Now let's go ahead and skip forward to getting better at reading requires seeing the written word differently

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,870
once you get the hang of that.

16
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,320
The writing comes naturally to study in literature make you better at every subject you'll ever study

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,900
I.

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,620
Okay, perfect.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,910
So we have our music synched up to the cool moments in our visuals.

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,990
We have the music synched up to the right moments to when she's speaking.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,920
And that's really the goal that we focused on throughout the course.

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,350
Now, I just want to explain what's going on here and why these shots work so well together.

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,390
You can kind of see, OK.

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,180
And by the way, these shots are right here, one, two, three, four, five shots.

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,520
And if I go ahead and reveal this in the project, OK, sorry about that.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,630
My computer or my editing program actually just crashed.

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,480
And that's one of the dangers when you have a lot of stacked footage with a lot of filters on it.

28
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,850
This can happen.

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,270
So you have to save your process regularly.

30
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,650
OK.

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,520
Now back to this.

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm going to right click the first shot in a viral sequence.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,650
I'm going to open it up and I'm going to show you what the original shot look like.

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,820
So we have the teacher, I'm giving her some direction on what to do.

35
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,360
So we have her walking up here, OK?

36
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,330
Of course, we're not using any of these things before, and right there is the shot, as you can see.

37
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,290
Then she walks up and she honestly doesn't really do anything.

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,850
We do it again.

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,750
She walks up.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,040
She starts writing.

41
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,330
I'm giving her notes or feedback on what to do.

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,520
She's kind of doing a mock teaching session here, like pretending like she's teaching a class.

43
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,910
She's writing out OK.

44
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,040
And altogether, this is a seven minute sequence.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,780
So what we did is we took the most interesting parts of that sequence.

46
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,860
Of course, we color corrected it, as you can see between this shot and this shot.

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,690
So we have her walking in.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,070
We cut to her writing.

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,810
And as she's still doing that movement, boom, it goes to this movement.

50
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,940
And as she's moving her hand, still, boom, it goes to this movement.

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,030
And as that slides, then that goes into this same type of movement.

52
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,940
That's what creates that to do really smooth transition between these five shots.

53
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:46,060
That was really seven minutes of raw footage that we went through in the select process that you should

54
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,410
be an expert at by now.

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,930
And we took that and we cut together this little let's see.

56
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,480
Twenty eight seconds to 33 seconds.

57
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,330
So this is a little four to five seconds in literature, four or five second piece.

58
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:09,220
And you can see the other reason why it feels right is because each cut is on beat with this track.

59
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,150
Here's our track.

60
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,310
These mountains or peaks are going to be our beat.

61
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:17,970
OK.

62
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,839
And actually, let me solo this track.

63
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,480
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

64
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,090
So boom, boom, right.

65
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,150
It goes right with the song itself.

66
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,220
So it feels natural to the viewer.

67
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,110
And it also goes to the moments of her speaking.

68
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,650
So as you develop your skills, at first you're going to be able to create a montage just to a song,

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,750
and then you're going to be able to create, you know, a montage and an edit to just vocals maybe,

70
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,980
and mash up the visuals and show the visuals that explain more about what's being shared audibly.

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,450
And then you're going to be able to develop the skill where you're sinking the visuals to what's being

72
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:03,990
said.

73
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,930
You're matching the beat with your cuts on the music track, and then you're adding in all these extra

74
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,650
layers.
