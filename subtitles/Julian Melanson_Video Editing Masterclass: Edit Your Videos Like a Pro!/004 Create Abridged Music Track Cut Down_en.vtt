1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.130
OK, so we have our track chosen, and now the next step would be to create a cut down in the track

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.470
if needed, and for this situation, we definitely want to do that.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.760
Look, I track itself is about three and a half minutes long.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.980
Our B-roll footage is currently about two minutes.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.770
But honestly, I want to get this down to closer to a minute and a half, even closer to a minute,

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.610
if possible.

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.290
It's probably going to be more like a minute and a half.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.189
So I did put a few markers here on our track.

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.250
But let's just go ahead and take a listen of where I placed these markers and I'll explain why I did

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.550
that.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.900
So we have our intro.

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.680
So there's the first marker, and here's where the beat comes in.

13
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.130
Now this intro, it repeats twice.

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.880
OK, so there's this intro, and then it replicates and repeats again.

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
So I believe this is four bars and this is four bars and makes eight bars.

16
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.790
So it's an eight bar intro.

17
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.420
Now I put a marker here because to save, let's see.

18
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.820
This is ten seconds if we look up here at the top.

19
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.500
This is ten seconds.

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.230
Boom, we hit it and then it restarts again.

21
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.030
And then boom.

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.870
This is where the beat comes in.

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.180
We can save 10 seconds of our edit by scooting over and deleting that extra.

24
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.480
Four bars, I believe, is four bars that we don't need.

25
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.050
OK, so we still get this great intro song comes in here.

26
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.260
Now, this whole part is kind of the main part of the track.

27
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.410
And then here you can see these two markers.

28
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.320
This is where it goes into a more laid back breakdown kind of feeling.

29
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.660
OK.

30
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.000
And right here is where it goes back into the beat, so I already know that I don't want to start the

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.230
beat again here and then go into another laid back part here and go into a build and go into the beat

32
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.620
again.

33
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.510
That's not what we want to do.

34
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:42.340
We probably want to go into a different main portion that's then going to end naturally close to where

35
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.410
we want our actual edit to end.

36
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.190
So if we go to, let's say, this marker.

37
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.860
OK, so it plays again, and then there's a natural fade out that's built into the track itself, so

38
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.460
we don't have to add a crossfade or an echo or reverb.

39
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.240
There already is that in the track, which is perfect, so it's going to sound natural.

40
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.440
OK, perfect, so let's make a cut here, and let's drag this part where the beat comes in and replace

41
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.650
it.

42
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.780
Over here now, I can drag it right on top.

43
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.580
But a kind of a trick that I like to do is to drag it right next to it so that we're not deleting the

44
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.240
old track this way, I can sink these two things up.

45
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.200
So you see, that's the bit there.

46
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.000
That's to be there.

47
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.800
I can go.

48
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.540
Boom, and then I can hit play.

49
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.790
And they're selective sometimes what happens is it'll be off a little bit and we don't want that.

50
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:05.900
So what happens to is if this is be here and let's say I undo this and we have it over here and I want

51
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.070
to drag it in.

52
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.990
You know, sometimes the markers are off a little bit, so let's see if we get it right.

53
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.260
OK, the other was a missing beat.

54
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.450
Right, so doing that instead, the second way I did it allows for us to sync it up.

55
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.100
We're not deleting anything yet.

56
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.200
And kind of drag this out.

57
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.790
Make sure the beats are sync up.

58
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.220
And then now we can even do.

59
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.770
Let's see if this works.

60
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.370
I'm going to go ahead and delete their delete there.

61
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.390
Put this down.

62
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.640
Perfect.

63
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:58.250
And now we have this nice fade out right at the one minute and 30 second mark, which is perfect because

64
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:06.320
I know this is going to be our ending shot and we'll probably add like a nice fade just like this.

65
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.500
So that it's going to be something like this, it's going to fade.

66
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.730
The.

67
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.530
OK, and then, you know, we can put the the company website, the realtor website, the product website,

68
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.140
whatever it is, but we're not there yet.

69
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.170
Right now, we're just focusing on our music track and making the cut down so that it matches up with

70
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.240
the overall video length that we want to have.

71
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.440
And it's looking good.

72
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.610
We have our intro that we cut down in half.

73
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.350
We have our main part here.

74
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.040
And we went from a three and a half minute track to now a one and a half minute track.

75
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.380
But we're still getting the intro, the build the main be, the more laid back part.

76
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:09.810
Another bill again right here and then a nice natural echo and reverb out with a slow crossfade that

77
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.350
feels normal and it doesn't actually feel like there's an area in the track.

78
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.490
And that's really the goal.

79
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.760
You want to cut this down so that no one knows that there is actually an edit that's going, you know,

80
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.150
you've done a good job editing down your music.
