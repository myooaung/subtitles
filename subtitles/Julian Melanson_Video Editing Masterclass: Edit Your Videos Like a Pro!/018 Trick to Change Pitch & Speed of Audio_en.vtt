00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.750
And as a little bit of a pro tip to take things a little bit further.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.530
Because depending on where you pull your audio from, if you're reusing different bits from your timeline

3
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.090
and you don't want it to sound too similar, like, oh, that person obviously coffee didn't, you know,

4
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.560
use that same audio twice.

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.140
So if we take a listen to the pitch, what we can do is a little bit of a trick here is to highlight

6
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.820
the second time that we use it.

7
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.560
And change the speed of the clip, and we can either increase the speed or decrease the speed if we

8
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.730
decrease the speed.

9
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.300
It's going to decrease the pitch, bringing it lower.

10
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.380
Or if we increase the speed, it's going to increase the pitch, bringing it higher.

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.290
So let's see what it sounds like if we go from a hundred percent speed to 80 percent speed.

12
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.410
So that's what it sounds like now.

13
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.930
It sounds like a completely different bird, I'm not saying it sounds amazing and this is the way I

14
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.570
would have it for the final edit, but this

15
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.330
is compared to the original.

16
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.830
This is pretty different.

17
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.060
I don't think that even a trained ear would necessarily know that we reuse that clip twice and we could

18
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.830
even maybe just do 90 percent because 80 percent, it sounded a little bit too deep, a little bit too

19
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.190
low.

20
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.720
So if we do, 90 percent.

21
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.500
Right.

22
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.750
Sounds completely different.

23
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.440
So that's another little hack right there to be able to reuse audio twice and kind of get away with

24
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.650
it.

25
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.340
We'll do more about using audio swooshed transitions and changing the speed later in the course.

26
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.010
But that's kind of a cool trick.
