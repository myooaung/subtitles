00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.340
And now, because this is a promo video, you know, a lot of the times when you're doing these projects

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.860
for clients, this is a music producer doing this routine to promote his new album.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.460
I went online because I forgot this project was a year or so ago.

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.540
I couldn't find his any of his logos.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.400
I don't know why I don't have them on my computer, but it's cool.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.170
I forgot that he worked with Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, little John, like, come on, it's crazy.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.790
So anyways.

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.159
Yeah, because this is a promo video for a project.

9
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:39.120
A lot of times in the end, these videos are going to have a title screen or a call to action or some

10
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
kind of wording that's going to tell people to do something after watching the promo, whether that's

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.640
a promo for a product.

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.020
It could be a link to the product's website or whatever it is.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.650
So I generally that's going to have a logo so we can go ahead and drag in this logo that we used earlier.

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.630
It's going to have the logo and it's going to have some kind of wording.

15
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.670
So let's so let's go ahead and add in an example.

16
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.650
So w WW dot promo video dot com, of course, is is not going to say bro video is going to say, you

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.420
know, the client's website or whatever it is that your project entails.

18
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.100
And I'm just going to go ahead and get a clean looking font.

19
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.870
Just go with Latu.

20
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.470
It's a good one.

21
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.490
Never fails.

22
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.390
And let's go ahead and scale this up a little bit and let's center it.

23
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:44.730
Okay, so now what we have is this ending here, and we have our promo video logo with a website.

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.430
So what I want to do actually the end, because this is kind of a unique ending that we have here.

25
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.250
We have this kind of our overlays, see how it goes, boom, and then boom.

26
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.790
Oh, I actually want to put our title below that so that it looks kind of like.

27
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.350
It comes from behind it.

28
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.630
That's kind of cool.

29
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.260
So let's kind of refine this a little bit more that.

30
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.860
And like that, you know.

31
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.190
OK.

32
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.590
And we'll move them up.

33
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.290
OK,

34
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.940
OK, cool.

35
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.050
So that kind of incorporates our ending title card title screen a little bit more into the edit, and

36
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.250
I can even extend that's a little too much distortion going on.

37
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.240
But yeah, I can find a more a less distorted version.

38
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.420
Yeah.

39
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:07.050
Like that, just so that it fits a little bit more with the rest of the edit, because just the black

40
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.370
screen for all this, like overlays and greediness and you know, all this just different textures that

41
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.410
we have here just to go to that, it doesn't really match the rest of the video.

42
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.500
So that's something you want to keep in mind.

43
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.270
Anytime you're doing a title screen, you want it to be cohesive with the aesthetic of the rest of it.

44
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.770
Otherwise it's going to feel out of place.

45
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.340
So I don't want this to get too glitchy and crazy.

46
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.520
So what I'm going to do to combat that is I'm going to slow it down so there's less frequency of stuff

47
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.360
moving boom.

48
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.960
That makes it a little bit more palatable.

49
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.290
Right before it was kind of too much going on.

50
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.490
That's a lot going on.

51
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.140
I slowed it down to 60 percent.

52
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.620
Now the glitching is slower and then it goes out.

53
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.330
OK, so that's looking good.

54
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.560
Now, what we can do as maybe a final little layer here.

55
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.050
Just because, like I mentioned, we want our whole video to match up, what we can do is do a glitching

56
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.649
is directly to this altro, this ending bit of the clip.

57
00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.800
So it's going like scale's move.

58
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.200
So we go from here, boom.

59
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.950
It goes like that.

60
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.800
Go for it again and move it.

61
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.900
And let's see how that works.

62
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.010
Boom.

63
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.910
OK, cool.

64
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.560
So we can even hold that a little bit more.

65
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.640
OK, we can even add one more, one more, you know, addition of a few frames of wittiness.

66
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.440
OK.

67
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.700
OK, cool, I like that.

68
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.080
So now our logo kind of interacts with the glitching is around it, and it doesn't just disappear,

69
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.890
fade out.

70
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.520
If this was a slow, smooth moving project that was like a violin, like one of our previous edits,

71
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.650
this would not make sense.

72
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.520
But we're really turning up the glitch grunge layer level on this one, because it just really matches

73
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.450
up with the vibe.
