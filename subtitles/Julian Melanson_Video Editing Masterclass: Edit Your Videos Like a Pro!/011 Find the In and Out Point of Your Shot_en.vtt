00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.300
OK, so at this point in the edit, quite a few of the Selex have been made, but honestly, this is

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.080
a pretty big project.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.100
So I've been categorizing everything.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.290
But right now, we're working with two new sequences here, raw footage, too, in raw footage one.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.020
And as you can see, I mean, there's a lot of raw footage in here.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.370
This is like two hours.

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.040
So what I've done is dragged all these clips in here.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.350
And as you can see, we've done the colouring process so that we have an idea of the shots from different

9
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.490
sequences.

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.940
Now, this is a rough ordering of what the layout of the vlog is going to be.

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.490
We have the beginning here beginning before shots of the office.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.540
We have some of the items that I bought, all the Amazon purchases and boxes.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
We have the different phases of creating the office.

14
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.240
Right.

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.780
And then we have the office starting to come together, starting to fine tune the look of the office,

16
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
putting in shelves, painting the wall, all that good stuff.

17
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.430
And basically, I'm going to go through here.

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.320
I'm going to let the camera roll on and let the screen capture continue.

19
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.170
And basically, once all these Selex are pulled, we're going to assemble our rough edit and then drop

20
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.610
in our voice over.

21
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.170
That's really going to be the driving force behind the story and really explaining what's going on in

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.670
the footage.

23
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.510
So I'm going to continue to pull these Selex.

24
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.300
And at any moments did pop up that are important.

25
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.950
I'll stop and we'll talk about it.

26
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.360
So a lot of the times when you have visual shots that you're putting together for a montage, you know,

27
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.500
you're going to have the moment where you hit record, you're setting up your shot, your camera, your

28
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.920
focus, your settings, and then it's actually the shots going to start.

29
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.330
So when we're scrubbing through our clips, whenever we're editing, we want to look for that moment

30
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.970
where the beginning of our shot happens.

31
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.860
So I can see kind of jostling moving and came around and then right about there.

32
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.470
So we're going to cut in right there is where the smooth shot begins.

33
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.670
So a little scrub forward and right about there before it goes out of focus is where it ends.

34
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.220
And this we don't need and a lot of times as well, you do a shot more than once.

35
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.800
And I talk about this in the cinematography course where you want to have as many options as possible.

36
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.880
So if you have one type of shot, you want to shoot that shot twice.

37
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.070
So I come in pan to the left to show the state of the room before we begin the renovations for the YouTube

38
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.080
studio or the film studio.

39
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.830
And then I do that same shot and I pan to the right.

40
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.350
So we're going to grab that and we're going to continue to scrub forward.

41
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.040
Now, I know this is not the most interesting viral at the moment.

42
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.140
It's a blank slate.

43
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.470
It's a blank room with nothing on the walls.

44
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.140
But bear with me.

45
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.020
We're going to start getting to the interesting footage very soon.

46
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.440
Something else I want to mention is out of context.

47
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.360
These shots don't currently make a whole lot of sense, but because you are the one who's putting together

48
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:32.450
your masterpiece, you know, the context and the content and what the story is that's being told.

49
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.830
So as you're making your cuts, you are really making connections.

50
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.140
We know that we're going to connect these shots before the renovations to the shots, after the renovations.

51
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.840
So we're gathering pieces to the puzzle to tell that story.

52
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.000
And the context that we're putting these shots in is really what tells that story.

53
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.660
So to the average person who doesn't understand the project you're creating, things really aren't going

54
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.990
to make sense during this phase.

55
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.370
A lot of the time, it's kind of like seeing a painting or drawing or whatever it is when you've only

56
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.160
seen the sketch and you haven't seen the final product yet.

57
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.380
And because the final product resides in your mind, right.

58
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.250
In your thoughts, in your creativity, what you're actually doing in this process is like a sculptor

59
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.660
carving a granite block.

60
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:42.120
You're chipping away the layers and revealing the sculpture that's underneath the stone.

61
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.750
Right.

62
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.190
There were philosophical there for you.

63
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.470
Now, most of the time, we are planning ahead of the shots we're going to use and we have an idea of

64
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.150
where we're going to be putting those shots.

65
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.260
Now, here's a perfect example of a clip that I have that I'm going to hold on to it, because I really

66
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.590
feel like this will be a cool, kind of unique moment where I can really come in with the voiceover

67
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.900
and talk about the planning phase.

68
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.320
Right.

69
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.110
The starting with a blank slate phase and not knowing what to do.

70
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:25.130
This is also a really cool shot to keep in your back pocket that you can add text in these blank spaces.

71
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.430
So kind of piggybacking off what we were just talking about, about having the idea for the edit here,

72
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.160
but keeping an open mind and keeping an eye out for shots that the average person would see and throw

73
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.230
it away discarded.

74
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:47.480
But because a good editor can always turn bad footage into a great edit and a bad editor sadly can turn

75
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.740
great footage into a bad.

76
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.260
And it's so we want to hold on to stuff like this and really see what we can do with it later in the

77
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.560
editing.
