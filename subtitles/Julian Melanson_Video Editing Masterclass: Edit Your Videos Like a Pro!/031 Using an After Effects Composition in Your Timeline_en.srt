1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,290
Righto, so we have, like I mentioned, this, you know, big shot, that's the one of the most important

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,820
shots of the video and this going to be shot.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,880
So I want to do like a zoom effect.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,820
Kind of a sushi kind of zoom in.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,950
I don't know how to explain it, a zoom effect.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,750
So a cool way to do this and really to integrate into after effects.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,640
Now, this is not an after effects course.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,390
It's an entirely other editing software on its own.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,970
But it's basically the Photoshop of video final cut premiere I movie.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,300
These are like main editing softwares that are designed to create cuts like what we've done in this

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,990
chapter.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,410
But something like After Effects is really an in-depth editing software that's designed to create very

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,330
intense.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,780
Oh, God, I'm repeating myself.

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,260
OK, let's just get into it.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,600
So what I would do is duplicate the two clips that we're going to do this effect with.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,620
And I'm going to right click these clips and I'm going to do replace with after effects composition.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,500
This is going to open up after effects and create a sequence with these clips that we have.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,850
And the benefits of doing it this way is that we don't have to highlight our clips, export them, import

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,520
them in the after effects, do the editing that we want, export them out of after effects, and then

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,830
import them into our editing software.

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,170
So it's asking me where I want to save this brand new after effects project.

23
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,540
So I'm going to put it in the proper folder.

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,370
I'm going to title this folder after effects transition.

25
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:54,780
And what I want to do to get this swoosh effect is to create a justment layer.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,310
And this is exactly like the adjustment layers that we've been using in our normal editing software.

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,450
It's going to create a global effect on whatever's below it.

28
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,540
Sorry, I just kind of changed the layout of the windows here.

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,040
But I'm going to go to the Presets and Effects tab and I'm going to take one of my favorite transitions

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,200
that does kind of that cool sushi style.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,950
And I'm going to drop that on to our adjustment layer.

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:28,080
Now, what this is going to do and by the way, you don't have to use this same exact transition.

33
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,250
You can do this, you know, for color correction if you want in after effects.

34
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:39,660
You can do this for thousands of different things that the after effects filters can do, specifically

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,660
that premier final cut can't do.

36
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,980
So I'm going to take this filter that I dropped on and I'm going to really just line up the key frames

37
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,510
to the transition between the two clips.

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,880
And I'm going to preview what that looks like.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,190
So that has the more right effect that we're looking for.

40
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:12,600
Of course, I can go in and I can fine tune the zoom strength, the blur, all that stuff.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,330
But this is really not about after effects.

42
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:23,520
This is just more about the simplicity and the benefit of being able to edit an after effects sequence

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:32,400
that automatically goes to your premiere timeline without having to import and export it.

44
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,590
So I hope that you can use that in your future videos and in your YouTube video that you're editing

45
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,860
to do some creative stuff and save a little bit of time.
