00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.450
And we also have our music track, so there's a few things going on here.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.130
Let's now focus on the audio.

3
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:26.830
OK, so as you can see, it's synched up perfectly to this big strong beat that comes in when the overlay

4
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.260
or the title cards come in.

5
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.900
But there's a reason there's some cutting here, and there's a lot of changes to the key framing of

6
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.530
the volume.

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.220
We want the volume to be all the way up or at least more frontal and primary when there's no speaking.

8
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.410
Otherwise, it'll kind of fall flat.

9
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.070
So like we did earlier, if I put all this stuff down to the level that it is right here while she's

10
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.610
speaking.

11
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.120
She your membership plan and become an annual member today.

12
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.610
It just kind of falls flat, right, so let's undo that.

13
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.180
And let it play, it's become an annual member today.

14
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.120
There we go, and let's also take a look at what we were cutting and why we did it.

15
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.040
So I'm going to take away our cuts.

16
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.070
Let this play if you're ready to get started.

17
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.610
So that part sounds OK.

18
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.880
It has a little bit of an extra instrument added, but I have that same sound at the beginning of where

19
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.630
this track actually comes in just like 20 seconds earlier.

20
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.740
So rather than it's sounding a little bit repetitive, I went ahead and I grabbed a part of the track

21
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.430
that's later in that track and I put it lined it up at the same moment.

22
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.370
But change the type of sounds that that track was using, so we also went over that as well.

23
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.990
Earlier in the course of how to properly cut down and trim your music so that it really is cohesive

24
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.270
with all of your visuals.

25
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.050
That about does it for this breakdown on this client project trailer.

26
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.950
I believe the project budget for this was like 17000.

27
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.930
So you got to see a cool behind the scenes how to on how a really high end professional video of this

28
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.180
nature is cut together and what the special moments are that really makes it more entertaining and brings

29
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.150
up the production value.

30
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.430
So in the next video lesson, we're actually going to be hopping into another client project.

31
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.430
I will see you there.
