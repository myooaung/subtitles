00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.820
Sweet.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.710
So we have all this Selex pulled for our sequence.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.350
Now, I have some shots that were kind of mixed in here that aren't going to make it into the montage.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.730
They're these ones.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.860
They're more of slow pacing shots.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
They will probably have some voiceover under them of showing what I bought some of the items.

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.940
But for the purpose of this montage, we're going to go ahead and select these clips, these longer

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.040
ones that aren't going to be in the montage.

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.640
We're going to move them to the back and we're going to change the color so that we know they're not

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.810
part of our montage.

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.970
I'm going to right click the space in-between to remove the gaps.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.310
Do the same for our montage clips.

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.350
What we did here is whittled down all of these montage shots from five minutes to about 30 seconds.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.310
Now, let's do a quick watch through and see what we have to work with.

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.020
And we'll find what moments need to be tightened up, shortened in space, taken out, and what maybe

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.420
moments need to be fully.

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.320
What clips need to fully be taken out completely or what footage

18
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.680
or what clips need to be fully taken out completely if maybe there's too much repetition.

19
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.710
So let's check it.

20
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.990
OK, cool.

21
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.420
So not too bad.

22
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.990
There's definitely a few moments that I saw with my editing eye that there's a little too much space

23
00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.950
kind of hanging around.

24
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:08.770
And personally, I'm not a huge fan of I love the knife shots and all that, like cutting the tape.

25
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.460
I'm not the biggest fan of these opening the boxes.

26
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.770
It's a little too.

27
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.620
I don't know.

28
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.590
It doesn't have a really cool feel for me.

29
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.010
So rather than deleting these, it might just be the ordering.

30
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.300
And that's really a big thing when it comes to montages.

31
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.650
It's the shot.

32
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.470
That's it's the shots that you choose.

33
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.140
It's the length that you choose to show those shots.

34
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.990
And it's also the ordering that you decide to put those shots in.

35
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.940
So I just whistled when I made the sound shots in.

36
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.090
So there's a lot of stuff going on, a lot of different complexity.

37
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.180
And rather than deleting these shots, I don't like first of all, I'm going to go ahead and make some

38
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.930
space to duplicate our montage clips so that we got it back up right there in our timeline.

39
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.190
And then I'm going to go ahead and change this color.

40
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.130
And I want to take these shots I don't like and I'm going to actually place them together because to

41
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:22.630
me they throw off the pacing of this montage, but if I reorder, then it might actually work with all

42
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:30.070
those shots linked up towards the end of the edit, which kind of also makes sense chronologically,

43
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.270
because we're cutting through all the boxes and then opening.

44
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.310
All the boxes simultaneously.

45
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.610
Grab those.

46
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.510
OK, now let's close our gaps here.

47
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.070
These are all the opening back shots.

48
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.190
And let's see what we got.

49
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.580
And OK, cool.

50
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.800
That, to me is actually flowing a lot better, but there's still some shots in here that don't really

51
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.260
need to be in there a little bit too repetitive.

52
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.850
And there's definitely a lot of time we can take out of the montage.

53
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.550
Extra breathing room and space that we don't need.

54
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.730
That's going to bring up the energy, be make it more interesting and overall really improve the edit.

55
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.040
So let's go ahead and do another pass on this.

56
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.400
Now, we're going to be sensing we're going to be listening and watching and feeling where there's a

57
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.160
little bit of extra space that doesn't need to be there.

58
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.820
OK, definitely at this point, right off the bat.

59
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.800
You can see this empty space right here.

60
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.430
Let's go ahead and remove that.

61
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.980
OK.

62
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.910
Remove that.

63
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.270
OK, miscued to the so.

64
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.570
It's too much empty space right here as well, scooched that over.

65
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.550
And what I think I want to try to do here is if we look at the waveforms, we can see the sound come

66
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.000
in.

67
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.570
The action is happening in the sound falls, meaning the action is ending.

68
00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.080
I'm going to try and squish these clips closer together so that rather than the action starting ending,

69
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.380
next shot, starting ending, next shot, I want it to kind of get closer to more of a continuous shore.

70
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.860
Sure.

71
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.780
Where I'm whistling a lot today, where instead of starting and ending on a clip, all the clips are

72
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.240
kind of in the middle of their action as we're cutting into them and leaving the clip, cutting out

73
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.190
kind of before the action ends.

74
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.500
This is going to kind of merge everything together.

75
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.080
OK, there's some some extra breathing room at the beginning of these next ones we can take out.

76
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.990
And you can see we're kind of also creating a rhythm here, we're creating our own beat.

77
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.680
So this shot, not a huge fan of the sound.

78
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.260
Honestly, and I don't think we need that.

79
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.510
So we're going to go ahead and just take this one out completely.

80
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.320
OK, cool.

81
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.790
I'm liking that a lot.

82
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.920
I'm just going to cut this sooner before my action is ending.

83
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.340
You see how that seamlessly cuts into the next shot.

84
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.140
Now, previously, he was like this.

85
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.670
And now we took out that extra space.

86
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.020
And it's almost like one shot.

87
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.380
Katie, energy kind of dies there in the clip because the sound drops out for just a few frames.

88
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.360
So we're going to remove that drop out by cutting into this clip a little bit later.

89
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.280
There we go.

90
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.510
So before it was like this and then now.

91
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.550
Same with this one as well.

92
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.510
So we lose the energy here because there's a little bit too much time at the beginning that we don't

93
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.210
need it that one too much time at the near.

94
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.860
Still, we get it kind of goes and stuff, so.

95
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.850
Right, right.

96
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.570
So we see these frames here.

97
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.620
Boom, it stops.

98
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.940
But we're holding this image.

99
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:39.720
This is an exact time as an editor where these two frames are making a huge difference on the seamlessness

100
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.830
in the flow of our edit.

101
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.289
So we got to ninja our way through this.

102
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.690
There we go.

103
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:09.060
Now we've went from a five minute edit of raw footage to like a one minute edit to now a 20 second edit.

104
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.270
Let's see what we did on this last pass.

105
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:40.610
OK, cool, so we don't have a definitive ending yet for this montage, I'm not exactly sure what the

106
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.040
voiceover is going to be saying at this point in the edit.

107
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:49.110
But the takeaway that I want you to have here is that the editing is in the subtleties.

108
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:56.090
If you give the same footage to two different editors and they cut an edit in the same time frame,

109
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.490
but they're holding shots for a different amount of time, ordering the shots in a different way, it's

110
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:08.450
going to be a completely different edit with a completely different feeling given to the viewer.

111
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:16.880
So as you're going through working on your edits, keep in mind and feel what the edit is giving you.

112
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:25.520
And pay attention to that gut feeling and that knowing of if a shot is feeling good or if it's not feeling

113
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.530
good and keep reworking it, you know, keep reworking it and keep trying to.

114
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.860
Like I was saying before, carved the granite block into the statue in the artwork.

115
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:42.770
So now I'm going to continue to go through the rest of this footage and pull the rest of our Selex.
