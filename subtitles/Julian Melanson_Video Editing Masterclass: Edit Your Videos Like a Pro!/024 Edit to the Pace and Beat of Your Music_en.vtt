00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.470
And to wrap up the kind of insights and takeaways for this portion where we added in a musical track,

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.310
I just want to touch on why I was deciding to cut the way that I did.

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.340
So if I expand this a little bit, we can see clearly that these four video clips are really the same

4
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.810
length.

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.590
That means the pacing is equal between this section of the edit.

6
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.910
So let's go ahead and play that through.

7
00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.290
Boom.

8
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.070
Boom.

9
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.650
Boom.

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.830
The reason I decided to do that is because the track was dictating the way I was cutting.

11
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.030
So you can feel that right here what you're hearing is the strong beat that's happening, boom, right

12
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.200
there, boom, right there, boom, right there, and boom right there.

13
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.690
And then what changes in the track is that strong beat moves to this portion.

14
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.790
Where things go and slow down.

15
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.230
Right.

16
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.620
So when you're not knowing when to cut or when to really switch things up on your edit or what pacing

17
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.680
to have, and you're using a musical track, what I want you to take away from this a lesson is that

18
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.080
you're using your ear and the beat and the rhythm to dictate what is shown and what is being cut.

19
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.050
And if I cut to something that's not as primary as what we are cutting to hear and really following

20
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.310
the rhythm and the pacing of the song, let's say we cut to the bells in the background.

21
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.300
OK, there's a bell right there.

22
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.250
So we'll see what that looks like.

23
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.180
So you can see we're using the same shots in literally the same exact ordering, but you're feeling

24
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.300
the moments differently and there's different emphasis given to different moments, depending on where

25
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.630
they're lined up with your audio track, with your musical track, and where those strong beats or striking

26
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.060
points are hitting your footage.

27
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.330
So really think about that and keep that in mind as you're putting your edits together and as we're

28
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.360
moving together throughout the rest of this course.
