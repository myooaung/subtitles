1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,670
OK, so I'm super hyped because we just finalized and finished this entire chapter and we finished our

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,630
entire showcase edit, so we got into a lot more of the refinement, tips, techniques, strategies

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,000
for creating a more cohesive but, you know, elegant video.

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,110
It doesn't have to always be crazy suche transitions and montages.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,320
It can be cleaned.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,770
Video that simple is sometimes more effective.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,500
So what I want to do now is sit back, relax and watch the final final.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,530
I was getting the same video and edit and said Aido final edit that we created together.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's check it out.

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,230
Who they they look good, right, super clean.

11
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,980
And I really liked how the final product turned out.

12
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,230
So I'm really excited to also see the edit that you were creating during this whole process when we

13
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,070
were learning these kind of new, more refined techniques.

14
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,020
Now, here's just a mini recap of some of the stuff that we learned in this chapter.

15
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:45,420
We learned how to use shot arrangement to tell a story where no story was originally there.

16
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,280
Wow.

17
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,300
The footage was shot.

18
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,460
So we show the story of the exterior of the house walking up, walking through the doorway, the experience

19
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,760
that the person would have if they were actually there.

20
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,150
Then we got into editing down our music.

21
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,490
We took a three and a half minute track, I believe, and edit it down to a minute and a half while

22
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:12,390
still retaining the main beats, the main introduction, the bridge in the more laid back part and the

23
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:20,310
more excited parts of the video or of the track and, you know, tailored it custom to fit the video

24
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,420
that we were working on.

25
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,710
Then we made some intro title cards for that very beginning introductory screen, and then we made some

26
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,730
lower thirds title cards for other important information that we wanted to convey to our audience.

27
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,000
And then we went into creating an ending motion graphic is where we use after effects to create a much

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,290
more stylized and high production value motion graphic with a title, with text and with animation.

29
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,970
We did a few more things.

30
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:01,050
And then we also added a custom transition, a really cool day to night transition with a more beginner

31
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,840
to intermediate version inside of Premiere or your main editing software, and then a slightly more

32
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,860
advanced version where there's more ability to change the parameters inside of after effects.

33
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,940
We also added a little bit of a mini sound design part where we added that swooshed transition and then

34
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,670
we finalized our edit, did our color correction, and exported our final video.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,840
So like I said, export share your edit, you edit.

36
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,910
OK, that's supposed to say your edit.

37
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,420
So yeah, go ahead and export and share your edit in the studio Q&A so you can get feedback from myself

38
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,640
and from the other students that does it for the end of this entire chapter.

39
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,060
I was super excited to see you in the next chapter where we're going to be diving more into even more

40
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,880
advanced editing techniques and principles.
