00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.700
Yes, yes, yes.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.520
So we are at the final stage of this edit now that we have everything is looking good, sounding good.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.710
It's time to add a just a nice overall layer of color correction to the entire timeline.

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.040
And the way we're going to do that, which we've done before together, is to create a new adjustment

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.460
layer.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.380
So we're going to drag in this new adjustment layer and we're going to make sure we're not accidentally

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.200
deleting anything by dragging it on top of which you have definitely done in the past.

8
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.290
You do not want to do that.

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.820
Trust me.

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.040
So we're good.

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.130
We haven't deleted anything.

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.230
And we're going to go to the effects tab.

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.650
We're going to make sure our adjustment layer is selected and we're going to type in the color correction

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.710
filter that you're going to be using and just kind of looking around at the edit.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.590
I can tell that every shot can definitely use a bit of saturation, definitely an increasing contrast.

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.500
You can see the darks aren't really that dark.

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.760
They're pretty gray.

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.180
It looks a little bit bland.

19
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.910
So the saturation and the contrast is definitely going to help with that.

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140
And that's all I'm going to do.

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.680
I'm not going to do a whole lot of fancy color correction for this project specifically.

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.310
But yeah, I'm just going to kind of go in.

23
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.770
And now that I've looked at the whole timeline or, you know, a good portion of the timeline.

24
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.760
I got a feel for what it needs.

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390
So I'm going to take the saturation.

26
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.310
I want to move it up to 120 and I going to move up the sharpness, because I can see that not a whole

27
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.390
lot of these shots are super all that sharp.

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.870
So I do want to increase a little bit of the sharpness.

29
00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:01.290
I'm going to move that up 20 points and I'm going to increase the contrast, let's say 25 points, and

30
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.190
I'm just going to push down the shadows to create even more contrast just a little bit.

31
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.750
I want to go minus 15.

32
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.170
That's just going to make the dark parts of the frame even darker.

33
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.110
This creates in general a more cinematic look.

34
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.350
And creates a little bit more of a stylized image.

35
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.440
So that's what we're working with now.

36
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.750
And that's what we had before.

37
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.830
That's before that's now.

38
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.890
So the image before it was pretty decent.

39
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.780
That's before that's now.

40
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.480
It really doesn't need a whole lot of stylizing.

41
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.550
That's before that's now.

42
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.680
Doesn't need a whole lot of stylizing for this kind of edit, because this is like a tutorial.

43
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.350
And it's not a music video.

44
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.580
It's not a short film.

45
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.350
It's not a client project.

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.940
So overall, that's looking pretty good.

47
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.650
And we're going to export this and look at the final masterpiece that we put together.
