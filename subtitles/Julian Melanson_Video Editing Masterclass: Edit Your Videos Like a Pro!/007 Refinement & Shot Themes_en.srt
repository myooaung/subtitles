1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,040
So we're going to continue to go through this, edit and uncover some more secrets and techniques.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,580
Now, I wanted to mention that, you know, we're doing a lot of lessons, video lessons here on like

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:19,860
overlays and film burns and that kind of stuff is because you'll find each edit is going to have a lot

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,270
of its own specific look in some of the projects we edited together previously.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,530
Some of the edits were had a lot of glitching in some of the edits, had a lot of audio swoosh, kind

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,650
of sound design, some of the edits, had a lot of motion graphics and text to some of the edits, had

7
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,450
a lot of other specific elements that are kind of repeated throughout the video.

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,180
So you want to find what it is at.

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,660
That specific project needs to upgrade it to the higher level of production quality.

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,940
And then you're going to hone in on that and then you're going to kind of repeat it throughout the video,

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,740
but in a way that doesn't feel boring.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,840
I don't overdo the sparks overlay.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,260
I do it just enough in the scenes that need it where you almost don't notice it.

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,180
But it looks really inspiring.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:17,790
We have the different kind of crystal overlay things and crystal overlays at the right moments.

16
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,390
And then we have the more Filburn style at the right moments as well.

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,000
So keep that in mind.

18
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,590
You know, you're going to find a specific look for a specific project, hone in on that look and then

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,060
put it throughout the video.

20
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,530
Now, let's go ahead and continue to go through and see what we can find across the room, watching

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:45,120
it hit the ball across and all the way around the world, all the way back into your next deep breath

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,620
and see the world record with your contribution.

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,070
OK, so there was a few things there.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,370
We had this subtle time remapping right here.

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,300
Boom, boom, boom.

26
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,740
So let me hear it play.

27
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,610
Let me let it play.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
You can see the time.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,020
Remapping starts right there, ends right there across the room, shouting at it, which just gives

30
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,180
it a little extra something.

31
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:16,770
If I were to take away this and let it cut into the other video or the other clip room.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,240
Watching it.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,880
It didn't work.

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,870
There was just something wrong.

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,620
I want I thought it would work initially because it's like there's these that almost look like embers

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,610
out of focus.

37
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,010
You know, there's actually a lot of similarity in these two shots as far as the bouka and doing.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,990
But it didn't it didn't work.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,660
Watching it, I don't know.

40
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,320
There was something about it that wasn't working.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:47,500
So I added this little time remap that sped things up on this clip right before we cut the moon.

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,070
And for some reason, that worked perfectly in this situation.

43
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:59,070
Hit the wall across and all the way around the world, all the way back.

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,690
Now we have a theme that's happening between these shots.

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,620
We have our hand going into frame, going sideways, actually.

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
We have our hand going sideways and down.

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,350
We have our hand going out.

48
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,160
And then, boom, we have this matko of her hand at a different location.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,030
So let's watch that back across the room.

50
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:32,550
Watching it hit the wall across and all the way around the world, all the way back into your next deep

51
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,780
breath and see the world record with your contribution as your north perfec.

52
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,140
So a cool little unique 10 second sequence there.

53
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:52,080
We we used a similar move made between our shots with a similar repeating in this case body part her

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,840
and to create a pretty unique sequence.

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,440
So we also have some filmar an action going on.

56
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:06,140
So this one was used right here, see the world to link these two together in a way they just felt better

57
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,260
if I were to take that away and let this play see the world of this year.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,460
It's cool.

59
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,150
It's fine.

60
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,149
It just doesn't have that final payoff, you know, is a big exposure difference between these two images

61
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,310
and a big color difference.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,280
But a similar movement with our character.

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:35,190
But perfect situation to link these boom with our Filmon, with your contribution as your North Star.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Whether it's behind clouds or not.

65
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,050
Dipsy.

66
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,910
I should confess.

67
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,170
What is your why?

68
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,930
Open your eyes, see your star.

69
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,590
OK, perfect.

70
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,830
So we have this camera movement going up to the sky when she says and fly, I'm arriving in this lesson

71
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,650
and I love it, OK, and then we go to a fade.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,750
Actually, across is all of this shot.

73
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,550
Now, of course, for this project, our trusty Filburn is really helping out with getting these two

74
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,200
shots linked together.

75
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,230
If we were to scroll through it without its cool.

76
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,410
You know, that's fine, it's cool.

77
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:42,570
But this is one of those projects where filmmakers are really the money on this one, so get comfortable

78
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,960
with using film burns because it's going to come in handy.

79
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,030
They're really easy to add.

80
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,140
They're really easy to use.

81
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,570
And the professional look, you can get by dropping the perfect one in at the perfect moment of the

82
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,200
video.

83
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,970
Is the game changer trust?
