1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,880
So we've created our title cards, we've created our main sequence, we made our really cool custom

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,800
outro motion graphic, and now we're at the time in the edit where we want to do our color correction

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,310
layer.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,370
Now, what I'm going to do is a similar process to what we've done before, where I want to raise up

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,320
the titles that we treated that way.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,860
When we turn up the exposure or the highlights or drop the shadows on our footage below.

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,090
We don't affect our title cards.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,080
That's a big no no.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,810
So I'm going to go to our project window.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,940
I'm going to right click.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,310
I'm going to hit adjustment layer.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,380
I'm going to create that adjustment layer.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,790
Drag it in.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,400
Extend it out.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:53,380
And I know this ahead of time that I have quite a few different overall exposures.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,620
We have this outdoor sequence.

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,490
We have these indoor to outdoor stuff.

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,220
We have this living room stuff with outdoor.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,620
So there's a lot of different exposures.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,880
So we're going to have to kind of go through and fine tune.

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,560
And then once we get over here, then we're outdoor again.

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,620
So that's just something to keep in mind that we're going to have to do a little bit more work to get

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,770
everything leveled and looking the same, or at least getting the exposures correct on these different

24
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,510
types of clips.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,770
So I'm going to go in I'm going to hit lume tricolour.

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,490
I'm going to grab that main color correction filter.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,550
And what I'm going to do is now that I have the effect laid over the entire timeline with no parameters

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,540
adjusted yet.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:49,770
Now I can go and cut where the major changes in scenery and exposure are going to be.

30
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,950
And we already kind of did that marking earlier by changing the colors of what's in our timeline.

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,140
So I know that all of this is going to be a very similar exposure.

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,730
It's shot in the same location.

33
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,720
If I make a cut here, I know that all of this, again, is going to be a very similar exposure because

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,570
this is a grouping of the same parts of the house.

35
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,750
Now, I'm going to go here and we'll take it to OK.

36
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,030
So here's where we go, outdoor.

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,720
So right here, all these should be bedroom bathroom yet, OK.

38
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,450
And then we go to here, we're outdoor and then we go to this nighttime transition.

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,800
So we're going to create.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,570
Oh, I forgot about that.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,490
OK, we got to do our nighttime transition.

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,950
We'll do that after this process.

43
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,560
So we have our adjustment layers ready to go.

44
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,060
And now it's time to go ahead and start fine tuning these clips.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,750
Now, this is a pretty good look and exposure.

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,980
We have enough definition in the dark parts of the frame where it's not too dark, but it's not too

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,530
bright where it looks, not to where it looks kind of boring, you know, but we don't want to go for

48
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,370
a light.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,380
We're not going to do a lot for this type of project, because if we take a beautiful house and we start

50
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,160
dropping on, you know, these kind of preset custom lights, it's going to start.

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,650
You don't want to do that too much on this kind of project because you want things as they are.

52
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,770
Like that looks really cool.

53
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,540
If it was more of a music video.

54
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,970
Right.

55
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,330
So always keeping in mind what type of project it is.

56
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,500
You may have a certain, you know, love that you love that works for all your projects.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,670
But if you hired by a client and you needed to create a clean, bright looking space, it's not going

58
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,110
to work.

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,900
And so we've talked about it before, but the coloring is what gives your footage the feeling.

60
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,110
So this is a very like called Iron Man kind of vibe if I go to just pick a random different one.

61
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,590
This is very black and white looks, old school.

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,830
It's the same exact house.

63
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,360
We're not changing the location.

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,720
This is more of a western kind of feel, you know.

65
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,240
So that's like more of a nighttime.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,070
Now, this looks like almost nighttime footage.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,780
So we don't want to create that type of personality for this kind of project.

68
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,610
We want to let our footage speak for itself.

69
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,780
We want it to look nice and be realistic, not overly stylized.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,380
OK, good.

71
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,560
So we got that out of the way.

72
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,110
Now, a good thing to do, though, is to definitely start with bring up the saturation for a project

73
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,520
like this.

74
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,770
We want everything to look vibrant and inviting and almost, you know, healthy in a certain way.

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,830
We don't want to have a black and White House with no color, no sky, no green plants.

76
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,060
People aren't going to be interested in purchasing that first showcase video.

77
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:46,070
So instantly, just by boosting up the saturation, 75 points, that's looking pretty good.

78
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,500
This one doesn't not need a whole lot of work.

79
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:56,040
I can bring up the exposure just one point, you know, maybe two points and a little bit more saturations.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,020
Go to 185.

81
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,470
OK.

82
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,270
And that's looking great, OK?

83
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,020
These are really easy, these other shots, I think they're going to need a little bit more help.

84
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,420
So we go into the house.

85
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,030
Okay.

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,570
OK, so I see a big exposure difference.

87
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,800
So we'll deal with that separately.

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,980
But let's focus here and let's bring up the exposure.

89
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,040
Let's say point five.

90
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:22,910
OK.

91
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,280
And let's bring up the shadows because we can see all these dark parts of the image here.

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,520
Right.

93
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,140
That's not a good look.

94
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,840
When you really want to show something off and you want it to look pretty nice and clean.

95
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:36,990
Right.

96
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,290
So let's go ahead and see what that looks like.

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,000
And let's bring up the s the excuse me, the saturation.

98
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,140
OK.

99
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,560
OK, so without with without, with.
