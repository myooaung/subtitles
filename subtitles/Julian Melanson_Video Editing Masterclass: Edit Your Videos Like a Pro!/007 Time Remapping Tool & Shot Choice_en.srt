1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,350
What I'm going to do is because I want this to get sooner to this, OK, so if I can lock this track.

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,920
I wanted to transition on this sound boom right there, so I'm going to hit a marker so we have a marker

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,290
right there, and I want the transition to be here, which is this marker.

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,710
So we're going to bring up our time remapping tool and we're going to do a little ninja work here.

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to speed.

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,300
Actually, I want to create two key frames.

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,940
Boom, boom.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,180
I'm going to speed up this center area.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,040
Just like that.

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,460
And kind of smooth this out.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,630
Oh, who?

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,810
OK, it's a little bit late.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,180
Not bad.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,710
OK, so you see how we have slow pacing at the intro.

15
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,560
Any song that you choose is going to have an intro, an exciting part, a mellow part.

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,700
Well, OK, any any song that you choose is going to have an intro, a build, exciting part, a mellow

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,120
part, another build, and then another exciting part, then an outro.

18
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,790
So what we're doing here is we're following that kind of template of our intro here.

19
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,440
And as the excitement builds, we go into the higher paced shots with more movement.

20
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,940
OK, so this one's a little bit late, Ionescu, this over.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,830
Shh, shh.

22
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,360
OK, we're going to do the same thing here now because we're working with content that's already been

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,050
exported.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,770
If we had the raw video files we were working with, which you can do it that way, you can drag in

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,840
the files directly from, you know, the other project.

26
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,240
But it's more time consuming.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,830
We don't really do we really need to be that specific and that precise for this edit.

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,960
So that's why I'm using the time remapping tool so that we can speed up where the cuts are, where we

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,540
need.

30
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,710
Now, I don't want to have too many of these style shots from one video back to back in the demo.

31
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,710
Really, you kind of want to have multiple shots sprinkled in with each other, you know, because you're

32
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,100
showing a variance of your different skills.

33
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,550
Right.

34
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,600
So let's move on to a different set of footage.

35
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to pull over the rest of our shots.

36
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,150
And we're only 20 seconds in and we're starting to look pretty good.

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,350
So let's just take a second to look back at what we've done so far.

38
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,010
OK, cool.

39
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,990
So there is a few little things in there I would change, I'm going to move that over.

40
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,780
OK.

41
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,530
And there's a noise here.

42
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,480
It's like the doom, doom, doom.

43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,070
And I want to have something cool for that.

44
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,680
So I'm going to just scroll through and see.

45
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,850
What would match up with that noise?

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,100
Boom, boom, boom.

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,240
Let's see if this if we can get this to match up.

48
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,750
I don't know if that's going to work, but let's give it a try.

49
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,490
And let's bring it over.

50
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,130
And let's face it in.

51
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,910
OK, so actually, yeah, let's grab this shot and put it in front.

52
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,610
I'm going to hold all I actually command and drag it in.

53
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,200
OK.

54
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,080
Let's see.

55
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,670
And let's move this over as well.

56
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,900
So all I did there was held command and pushed these back.

57
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,830
So.

58
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,750
Let's move this over slightly.

59
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,000
And.

60
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,340
OK, so I think we're going to get something here.

61
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,910
Let's watch your back.

62
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,060
OK, that's pretty cool.

63
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,710
Now I'm cool with that.

64
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,380
We're about 30 seconds into the edit in the next edit, we're going to continue to refine our first

65
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,220
rough edit.
