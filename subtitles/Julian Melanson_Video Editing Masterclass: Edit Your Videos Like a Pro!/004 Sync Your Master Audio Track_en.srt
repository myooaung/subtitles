1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,310
So now that we have all of our clips synched up, the next step is to drag our audio that we're actually

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,900
going to be using for the edit.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:18,030
So let's go to the same point of the audio track and mark the same point that we marked for all of other

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,840
video files.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,310
So as towards the end.

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,190
So it's that point right there, it m for marker.

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,950
And now that we don't need any of these audio files, we can go ahead and select all the audio files

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,580
hit delete.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:52,940
We still have the markers here as a reference, and we can drag our audio in line up the marker.

10
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,270
And if we did everything right, this should be synched up.

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,700
That's looking, seems to me so we've done a good job so far.

12
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,640
Now what I want to do is trim some of the excess clips that we don't need.

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,970
So we're going to go to the beginning of our actual audio file.

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,690
And I'm going to hit see to bring up the blade tool.

15
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,970
And I'm going to hold shift before I do the normal cut that we've been doing throughout the course.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,500
What that's going to do is rather than making a cut on one single layer at a time when I hold shift

17
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:43,010
and click, that's going to make a scene cut across all the layers, which is really handy in this kind

18
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,170
of scenario, because we've got quite a few layers that we're working with here now that I've made the

19
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,520
cut on all of those layers.

20
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,670
I'm going to highlight them in a tweet.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,360
Then we can simply right click repl delete to fill that empty space.

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,040
Now we can do the same thing at the end.

23
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,900
OK, go to the end.

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,410
I'm going to proceed for the blade to hold, shift and click.

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,610
There we go.

26
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,460
We have all the clips and we're going to get to the end.

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,550
And this will be a good time to create a backup sequence.

28
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:30,820
OK, so that way we have all of our Selex pulled in together and then it'd be nice and safe.

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,160
So let's go to our sequence.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,730
Let's hit Comanche and hit Command V to duplicate it.

31
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,220
Let's go ahead and name this backup.

32
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,180
OK.

33
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,030
Drag it back into the sequences folder.

34
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,130
And now we're ready to start cutting together our rough edit.
