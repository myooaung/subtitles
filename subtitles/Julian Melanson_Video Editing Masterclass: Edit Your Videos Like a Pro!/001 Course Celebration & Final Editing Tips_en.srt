1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:10,050
OK, so we have made it to the final chapter of this cause, I mean, what a huge event, a journey

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,640
this has been for both of us, for me, putting together all this content, working with you to help

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,700
you create these new videos and all these new techniques.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,180
And this is this news, this celebration, actually.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,430
Let's see what we got.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,880
Hmm.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,880
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,280
OK.

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,170
OK.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,820
Yes.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,900
Super excited that you made it all the way to the end through the hours of content, information that

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,600
we shared and literally hundreds of video lessons, tons of information, tons of stuff to absorb.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,620
So pat yourself on the back.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,840
Amazing job for making it all the way to the final chapter.

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:03,930
Now, I just have a few more slides of just kind of final tips and techniques that I want to give before

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,640
we conclude this journey and finish the process.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,830
Now, like I mentioned, I just have a few final editing tips.

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,950
I kind of, you know, said this a little bit before, but you always want to take time off your edits.

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,890
You want to take all these techniques we've learned together.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,680
And then when you are in the refining phase, you want to take time away from your edit.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,460
Close the computer for a little bit and try to remove your personal bias when you're watching your videos,

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,740
because after you've seen it so many times, you have a very clear expectation of where the cuts are,

23
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,010
what the sounds are, and what to expect next.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,570
And a side effect of that is you can also become kind of attached to certain shots for you.

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,040
They took a lot of time to pull off.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,980
Whether that took a lot of time in the filming phase, you know, of the hours of struggle that it took

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:09,000
for you to get that shot or whether it took time of hours and struggle in the editing phase to create

28
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,220
that specific sequence.

29
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,660
We don't necessarily know or it doesn't necessarily carry that much weight for the person watching it.

30
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,700
So even though you have a very strong attachment to certain shots, we want to remove that and watch

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,780
our videos as clear and with as much clarity as possible.

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,870
And when you're doing this, ask for feedback before releasing your video, because like I mentioned,

33
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,390
you kind of become blind, deaf to a lot of this stuff.

34
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,010
So I always, you know, send out my rough edits to certain groups of friends that I know I can trust.

35
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,510
They have a good creative eye.

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:53,010
They have a certain amount of respect in their own field and that they know what a quality project should

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,540
look like.

38
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,640
So find those friends, find those family members that you can trust to give you honest, constructive

39
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,120
criticism and positive feedback on your projects.

40
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,340
Because once you hit the upload button and you hit the pause button, it's there.

41
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,010
Of course, you can delete it and take it down if there is mistakes that you find out that you see later

42
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,610
on in the process.

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,880
But the goal is not to do that.

44
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,140
You know, when someone releases a feature film, they're not like, oh, yeah, yeah, you know, I

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,190
got to take that back.

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,200
It's when it's done, it's done.

47
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,500
And that's how it should be, so that you can move on to the next video, which should be twice as exciting,

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,870
twice as inspiring, and twice as high of a production quality.

49
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:44,400
So what you want to do with all of this is to explore it like we did in the previous chapter, is export

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,430
and view your edit outside of your editing software, do it on your iPhone, do it on a different computer,

51
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,420
whatever it is.

52
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:59,340
And then we do that same exact process of taking mental notes and writing down the timestamps with changes

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,910
needed.
