00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.820
And the final important one in here that I want to show you is the hue versus Luma.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.720
Now, what this is going to do is it's going to go in and not change the saturation or the hue, but

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.500
it's going to change the intensity of brightness, the Lumines right.

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.970
Of a specific color.

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.900
So with our greens, if I go here, select greens bring up the intensity.

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.720
We can bring up the exposure selectively on our greens or bring it down.

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.380
Right.

8
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:48.260
So pretty cool and pretty unique, and it gives you a lot of coloring and stylizing capabilities to

9
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.010
work with.

10
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.820
Now I'm going to bring down these greens a little bit because it's a little too saturated, and I want

11
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.860
to finish adding our final refinement layers.

12
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:10.640
So I think overall, we can kind of make this even more tan and warm by boosting our temperature.

13
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.580
Now, what this is going to do is as I pull and boost up the temperature, we're going to start to go

14
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.820
to more of a warm summer day versus down as a more cold winter day.

15
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.360
OK, so we're going to reset that to zero and we're just going to boost this a little bit.

16
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.310
Let's see, maybe 10.

17
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.520
We can say that's we can see that's with the boost without with without with.

18
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.400
We just want to subtly give even a little bit more warmth to our image.

19
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:51.000
To really make it feel like a warm summery forest, because that is the vibe and emotion that we are

20
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.950
wanting to convey in the final product, the emotion, and that we're wanting our viewer to feel when

21
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.330
they're watching the final video.

22
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.600
Now, let's say that some of these shots are looking perfect and we're ready to export.

23
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.110
But there's a few in here that aren't really doing it.

24
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:17.130
This catches my eye because her skin tone and really a lot of this image is has a little bit of that

25
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.430
gray tone that we don't want when we get to the next image.

26
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.410
This is looking good.

27
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.420
OK, this one as well.

28
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
I'm really liking the exposure, the contrast and saturation.

29
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.430
But this first one, it's a little bit dull.

30
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.310
So what I'm going to do is bring out our blade tool.

31
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.560
I'm going to select our adjustment layer.

32
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.910
I'm going to cut where this clip is that we want to change.

33
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.500
And I'm going to leave the rest of this one, because the way this adjustment layer is affecting the

34
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.330
rest of these clips is perfect.

35
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.500
We just want to change the way it's affecting this first clip.

36
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.920
So I'm going to highlight the cut that we made.

37
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.680
And I'm going to boost some of the contrast, 15 points.

38
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.530
I'm going to bring up a little bit of exposure because it's looking a little bit on the darker side.

39
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:18.030
And now I'm going to bring up some of the vibrance to add more intensity to the colors in our video.

40
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.170
So we're bring that up 20 points, OK, very subtly, just suggesting it and now go into the next shot.

41
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.990
OK, that's looking a lot better.

42
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.360
We still want to increase a little bit on our contrast.

43
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.890
Which is going to make the dark's in the image darker and the bright in the image brighter.

44
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.790
And let's do just five more points of saturation.

45
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.960
Let's hit play.

46
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.970
Perfect, that's looking a lot better.

47
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.500
Now, these images all really match.

48
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.040
Let's see if there's any more standouts, OK?

49
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:10.200
This one is looking like it can use some more depth in the dark parts of the frame as well, because

50
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.840
this looks great contrast saturation.

51
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.760
This one's looking a little bit gray.

52
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.720
So let's do our same technique as we did on that first clip.

53
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:31.020
Bring out a blade tool, cut our adjustment layer selectively just above this green clip that we want

54
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.180
to change the parameters on.

55
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.120
Let's bring down some of these shadows to create a little bit more depth in the dark parts of the frame.

56
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.190
Let's add a little bit more saturation.

57
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.170
To bring up the colors in the overall image and now let's see.

58
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.660
OK, great.

59
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.590
That's looking pretty good.

60
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.000
Of course, I could spend more time fine tuning this, but I want to keep moving forward here so we

61
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.400
can get into some more important techniques.
