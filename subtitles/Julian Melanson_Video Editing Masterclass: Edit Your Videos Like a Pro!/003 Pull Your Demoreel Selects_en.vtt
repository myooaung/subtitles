WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.930
And now that we've gathered all of our past projects that we want to showcase, we brought them into

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.630
our editing software and we drop them into the timeline and created the proper sequence settings.

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.110
Now it's time to pass Selex.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.810
Once we do that, we're going to create a rough edit and then we're going to refine and make a really

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.800
great looking at it.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.060
So what we're going to do in this step is basically I want to color all these clips and we'll do more

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.290
coloring and labeling later.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:37.920
But I know for a fact I want these separate from the drone footage, because it's going to be kind of

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.650
two separate videos in one if we can pull that off.

10
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.800
So I'm going to do that right away.

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:50.650
And because this is a demo reel, we're not going to be using any of the audio from these past projects.

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.710
We just want to use the visuals.

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.600
I forgot to mention that we're going to choose a track after we pull the Selex.

14
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.800
And we're going to.

15
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.100
Yeah.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.709
Choose a few different music options to find one that fits the best, using the tech needs, using the

17
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.080
techniques that we learned early in the course.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.820
So let's go ahead and remove the audio from these videos.

19
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.150
Were not going to be using that.

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.360
We're going to be using a musical track throughout the whole video.

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.260
And actually, you know what?

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.310
As far as the drone footage goes, I believe there's one in here that I do want to keep the audio.

23
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:40.160
Yeah, because this one has really cool sound of nature, sounds, atmosphere, sounds, the ocean,

24
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.440
air, everything.

25
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.280
So let's go ahead and keep that.

26
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:59.720
And now what I'm going to do is go through and start just kind of scrubbing because we got an hour of

27
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.070
content to work with here.

28
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.950
We want to get that hour down to like three minutes because we don't want to create a demo reel.

29
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.970
That's more than three minutes.

30
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.140
And in today's day and age, we want it to be more towards like a minute, a minute and a half.

31
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.890
So I'm just going to scrub through and I'm going to start looking for shots that either remember I know

32
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.190
I want to use or that catch my eye when I see it.

33
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:36.240
So you should have a pretty good memory of your footage and your past projects, so I know from this

34
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.480
past project, this was a trailer for a course that I did.

35
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.440
And I know I really liked these two shots.

36
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.200
I don't know if I'm going to use them, but and this is just the outro.

37
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.230
If I was a motion graphic editor, I wanted to display motion graphics and I would, you know, grab

38
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.800
this part.

39
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.700
And keep that and then delete the rest.

40
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.910
So what I just did was I grabbed these two shots and I grabbed this shot, and now we can go ahead and

41
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.080
label this so that we know these are from one project.

42
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.120
Now I'm a step forward here.

43
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.190
OK, we have this cool opening shot.

44
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.160
Let's go ahead and hit there.

45
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.450
Boom.

46
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.430
And just because you grab one shot doesn't mean you need to keep the whole thing.

47
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.950
I'm going to make a cut right here.

48
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.280
Even though this shot continues to extend, we don't really need all that.

49
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.030
None of these shots are going to last more than, you know, two to three seconds on screen.

50
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.250
So that's something to keep in mind.

51
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.380
It's really boom, boom, boom.

52
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.790
Fast pacing.

53
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.710
Keeping the shots moving forward.

54
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.120
Now, I remember this project and there's a shot.

55
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.450
This one I like, um, and cut it, OK?

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.830
I'm pretty sure the rest of it we're not going to use yet.

57
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.720
This was a video for a meditation retreat.

58
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.850
So, boom, we're good.

59
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.800
OK, great.

60
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.370
Now we're out a music video.

61
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.540
So let's skip forward here and sorry if I'm scrubbing through this quickly.

62
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:24.490
But like I said, I'm so familiar with these past projects because I saw them again and again and again

63
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.500
and again from version zero to version 10 on some of these projects.

64
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.760
So apologies for scrubbing fast, but I know this is a great shot.

65
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.230
And we go.

66
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.200
Zoom into the camera, OK?

67
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.610
Boom.

68
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.620
Let's go ahead and cut right there.

69
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.510
I'm going to label these.

70
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.610
So I'm pulling the Selex.

71
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.480
I'm labeling the different footage from different projects, different colors, so that it's easier

72
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.840
to scrub through when we get to the next process.

73
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.340
Now, let's go ahead and let's go here.

74
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.950
Yeah, I love that shot.

75
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.170
Okay.

76
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.980
Make a cut right there and boom, love it.

77
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.900
OK, boom.

78
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.770
Cut right there.

79
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.290
No, no.

80
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.460
Yeah, this was a music video for a client.

81
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.330
What was it called?

82
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.600
Oh, this was called Free Men.

83
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.960
Yeah.

84
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.150
So the idea that we came up with was to have all of these different warriors and soldiers from different

85
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.840
eras.

86
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.690
And the song itself is about ending war, ending fighting each other.

87
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.320
So we took all these different famous kind of soldiers that you read about in history, books like Red

88
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.310
Jacket, Red Coats, Indians, Samurai's, Different Soldiers from different years.

89
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.850
Oh, US Army, you know, modern, more modern army.

90
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.040
A business woman, a Sikh.

91
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.240
All these different kind of people.

92
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.660
And we put them in one room to share and show that they're not just different people, that they're

93
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.670
not just, you know, words on a page.

94
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.870
These are actually real people that we read about in so-and-so or 10000 people died.

95
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.450
You read that.

96
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.990
OK, I'm getting too deep into this.

97
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.760
So let's move on.

98
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.670
We got some good shots from there now.

99
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.300
Okay, cool.

100
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:31.170
We have this Athletes in Fashion Project, which was about NBA stars and their fashion style and what

101
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.470
they did off the court.

102
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.600
So these are all good.

103
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.660
Um oh.

104
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.010
There's this one shoe shop.

105
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.240
Yeah.

106
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.750
So we don't need like this is a good example.

107
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.540
There's a cool little sequence here, boom, boom.

108
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.750
But we don't need these don't mean anything.

109
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:56.010
But when we see like a product or something that's recognizable, that can catch people's attention.

110
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.690
Now, we have I remember this kind of cool mini montage here.

111
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.570
Oh, yeah, I love that shot.

112
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.480
OK, everything looks so good in slow motion.

113
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.660
OK, but let's keep it moving here because you can be here for a long time.

114
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.630
I'm not really going to grab any motion graphics.

115
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.840
That's not something that I focus on or that I feel like I need to showcase in my personal demo reel.

116
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.640
So even though a lot of these videos have different graphics, I'm going to take that out and label

117
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.820
it.

118
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.740
It's own specific color.

119
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:36.060
And I'm going to continue to go through and pull these Selex while you're pulling your selects as well.

120
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:42.210
And in the next video lesson, we're going to start our rough edit face and choosing our music.

121
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.410
So I will see you there.
