1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,390
I want to show you how to take a screen cap and add footage into that screen cap to create something

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,980
that wasn't originally there.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,350
So let's hop over the screen cap, OK?

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,450
Is it a screen Gaffigan?

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,850
Inception, right.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,470
Let's hop over to the screen cap I'm doing right now.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,900
And then we'll talk about editing a different screen cap.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,820
So what makes a poem?

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:29,280
A poem is supposed to be in paragraphs and prose can utilize the concrete space on the page.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,620
Then what defines a poem?

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,960
You actually get to answer that question.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,710
OK, cool.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,800
So we have this first screen capture.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,480
Now, all I did was I use quick time on my laptop.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:50,320
I went to the client's website and I clicked on one of the videos on their course dashboard.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,170
So that's this clip right here.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,940
If we zoom into this clip we have.

18
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,130
The page loading, scrolling down, and then my mouse goes over and clicks.

19
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,410
Now I added a color mat on top of this one, just like for the other one, because when you're logged

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,680
in to the Web site, it shows an icon of your profile picture.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,720
We don't want that for this kind of video.

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,560
So a color mat is a really great way to get around that.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,220
And so basically, I just scaled down and moved it over to just cover that part of the image.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,090
If I wanted to change the color of this karamat, I'd double click it and I could put it to anything.

25
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,090
But what I did was I double clicked it.

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,050
I hit the eyedropper tool and I went to the color that I wanted to cover and I hit boom and then hit,

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,440
OK.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,830
Now what we have is this moment.

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,330
OK.

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,420
And you can kind of see actually skip forward here.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,370
So we have the original screen cap.

32
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,710
I think this is the clicking boom.

33
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,950
I think it took me a minute to like click.

34
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,190
I don't know what what was going on, but I just scooted over a bit of a screen cap to make the clicking

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,760
sooner.

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,010
Now, let's back up a little bit.

37
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,240
And we have this.

38
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,080
Now, what I did here was a nested this sequence.

39
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,670
Again, we're starting to really love nesting because of the cool things we can do with it.

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,950
And I used it to, again, create a little bit more camera movement.

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,280
You can see up in the top these key frames that are going on.

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:31,640
We're scaling up our image and we're also going to the left part of the frame, which is where the mouse

43
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,310
goes, because that just creates a little bit more movement and it makes it feel less stagnant.

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,800
We have all these moving shots and interesting shots.

45
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,020
And then if you come to a very bland still screenshot, it can get a little boring.

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:54,650
So I really recommend you always add some kind of zoom pan motion to your screen grabs or screen captures.

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:02,300
Now we go to this next shot and it shows, you know, going from clicking on the video to then going

48
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,710
to an example video.

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,420
And we have a zoom in like we've already been talking about these key frames at the top.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
We're zooming in here.

51
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,430
But if I don't click this, let's break this down.

52
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,420
We have our top layer fixing the top part that we don't need.

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,520
And then we have this middle layer right here.

54
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,870
And then we have our background layer, which is our main screen capture.

55
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,560
So as you can see, we have all these different shots.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,110
They weren't really there.

57
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,480
This is what was actually there.

58
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,680
So what I did was I took raw footage that I had.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:45,390
I scaled it down properly so that it covered the actual screen where video should be playing.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:57,860
And I added these bero shots that made it look like these footage, these shots were actually on the

61
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,180
client's Web site.

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,850
So I grab the screen cap shots.

63
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,100
I ordered them where I wanted them to go.

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,480
And then I nested them by going like this hitting nest.

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,690
And that's what created this nested sequence.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,339
Then I could scale all of them down globally and move them into the proper placement.

67
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:28,070
So instead of having this, let's go back to our edit and utilize the page.

68
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,920
Then it turned into this and utilize the concrete space on the page.

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,420
Then what defines a whole huge difference, right?

70
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,550
Huge difference.

71
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,260
So one last thing I want to mention as well is just this little subtle mouse click you can utilize.

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,670
I don't know if you can hear it with this audio.

73
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,510
I can hear really clearly just a little sound.

74
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,090
I went and I downloaded the apple mouse keyboard click.

75
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:11,190
Just that little sound to further sell that this is really happening and this is what the experience

76
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,200
would be like for a student or a customer actually using the website.

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,760
So with all those things together, the movement that we added to this kind of footage, the sound design

78
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,190
that we added on the bottom, the zooming and then the adding of B roll on top of a screen cap.

79
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:36,300
That's what made this quick sequence just that much more professional and that much more entertaining

80
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,170
to watch.
