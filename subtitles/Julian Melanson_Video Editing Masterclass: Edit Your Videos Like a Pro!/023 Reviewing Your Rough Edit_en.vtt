00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.300
So as I'm going through and you can see we're kind of speeding through this process of taking all the

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.380
Selex that we've made.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.580
And now I'm cutting it and sinking it up to different words and different sentences of my voice over

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.580
this process.

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.200
This could be a little bit tedious, but really the takeaway here is that we're using the important

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.310
clips that we set aside for our edit and were simply scrunching everything down into a much faster pace

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.420
montage similar to what we did with the opening the boxes sequence in a previous learning lesson.

8
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.930
But instead of doing that to the sound in the clips, we're doing it to the sound of the voiceover.

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.550
And now that the edit is at a pretty good place, I just want to kind of play through a couple of parts

10
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.760
here.

11
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.360
Now, we got it down to ten minutes, just over ten minutes.

12
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.360
So I'm going to skip through and just kind of play a few parts so you can get a feel for what the visuals

13
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.330
are looking like for what the voiceover is sounding like.

14
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.230
And then we're going to go in and start adding our layer of music and a few other refining tips.

15
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.260
So I'm going to skip ahead to, let's say.

16
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.490
And that leads us to the Christmas phase.

17
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.330
This is going to be where you're at your peak of overwhelm during this process, because you're going

18
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
to end up with a bunch of packages at your house when you don't even really remember what you ordered,

19
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.090
but there's just a bunch of boxes.

20
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.160
So I use this room to create a cool little montage with a really pointy object.

21
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.410
And after putting any band aids on, so that's kind of how our montage got together, we were able to

22
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.650
use it at a specific part that made total sense for the video.

23
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.170
So let's continue to play it through.

24
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.820
And after putting any band aids on for minor cuts and scratches from that last montage.

25
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.360
Now it is time for our initial test shots instead of beads.

26
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.400
So what you want to do is grab your most important equipment.

27
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.980
Mine's going to be my key, like my main lighting source, a camera at my desk, in my chair.

28
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.640
And I'm going to kind of move things around in my studio to find out what's going to be the best location

29
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.370
in the backdrop.

30
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.470
So you can continue to move things around, wave your hands around, do a little bit of a dance.

31
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.550
And after all of the testing, just move things back to where you figure they're going to be in the

32
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.210
first place.

33
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.260
But now that we've done that, we have our set up ready to go.

34
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.540
And all we have to worry about in the future is sitting down and hitting record because we know we're

35
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.270
maximizing our space because we did these test shots.

36
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.040
And now that we've done that, it's time to second guess all the decisions we made up to this point.

37
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.270
So you can see that there's cutting at big moments of what's happening in the voiceover.

38
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.190
So you can kind of read the audio here that you can almost see just from looking at how this looks right

39
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.350
here, that there might be a cut there.

40
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.980
And there is.

41
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.240
And then this is a big peak.

42
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.070
So these are intonations.

43
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.430
These are changes in speech.

44
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.910
These are new sentences.

45
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.050
These are changes in thought and me making different points.

46
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.860
And that just kind of happens to line up with when the volume of someone's voice might change.

47
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.090
So that's something to keep an eye on and something to keep in mind when you're deciding when should

48
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.270
I make a cut, when should I edit, when should I change my shot?

49
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.950
That's something to keep in mind.

50
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:47.200
These cuts are literally matching up with the specific kind of packets of speech that I have these to

51
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
line up with this sentence.

52
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.200
Let's see what it was.

53
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.300
So you can continue to move things around, wave your hands around, do a little bit of a dance.

54
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.880
Right.

55
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.920
So I'm always showing what the vocals are saying.

56
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.560
That might be obvious to you, but it may not.

57
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.770
It's really kind of so obvious that it's not obvious.

58
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.560
I see a lot of people who create videos.

59
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.370
They're not showing things that the music or the vocals are telling what should be shown.

60
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.100
They're speaking about something, but they're showing something else.

61
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.570
So it's almost so obvious that it's maybe overlooked.

62
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.580
I'm not quite sure why not many people do it.

63
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.510
And if we kind of skip forward, let's just look at maybe one more example before we get into updating

64
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.380
the audio.

65
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.120
We don't have a whole lot of time for that, because now it is our building process.

66
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.210
This is where we get to the listing's marks and things, drills and things use a cool laser thing.

67
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.660
And ideally, by the end of this process, we've shown these things on the wall and they are staying

68
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.050
on the wall and voila, there we go.

69
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.960
Now we have our shelves in the background and we put some lights on in the background to see how things

70
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.910
are starting to come together, which leads us to our painting and styling phase.

71
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.890
So you can kind of see how these chapters they're changing.

72
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.430
And so what's going to be taught in each one of these little mini chapters of this 10 minute video is

73
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.210
going to be likely possibly a new song.

74
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.300
So we're going to get into some tips here and some techniques around using multiple tracks, which I

75
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.210
set aside some already that we'll go through together.

76
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.430
These are going to create a 10 minute video that really feels more like a four or five minute video,

77
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.520
because we're going to change the music so often.

78
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.590
It's really going to make a brand new start and the beginning to our video.

79
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.380
But let's not get ahead of ourselves yet.

80
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:54.280
And let's first get into a technique on how to use reverb in a strategic way in the next learning lesson.
