00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,340
So there actually is one final edition that I wanted to do before we export this and watch our masterpiece

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,800
now.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:16,260
I've already explained it in previous chapters, but I did go through and add a warp stabilizer filter

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,020
to the shots that needed it.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,690
All this footage is pretty dang smooth because it was shot on a gimbal.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,280
So there's just a few little bumps and shakes here and there.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,050
But if you want to know more about the warp stabilizer, how to use it, how to refine it.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Check the lectures in the previous chapters.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,750
But for this lesson, what I wanted to focus on is we did a great job creating our transition.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,150
But if I let it play and I watch it back, you know, there's something missing when there's something

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,310
that is kind of a drastic train change or a unique part of the video.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,800
We've learned this before.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,540
And what it is, is that it helps to have an audio cue, an audio sound effects, something that goes

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,810
along with the effect or the visual that someone is seeing.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,739
So if we hit play.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,290
Right, so it matches up with a point in the song where the rhythm or the pacing changes, which is

17
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:32,840
perfect, but it's needing a little something because it's kind of out of the blue.

18
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,330
There's no real there's no special effects in the rest of the video or transitions.

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:45,760
So what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and find a swoosh audio transition that's going

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,560
to help tell the story of this cool transition that we created.

21
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,910
So I'm going to just kind of scroll through and whichever when I do end up using, I'll drop in the

22
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,680
student downloads so that you can also drop it in to your showcase edit.

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:08,520
And I'm just looking for a slow, elegant, like aush kind of transition.

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,560
OK, these are all a little bit too fast.

25
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,820
I mean.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,270
Let's try this one.

27
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,330
Let's go ahead and drag this in, so I'm going to take this one.

28
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,710
It's going to need some work.

29
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,290
It's definitely not perfect.

30
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,560
But let's go ahead and drag this in and let's just see.

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,490
OK, so we're definitely going to slow this down.

32
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,830
So I'm going to slow it down and say 60 percent.

33
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,090
And let's turn down our music track just a little bit.

34
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,930
And I'm going to slow down even more to 30 percent.

35
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,480
OK, let's turn off our transition.

36
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,040
That's too much.

37
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,110
OK, that's looking and sounding a lot better.

38
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,580
Let's check that out one more time.

39
00:04:49,830 --> 00:05:00,390
OK, and if we want to add even more of a reverb to it, to really kind of fill in and sustain the effect

40
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,160
a little bit more and create a little bit more personality, we can add a studio reverb.

41
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,180
I love the Great Hall preset.

42
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:14,420
I generally turn the room size like all the way up, turn the decay higher, which makes it last longer.

43
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,110
It's the tail end of the effect.

44
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,930
Turn up the dry, which is the sound effect itself.

45
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,110
And the wet is the effect and reverb layered on top of the sound effect.

46
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,570
We can turn down the dampening, turn down the diffusion.

47
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,740
That means the effect is going to be more sustained as well.

48
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,630
And when you dampen something or you diffuse something, you kind of spread it out, split it up and

49
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,570
make it less.

50
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,670
So we don't want to do that.

51
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,380
Let's now take a listen.

52
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,440
OK, that's pretty cool.

53
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,920
So if you could hear that what happened was a hit play.

54
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,350
That's a little bit too long so we can turn our dampening and diffusion up a little bit, bring our

55
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,600
room size down, bring our DeKay down, so it's going to shorten the amount of the effect.

56
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,100
OK, now.

57
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,100
Let's see that we want to sustain this effect and we don't want it to end abruptly at the end of this

58
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,460
clip.

59
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:31,250
We can duplicate the clip, turn the volume all the way down, select our studio reverb.

60
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,680
Copy it and remove it from this effect right now, it's going to make sense in a second.

61
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,750
I'm going to highlight both of these clips.

62
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm going to right click.

63
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm going to nest these clips.

64
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,700
Now we have the same exact sound effect, but extended the clip.

65
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,610
And if I paste back the studio, reverb back on.

66
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,660
Now, let's listen.

67
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,090
It gets to extend without dropping away, because the clip did not end what we did, there was a little

68
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:15,360
bit of protip, oh my God, the pro tips was a little bit of a pro tip to extend the clips so that all

69
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,670
of a sudden the reverb

70
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,260
doesn't just end abruptly.

71
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,480
So now let's hear it with our soundtrack.

72
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,400
Perfect.

73
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:43,150
Now, what I'm going to do is export our final edit and we're going to get a chance to look back at

74
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,840
what we did.
