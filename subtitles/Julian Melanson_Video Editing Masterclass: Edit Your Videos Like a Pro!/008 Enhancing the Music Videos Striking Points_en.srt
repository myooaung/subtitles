1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,780
So let's go to Fusion.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,600
Think.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,270
Thank God.

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,350
So we have the biggest striking point of the entire video.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,340
This big booming chorus of our track.

6
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,530
Now, we built up to that by doing some time remapping, speeding up these cool, sparkly shots, which,

7
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,660
you know, technically this shot could be considered kind of unusable.

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,460
It's out of focus.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,340
It's really messy, you know, and it's really not all that useful on its own.

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:08,130
But if we listen to the track and we see how that visual lines up with the track, it actually did a

11
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,850
pretty good job.

12
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:21,510
So we use that kind of, you know, fast camera movement to throw the viewer into this time remapped,

13
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,130
underwater shot.

14
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:35,410
So if I were to just kind of drag over this shot that's in focus and fine and no issues and very usable.

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,690
Let's see what that would have look like.

16
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,560
Right.

17
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,290
There's no camera movement, there's no like fast pace in this to it, so it doesn't really do anything

18
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,810
for the viewer to.

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,730
So these moments are key.

20
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,890
You don't want to throw away shots that, you know, would be quote unquote unusable in your edit because

21
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,900
you can do ninja type things of man.

22
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,150
I just remembered we're not doing perative slightly, OK?

23
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,500
This is a pirated throw it up.

24
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,190
Yes.

25
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,150
You don't want to throw away shots that initially you would think are unusable, because a lot of the

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,580
times, like I just said, you can do ninja things and ninja ways to speed up the shot, have it as

27
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,480
a really quick, quick cut away or use it with an added overlay like we're doing right here, which

28
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,260
is going to make it seem like it's the right shot at the right place.

29
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:42,910
Now, our trusty overlays are doing a really good job here of making the most exciting part of the video

30
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,180
feel exciting.

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,110
So if I take these away, let it play itself.

32
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,670
Looks good.

33
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,000
But with the overlays, here we go to.

34
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,840
And looks good, so as you can see, relinking our movement together to create a seamless flow between

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,490
all these shots.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,560
So movement, VOON, movement VOON, movement foom.

37
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,110
And then we go into her singing.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,090
So what I did here was I blended her singing Selex that we looked at we that we looked at at the very

39
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,260
beginning of this process.

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,820
Where is it?

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,590
Yet we have this.

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,670
So I blended this sequence together with.

43
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,100
The awesome underwater footage that we have.

44
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,400
And the fire footage.
