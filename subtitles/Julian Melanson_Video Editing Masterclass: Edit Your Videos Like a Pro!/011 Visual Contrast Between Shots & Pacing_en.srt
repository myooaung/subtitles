1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,970
So we have this opening shot, and I'm going to cut it right about there.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,740
It's interesting when we're looking at the waterfall, but then we start going over here too much.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,580
So it's cut it there.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,550
And let's just see, because I think this next shot that was kind of already placed there is pretty

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,600
interesting, too.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,290
It's pretty unique to see that, especially because it's really contrasting this first shot.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,080
So you want to keep in mind what you're editing.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,460
If you're editing something that you want to be like a travel video, that's really punchy.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,980
It's cool to have contrast, like an image with a lot of reds in it and then an image with a lot of

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,730
blues in it.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,360
OK, that's going to create more of a punch, Yoenis, an impact for the audience.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,060
So let's see how these two flow together.

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,420
OK, so I think I want to start this a little bit later.

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:09,300
And that is feeling like a pretty harsh cut because the audio is so drastic, but what we can do is

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,400
continue to bring down the audio on the really loud waterfall.

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,630
Let's let's keep that for now and let's keep moving forward.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,280
Well, really fine tune this audio, but let's try and get the right ordering and the right pacing for

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,540
our visuals here.

19
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,770
So this first shot is about four seconds, as you could see.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,560
And I want this to feel kind of like a story, kind of like turning pages in.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
You're going through the traveling trip that's going to kind of dictate the pacing.

22
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,170
Now, the pacing is the amount of frequency of cuts.

23
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:43,950
OK.

24
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,010
So if it's like boom, boom, boom, that's a pretty slow pace.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,680
If it was like this.

26
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,070
OK.

27
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,530
Boom, boom, boom.

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,530
So I don't mind the audio, but that's a much faster pace, which makes things feel a little bit more

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,850
moving forward, a little bit more acceleration, a little bit more energy, a little bit more of a

30
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,450
quickness.

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,380
OK, so let's continue to move forward here.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,450
Let's go ahead and cut that clip there.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,470
Looking back at this one, it doesn't really do a whole lot.

34
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,690
So I'm going to delete that.

35
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,100
This boomerang is cool, but it's a I want this to feel like a flow.

36
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,140
I want someone to be able to watch this video and flow through it like they went on the trip himself.

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,830
And this boomerang where it's going back and forth is not flowing for me.

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,450
So we're going to go and delete that.

39
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,210
And I want you to be making those same decisions as you're going through right now with your Roughan.

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,660
What is the purpose and the primary sensation feeling take away that you want the viewer to have?

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,350
And is the visual or audio that they're experiencing right now in your edit, giving them more of that

42
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:09,260
thing that you want them to receive, just like a chef is choosing certain food ingredients to bring

43
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,170
together little bit of salt, a little bit of pepper, a little bit of paprika, a little bit of cayenne,

44
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,280
you know, to spice things up.

45
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,540
If that's the kind of dish you want to make, make sure that all of your ingredients, which are your

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,250
edits, are creating that final dish that you want to create.

47
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,710
It's a nice analogy there.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,040
So let's keep it moving here.

49
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,440
That is far too loud.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,870
I'm not super feeling this one.

51
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,310
So let's go ahead and do eat that.

52
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,230
And of course, we have our back up.

53
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:42,530
So if we do want to go back and put that shot back in, once we have our rough edit, we will have that

54
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:42,890
there.

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,520
So.

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,000
OK, so we have two yellow shots here.

57
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,890
Oh, yeah, OK.

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,190
I really like this clip here.

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,670
It's got people in it.

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,900
It shows the environment.

61
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,930
I think there was already really good audio from it as well.

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,800
Yeah, you see, like it's not even going to take that much work to get it sounding good because the

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,210
audio is already really good.

64
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,170
OK.

65
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,490
I don't feel like we need this waterfall shot because we already have a shot in our edit that tells

66
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,150
that story.

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,720
So if you have some type of duplicate that's not really pushing your footage in your story or video

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,910
along further, it's going to take it out.

69
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,970
I do like these two shots.

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,130
I'm going to go ahead and hold on to them by pushing them to the back.

71
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,470
So what I just did right there is I highlighted the clips that I feel like I may use in this edit,

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,540
but they're not going to be happening at this place chronologically.

73
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,540
And I highlighted them and did command X, which is simply instead of copying, you're cutting it,

74
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,970
which is going to remove from the timeline.

75
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,290
And then I'm going to take the player head to the back of the timeline and paste it.

76
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,040
OK.

77
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,530
Now I'm going to triple delete and remove that extra space there.

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,720
And let's see what we have here.

79
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,790
I want to see what this shot will be like directly after this.

80
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:25,800
I like that there's kind of something to link them together, which is the trickling water sound.

81
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:32,890
That's something to kind of keep in mind when you're doing an edit this like this is you can blend things

82
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,050
together by having certain similarities.

83
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,590
Whether that's something similar that's in the frame, let's say you have two shots of a sunset and

84
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,890
you cut them together and the sun is in the same place on both shots or the camera movement is similar

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,940
on this shot.

86
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,800
When it's ending, the camera is going this way.

87
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,400
And on the next shot, the camera is doing the same thing.

88
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,000
So let's see what these two look like.

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,740
OK.

90
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,280
So I'm going to kind of scooch this over.

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,530
So I like how those two are cutting together because it's a similar camera movement and the audio in

92
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,290
the background is going to be similar when we do level that out.

93
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,890
And I like this linking together of these kind of different water shots.

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,410
So let's skip forward here.

95
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:34,540
And let's see how dragging this one in after this.

96
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,710
OK, that's OK.

97
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,440
It doesn't need to be perfect just now on this rough edit.

98
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:50,940
But I think those will cut together and we can even add, because this is a tripod shot for this meditating

99
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,780
Yoji shot.

100
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,600
But we can't even add a little bit of movement when we get to our next stage.

101
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,920
And I'll show you how to do that.

102
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,430
As we can see, you can kind of tell I'm kind of cutting these shots even in half the duration that

103
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,050
they originally were when we pulled our original Selex.

104
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,090
So that's something that I kind of mentioned, where you don't want to get too nitpicky too early on

105
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,690
in your edit.

106
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:24,710
It's way faster in the long run to do something that's a basic layer, a basic pass through the edit,

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,980
another basic pass.

108
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,240
It's a little bit more refined.

109
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,530
Another basic pass.

110
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,810
It's a little bit more refined, rather than finding the exact shot in the exact location of the exact

111
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,350
timing.

112
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,540
So hopefully that's making sense.
