1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,880
OK, so I'm going to take my first choice track.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,189
I'm going to copy it and I'm going to go ahead and paste it into our sequence.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,510
Now, before we start editing, we want to first make sure that this potential track is going to be,

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,920
you know, the ideal track to use.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,360
So with nothing edited, we're just going to hit play and we're going to sit back and see how the edit

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,830
is flowing and feels.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,620
OK, not bad.

8
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:06,350
I'm actually really liking that, so I say it's a go.

9
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,250
I think that this is a good track to use for the edit.

10
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,460
Now, sometimes, you know, you let's say let's take one of our second options and let's go ahead and

11
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,300
paste it in over the one that we're going to use.

12
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,480
And you think, OK, this track is going to be great and you hit play.

13
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,950
And the potential track that might have been it just doesn't match, so sometimes the first track you

14
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,350
try and paste in, boom, it's perfect.

15
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,070
You're good to go.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,680
Sometimes you have to try a few different tracks.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
In this case, we got lucky.

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,350
The pacing, the energy is perfect for this track, and it matches the vibe of a lot of these shots,

19
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,540
which are a lot of them are slow motion shots.

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,250
So next, I you know, when we were listening that first time, I definitely heard that this intro is

21
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,700
really slow and very kind of like, how do I say this?

22
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,190
Yeah, it's like turning on an old television or an old vinyl record.

23
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,150
So these quick shots that we originally wanted to put at the beginning, this is not going to work.

24
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:30,310
So what we want to do is to lock our soundtrack because we don't want the soundtrack to move, what

25
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,340
we want to do is move the other stuff around our soundtrack.

26
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,440
So because we want to kind of build this out chronologically, it'll be easiest from beginning, middle

27
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,950
to end.

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:50,260
Let's scrub through our demo reel and find those more potential elegant, slower types of shots.

29
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,790
I'm thinking that some of this underwater footage would be perfect for that.

30
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,350
So let me grab.

31
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,080
The more slow ones I know I have the underwater footage, that's more high energy.

32
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,360
So we'll leave that.

33
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,390
But let's grab.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,850
Yeah.

35
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,270
The slower ones.

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,710
So I'm going to grab them.

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,770
Ominous.

38
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,840
Scooch everything over.

39
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,230
And boom, I'm going to paste them in.

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,820
And let's see how this is looking.

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,290
OK, that's feeling way better.

42
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,220
OK, cool.

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,930
So we just need to kind of increase the pacing here a little bit.

44
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,610
And what I'm going to do is just quickly cut to the beat.

45
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,520
So as we play through, I'm going to make quick cuts as I feel where the next cut should be.

46
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,020
While listening to the track.

47
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,870
OK, so let's see what we did.

48
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,890
OK.

49
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:12,710
OK.

50
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,150
And now I doesn't want to have something special for this moment.

51
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,020
OK.

52
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,530
And let's see if we scooch everything over, how these will cut together.

53
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,660
OK, this shot's OK, it's it's kind of boring compared to all this great other stuff.

54
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,070
This one's a lot more high energy, so we don't need this eyeshot so much.

55
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,510
Let's go ahead and delete that one.

56
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:55,140
OK, and let's try and a lot of this is trial and error, so I'm just going to try to reorganise things,

57
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:01,230
change the orientation in the pacing a little bit until I get something that feels good for now with

58
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,700
this cool, big moment.

59
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,110
Oh, OK, now we're talking.

60
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,400
Oh, perfect, OK.

61
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,810
It's just the timing is a little bit off.

62
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,650
OK.

63
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,640
That is really cool.

64
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,700
So all this is actually synching up pretty nicely.
