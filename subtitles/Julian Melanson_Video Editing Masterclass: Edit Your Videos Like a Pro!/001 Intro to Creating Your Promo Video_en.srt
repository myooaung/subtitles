1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,020
OK, so new day, new fit, new background, want to switch up the look?

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,670
We've been working together in this course for quite a while.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,930
It's been about eight and a half hours so far, just a pure post-production and editing content.

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,120
So we're building a good relationship for getting to know each other.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,180
And I'm really excited for these next two chapters, because these are both going to be downloadable

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,340
content that I'm going to be editing, that you'll be able to download a more lower resolution version

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,280
of and follow along and edit with me.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,800
So let's get into what content we're going to be working with in this chapter.

9
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:56,120
So I want you to grab the downloadable footage that you can click next to this lecture or edit a pass

10
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,280
project that you have now.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,780
This past project has to have a real coverage and B, roll coverage.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,420
And what we're going to do is create around a 30 to 45 second promo video.

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,570
So in this chapter, I'm not going to be going through the back of the footage, gather the footage,

14
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:21,080
capture it or organize it, pull it into the timeline, create Selex, make it back up of that sequence

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,250
color and label everything.

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,460
We've already done that together through around four or five projects already.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,400
So from this point on in the course, we're going to be focusing on the more advanced techniques that

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,670
come after that, just initial organizing and setting up phase.

19
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,560
So I'm excited to get into these new techniques.

20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:50,140
So before we dive into this chapter, be sure that you have your initial rough edit ready to go.

21
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:57,320
And then what we're going to focus on together is these new types of techniques, like creating a multicam

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,520
sequence using quote unquote, unusable B roll.

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
That's going to be really cool.

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,229
We're going to get into masking and how to create cool new styles of overlays, more of the glitchy

25
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,860
effects.

26
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,180
And we're going to get into some of my favorite filters to use.

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,450
Then at the end of the chapter, once we've finished our edit together, you can export and share your

28
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:27,890
video URL in the student Q&A section for feedback from myself and from your other fellow students.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,850
And I want to mention that these techniques you can use for any kind of promo.

30
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:41,150
So whether you're creating a promo for a product for a client, you know, it could be any kind of product,

31
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,810
I don't know, like product for a client or possibly you have a service that you offer, maybe you sell

32
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,740
something online or maybe you offer something in person.

33
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,890
This kind of promo video will be a high energy short thing that will make that product or service or

34
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,450
video series that you want to advertise or music album that you want to advertise.

35
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,060
That's what this specific promo that I'm going to be editing is for.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,910
It's a promo for a music album.

37
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,500
But for anything for a client or personal project, this will work.

38
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:19,880
So what I want to do first before getting into the editing lesson is show you an example of what one

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,620
of these final products looks like.

40
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:52,860
Let me just.
