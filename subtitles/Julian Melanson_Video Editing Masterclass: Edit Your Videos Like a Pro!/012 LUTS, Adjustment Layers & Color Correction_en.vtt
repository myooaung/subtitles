1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.950
And now that we have our entire edit fully stylized, we have really cool moments sicked up to the audio,

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.070
we even added some audio filters with the low pass filter on our soundtrack.

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.650
Now it's time to color.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.160
Correct.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.180
And add a light to our entire.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.550
So let's get into it.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.800
I'm going to go ahead and create an adjustment layer.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.930
That way I can do one color correction layer for this entire edit, because for this one specifically,

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.590
we don't really need to go in and individually color correct our videos unless there is something that

10
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.400
really stands out.

11
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.070
Even just scrolling in this moment, I can actually see that for some reason, the lighting really changed

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.640
a lot because you can see a gigantic difference between the warmth, the skin tone and the saturation

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.380
and the exposure between these two shots.

14
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.400
So this may be one of the few shots in the edit where after we add our adjustment layer and our color

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.680
correction, we can go in and individually fix the handful of shots that need a little bit of help.

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.320
So I've got my adjustment layer in and a little bit of a tip here.

17
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.440
Man, we're not doing the pro tips anymore.

18
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.780
You know what?

19
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.890
Therapy pro tip again.

20
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.580
OK, so I'm glad we got that out of the way.

21
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.750
A bit of affirmative.

22
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.580
So when you add your color correction layer, we also have these layers on top here.

23
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.450
Now, you don't want to add 90 percent of the time, 99 percent of time.

24
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:52.580
You don't want to add your color correction layer on top of your overlays, because if I go in here

25
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.280
and I have this bright overlay that adds a really cool moment in the edit and I start changing.

26
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.510
The color correction and the saturation and the exposure, it's going to affect all these cool overlays

27
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:13.330
that we spent time having to edit so simple way around that is to always keep your overlays above your

28
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.670
color correction adjustment layer.

29
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.720
That way, they're not getting color corrected.

30
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.290
All we want to do is change the style of our footage below, you know, our main footage.

31
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.310
So with that said, let's go ahead and just kind of scrub through to see what the footage is looking

32
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.640
like.

33
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.310
And from looking at it, I definitely want to increase the brightness.

34
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.320
I want to increase the contrast.

35
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.110
I want to increase income.

36
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.640
I got increase the saturation and I want to bring up the Tannen's and maybe a little bit of greens.

37
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:58.300
So let's go ahead and look and see if there's any luts in here that will give us a cool look and a cool

38
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.740
feeling.

39
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.580
And honestly, this one.

40
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.950
It's like at the very top for premier sieci, it's going to be a little bit different for the editing

41
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.730
software you have.

42
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.940
But, you know, it's always good to decide on the coloring that you want to bring out and the scroll

43
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.110
through the and take a look.

44
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.320
I know I don't want it to be super blue.

45
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.300
So a blue, intense light is not going to do the trick.

46
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.510
If I want to really warm it up, you know, there's the Kodak presets and there's like the gold heat

47
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.660
stuff that really kind of has more that western kind of feeling, which actually looks pretty darn good.

48
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.450
But I have a feeling that for this specific edit, this in the space light is going to be perfect.

49
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.550
All we have to do is turn down the intensity a little bit, bring up the shadows so we don't lose too

50
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.950
much definition in the dark parts of the frame.

51
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.030
And bring up the highlights.

52
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.150
And I'm really liking how that's looking.

53
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.700
Now, in the footage is looking a little bit on the red side.

54
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.640
There's a lot of magenta, pink, reddish nice reddish is in the edit, so we can combat that by the

55
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.510
tint function.

56
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.520
The more we go to green, the more those reds start to turn into yellow.

57
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.330
The more we go to purple, the more those reds start to turn into a purplish pinkish reddish.

58
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.560
So we put this back at zero.

59
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.160
I'm going to bring up the greens so that we get more of a golden look rather than a red look.

60
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.820
So let's play this and let's see.

61
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.820
OK.

62
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.200
So if we take a look, that's with that's with out with without, right.

63
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.730
It's pretty stylized, like we went pretty far in the stylizing.

64
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.820
I might be a little bit too much for my eyes.

65
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.030
So what I'm going to do is take down this inner space filter from seventy six points to say 60.

66
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.030
That's just going to take down the contrast a little bit.

67
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.790
And there are some problem clips in here.

68
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.610
The exposure on most of these looks pretty good.

69
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.860
But yeah, and like with the intro.

70
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.210
So what I'm going to do is with the intro, I'm going to go ahead and cut on this adjustment layer.

71
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.520
And for these four inch shots, I'm just going to bring up the exposure a few points and definitely

72
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.450
bring up the highlights.

73
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.900
That way we can see a lot more in these look a little bit to tan.

74
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.260
Well, let's just see, actually, this one is just too expose now, so it's bringing down the exposure.

75
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.970
OK.

76
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.540
Much better.

77
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.830
OK.

78
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.180
And I'm going to bring the coldness down so you can see more cold, more tan.

79
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.830
I'm going to go maybe like negative 15 just so it matches up.

80
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.850
Yes, he does a lot better.

81
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.910
The coloring of this clip flows into this one a lot more before when it was at zero.

82
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.040
This is really tan.

83
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.660
And then that looks really blue.

84
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.760
But if we simply make this clip a little bit more blue, then it flows right into the next clip.

85
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.290
OK.

86
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.040
And I'm definitely seeing that I want to sharpen up the overall image, so I'm going to go under the

87
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.250
creative filter and I'm going to put up the sharpness.

88
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.580
I say thirty five.

89
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.660
Now there's a lot more crispiness in the pixels of the frame.

90
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:26.550
Now let's go ahead and quickly fix our our problem shots so we see the skin tone and contrast that it

91
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.330
looks proper.

92
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.680
We get to the close up and all of a sudden he just got out of a spray tan at a tanning bed.

93
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.050
Right.

94
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:40.650
So we're going to lose the tree color and I'm going to selectively drop a color correction layer just

95
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.150
on the clip I want to fix.

96
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.220
And then I'm going to turn down the saturation because it's clearly oversaturated.

97
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.450
I'm going to bring down the coldness, the temperature, a few points.

98
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.640
I'm going to push up the shallows.

99
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.960
And that is starting to look way better.

100
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.880
So we have now really tan.

101
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.320
Now back from a vacation in Miami and now.

102
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.320
OK, so that's mashing.

103
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.490
It's still a little bit dark.

104
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.570
So let's go with the highlights.

105
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.200
Push that up.

106
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.730
That should be good enough.

107
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.660
I'm going to copy and paste it on the following clip.

108
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.860
OK, cool.

109
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.600
That's matching up way more.

110
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.490
I'm liking that.

111
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.200
Let's move forward in the edit and let's find our next problem clip.

112
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.560
Oh, yeah.

113
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:37.460
He just went to a different whole different whole different level.

114
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.500
So I'm going to copy what we added to the previous clip to fix.

115
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.799
I want to pass it on here.

116
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.330
Let's see how that looks.

117
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.320
Pretty good.

118
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:52.550
I'd say this is still a little bit too warm if you just look at the overall redness and that high temperature

119
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.600
tint versus here.

120
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.440
Very cool.

121
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.120
Cool as in temperature.

122
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.180
No, but it also looks cool.

123
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.920
So let's bring the temperature down.

124
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.750
There we go.

125
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.800
OK.

126
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.880
OK, that's looking good, so we'll see you, though.

127
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.360
And with

128
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.850
K.

129
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.010
That one's looking pretty dark.

130
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:21.790
So.

131
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.610
Let's.

132
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:25.730
Paste our clip.

133
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.710
Bring down the temperature a little bit more, bring up the exposure.

134
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.370
Copy that pasted, pasted.

135
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.570
OK.

136
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.340
This one is, well, a little bit dark, so a lot of the closeups got just a little bit too dark.

137
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.740
Yep, that one as well.

138
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.000
OK.

139
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.020
OK.

140
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.130
There we go, and so better.

141
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.150
And let's brain on this one.

142
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.530
Now we have our entire edit super stylized.

143
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.000
The coloring looks great.

144
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:37.980
Wait a minute.

145
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.740
Hold on, hold on.

146
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.720
This looks one way to 10.

147
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.920
OK.

148
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.060
Yeah.

149
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.000
OK.

150
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.020
There we go.

151
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:51.230
Great.

152
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.280
So now we have our entire edit stylizing is on point.

153
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.720
Everything looks really cool.

154
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.160
And now it's time to move into one of the final refining steps.
