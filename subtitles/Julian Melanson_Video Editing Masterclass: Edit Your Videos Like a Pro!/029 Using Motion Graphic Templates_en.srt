1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,400
Next up is to talk about title cards.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:10,110
Now, as you saw, we kind of use these temporary title cards as placeholders to keep track of the main

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,270
chapters of our YouTube video.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,530
Now, I'd love to have some type of title card for the audience and the viewer that explains where we're

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,340
at in the process.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,040
But these little guys down here at the bottom, it's just not cutting it for me.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,810
So I want to explain how to really update and make these look better.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:39,630
Now, the easy way would be to kind of go in here and, you know, center it, maybe scale things up

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,370
and just make it feel a little bit more professional with maybe changing up the font.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,970
I know a good font is lotto.

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:56,550
I use this one a lot and that looks a little bit better, but I'm really not happy with it.

12
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,850
But something that will help when you're using kind of big, big title card like this is to kind of

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,990
turn the exposure down of the background so that the font stands out more.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,930
Now, that's still not cut that for me.

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,990
We could spend a little bit more time on this.

16
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,120
The typography of this, you know, really making it look good and making the spacing look good.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,710
But, you know, I'd really recommend putting some time into going online and finding some motion graphic

18
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,420
templates.

19
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,220
And there's so many out online that are free that you can buy for a few dollars.

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:42,150
I've collected some that I really like over the years, and it's just something that takes time to kind

21
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,700
of build up the stuff that you like to use.

22
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:51,240
So there is this essential graphics window that I mentioned earlier in the course that there are some

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,150
templates that you're editing software will come with.

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,420
But I do have some favorites that I have saved that I use for a lot of my projects.

25
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,600
So I'm going to grab one of those that I use a lot, and I'm going to show you how to put together and

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,580
really whip up a really quick, good looking motion graphic or title card for your video.

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,280
So out of the ones that I really like, I'm just going to kind of grab a random one here and I'm going

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,070
to drag it down into the timeline and I'm going to turn off the footage below it so that we can really

29
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,720
just clearly see what we're looking at here.

30
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,910
So if I select this at the graphic, we can see text online one traditions, traditions.

31
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,380
Is there text online, too?

32
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,280
This is just automatically what it comes.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,720
I don't know why it's talking about Japanese tea ceremonies, but OK, now I'm going to look back here.

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,810
OK, so step seven, start the build.

35
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,740
Let's see how we can put that into the template that we're using.

36
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,410
And this is going to work for any template that you use.

37
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,240
You want to find a cool way to display the information that you want to have on screen.

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,710
So I'm going to type in step seven.

39
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,010
And, you know, you can use a number, maybe that looks cooler, but honestly, in this kind of scenario,

40
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:17,680
I'm going to spell out the number and I'm going to say start the build, because that's the name of

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,390
the step in this one and yours as well, that you use whatever it is, it's going to have like different

42
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,410
parameters.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,200
This one has a good gradient parameter.

44
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,340
But, you know, I want all of the text in here to be white with no gradient.

45
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,730
So you could see what the gradients there is, those different shades of white without the gradients,

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,880
no different shades.

47
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,970
And I don't need all these kind of like geometry thingamajigs.

48
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,500
But I do like when it comes in and that type of animation.

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,440
So I'm going to cut out the beginning kind of overly geometry kind of things.

50
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,250
And I skewed it to where we want it to start.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,650
I'm going to cut it where we want it to and I'm going to get rid of the old one.

52
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,160
Actually, I'm gonna keep you on the on so we can see it before and after.

53
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,280
And I'm going to turn back on our bottom layer.

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,450
Now I'm going to turn on the safe margins, kind of overlay.

55
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:27,070
It just pops up basically this wireframe, just so I can really get our graphic centered, because sometimes

56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,430
that's hard.

57
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,860
So I'm looking at these horizontal dashes and then these vertical ones, and I'm just going to kind

58
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,700
of eyeball it.

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,770
Put that in the ocean.

60
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,790
Put that in the center and then that in the center.

61
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,520
I feel like the step seven thing is a little bit high.

62
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,030
So we could scale this up.

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,580
And then I want to bring down.

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,960
Yeah, OK.

65
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,150
Bring that down.

66
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,800
Scooch it over.

67
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,300
And we're starting to look pretty good.

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,420
Now we can take this off, see how it looks.

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,760
And now that we've done that, it's time to second guess all the decisions we made up to this point.

70
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,410
But we don't have a whole lot of time for that, because now it is a building process.

71
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,590
This is where we get to lift.

72
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,140
OK, cool.

73
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,550
So I like that.

74
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,250
That's a lot better than that.

75
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,620
OK.

76
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,910
We're making progress.

77
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,640
What I do want to add, though, is I really like this intro animation, The Mute, that I really like

78
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,470
this intro animation now, because it just disappears.

79
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,060
It doesn't look as cool.

80
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,540
Right.

81
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,660
So what I want to do is grab this clip, hold alz.

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,320
I guess I'm a really fan of holding alt and dragging Clevis, because it's just such an easy way to

83
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,500
duplicate a clip without clicking it.

84
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,310
Command C click somewhere else.

85
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,990
Command V.

86
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,110
You can click and drag it wherever you want, and it's just great.

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,810
So we're going to click this duplicate.

88
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,270
And what I did, I just duplicated the friend.

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,420
So but there's a problem.

90
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,360
It's like, no, that's not what we want.

91
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,880
So what we do want is to right click the clip.

92
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,370
We're going to reverse the direction.

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,250
So at the beginning, animation is now the ending animation of it going away.

94
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,400
OK.

95
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,490
And sometimes to smooth things out a little bit.

96
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,050
This is kind of a weird cut.

97
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,700
It's a little bit of a jump cut.

98
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,040
So we'll fix that.

99
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,780
But it's kind of cool if you overlap whatever animation you do, put on the screen a little bit over

100
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,210
the next cut.

101
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,020
So I'm actually going to fix this jumpcut because it makes it hard.

102
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,910
It's distracting.

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,410
So we're just going to scale this up.

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,660
That'll kind of take away our jumpcut.

105
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,490
OK.

106
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,500
And now,

107
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,240
boom, the animation comes in and then, boom, the animation goes away.

108
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,700
But you see how it overlaid on the next one.

109
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,170
That kind of just meshes everything together.

110
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,650
This is a clean cut without the overlay or, you know, the lag, actually.

111
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,910
And then this is with it going over, which is funny that you would think that that would make it that.

112
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,310
But it actually works really well.

113
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,110
I do that a lot with animation so we can even even do it to the beginning.

114
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,340
Boom.

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,260
So it comes in on the last shot and overlays versus the clean cut.

116
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,220
So it's kind of an aesthetic decision.

117
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,320
There's no right or wrong.

118
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,200
They both look good.

119
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,320
But I kind of like that look instead.

120
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,100
Now, the other thing is, because these two shots are so similar, but there's an exposure change between

121
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,430
here, the opacity that 70 percent.

122
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,540
Here's a 100.

123
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,150
Let's kind of do a ramp up so that it's more gradual zoom.

124
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,610
OK.

125
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,270
I like that.

126
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,280
OK, now let's do the same process to our next.

127
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:09,790
Oh, God.

128
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,470
Our next overlay.

129
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,710
You see how this looks so rinky dink down here in the bottom.

130
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,030
We're going to fix that.

131
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,440
So I'm going to highlight what we just created, Holdall, which, you know, is my favorite thing to

132
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,130
do by now.

133
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:30,070
I'm going to put it in place and I'm going to turn down the opacity of the clips below it so that our

134
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,850
motion graphics stands out a little bit more.

135
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:48,520
And I'm going to change this to step eight and I'm going to change this to paint and style now, because

136
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,070
this next clip is a separate cut that we did.

137
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,070
We're going to have to change the writing as well.

138
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,120
So my copy that Cahier, paste it here and let's check it out.

139
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,920
And voila, step eight, paint in style.

140
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,150
Let's actually see what's like with the audio sound in the background to see how things are starting

141
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,810
to come together.

142
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,750
Which leads us to our painting and styling phase.

143
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:29,050
It's where we get to use a green Tabe saying to tape up all the bits of the wall that we don't want

144
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,230
to get.

145
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,040
OK.

146
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,680
So that's starting to really come together.

147
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:41,290
Now, I'm going to do the same process for the other chapter titles of this video, and then we're going

148
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,140
to continue to upgrade our YouTube video.
