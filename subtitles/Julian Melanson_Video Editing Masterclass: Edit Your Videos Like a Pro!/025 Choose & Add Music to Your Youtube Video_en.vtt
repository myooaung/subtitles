00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that we've done the cool reverb effect on our intro, now it's time to start dropping in some music

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.320
so we can make this 10 minute video feel a lot more fun and really just add another layer of production

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.220
with some music.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:21.840
So I have one, two, three, like six or seven tracks here, and I kind of roughly order them in this

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.830
thought or in the order that I feel like they may go in.

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.210
So if we take a listen to the first track shoes.

7
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.110
It's a cool vibe.

8
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.860
It feels like you're getting things started, you're moving.

9
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.950
And this track really feels like you're definitely getting stuff done.

10
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.380
So I wanted to start off kind of with a smooth track as the intro starts for the video and going into

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.560
really getting stuff done as we're doing the renovations in the space.

12
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.340
That's just another cool track that kind of matches the vibe of the video.

13
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.510
So these are all really cool, but I guess the last thing that I want to say before we drop these in

14
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.510
is I know I want a big payoff at the end of the video where we've done all the work.

15
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.380
We show the behind the scenes on the whole process and then we show this final product.

16
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.160
And I want that payoff to feel really cool and joyful.

17
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.870
So knowing that ahead of time, I chose this track.

18
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.210
Yeah.

19
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:16.020
That's just Zober upbeat and bright, and it's got these horns that, you know, just really sounds

20
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.430
like a celebration vibe.

21
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.110
So something to keep in mind as you cut together your YouTube videos.

22
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.470
Right.

23
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.370
But let's first go ahead and drop this first track in here at the beginning.

24
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.030
And I want this hit, this big beat that has a marker to hit at the beginning of where things get started.

25
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.080
Of course, the audio levels are off, so we're going to bring down our music track.

26
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.560
And I want to do a little bit of a fade in, if I could, to do it, so let's get right into it.

27
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.010
First, if you want to do, is choose your filming space.

28
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.050
I'm choosing this extra room.

29
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.870
OK, so it's still a little bit loud.

30
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.010
Generally, what I do is I'll put my speakers at half.

31
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.180
This is all the way up.

32
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.660
That's all the way down and at half.

33
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.570
Because you got to imagine, people are going to be playing it on their phone in loud places, in quiet

34
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.380
places in the valley, like wherever it happens.

35
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.670
Right.

36
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.770
So if I can't clearly hear the music and clearly hear the vocals at half volume with whatever I'm playing

37
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.070
it on, then I know my levels are not right.

38
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.550
So we're going to have to listen to this a few times to level off the sound of this first music track.

39
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.340
I got a little work to do.

40
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.980
So let's get right into it.

41
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.590
First, if you want to do, is choose your film.

42
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.750
That's a lot better.

43
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.780
That's pretty darn good.

44
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.700
If I'm choosing this extra breathing apparatus because I can renovated, I can move things around.

45
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.280
It's a clean slate to work with.

46
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.270
I mean, look at it.

47
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.680
It's a pretty tame, clean slate.

48
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.020
Empty walls, empty floor, empty ceiling.

49
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.320
And you see how this music is really pushing forward the edit.

50
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.250
If I play the same bit, but I mute the track children at my house because I can renovated, I can move

51
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.980
things around.

52
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.589
It's a clean slate to work with.

53
00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.519
I mean, look at it.

54
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.570
It's a pretty and clean.

55
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.150
It's OK, but not like this.

56
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.530
Empty walls, empty floor, empty ceiling, everything you hear echoing here to fix that in the latest

57
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.910
steps.

58
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.350
So I'm really happy with this first track.

59
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.690
I feel like it matches with the first minute of this video.

60
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.590
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look ahead in my edit and see where I have major changes.

61
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.060
Now, that's going to dictate a really perfect time to change songs.

62
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.010
And for this edit is specifically, it's going to be pretty easy to do that because we are already highlighted

63
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.910
the main chapters of our edit, and they're their own specific color.

64
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.310
So let's look at the colors of the edit.

65
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.020
We'll keep that in mind and we'll look for parts in the song where we can transition between tracks

66
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.100
that we want to gather inspiration.

67
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.960
So I went through a full three creative spaces that I really like.

68
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.280
We got this lightsaber guy.

69
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.690
We have this creator has a really nice little modern clean space.

70
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.840
It's a little bit cold.

71
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.650
And then we got this guy believes these Armondo really cool space, very unique background, excellent

72
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.170
lighting.

73
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.820
So those were the three that I wanted to use and remix into my own space.

74
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.140
Next up is our brainstorming and concept creation phase.

75
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.020
This is where we're taking the inspiration that we gathered from online.

76
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.260
What people are doing, what they're not doing, and we're going to mix them with the space that we

77
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.950
chose.

78
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.810
So I'm doing a test shot here.

79
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.560
I got my camera out with rough framing of what I want the shot to look like.

80
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.200
And I'm getting some worked on where the hands are.

81
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.640
And, you know, busy day here.

82
00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.240
But the goal of this is to see if the ideas that we came up with are going to work in our space.

83
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.750
Next up, we create our purchase place and we really want to.

84
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.430
OK, so we could potentially change this track a little bit around here.

85
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.790
But I actually came to a part in the edit where I know there's kind of a comedic line that I say here,

86
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:28.180
and this is a perfect opportunity to learn when to remove and drop out your music to really make a vocal

87
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.360
part stand out.

88
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.030
So songs do this all the time.

89
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.140
When they make the beat take, they make the beat, they take away the beat while the vocalist is singing

90
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.730
or saying something, and it makes it stand out.

91
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.950
So we're going to kind of do that same thing here, and we're going to use that to transition to a new

92
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:45.280
song.

93
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Its next step, we create our purchases and we really want to maxed out our credit cards here because

94
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.150
and I talk about maxing out your credit cards.

95
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.470
I'm making a joke.

96
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.440
So we're going to find the right place to drop this out.

97
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.720
And we really want to maxed out our credit cards here, because that's going to give us some more motivation

98
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.800
to really take our video creating creativity and career a lot more seriously.

99
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.180
Why?

100
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.410
Because there is no choice.

101
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.130
We got to pay off our debt now.

102
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.190
And I'm serious here.

103
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.880
OK, so is it funny?

104
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.640
Is it not?

105
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.570
I don't know.

106
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.810
It's a little bit funny, but that actually worked pretty well.

107
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:30.670
So we dropped out our track at here because that's going to give us some more motivation to that point

108
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.180
where I talk about motivation, because getting into debt as a joke.

109
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:42.610
But let's try it if I drop it out at a different word, except we treat our purchases and we really

110
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.590
want to maxed out our credit cards here, because that's going to give us some more motivation to really

111
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.830
take our video creating creativity and career.

112
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.210
A lot more seriously.

113
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.030
So as soon as the track drops out, your ears automatically goes to my vocals, which sounds great.

114
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.500
I'm happy with it.

115
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.210
We don't need to fine tune it too much.

116
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:07.720
But there's, like I say, creating creativity, something, something video, creating creativity and

117
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.110
career.

118
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:16.360
So let's see if we can take out one of these parts of this alliteration that I'm doing a video creating

119
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.570
creativity in our video.

120
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.110
I'm just going to go to video Career Street.

121
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.050
A video, creativity and career.

122
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.190
A lot more serious.

123
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.900
OK, so we took out one of the actresses that didn't need to be there.

124
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:39.830
And now that we found a point where we can drop out our track and it actually works for the edit, it's

125
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.710
not for no reason, but it's actually for a very specific reason.

126
00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:50.660
Now, let's go and grab our next track and find out where to sync it up and how to get it into the edit.

127
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:59.720
What I'm going to look for is, as you can see, there's a marker at the kind of main part of the video

128
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.280
of the song, and I remember it as we were listening.

129
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.080
It kind of comes back in to the video being serious again at this moment.

130
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:19.670
So let's line up this marker and let's just see what happens if we go right into the track without having

131
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.310
a fade in or build.

132
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:27.020
Next up, we create our purchase list and we really want to max out our credit cards here, because

133
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.810
that's going to give us some more motivation to really take our video, creativity and career a lot

134
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.620
more seriously.

135
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.010
Why?

136
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.240
Because there is no choice.

137
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.590
We got to pay off our debt.

138
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.450
Know in all series here, what we want to do is create a purchasing list of all the.

139
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.340
OK, so you see where we're going.

140
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.240
But it didn't quite work and the timing was a little bit off.

141
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:53.750
So rather than going straight into the B, the main part of the song, let's scoot it over and let's

142
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.930
see if we start the intro of the next track at this point where we know we want a new song to come in.

143
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.220
Let's see how that sounds.

144
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.190
Creativity and career a lot more seriously.

145
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:04.580
Why?

146
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.810
Because there is no choice.

147
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.640
We got to pay off our debt, you know, and all series here.

148
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.210
What we want to do is create a budget.

149
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.360
Nothing, nothing serious here.

150
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.420
What we want to do is create a purchase list of all the ideas we're going to need for a space.

151
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.600
I found that the best way to do this is to create two columns.

152
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.410
One.

153
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.640
OK, that's OK.

154
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.300
I'm not super mad at that.

155
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:34.640
But what I do want is for the main beat right here, this marker, I really want to have it come in

156
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.780
on this new section of the video.

157
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.240
So we're going to have to do some ninja work here.

158
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.400
So let's line up the part that we want.

159
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:53.390
So this marker and that leads us to the Christie space.

160
00:10:53.710 --> 00:11:00.040
OK, well, you can already feel how that is at the right place, and that leads us to the Christmas

161
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.180
be okay.

162
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.040
Now, what we do is find out how to get things right over here.

163
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.960
So let's pull this back and let's see how this sounds.

164
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.610
We got to pay off our debt.

165
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.110
No, no serious here.

166
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.150
What we want to do is create a purchase list of all the items we're going to need for a space.

167
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.360
I found that the best way to do this is to create two columns.

168
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:29.530
One column has all of your equipment list purchases, and then one phone has all of your aesthetic list

169
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:33.970
purchases of what's going to go in your space to really give it more style and more character.

170
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.210
And that leads us to the Christmas phase.

171
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.910
This is going to be OK.

172
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.520
Perfect.

173
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:45.940
So we use the intro of this track to change the beat and the tempo after the cheesy joke that I made.

174
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:52.930
And we used that joke as kind of a cool moment to cut out the track before it to make the transition

175
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.280
into the new track.
