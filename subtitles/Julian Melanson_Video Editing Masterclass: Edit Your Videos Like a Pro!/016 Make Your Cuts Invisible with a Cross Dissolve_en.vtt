00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.610
So I'm going through here and I'm pulling some more Selex.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.050
And there's a great moment here where I want to show a technique we can use.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.950
It's really a handy way to use a cross dissolve.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.840
So if I play these clips together back to back, I'm putting some lenses on the shelf.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.960
And then there's another take where I bring my hand back and then I kind of reposition the lens.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.370
So if we do want to use the second shot, here's the thing.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.540
You see a big you see a snap right there because the lighting is slightly different in these two different

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.420
takes, the same angle.

9
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.770
The framing hasn't changed.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.420
But you can see that snap.

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.410
It's a little bit jarring and a little bit distracting.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.330
So this is the perfect opportunity to use a little cross design.

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090
So let's highlight our clips here.

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.070
And we're going to go over to our effects panel and we're going to put it across the Gulf and we're

15
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.590
going to go and we're going to drag that crosses off right on the middle of these two clips.

16
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.790
Now, the default of a cross is all for all editing softwares.

17
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.860
It's going to be a pretty decent amount of time.

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.640
So we don't really need it for quite that much.

19
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.880
The longer you stretch the crosses, all the more it's going to blend these two shots together over

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.400
a slower amount of time.

21
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.580
You can see my hand there start to go out and disappear.

22
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.310
So we don't want that.

23
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.710
We're going to keep it nice and short.

24
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.480
But let's go ahead and play this through.

25
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.860
And you can see there's no more quick snap between the change of these two shots.

26
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.710
This really dissolved the transition between these two and blended it together nicely.

27
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.210
So when the shadow from my hand comes in, it's seamless.

28
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.440
Perfect.

29
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.400
So that's with it.

30
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.410
And if I highlighted.

31
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.200
And delete it.

32
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.980
This is without.

33
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.990
Well.

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.410
And this is with.

35
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.920
Perfect.

36
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.350
So we have another opportunity over here as well for a similar type of shot where I sit down this light.

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.350
And then in a separate shot, but with the same framing, again, I go down and I turn on the light.

38
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.140
So we have this same similar snap between the exposure of the two.

39
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.770
Let's see what we can do with the cross dissolves.

40
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.740
So I'm going to drag it again between these two clips.

41
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.060
Going to shorten the length of this transition hit play.

42
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.340
And it's a lot more gradual.

43
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.500
So this is with it.

44
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.380
And this is without.

45
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.720
Way better with.
