00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.630
Next up, what I want to talk about is music choice.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.620
Now, we've touched on music choice a few times in this journey together inside this course, but it's

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.950
something that I like to revisit as much as possible, because it's honestly one of the biggest.

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.900
I don't want to see mistakes, but it's one of the biggest missed opportunities.

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.020
A mistake when you miss taking something, right?

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.160
Hmm.

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.030
Yeah.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.030
One of the biggest myths about missed opportunities that I see in a lot of videos that people send me

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:42.030
that people share with me, that I see online is a mismatch between the visuals and the music choice.

10
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.780
So song choice is everything OK?

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.540
It's everything.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.540
It's just as important as the footage.

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.540
I'm sitting here and watching these beautiful shots and I'm sitting here and I'm listening to whatever

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.320
the editor is choosing I should listen to.

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.250
And it's another level of subtlety that you understand or you don't.

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.700
But if you don't know what song, then it's really good to practice and to visualize and to really absorb

17
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.950
the footage that you have.

18
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.790
And, you know, intuitively feel.

19
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.170
So it's another level of subtlety that this is why I like to revisit it again and again to really lock

20
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.830
in this thought process in this way of creating better looking videos, because you're choosing better

21
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.970
sounding audio to go with that.

22
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.100
So I chose I didn't even choose.

23
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.270
I just grabbed a few kind of random songs.

24
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.620
So let's actually first just take a quick, brief look through our content.

25
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.710
I'm just going to hit play and I'm going to kind of skip around.

26
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:59.760
So this is slow moving, classic, professional, clean, modern.

27
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.990
Not a whole lot of emotion that we need to provoke or create in a music track.

28
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.100
We want it to be calm, relaxing, but engaging, and we don't want it to sound like stock footage,

29
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.730
music.

30
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.360
We're not going to go in the hip hop more beats genre.

31
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.290
We're not going to go in the more electronic techno, you know, electronic house or future based genre.

32
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.090
We want to find a good middle ground that a 20 year old can listen to and a 40 year old can listen to

33
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.640
and a 60 year old, because especially for a video that we're creating for a client we want to have

34
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.370
in mind.

35
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.480
If it isn't already discussed upfront with the person you're working with, here's the target audience.

36
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.860
That's always a good thing to know, but especially for a client, a vision and video where you need

37
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.700
to lock in something that's going to sell something.

38
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:08.730
You want to keep the ending user, the end user, the viewer, the person who is the customer in mind.

39
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:18.360
Now, there's not going to be any like 18 year old, you know, millennial Gen X, Gen Z person that's

40
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.040
going to buy one of these properties.

41
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.270
So I'm not going to pick a track like that that I would just hear on Spotify playlist.

42
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.580
I want something a little bit more mature.

43
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.210
So let's go ahead and just kind of breezed through these tracks here.

44
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.600
And I like to bring it into premiere so I can actually see the waveform.

45
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.380
Yeah.

46
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.320
So we have our intro right here.

47
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.880
Not bad.

48
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.800
OK, I'm going to skip forward right here is going to be where the beat comes in.

49
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.529
Not bad.

50
00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.150
I'm actually I like that one, it's got a little bit of a French vibe.

51
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.890
We don't want to get too much on the Bossanova kind of style.

52
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.650
We kind of want a track that's almost has enough personality to keep someone interested but doesn't

53
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.480
go too far into bossa nova or rock or hip hop, because then, you know, it can kind of become a distraction

54
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.190
for a video like this.

55
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.090
OK, that's too young sounding, so I'm just going to label this brown.

56
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.800
We're not going to use that.

57
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.670
Food.

58
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.190
OK.

59
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.990
Well, it definitely has the slow, smooth, relaxing vibe buds.

60
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.650
I'm not quite into it, so if it's a maybe, you know, you can label it something else.

61
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.450
Let's go let's go mango.

62
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.310
OK, just for those first two sounds, I can already tell.

63
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.810
Now to millennial the.

64
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.760
Super cool song, but this is more of a music festival recap video is not what we're doing here.

65
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.900
So the label at Brown

66
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.750
time and see if you can imagine the footage when you listen to your track that you're possibly going

67
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.380
to use.

68
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.090
OK.

69
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.970
I like the smoothness of this one.

70
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.890
Definitely.

71
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.110
So let's label this magenta.

72
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.340
And I would say it's between the first and last track.

73
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.580
So I'm going to what I'm going to actually do is I'm going to go ahead and drag in both of these tracks.

74
00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.360
OK.

75
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.790
And then I'm going to mute one of them and I'm going to lock off our vidyalaya so nothing actually happens

76
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.640
to our Selex in our timeline.

77
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.980
And I'm just going to do a run through and just hit play and see which of these tracks better fits the

78
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.560
footage, and I really like choosing two to three.

79
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:25.050
And, you know, dropping in in the timeline and just getting a view and seeing because one that you

80
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.230
like.

81
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.980
Yeah, that's it.

82
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.100
And once you drop it and you see what the footage, it could change.

83
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.200
The second choice that you had actually fits the footage better.

84
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.080
So let's check it out.

85
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.950
And.

86
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.080
And I'm going to skip forward here.

87
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.590
Not bad, not bad.

88
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.360
Let's see the second option.

89
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:24.570
OK.

90
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.830
And I'm going to skip forward.

91
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.310
OK.

92
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.950
I mean, honestly, both of those sound really good.

93
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:07.110
Honestly, this second track for my ear goes a little bit into the stock music sound just slightly.

94
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.890
It doesn't have that really annoying, fully stocked sound that that tracks have, but it kind of does

95
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.790
almost get over there.

96
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.410
But and I really like this first one because it's got a lot of character.

97
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:29.880
But with the final viewer and the final consumer in mind for this kind of project specifically, I'm

98
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.820
going to have to go with this second track, because this first one is kind of Spanish or it has a bossa

99
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.510
nova vibe.

100
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.130
It's a little bit more fun and playful.

101
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.010
I think that the more classical and piano sound.

102
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:53.780
That has a little bit more of that personality that I would imagine the consumer vibing with more.

103
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.330
I'm going to go with the second track in this scenario.

104
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.800
If the viewer was going to be younger and it was more of a fun video, boom, we drop in this first

105
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.160
track.

106
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:09.710
So let's drop in this second track and then I'm going to line up the visuals to sync up with this music

107
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.450
choice that we just did together.
