00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.700
So now that you have your edit looking nice, crispy, entertaining, you're telling your story and

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.960
we've used the audio from our actual clips or added in pretend audio, if you want to call it post-production

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.860
audio to some of our clips to really sweeten up the overall video.

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.710
Before we dive into really using music to create music montage in the next section, what I want to

5
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.600
do as an experiment for you, because there's some really big insights and some just overall understandings

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.610
as an editor that I really want you to grasp on how much audio is affecting your edit and how much the

7
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.470
marriage between audio and visual is what creates the movies.

8
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.550
Commercials, TV shows, all the things that you love and that you are inspired by.

9
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.630
The reason you feel that way is because there is this perfect synergy between these two elements of

10
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.530
audio and video.

11
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.750
OK, that's one of the reasons why video is one of the most impactful mediums across all the artistic

12
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.440
platforms.

13
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.410
Of course, art painting is amazing.

14
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.700
Photography is amazing.

15
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.150
Singing or, you know, all the other stuff is amazing as well.

16
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.010
I'm not pressing any of them down.

17
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:34.500
But what I'm saying is that video film creating content is the one that uses all still imagery, motion

18
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.310
movement, sound visuals, all the senses and suffering as smell and touch, you know.

19
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.610
But the strongest senses that we have, I'm kind of rambling on here to wrap up this thought.

20
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.340
The strongest senses that we have as humans, our sight and sound.

21
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.720
OK.

22
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.990
If you go without your smelling and you lost your sense of smell.

23
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.640
Yeah, we kind of suck.

24
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320
You know, if you lost your sense of touch or taste, yeah, that would suck, you know.

25
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.390
But losing your vision or your hearing would be a massive life change.

26
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.830
The other ones would really suck.

27
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.930
But these two are a massive wave of change.

28
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.710
Why is that?

29
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.540
Because he's the most connected to our experiential life that we live as humans.

30
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.420
So bit of a rant there.

31
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.830
But I want you to really see, you know, the deeper level.

32
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.530
That's what I want this to do, is really teach you deeper level of what you're doing and how it's affecting

33
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.040
other people.

34
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.490
So let's move over to the screen cap here.

35
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.720
And I want to kind of show the process a little bit of an overview of the process of going through and

36
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.380
choosing proper music for your edit.
