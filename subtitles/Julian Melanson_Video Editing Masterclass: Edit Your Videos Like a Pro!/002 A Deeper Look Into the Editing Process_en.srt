1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,200
OK, yes, and so we got a lot to talk about for this project, and I want to say this just once at

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,270
the beginning of this chapter or the beginning of this project, so I don't repeat it through the video

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:12,870
lessons.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,490
If I'm going through the edit and you see something like, wait, what?

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,420
How do you do that?

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,920
Why is he not explaining that?

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,390
I'm moving past that because I've already explained it earlier in the course.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,010
I just want to say now I have to repeat it.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,700
Do you see something like, wait, how the heck do you filter the audio or how do you out of reverb

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,530
or whatever it is, it's because it's already in the course.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:43,980
This whole portion of these showcases and case studies and breakdowns is to focus on the more complex

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,190
stuff.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,080
So good.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,400
OK.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,870
Perfect.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,670
Now, let's get into this edit.

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,240
And I want to just show first off, we have this text layer.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,570
So I got this from the client.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,720
This is their logo for the track that they made.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,340
And so what I did is a simple fade in and fade out.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,440
But as you can see, we did the bezier on it.

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,360
So we have this nice curve.

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,740
If we don't have the Bezzina, just linear.

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,210
It's one straight line.

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,960
So when it fades out, it can be a little bit more abrupt for a project like this, where it's smooth

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,530
and it's mysterious and it's ethereal.

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,310
We want to have things right.

28
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,160
So that's one thing right out of the gate.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,130
We have a nice soft curve that makes the fade a lot smoother like that versus push.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,440
Push, right.

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,510
So that's something right out of the gate.

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,010
And let's kind of see as you can kind of look here.

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,530
I have it's hard to see.

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,730
OK, I have these markers on this clip.

35
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,260
OK.

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,060
Boom.

37
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,860
And it's showing where I want my first cuts to be.

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,220
And it's a pretty slow pacing at this beginning of the video.

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:10,560
We have this opening mysterious shot where the character is swimming, but we don't quite see what it

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,070
is.

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,590
This is kind of a cool reveal shot where it catches your attention.

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,120
And that's why I put it first.

43
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:29,850
And it's also acting as a little bit of a background image for this logo to sit on top of.

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,460
If I took that same logo and put it on a really clear image, it doesn't look bad.

45
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:42,030
But because the background is already kind of a little bit blurry and darker, it's perfect for our

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,110
opening shot.

47
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,860
Take a deep breath, and I want to mention that, yes, we are following the pacing of the track, this

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,670
not dum dum dum dum dum with the cutting, there's not a bunch of quick cuts.

49
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:16,340
It's pretty slow and steady because the beginning of the song doesn't have a beat B. It's not right.

50
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,980
There's no beat.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,840
It's just a really cool kind of atmospheric ambient noise.

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,490
So you want to cut slower, but you want to find where the beat is, even if there is in a specific

53
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,120
instrument.

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,390
So we're cutting on the different note changes.

55
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,840
A.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,430
No change.

57
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,360
Is no change.

58
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,870
And no change.

59
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:58,230
And you see how we're holding this shot, so it's got an extra cool feel of just extra epic ness overall.

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,710
Take a deep breath.

61
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,830
By two feet, breathing all the way out.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
And there's some subtleties going on here.

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,310
Yes, we do see her feet in the shot.

64
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:20,320
It's just kind of a little bonus that this motion that she's doing and the feeling of this song or the

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,290
feeling of the shot matches up with her vocals.

66
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,330
And then we have kind of an abstract shot of just her dress.

67
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,990
And the vocals are breathe it all the way out or something like that.

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:39,550
We're not showing her physically breathing out, but we're showing a shot that in an abstract, creative

69
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,160
way, it doesn't really make sense on paper that, OK, I have to breathe it all the way out.

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,920
And then if I write down, show dress shot wouldn't really compute or make sense.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:05:00,970
But if you see the motion of the dress, it kind of has a metaphor simile kind of effect to what she's

72
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,330
saying.

73
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,640
So hopefully understanding that kind of subtlety.

74
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,470
Let's take a look.

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,730
A deep breath in.

76
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,450
By your feet, breathe in all the way out.

77
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,280
Take another deep breath and bring on it.

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,480
OK, perfect.

79
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:30,930
So as you can see, we're cutting with the major parts of the track and her vocals.

80
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,220
And this is something I want to share called a match cut.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,720
Oh, is it?

82
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,490
Yeah.

83
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:37,920
OK, yeah.

84
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,840
This is a match cut.

85
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:48,790
So we have her hand in roughly the top right part of the frame in the following shot.

86
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,280
We have her hand in a different location, a different time of day, a completely different part of

87
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,970
the production.

88
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,060
Roughly in the top right part of the frame.

89
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,750
Right.

90
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,830
So you can kind of create some cool visual moments by what's called a match cut.

91
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:17,100
Now, what that means is we're basically having two separate images with a very similar area of where

92
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,130
the viewer is looking.

93
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,170
When you look at the shot, I can guarantee your eyes looking right here.

94
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,460
It's not looking over here.

95
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,350
It's not like it over here.

96
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
It's going to be looking right here.

97
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,430
Now, in this next shot, your eye is already going to be resting at this part of the image.

98
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,190
So when the shot comes in, your eye is already looking there.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,580
And I guarantee you, when you look at this image, your eye is going to start here.

100
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,350
It's going to go here, here, here, here.

101
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,680
So if you pay attention to where your eyes looking at the image consciously, you'll find that.

102
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,360
And that's a really cool way to use a matko is my looking here.

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
The next part of the image, I'm looking at the same place and then I can look elsewhere.

104
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,540
I'm looking here the next cut or the next image, boom.

105
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,470
I'm still looking there.

106
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,470
That creates seamless edits.

107
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:08,790
And that's a really cool way to change location kind of seamlessly or in a unique way is to find similarities

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,680
of where the viewer is looking.

109
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,850
And what the contents of that actual image is.

110
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,500
Now, let's move forward and find some other unique parts of this edit.
