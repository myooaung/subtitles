1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,310
And the last thing that I want to do before I actually go into the editing process of putting this whole

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:12,090
multicam thing, which is going to be pretty dang fun to do, but we don't want to use any of this audio.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,220
This audio is very echoey if we listen.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,050
It was just the, you know, the on board mike of the camera, I think I shot this with the one, the

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,420
X mark, two of the five, D mark four.

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:34,450
So what we want to do is take the good actual produced song and bring it in here and synchronize it.

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,530
So we have the song here

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,110
and you can see how much better that sound.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,290
So I'm going to copy that.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,380
I'm going to go to our multicam sequence.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm going to double click it to open it up.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,980
We have all of our layers.

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,750
I'm going to paste in the good track.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,530
I'm going to drag it down here to the bottom.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:06,360
And I'm going to go to the final beat of the track, because that's the most definitive part of the

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,810
video.

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,100
And I'm going to listen on a solo or good track that we want to use.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,290
And I'm going to find that final beat and make a marker.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,790
OK, I know it's right there at that last hit.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,740
OK, now I'm going to line it up.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,480
And I'm an unmuted OK.

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,910
And now I know that synched up in what I can do is mute the rest of the tracks and what we'll have now

23
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,400
is all of our tracks.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,250
Synched up.

25
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,250
With the good sounding audio.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,120
OK, now we're starting to get cooking here.

27
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,710
Now, if we go back to our main sequence, and I'm just going to delete this tail off here, because

28
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,570
we kind of scooted everything a little bit forward in our multicam sequence.

29
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,620
And now we have our main sequence and it just looks like one layer, right?

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,080
We have one layer of audio and one layer of video.

31
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,460
But this is where the good stuff happens.

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,610
This is where the magic happens.

33
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,030
I'm going to hit shift zero.

34
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,830
Now, I have all six of my angles that I can view at once.

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,420
So if I let this play.

36
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,940
So we have everything that we need.

37
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,690
Now, here's the cool part of the multicam.

38
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:53,410
So I'm going to show you how to do it, and then I'm going to go through and edit this 30 second cut.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,240
So if we look at our waveform, we can see kind of where big striking moments are.

40
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,040
I can already tell that right here is a striking moment.

41
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,890
I can tell that just the beat is at the beginning of this video.

42
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,890
So it's just a touch before the actual musical instruments come in.

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,840
The big B is right there.

44
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,350
There's a pause right here.

45
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,950
And then the ending is here.

46
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,980
So that's going to kind of dictate where some of my cutting is going to be and the way we can do the

47
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:32,540
cutting is either by using the blade tool like this, I create a cut and then I minimize this and I

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,900
can click where I want this cut I just made, which angle I want to use for it, basically.

49
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,730
So I go.

50
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,630
And then a cut to the next angle, if I didn't want to use this angle, I could simply click.

51
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,180
And now it changes this whole clip to be that angle.

52
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,850
The other thing you can do if you don't want to click is you can use the numeral what's it called,

53
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,960
the number pad.

54
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,230
So I'm hitting one to go to angle one.

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,550
I'm hitting two on the keyboard to go to two, I'm hitting three and the keyboard to go to three, four

56
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,420
and so on.

57
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,089
Those are the two main ways to cut stationary without you playing.

58
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:23,440
But honestly, my favorite one to do is to actually let the clip play through or let the timeline play

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,870
through and cut live.

60
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,120
This is the kind of like breakthrough aha moment that I had with using a multicam sequence the first

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,930
time that I used it.

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,690
So if I let this play and I start clicking with the shots I want to use, it's going to cut live.

63
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,250
So let's let's see what that looks like.

64
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,370
Gas.

65
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,360
OK, so I hit pause and now it just saved all those cuts that I just made.

66
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,530
So let's see in that little 20 second window what kind of we just magician didn't put together.

67
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,360
Gas.

68
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,130
So just like that, we weren't pausing bring out the blade to a cutting, scooting everything over,

69
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,140
removing, cutting, changing angles, pulling back layers to see was below it.

70
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,220
We just played it through and simply clicked or use a numerical pad to cut live, almost like cutting

71
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,390
a live event or a live TV show.

72
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,480
They use switching boards, kind of similar to this multicam sequence where when you're watching like

73
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,830
the Olympics or a sporting event like the Super Bowl or something, there's guys sitting in a room with

74
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,910
a live cutting board where they see all the angles that are happening on the field.

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,380
They're cutting it live.

76
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,840
And that's what you're seeing on your television.

77
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:41,850
That's really the same process that we're doing here, is using that really cool sound, good same technique

78
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,610
to make our editing process quicker when we're using multiple angles.

79
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,360
So now I'm going to go through using this multicam sequence and create the first draft edit, and then

80
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,690
we're going to hop into how to then add B roll into our sequence.

81
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,200
So I will see you in the next learning lesson.
