1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,780
OK.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:09,090
And so before we move on from this specific video project, I want to also share one more aspect here.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:17,730
The client asked me or actually was part of our contract for me to put together for 15 second cut downs

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,430
and one 30 second cut down.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,300
So a cut down is basically exactly what it sounds like, a shorter version of the final product.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,090
So these are used for Instagram.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,490
They're going to be used for Tick-Tock.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,670
They're going to be used for all social media platforms as shorter posts.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,560
The full music video is going to be the main video on the client's website, on their YouTube channel.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,480
All that good stuff.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,300
So I just want to kind of walk you through the process here and let's hop right into it.

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,090
So if we just kind of take a listen to this first track here, you can see we have our 15 second edit

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,810
cut down.

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,490
What is your purpose?

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,349
What you buy?

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,040
And it goes right into the main course of the song.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,550
So knowing that there is like this for second of intro, I'm going to have some really nice intro shots.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,050
And going into the more exciting part, I know I want to have some exciting footage that matches up.

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:33,340
So the process which we've touched on before, but it's basically going through and taking your main

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,720
edit just like this, what we have here, you want to duplicate it.

21
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,790
So let's call this music video shutdown's.

22
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:52,000
And now you can edit this, change things around, move things around without affecting your master

23
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,410
final sequence.

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,810
So that's the process that I started with.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,070
I duplicated it.

26
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,720
I started moving things around.

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,640
And I kept in mind, OK, I'm going to have this as I'm going to keep these as intro shots.

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,900
And basically, the client specifically for this project wanted to have one cut down with beach footage,

29
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:21,400
as you can see here, our beach footage and it ending title card for the artists album.

30
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,920
So I just dropped that and added a little bit of a fade so we can actually play this real quick and

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,640
see what it looks like.

32
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,350
What is your purpose?

33
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,240
But issued you buy.

34
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,490
Perfect.

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,390
So even though we didn't get to use the exciting underwater footage, we used quicker pacing with these

36
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,720
really sunny, bright high energy shots that when they're edited correctly with the right amount of

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,410
rhythm, they actually match up quite nicely with the main course.

38
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,770
So that was a perfect execution.

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,670
The client loved it.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,220
They got all their beach footage in one mini video.

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,320
Now let's move on to the next 15 second cut down trees.

42
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,200
OK, so there we go, we got another 15 second cut down, but they just wanted the and I mean, this

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,780
glitch is really bothering me.

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,900
I think it has to do.

45
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,250
Yeah, there we go.

46
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,160
It has to do with the overlay that I have for some.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,540
We for some reason, when it renders, it does a weird glitch.

48
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:49,180
So anyways, yeah, a client wanted another version, which is the nighttime footage and locations.

49
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,960
So I used, you know, the normal shots in the original edit.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,490
I accentuated a few things.

51
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,880
There was a time remapping here, which you could see it'll speed up.

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,290
You saw that?

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,460
I just enhanced that or increased it from the original edit so that it matched up with the audio better

54
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,840
here and went forward with, again, adjusting the pacing.

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,990
Paying attention to what the beat in the song was, doing the rhythm and cutting these shots to the

56
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,660
new parts of the song.

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,640
So here we have more of the underwater style, similar type of editing process, their clients outro

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,180
card.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,380
Take a deep breath.

60
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,200
And close your eyes, breathe it all the way out.

61
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,150
See the world of report with your contribution as your North Star.

62
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:55,560
Whether it's behind clouds or not guides to you, what is your purpose?

63
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,740
What is your why?

64
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,930
Open your eyes, see your North Star and fly.

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,430
OK, perfect.

66
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,700
So this one's a lot more calm laid back, and this is the 30 second version now that we went through

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,160
the process of how I put that together by duplicating our main sequence, moving things around, selecting

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,620
the right shots for the right moments in the new cut down audio.

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,620
Now I want to show you how I go ahead and repurpose it for specific platforms.
