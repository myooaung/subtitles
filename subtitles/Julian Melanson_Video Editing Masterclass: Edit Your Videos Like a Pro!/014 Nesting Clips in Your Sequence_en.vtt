00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.690
OK, cool.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.270
So for this shot right here, I feel like we can do a little extra something to make this a little bit

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.530
more dynamic.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.880
And this is a perfect opportunity to start talking about nesting your clips.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.140
Now, what nesting does is it basically puts your clip inside of another clip and kind of creates a

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.000
master clip on top of that.

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.600
So it's like if you have Tupperware and you have a smaller Tupperware and you put that all the contents

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.420
of that Tupperware into a bigger Tupperware, and then you close the top of that where you now have

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.310
a new outside layer that you can work with, it's kind of a fresh start.

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.540
So if we take a look at this clip, you can see what we did earlier, which was create some key frames

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.750
for the time, remapping and speed changes that we did.

12
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.750
Now, if I were to, let's say, make a cut right here, you see what that just did, how it changed

13
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.690
our speed that we did on this clip, because we're messing with like the Tupperware container of this

14
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.709
specific clip.

15
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.220
So when we nest something, let's go ahead and right click the clip and click next.

16
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.350
It's just going to ask you if you want to rename it.

17
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.750
I don't ever personally do that because the name of the clip doesn't really matter.

18
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.090
It's where the clip is in the timeline that matters.

19
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.070
So I'm going to hit.

20
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.560
OK.

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.370
Now, you can see that we have the same video clip.

22
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.410
It plays the same exact way.

23
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.560
But we can now do whatever we want to it without affecting what we had previously created key frames

24
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.970
for.

25
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.420
So we'll get even more into nesting and why you do it and when you do it.

26
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.420
But for this example, I did it because I wanted to change and alter this clip without changing and

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.210
altering what we had already created on it.

28
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.320
So we nested it to protect those changes and allow us to update the clip even more.

29
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.260
So what that update is going to be is I want to do a quick zoom on the beat to kind of spice up what's

30
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.060
going on here.

31
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.090
So we have our time remapping and right here on that snare, I'm going to make a cut.

32
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.680
And then on this other snare, I'm going to make another cut and I'm going to take this cut that we

33
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.130
just made.

34
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.330
Now we have three clips.

35
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.090
We started with one.

36
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.970
Now we have three.

37
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.440
So we can individually change whatever we want to.

38
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.020
These three on the scale this up to one ten.

39
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.410
I'm going to scooted over a little bit so that we're not losing the camera too much, because as you

40
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.250
can see, if I scale it up, the camera goes even more at frame.

41
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.100
So I scaled it up to 110 and then I'm going to scoot over the position to keep the edge of the camera

42
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.700
in frame.

43
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.950
OK.

44
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.990
And I'm going to go to this third clip that we have, and I'm going to try scaling this up to 120.

45
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.380
And I'm going to scoot it over, kind of scoot it down, too, so that we're not losing any of this.

46
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.990
And let's see what that looks like.

47
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.000
So, as you can see, it makes it a little bit of a cooler music video style for this specific sequence.

48
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.800
Now to add a little bit more sauce to this final shot, as you can see, again, we have this time remapping

49
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.850
that we had done.

50
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.480
I'm going to do the same technique of nesting so that we can update and add even more changes without

51
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.150
it being affected by this time remapping frames.

52
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.180
So I'm going to right click the clip hit nest hit.

53
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.160
OK, and then we now have the same shot, but with a fresh, clean slate to work with.

54
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.450
And I'm going to create a scale keyframe at the beginning.

55
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.310
Create one at the end.

56
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.420
Go to that beginning shot and let's scale this way up and let's see what this looks like.

57
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.890
OK.

58
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.950
OK, that's interesting, that's a little bit too much for my personal taste.

59
00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.150
Let's try one twenty

60
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.210
now instead of zooming out, we're going to zoom in.

61
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.610
It looks kind of cool to.

62
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.310
OK, I'm really liking that, so let's get a comparison.

63
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.340
I'm going to hold alt click and drag this clip up so that we have two options to look at.

64
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.950
And I'm going to right click and I'm going to remove the attributes that we just added.

65
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.320
OK.

66
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.810
This is a great way to get rid of key frames that you've added.

67
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.890
Opacity changes, motion changes to the positioning, whatever it is.

68
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.820
You can individually click it in here, even volume changes as well.

69
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.260
So I'm going to click motion because we added a motion scaling keyframe.

70
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.460
I'm going to hit OK.

71
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.530
That's going to remove the key frames that we added on this duplicate clip.

72
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.030
And let's hit play.

73
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.490
So that shot looks good.

74
00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.960
That's our original.

75
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.930
Now let's see are update.

76
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.030
Slight little different change in the scaling, and I really like that, that's just a little extra

77
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.770
something that makes the pixels of that image just look a little bit cooler.

78
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:25.080
And now that we have our picture locked and updated, the next lecture is going to be all about stylizing

79
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.210
and coloring our content.

80
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.820
So I will see you in the next lecture.
