00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.430
Here's something interesting.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.770
We have a situation here in this edit where there's kind of any abrupt cut here.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.210
I finish what I'm saying.

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.710
OK, but then I.

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.560
There's something in the video that I don't want to be there.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.100
OK.

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:27.190
So one thing that you can do so that a court doesn't feel so abrupt is to match certain things in that

8
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.060
end of that cut into something similar in the next cut.

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:43.180
Now, I do kind of a quick, like head turn here, and that actually flows perfectly into action in

10
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.430
the next shot with a similar type of movement or motion.

11
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.320
So that person's eye is going to be looking right here at me as I'm turning.

12
00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.070
And in that next shot, there's a foot coming in the frame that's also moving rather than turning.

13
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.390
But it creates more of a seamless cut.

14
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:13.390
Now, if I were to, for example, start this shot, maybe here where there's not that intro motion

15
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.130
into the clip, let's see what that looks like.

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.040
That is a waterfall.

17
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.900
You see, it's almost like there was something weird hanging out right there that makes the next shot,

18
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.310
kind of there's kind of a weird, you know, a weird subtlety.

19
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.250
But these things I want you to be able to really pick up on at this stage, to start thinking in a way

20
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.990
of how you're creating something that looks unique and feels great when someone watches it.

21
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:50.530
So we have this without using a similar motion in the next frame, the next clip to kind of mask a little

22
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.100
bit of an issue.

23
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.900
We had there was the waterfall and then we have that one that helps fix that problem.

24
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.250
Right.

25
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.110
So the shot that you have is always having a communication or a dialogue with the next shot.

26
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.949
Every frame is talking to the next frame, which is talking to the next frame.

27
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.800
And you create a whole string in your edit that creates this wonderful conversation that builds a whole

28
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.370
story.

29
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.970
So any time there's a little bit of a weird word in your frame that's kind of a mistake or something

30
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.760
that sticks out, it's going to throw off the viewer.

31
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.010
So these are cool little things that you can kind of pick up on to keep things smooth and feeling really

32
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.700
good in your edits.

33
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.950
It's stuff that you've felt, but you've never been able to put a word to why it is that you feel that

34
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.250
way.

35
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.350
So let's keep it moving here.

36
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.500
OK, so here's something I'm noticing here.

37
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.630
Both of these shots have a really great pan, a nice, smooth pan to show the scenery, but they're

38
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.010
going in different directions.

39
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.840
So there's two ways to get around that.

40
00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.460
You can either reverse the speed of one of your clips or you can flip the orientation of the clip to

41
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.450
change its direction.

42
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.880
Let's do both of those and see which one we like the most.

43
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.030
So I'm going to right click my second clip here.

44
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.880
I'm going to go up to speed and duration.

45
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.610
And I'm going to click reverse speed.

46
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.370
This is going to make the beginning, the end and the end.

47
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.000
The beginning.

48
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.500
So let's see what that looks like.

49
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.480
OK, don't worry about the audio or the audio is going to play in reverse.

50
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.550
OK, so that works OK.

51
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.560
That's one option.

52
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.370
So I'm going to undo what we just did and now I'm going to do the second option, which is to flip the

53
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.030
orientation of that clip.

54
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:53.360
So I just added the horizontal flip filter here that I typed in from the effects tab, the effects panel.

55
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.310
And now let's play through.

56
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.380
OK, I'm liking that a lot more.

57
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.810
I'm thinking that fits better because the coloring here is kind of a tan and green and then the coloring

58
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.700
here is kind of a tan in green versus when we flipped.

59
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.020
Excuse me.

60
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.560
When we reversed the image.

61
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.150
Now it's kind of a dark black green, because that's what's at the end of the clip, which doesn't really

62
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.380
cut together in my eyes as cleanly as that does.

63
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.720
Cool, so that feels like a nice concluding shot.

64
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.970
We have our edit now at 49 seconds, which is perfect.

65
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.470
Our aim was to create something under a minute.

66
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.270
And now the next thing to do is to take a look at the entire edit from start to finish.
