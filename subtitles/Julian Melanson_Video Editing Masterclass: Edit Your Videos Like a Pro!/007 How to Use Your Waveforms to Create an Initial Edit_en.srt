1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:09,660
Now, what I want to kind of share here is how to go ahead and read your waveforms so we can tell just

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,540
by looking at the waveform that this is not going to be used.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,970
None of this stuff is going to be used.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,340
Here you can see talking, talking, talking, talking, OK.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,350
No talking.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:19,770
Right.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,020
So what we want to do in this first initial step is to go ahead and delete what we're not going to use.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,140
So what is up, guys?

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,160
I wanted to actually add this lecture or series of lectures.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,230
OK.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,160
And we can go to the end of this tape.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,210
So let's get into it and we can delete what we don't need.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,190
And now we go to the next cut.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,930
So, first of all, I want to kind of show you and we can go ahead and remove this excess shot.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,340
Right.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,720
And you can see it's really clean and mundane.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,900
There's not a lot of going on in the background.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,990
It's really just a very clean shot and I'm doing that.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,970
And in this first process here, I'm just removing these extra amount of space that we don't need shot.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,750
And we're not worrying about what's going to make it in the final edit right here.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,310
We're not worrying about what our viewers are going to see in the final video.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,760
We just want to start trimming out what's not needed so that we can start to see our edit take shape,

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,940
start to take shape.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,160
OK, now it looks like I did it take here.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,940
And the footage is actually blurry now until I figure out if I redid this take.

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,870
I'm assuming that I definitely did.

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,670
But until I figure that out, I'm going to wait and leave it in just in case.

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,040
That's the only usable take that I have.

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,880
And what we're going to be effectively doing here is building our SELEX sequence that's going to start

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,560
to look like this versus the original raw sequence, which looks like this with a lot of extra space

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,020
and a lot of mistakes and areas that just aren't going to make it in the final edit.

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,500
So I'm going to continue to read my waveforms, which is going to save a lot of time in the long run,

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,920
because you can go ahead and scrub through the video hit play to see if that's a good part, scrub through,

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,020
hit play, scrub through, hit play.

35
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,650
Or you can look at your waveform.

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,990
You know, nothing's there, nothing's there.

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,740
Nothing's there.

38
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,250
So I can really ninja my way, scrub right to where it ends up to right where it begins, scrubbing

39
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,360
right to where it ends.

40
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,160
Do the same thing.

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:49,080
Scrub here, scrub to here, and continuously let the audio of my clips dictate where my initial cuts

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
are going to be for the selection process.

43
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,880
So now I'm going to go ahead and finish pulling the Selex on this initial intro footage, and we'll

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,900
see what we get next.
