1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:08,940
Great, so let's dive right back in here, so I'm going to go and grab my voiceover for this video.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,910
Now we have all of our Selex and we have the voiceover.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,110
It's going to go in.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:25,500
So what I'm going to do is drag this in and you can instantly see our voiceover is around 10 minutes

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,030
when all the footage that we have is around 30 or 40 minutes.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,280
So we definitely have some work to do.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,940
Even though we've cut all these Selex, we still have way more than we need.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,390
Now, I kind of feel like I'm repeating myself, so I'm just going to stop doing that.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,560
So the next thing we want to do is we have a voiceover in.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,650
We want to lock off this voice layer.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,090
And the reason we want to do that in this step of our YouTube video is if I were to let me actually

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,540
take it off and if I were to make a cut here and I want to move that and then I want to cut here and

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,440
move this year.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,480
You can see what it just did to our voiceover.

15
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,460
So I'm gonna undo what we just did.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:10,930
OK.

17
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:17,170
We don't want to cut any of this because our voiceover is done and it's ready for footage to be synched

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,930
up to it on top of the voiceover.

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,330
So we're going to lock it off.

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:30,100
Then we're going to make sure that any of the audio that we have from our cutaway shots, all this viral

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,780
is muted in this situation.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,120
Some of your videos, you will use the audio from your cutaway shots in this one.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,610
I know there's no audio from this empty space there are going to be using.

24
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,800
I know that there is no audio from any of this.

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,340
I know that there's no audio from this stuff that we're going to be using.

26
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,360
So it's muted.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,500
Now, the process starts from the very beginning.

28
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,030
We're going to save this, actually.

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:03,550
But now the process starts to now cut these Selex that we've pulled together in a way that syncs up

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,130
and is married, basically synchronized to the voiceover that we have.

31
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,910
The voiceover is going to be the driving force that dictates what shots were showing.

32
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,930
And then there's going to be music in the background, which we'll get to that in probably a few learning

33
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,410
lessons.

34
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,920
That's going to be a secondary kind of adding emotional, energetic kind of addition.

35
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,950
So what I'm going to do is listen to my voice and I'm gonna let that dictate where I'm cutting filming

36
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,520
space.

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,610
I'm choosing.

38
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,900
So right there is the first point where I kind of change.

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:44,000
What I'm talking about, I'm choosing this extra room at my house because I can renovated.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,530
I can move things around.

41
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,120
It's a clean slate to work with.

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,070
I mean, look at it.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,520
It's a pretty dang clean slate.

44
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,570
Empty walls, empty floor, empty ceiling, everything super echoey here.

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,000
But we're going to fix that in the later steps.

46
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,040
So when you're going and you're choosing your filming space, make sure it's somewhere at your house

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,020
that's not going to get a lot of extra noise from outside and that you're going to be able to move things

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,900
around and really make it unique to you.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,860
Then we want to get so that actually synched up pretty good.

50
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,550
There wasn't really a need for a whole lot of cutting in this portion.

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,900
So let's now move to what will be step two of this process.

52
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,090
And when we get later in this edit as well, we're going to add cool title cards to these different

53
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,600
step main steps that we get to.

54
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,030
So that'll be a cool moment that we'll get to as well.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,910
Then we want to gather inspiration.

56
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,740
So I went through I pulled three creative spaces that I really liked.

57
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,100
You got this lightsaber guy.

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,100
We have this creator that has a really nice, minimal, modern, clean space, but it's a little bit

59
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,610
cold.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,490
And then we got this guy, I believe.

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,870
OK, so I notice there's an extra gap in this voiceover, so let's go ahead and scoot over.

62
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,710
It's a little bit cold, and then we got the.

63
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,150
Well, they called and then we got this guy.

64
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,480
I believe his name is Armando.

65
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,010
Really cool space, very unique background, excellent lighting.

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,510
So those are the three that I wanted to use and refit.

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,540
It's into my own space.

68
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,040
Next up is our.

69
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,970
So this shot came in a little bit too early.

70
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,709
OK.

71
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,210
Base next up is our brainstorming in concept creation phase.

72
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,140
This is where we're taking the inspiration that we gathered from online.

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,360
What people are doing, what they're not doing, and we're going to mix that with this space that we

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,050
chose.

75
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,900
So I'm doing a test shot here.

76
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,160
I got my camera with rough framing of what they want the shot to look like, and I'm getting some work

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,520
done.

78
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,170
OK, in a move this around, and we're going to mix that with this space that we chose.

79
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,010
So I'm doing a test shot here.

80
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,750
I got my camera out with rough framing of what I want the shot to look like.

81
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,830
And I'm getting some work done, moving the hands around, you know, busy day here.

82
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:14,430
But the goal of this is to see if the ideas that we came up with are going to work in our space.

83
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,760
Next up, we create our brainstorming in concept creation phase.

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,660
This is where we're taking the inspiration and we gathered from online.

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,560
OK, so I feel like this shot is getting held for too long.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,580
And then there's a moment here that I want to scoot over to here.

87
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,290
So let's go ahead and grab.

88
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:43,620
This is this is where we're taking the inspiration and we gathered from online.

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,150
We're taking the inspiration that we gathered from online, what people are doing, what they're not

90
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,140
doing, and we're going to mix that with this space that we chose.

91
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,000
So I'm doing a test shot here.

92
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,750
I got my camera out with rough framing of what I want the shot to look like.

93
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,830
And I'm getting some work done, moving the hands around, you know, busy day here.

94
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:15,390
But the goal of this is to see if the ideas that we came up with are going to work in our space like

95
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,300
air space.

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,190
OK.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,390
Take out this extra room, scoot this over.

98
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,450
Next up, we create our purchase list and we really want to max out our credit cards here because that's

99
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:38,390
going to give us some more motivation to really take our video creating creativity and career a lot

100
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,200
more seriously.

101
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,620
Why?

102
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,790
Because there is no choice.

103
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,140
We got to pay off our debt.

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,550
No.

105
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,660
And I'm serious here.

106
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,690
What we want to do is create a purchase list of all the items we're going to.

107
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,710
I have simply cut away some excuses over, you know, in all seriousness here, what we want to do is

108
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,890
create a purchase list of all the items we're going to need for our space.

109
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,750
I found that the best way to do that.

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,820
Yes.

111
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,440
So right here in this part of the video, I'm talking about making a purchase list for the items that

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,550
you want to purchase.

113
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,360
So I remember that I have a screen gap on my phone and I already transferred it to the laptop.

114
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,180
So I'm going to go grab that shot now and then we'll drop it in together.

115
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,700
So as you can see, we have our shot up here and we definitely don't need that part.

116
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,700
So we're going to scroll to where I'm typing in purchase lists.

117
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,990
We're going to create an endpoint.

118
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,570
Don't you love those little snappy sound effects that Apple has?

119
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,930
OK, we'll probably end up time lapsing.

120
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,220
This, I'm guessing, because.

121
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,440
Yeah, we don't need to see this in real time, but let's drag it in.

122
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,040
And I'm going to hit scale to frame so that it scales it to the same dimension of our sequence.

123
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,900
And yeah, I'm going to timelapse this, so I'm going to right click.

124
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,710
Speed.

125
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,400
Duration.

126
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:07,480
And instead of this clip being four minutes and 35 seconds, I'm going to put it to 15 seconds.

127
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,200
I found the best way to do this is to create two columns.

128
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,830
One column has all of your equipment list purchases, and then one column has all of your aesthetic

129
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,870
list purchases of what's going to go in your space to really give it more style and more character.

130
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,530
And that leads us to the Christmas phase.

131
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,990
This is OK.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,860
So that's the first four steps of pulling together a rough edit.

133
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,590
What I'm going to do now is a little bit of a time lapse and go through pulling a rough edit together

134
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,110
for the rest of these steps so that we can get on to more advanced techniques in this video.
