1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,560
Perfect, so let's hop right into this edit and get our Demario started.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:10,950
So what I did already is I gathered my handful of my past video projects.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,150
So this is just simply leave me with this real quick.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,730
This is just the final full resolution, exports.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:27,450
For some past client projects, maybe a few personal projects in here that are from the past.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:37,140
And so what you want to do is gather shots or projects where, you know, there are shots that are unique

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:46,500
that showcase your skill set, that are visually pleasing and have something unique and special about

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
them that you want to share.

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,360
That's really the key to a good demo, really, is showcasing who you are in a short amount of time

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,120
so that someone doesn't have to look through your whole website or your whole Instagram feed or your

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,380
whole whatever social media platform to go and scroll through all this different kind of content boom

12
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,710
in one piece of content.

13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,120
Just in a few seconds, they can instantly see exactly what it is that you do.

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,110
So I have all these videos right here.

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,120
Now, what we're going to do is open up our editing software.

16
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,550
We're going to create our demo reel sequence.

17
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,620
So I'm going to go to a new project.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,660
I'm going to type in let's do a demo reel, OK?

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,790
Now, I'm going to like we did a lot together during this course.

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,490
I'm going to go to the proper place here.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,830
From here, editing demo reel.

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,960
And I'm on tape and demo reel.

23
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,870
Editing folder.

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,830
Boom.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,660
It shoots it.

26
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,310
OK.

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,150
And now I'm going to drag in all my Demario files and I'm going to make this bigger and I'm going to

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:15,630
go here and I can see the video info right here, and I'm going to choose one that is the proper frame

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:15,860
rate.

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,090
We want it to be twenty three point nine, seven, six.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,800
I don't really know why some of these exports.

32
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,560
That's strange.

33
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,130
Those might have been some older exports that were export.

34
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,780
It added 30 frames per second and 60.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,630
I'm not sure how that happened.

36
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,470
But the key here is that I want to choose one like this one.

37
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,210
That is 1920 by 10, 80.

38
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,890
So it's going to be 10 ATP, which is standard, and it's going to be the right frame rate, which is

39
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,240
24 frames a second.

40
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,820
AK twenty three point nine seven six.

41
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,380
I want to right click that.

42
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:55,710
I'm going to hit new sequence from clip and then I'm going to title it demo real mean Selex.

43
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,050
Now we have a proper sequence with the proper settings.

44
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,930
And I'm going to highlight the rest of these clips.

45
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:14,010
And I'm going to go ahead and De unSelect, the one that's already in the timeline and drag me in.

46
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,740
Now we have our main video files.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,800
Oh, and I also have yeah.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,320
Just a string of just drone footage.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:31,230
And we're going to try to do something unique with having a mini drone like montage inside of this larger

50
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,830
demo reel.

51
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,580
So we'll see if we can do something cool there.

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,910
But let's go ahead and drag the rest of these video files.

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,080
So I'm gonna take all the drone footage and I'm going to drag it in.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,300
And now what we have is, oh, my God, this is an hour of footage that we're going to pull Selex on.

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,860
But there's going to be something that's going to happen here that I want to fix before we get to that.

56
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:00,510
Now, we have different sized movie files, because some of these are for case.

57
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,890
Some of these are 10 ADP.

58
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,620
You can see the four key ones are really big.

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,710
What I want to do first before I start editing anything is to select everything in the timeline.

60
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,160
And I'm going to go right click and I'm on to set and scale everything to the frame size boom.

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,280
Now, the things that need to be scaled down are scaled down, the the files that need to be scaled

62
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,810
up or scaled up.

63
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,410
And we're good to start pulling Selex.
