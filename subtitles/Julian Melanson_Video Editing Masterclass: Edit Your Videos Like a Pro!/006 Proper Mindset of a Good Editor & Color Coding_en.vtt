WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.610
And this is kind of a cool shot, we'll see if we use that.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.420
Not sure yet.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.310
This is OK.

4
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.580
But honestly, it's not going to really fit into the style of video that I want this to be.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.720
So that's something else that, you know, you want to keep in mind is that as the film or the editor,

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.730
you're going to have a certain attachment to your own footage more than anyone else.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.650
Let's say I remember this moment.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.780
I was like, oh, yeah, my friend Aiva, my friend Aissa, you know, we were at the top of that mountain

9
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.740
and it was so nice.

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.150
And I want to remember that no one else has that memory or that attachment to the footage.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.870
So if it's not adding and if it's distracting potentially to your overall edit, you're going to want

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.410
to take that out because you want to have a neutral opinion as much as possible on what is being seen.

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.670
Very clearly, this is an interesting shot to anyone who has not seen this.

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.070
Right.

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.650
This is only interesting to me because I was there and it reminds me of my friends.

16
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.830
But we're not making this as a friend memory type of edit.

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.870
So I'm going to take out that kind of shot.

18
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.730
And that's the kind of mindset I want you to have when you're pulling together, trying to decide what

19
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.110
should I use, what should I knew?

20
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.490
What should I not use?

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.520
I'm not a huge fan of this shot, to be honest.

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.770
So I'm going to go ahead and take that out.

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.820
And it's a good idea to kind of keep in mind what kind of length you want your video to be and how much

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.900
footage you're working with.

25
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:39.600
So if I zoom all the way out here and by the way, the little oh, man, what's this called slant key

26
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.550
for premiere?

27
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.380
Shows you the whole timeline.

28
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.650
If you tap it, it's below the delete key and above the return key.

29
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.040
I don't know.

30
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.450
Backslash, I think is what it's called.

31
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.690
If you tap it, you see the full timeline.

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.590
If you tap it again, it zooms back in.

33
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.630
So I want to see the whole timeline.

34
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.210
And we can see I have five minutes of footage that I want to fit into one minute of this edit.

35
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.210
So I know that stuff that I'm iffy about that I don't think I'm going to use.

36
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.449
I'm just going to go ahead and take it out completely.

37
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.630
Let's move on here to the next clip.

38
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.950
Let it play through.

39
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.910
OK, perfect.

40
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.420
So this is kind of a cool shot, and as you can see, it has what we were talking about with a beginning

41
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.830
point of interest and an ending point of interest.

42
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.320
Every shot that you have has a beginning and an end.

43
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.910
So if we hit play, OK, it starts right about there.

44
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.350
You see, there's it's like a pretty ocean or it's actually a lake.

45
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.910
And there's some movement, which is kind of nice, but it doesn't really get going until around here.

46
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.820
So I'm going to keep a little bit of I like this in the bottom.

47
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.120
Right.

48
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.740
So I'm going to cut that and start there.

49
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.530
Yeah, and then I'm going to end it there.

50
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.250
OK.

51
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.530
And you don't want to get too into the in and out point quite just yet, because we're doing a first

52
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.700
kind of initial pass.

53
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.920
But then you can start to split frames once you get into more of the refining process.

54
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.190
But what we simply did there was trimmed out the intro that didn't need to be there.

55
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.720
There was not much going on.

56
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.170
And then right about.

57
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.570
Yep, there we cut the end of the clip.

58
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.290
So now it looks like we are back in the crystal underground place.

59
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.800
So I'm going to scrub through here and see.

60
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.110
That's kind of interesting there at the beginning.

61
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.170
That's OK.

62
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.940
I'm not too excited about that.

63
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.570
OK.

64
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.520
So I do some kind of camera movement there to the ceiling, but honestly, like this one doesn't really

65
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.840
do a whole lot for me.

66
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.230
But just in case I do like seeing this cool, all the reflections here in that stone, I think that's

67
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.980
pretty unique.

68
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.120
You don't get to see that much.

69
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.240
So what I'm going to do is play it and start it when we don't really need to see any of this.

70
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.370
It gets interesting right about there.

71
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.660
So as you're going through your footage, keep this in mind of starting with the point of interest.

72
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.850
You don't want to give your viewer anything to not look at because then it's like, well, why am I

73
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.720
seeing this footage?

74
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.130
OK.

75
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.980
And I'm going to end it about there and I'm going to trim edit the rest of that out.

76
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.330
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to start to loosely organize my clips together as I'm doing

77
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.590
this initial pass.

78
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.970
So I'm going to highlight this second Chave clip.

79
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.390
OK.

80
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.130
And I'm going to drag it over to the other Chave clip.

81
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.860
But what happens is when I do that is that it deletes what was underneath it.

82
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.910
OK.

83
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.990
The way to get around that is to when you drag hold command, when you want to drop it.

84
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.470
And this is going to push everything else behind where you're dropping it off back.

85
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.600
So rather than overwriting and deleting what's below it, you're simply doing the opposite thing of

86
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.050
a ripple delete, where you're creating space and pushing everything back.

87
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.230
So now we have this cave clip, boom, and we have this next cave clip.

88
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:44.040
Now, because I'm loosely categorizing these clips together, another kind of little hack is to label

89
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.350
or color code your clips.

90
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.060
So the way I'm going to do that is by highlighting the clips.

91
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.300
I want to change the color of or put together.

92
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.950
And I'm going to right click, go to label, and then I'm going to be able to choose from any of these

93
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.550
colors.

94
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:11.340
That's going to really make it obvious what clips are from the same scene, the same time of day, the

95
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.620
same location, all different types of ways to label and organize your footage.

96
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.970
But this is a really cool way and that you'll see once we have a whole timeline cut together, Wolf.

97
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.630
It is such a good way, especially if you're a visual person, to keep these clips organized.
