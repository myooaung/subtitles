00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.220
So now what we're going to do is our final step for this edit, which is the color correction and the

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.810
color grading process.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.080
Now, there's really a few main reasons we're doing this.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.500
We're doing this to correct any mistakes in exposure that our camera may have had when filming our footage.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.600
We want to fix these mistakes so that there's a clean look and a similar look across all the clips in

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.940
our timeline, in our video.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.050
So nothing looks out of bounds.

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.550
Nothing looks out of place.

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.850
Right.

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.070
That's something that's not professional, that as soon as someone sees that, they instantly have a

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.350
opinion about the level of quality of the video.

12
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.400
So we first want to start by fixing any of those issues.

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.940
Once we do that, we go into the color grading phase where we can then create a layer of stylizing on

14
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.490
top of our footage that makes it look unique.

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.650
So we're going to get into the basics of that.

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.800
And later, in other more complex edits, we'll get even more into detail on creating a specific look.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.240
So let's get into it.

18
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.720
What I'm going to do first is mute our music, because we have our video locked.

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.290
We're not making any more edits or changes on our cuts, on our pacing, on adding any cool little visual

20
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.060
transitions or updates.

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.340
That's not what this process is about.

22
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.620
All of those should be done by the time you get to this color correction and color grading process.

23
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.900
So I'm going to mute our music to smoothly scrub through our timeline without any distractions, were

24
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.540
just purely focusing on visuals.

25
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:39.630
So I can instantly see that the blacks and what I've been saying is blacks and dark's every image that

26
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.320
you shoot is made up of contrast between the color.

27
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
It's not a color dark, but it's a quality of dark black.

28
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.540
Right.

29
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.370
There's black behind me.

30
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.990
There's white here.

31
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.170
And the image is made up of different ratios between the black and the white.

32
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.590
And that combination creates everything that you're seeing.

33
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.000
And then there's color as well.

34
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.950
We have blue, we have orange.

35
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.500
We have a green green here as well.

36
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.490
All those are making up our image.

37
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.490
So in this step, we want to balance out those different aspects of our edit.

38
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.910
Now, here, I can see that the way the camera was exposing, because I was shooting on an iPhone,

39
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.680
I wasn't shooting manually.

40
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.560
The camera is trying to do its best to expose.

41
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.000
But the contrast and the level at which the dark sorat in this image looks really good to my eye.

42
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.200
If we go here, that same black of the camera is quite a bit lighter.

43
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.540
That means the exposure is higher.

44
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.780
So here the blacks look nice here.

45
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.460
The blacks look kind of gray.

46
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.990
OK, so we're going to fix that.

47
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.650
We're going to highlight our clip when we go to the effects tab.

48
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.440
And we're going to type in luminary color or whatever color correction effect that you're editing software

49
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.020
uses.

50
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.890
And we can either double click or click and drag it onto the clip that we want to apply it to open up

51
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.240
the basic effects tab.

52
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.500
And here we have our exposure, which adjusts the brightness of all of the image.

53
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.350
We have our contrast, which crushes the blacks and increases the whites.

54
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.090
OK.

55
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.610
We have our highlights, which just increases the whites.

56
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.930
We have our shadows, which just increases or decreases.

57
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.490
The dark part of the frame.

58
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.510
And we have our whites and blacks, which does a very, very similar thing to what the highlights and

59
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.500
the shadows do.

60
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.020
It's very similar.

61
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.090
I don't really use the whites and blacks per se, because, look, if we increase the shadows here and

62
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.250
get this look and do the same thing here, there is no you can't tell the difference.

63
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.950
So I just work with the highlights and shadows.

64
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.390
So let's start by decreasing the shadows to try and get a similar exposure on our camera and on the

65
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.610
skin tone of our subject.

66
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.920
OK, that's starting to look a lot better, let's even go down negative 40.

67
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.550
And now these clips are matching up a lot better if I undo our color correction layer.

68
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.000
That's the original and that's what we're working with now.

69
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.410
So I'm pretty happy with that.

70
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.910
Let's move to the next shot.

71
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.090
The cool thing that we can do is if we have two very similar shots that need the same color treatment,

72
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:49.360
we can simply copy by selecting the color correction layer that we want to do command see highlighting

73
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.410
the clip we want to apply it to and hit command V to paste.

74
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.180
That's one way to do it.

75
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.680
The other way to do it is to right click the clip that has the layer that we want to use it copy.

76
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.240
Go to the click.

77
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.150
We want to assign that same exact layer to and hit paste attributes.

78
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.000
Now, here's where we were kind of working with before about copying and pasting the motion of a different

79
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.210
clip.

80
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.900
We don't want to change the motion and positioning of the clip.

81
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.760
We purely just want to apply the colouring effect.

82
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.640
So that is the second way to do that process.

83
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.800
OK.

84
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.270
These are all looking good.

85
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.060
OK.

86
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:48.040
I think that these last few clips here could use a little bit darker dark's similar to what we did here.

87
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.440
So I'm going to go ahead and paste what we did by copying and hitting paste on this first clip to see

88
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.100
what it does.

89
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.480
OK.

90
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.130
I think that's a little bit too dark.

91
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.140
These didn't need quite as much of it, so I'm gonna do half do negative 20.

92
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.340
OK, that's looking pretty good.

93
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.440
So now that I know that looks good, I'm now going to copy this new one with negative 20 instead of

94
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.190
negative 10.

95
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.090
I'm going to highlight the rest of the clips that I know need updating.

96
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.710
I'm going to hit paste.

97
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.630
And let's check out the edit.

98
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.060
OK, that's looking pretty good.

99
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.420
We've called corrected the clips in our sequence.

100
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.050
And now it's time to add a cool looking stylizing to all the clips.
