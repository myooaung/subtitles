1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,790
So we've made it to the final stage of our edit, and now that you're becoming an expert, Ed, can

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,130
you guess what we're going to be doing in this stage?

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:08,840
Hmm.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,200
Yes, we're going to be doing the color correction and color grading process, because what we already

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,730
have here looks pretty darn good.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,210
I mean, you can't really go wrong with shooting with a location like this and having a subject that's

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,080
performing with a violin.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,230
I mean, that's pretty -- cool.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,960
But just like with the stabilization process, there's a little extra time that we're going to spend

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,440
on this.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,930
Refinement is going to make the colors pop.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,600
It's going to make the imagery stand out a little bit more.

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,590
And it's going to bring up the production value of our final product.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,170
So let's hop into the color correction and color grading process.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,670
All right.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,370
And so your timeline should be looking relatively similar to what we have here.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,770
If you've been working on the violin footage, if you've been working on your own project with your

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,240
own past footage, be sure to have had your first edit done.

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,490
And your second refinement edit done, ideally with some post-production stabilization.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,090
And now your edit is ready to be stylized with some coloring.

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,860
So to save time and really do this the right way.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,820
What we want to start by doing is first, scrubbing through our footage and seeing any shots that stand

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,200
out and don't match other shots instantly.

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,140
I can see there is a pretty decent exposure difference in this transition from these two shots.

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,790
So what I'm going to do is select the second shot, go to Effect's, type in lume tricolour or type

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:52,530
in whatever color filter title that you're editing software uses for it.

27
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,340
Drop it on.

28
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,090
And we're going to hit up and we're going to hit up.

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,030
We're going to open up the basic color correction panel.

30
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,090
And what we're going to do here is we could drop the exposure, but you're going to see what that's

31
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,720
going to do.

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,610
It's almost going to drop the opacity, which here's the thing.

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,740
This exposure is nice and this one is a little bit over.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,120
So rather than dropping the exposure, something you can do to drop down the overall intensity of light

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,050
but create an even better looking image is to really bring the shadows down instead, because that's

36
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,140
going to create more depth.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,070
There's going to be more I don't know what other word to use besides depth in the shadows, but there's

38
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:46,470
going to be more of a contrasty, stylized look by dropping the shadows, because you're just pushing

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,760
down the dark parts of the frame.

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,430
You're leaving the middle and you're leaving the bright parts of the same to stand out rather than bringing

41
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,390
down the exposure, which is bringing down the darks, the maids and the lights.

42
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,780
Right.

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,500
The blacks, the midtown and the white tone.

44
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,550
I don't know if tone is the right word, but you know what I'm trying to say here.

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,410
So we're just going to bring down the shadows, just a touch so that these shots now are starting to

46
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,940
match up a lot better.

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,340
There's also a little bit of a color difference here.

48
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,030
You can see is a lot more Tannen's going on in this image.

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,230
And this one is feeling a bit more blue and cold, but it's not too bad.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,570
It's nice.

51
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,460
We get the tans here once the shot pans around, but.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,870
We could, if we wanted to add a little bit of an increase in color temperature to bring up some more

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,340
warmth in this shot.

54
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,900
So that's the original that's what the color temperature increase we could do a little bit more.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,560
Let's do 10.

56
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,240
OK, perfect.

57
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,830
So without with subtle, but you can see that that's a little bit more bluish and that's got some more

58
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,580
Tanzimat, which is perfect when we want to match our shots.

59
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,810
So that shot looks fine.

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,410
Let's continue to scrub forward here.

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:16,079
Now, this is a scenario when the exposure in the overall image is pretty good, but the way our subject

62
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,770
is positioned and the way she's kind of backlit and we don't have an external light over here.

63
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,790
Out of frame.

64
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,540
We don't have a Phil card over here bouncing light on her face.

65
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,870
We didn't have that during the shooting process.

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,900
Now, what we can do is, like I said, the overall exposure is great, but her exposure on her face

67
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,700
is a little bit dark.

68
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,740
So there's two ways we can do this.

69
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:50,560
One way is to push up the shadows, because you can see this is all going to be affected by shadow parameters.

70
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,480
OK, because these are all dark's.

71
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,900
These are all lights, OK?

72
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,570
So if I boost the highlights, that's really going to start bringing up the exposure on all the bright

73
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,440
parts of the frame.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,680
We don't want to do that because the bright parts of the frame are already bright.

75
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,540
What the problem is, is that the dark part of the frame, which happens to be her face in this shot,

76
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,270
is a little on the dark side.

77
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,720
So we can push that up and bring some more exposure to her face.

78
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,650
Of course, it is going to affect the shadows in the rest of the shot.

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:32,040
But it's perfect for focusing on her face for this shot, particularly so without and with this out

80
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,580
inwith.

81
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,000
So that's a little bit better.

82
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,730
That's one option, one way to do it.

83
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:43,830
Now, the other option, I'm going to go ahead and turn this off and I'm going to put on a new color

84
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,890
correction layer so that we can see the difference between option one and option two.

85
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:58,260
Now, option two is to create a mask that is only affecting an area of our frame that we want it to

86
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,920
affect.

87
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,590
Now, there's two or three actual ways to do this.

88
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,230
We have our Elipse mask, a square mask and our pen tool.

89
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,950
If we click the Ellipse mask, what this is going to do is it's going to add a circular mask to our

90
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,870
image that's affecting where our color correction is going to affect our image.

91
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:27,270
So if I turn this up instantly, we can see where we're affecting the exposure only on this part of

92
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,590
the frame, which is pretty cool.

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,440
That's a really handy tool to have.

94
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,420
Now to blend our mask so there's not an hard edge.

95
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,730
And it's obvious that there's a mask there.

96
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,820
We can feather the edges of our mask by changing the intensity of the mask feather.

97
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,170
And we can change the opacity of that mask as well, which is going to also change the intensity of

98
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,430
the masks effect.

99
00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:00,570
And then we can change the expansion of how wide or narrow the mask is.

100
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:08,370
And lastly, we can invert our mask so we can actually affect the opposite of where the mask is.

101
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,320
So let's go ahead and delete this.

102
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm going to click the mask it delete.

103
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,010
And we can also do this square icon here to create a square mask.

104
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,800
If there was something that we knew in the frame was had right angles to it.

105
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,920
We can do the square mask to kind of save time.

106
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,340
We will be able to move the points of the frame of the mask around to match up our image.

107
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,270
Of course, that's not the style of mass we're going to be doing in this situation.

108
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,590
And lastly, if we really wanted to affect a very particular part of the frame that wasn't a square

109
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,250
was in a circle.

110
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,040
And we wanted to take the time to really draw in our mask, to make a very unique shape.

111
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:58,110
We can use the pen tool and literally outline our subject by hand.

112
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,630
Now you can get as complex or as detailed with this as you want.

113
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm going to change the zoom so that we zoom out a little bit and I have some room to select around

114
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,030
the frame outside of the actual image to finish off the mask.

115
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,180
And you can really fine tune this.

116
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,330
You can move this around.

117
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,170
You can also hold ALT to create curves instead of right angles, which is really great in a lot of situations,

118
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,370
so that your mask looks a lot more organic with curves.

119
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:45,470
And you can actually use these little lassos to even more fine tune where the mask is in your frame.

120
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,360
So squeeze out, OK, we don't need this to curve here.

121
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,770
OK.

122
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:59,510
I'm going to zoom back out here, fit it to the window and turn the effect back on.

123
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,780
And now we can see we're just affecting our subject now, monitoring the exposure down, because this

124
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,910
is definitely not the look we're going for.

125
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,210
So I'm just going to turn it up a little bit and boost the shadows just a little bit, 10 percent.

126
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,550
And now I want to further out the edges so that it's not so obvious as a mask.

127
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,280
There you can see that's without the mask.

128
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,340
That's with the mask.

129
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,310
We're just adding a subtle little fill layer of light on our subject.

130
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,350
And if we're happy with that.

131
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,210
Perfect.

132
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:40,790
But to take it one step even further, we can actually keyframe the path and positioning of our mask

133
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,960
frame by frame.
