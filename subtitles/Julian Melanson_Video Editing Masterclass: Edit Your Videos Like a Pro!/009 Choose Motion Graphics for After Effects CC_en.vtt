00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.660
Now our edit is looking good, we have all of our graphic titles now what I want to do is, like I mentioned,

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.060
add something a little bit more professional.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.320
It's going to stand out at the end of this video.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.379
So that kind of gets into the motion graphic category.

5
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.900
And a program like After Effects is something that's perfect for that.

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.470
So I want to dive into using that platform or that program a little bit in this edit and show you how

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.260
I do that for all my past and current actually client projects.

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.850
So rather than creating a project from scratch for, you know, these more in-depth motion graphics,

9
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.520
one of the sites that I've used for years is video.

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.190
I've done that.

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.930
So you can see up here video, hi, dot net.

12
00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.710
And what it does is it gives you these premade template graphic assets so you can see if I click on

13
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.500
one of these and hit play here.

14
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.120
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

15
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.600
Right.

16
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.170
OK.

17
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
That would have taken me like a week to create.

18
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.850
OK.

19
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.560
So there's tons.

20
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.670
I have like, you know, four pages of stuff that I've just bought and used over the years.

21
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.970
This one's 18 bucks.

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.340
It would have taken me days to create.

23
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.530
So it's definitely well worth the money when you want to have something that stands out.

24
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.470
Right.

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.190
It's not just white text on the screen.

26
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.860
This is OK to have white text on screen because this is more about information being provided.

27
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.490
It doesn't need to look fancy.

28
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.500
And honestly, you don't want to distract too much when it's overlaid on top of footage.

29
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.930
The thing with a motion graphic is that most of the time it's going to be a whole image on itself.

30
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.150
This is overlaid on top of footage.

31
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:07.650
But when we get into something that's as in depth and has as much detail going on as one like this,

32
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.210
you don't really want to overlay this on footage a whole lot of the time because it might be a little

33
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.310
too much to take in.

34
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.000
Right.

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.360
So we're going to use this as an outro motion graphic.

36
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.750
So I've got a good feeling that knowing these different graphics that I've already used over the years,

37
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.160
this one right here is going to be good for the kind of professional vibe that we're going for.

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.170
We want something elegant.

39
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.510
We want something to match up with a high end real estate property.

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.210
So we're going to go for something and a motion graphic that matches that vibe.

41
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.300
So because I've already purchased this, I'm going to go ahead and click download and we're going to

42
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.550
open it up inside after effects.

43
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.380
And before I do that, if you want, you can go to video Hy's, you know, or site that similar.

44
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.710
You know, there's tons of Instagram ads that pop up now these days for different kind of preset packs,

45
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.620
transition packs after effects packs.

46
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.470
And there's plenty out there and it's well worth the ten to twenty dollars to purchase when you really

47
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.280
like, because then you'll have it permanently for years to come.

48
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.610
So let's get into after effects and start this edit.
