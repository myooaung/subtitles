00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.120
OK, so I was actually done with this chapter, with this, you know, lesson, but I just remembered

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.990
that there's actually one kind of bonus tip in technique I wanted to just throw in here as a little

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.920
extra gift.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.890
So what this is going to be is a looping trailer, that it's kind of a cool, unique thing to do.

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.610
You know, it's almost like taking an Instagram boomerang to like the total upgrade next level.

6
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.340
So let's first start with duplicating our favorite thing to do here or a main sequence at 16 by nine.

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
This is just going to be the easiest way to demonstrate this process.

8
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.770
And I want to type this looping trailer.

9
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.960
So this is going to be like a 10 or 15 second looping video.

10
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.880
Now, what I want to look for, though, actually, let me open this up, OK?

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850
Let me close the other sequences.

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.060
We don't need those anymore.

13
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.160
And what I'm going to be looking for is like the most exciting part of the edit, which this could arguably,

14
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.380
arguably, arguably be that.

15
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.420
So let's take these shots

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.860
and.

17
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.700
Yeah, let's take these and let's skew these to the front.

18
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:27.470
So we have boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

19
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.180
OK, now we have the most one of the most exciting parts of the edit.

20
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.240
Now let's take one of the most exciting, audible parts of the edit as well.

21
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.130
So let's take this part and let's delete what's in front of it, just like what we did on the visuals.

22
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.730
Let's go ahead, scoot over what we don't need.

23
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.320
OK, perfect, that actually synched up pretty dang well.

24
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.730
Now, what I'm going to do is just kind of get everything else pushed back so we can just focus on this

25
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.710
little mini trailer that we're doing now.

26
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.970
I'm going to lock off our audio track and I'm going to duplicate our video track.

27
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.740
And now.

28
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.570
What we have is kind of a Instagram boomerang on steroids.

29
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.860
Right, so I can even extend this track out.

30
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.990
Let's say we want to make this, I don't know, 40 seconds.

31
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.310
Or even loop right here, there's no real need to make it longer, but we can have it restart right

32
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.640
here.

33
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.360
So.

34
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.970
Let's do that.

35
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.250
Boom.

36
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.420
And making outpoint.

37
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:14.750
So effectively, we have this really cool looping visual kind of montage, but the track continues just

38
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.500
like you can hear.

39
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.940
And this is just kind of like a visual candy teaser that you can release, you know, before you release

40
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.600
a project or a video, is you take an exciting part and you loop it a bunch of times.

41
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.960
Now, let's do this one more time at a different part of the edit.

42
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.080
Let's go ahead to our second track.

43
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.040
So I'm just going to delete everything that's in front of it.

44
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.930
And we duplicated our sequence so we don't need to worry about deleting anything important here.

45
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.870
Let's go ahead and drag this over a little bit.

46
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.480
Let's go here, create an endpoint.

47
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.710
Let's just delete the rest of this and let's find which shots we want to use.

48
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.310
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

49
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.290
OK.

50
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.190
Let's do that.

51
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.400
And let's remove the rest and put these all on the same track just so it's a little bit easier.

52
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.300
And we can kind of make these all the same color boom.

53
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.630
And I'm going to hold alt click and drag it over now.

54
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.830
Highlight both of them.

55
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.960
And now we have it repeating four times.

56
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.700
You can drag over our audio.

57
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.580
Take off the volume, key frames.

58
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.960
Go to the end, create an outpoint and see what we did.

59
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.010
It's.

60
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.000
OK, perfect.

61
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.990
So right before the instrumentals change, right about here would be perfect to create an outpoint so

62
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.820
that it loops just this part.

63
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.820
So just like on Facebook or Instagram on the news feed, there's an auto play function and auto looping

64
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.420
function.

65
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.900
This is a really cool teaser trailer, like I mentioned, that you can take what you've already done

66
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.370
and drop a video before getting people excited leading up to the launch of your project, of your demo

67
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.530
reel, and just kind of get the whole thing, get people more hyped up about it.

68
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.020
So I hope you enjoy this extra tip and I will see you in the next video lesson.
