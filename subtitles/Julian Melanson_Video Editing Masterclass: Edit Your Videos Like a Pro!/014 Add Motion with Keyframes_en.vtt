00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.180
So let's first go through here and you can see that at the end of the shot, there's a little bit of

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.530
a pan to the left.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.610
OK, so I want to match that movement by adding a pan here on this next shot.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.500
That'll kind of smooth things out a bit.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.260
So what I'm going to do is select this clip and I'm going to create a key frame.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.830
OK.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.910
I'm going to go to the effects control panel of this clip by you can double click it and then scroll

8
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.460
over to the effects control panel or do it how it is done in your editing software.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.930
And I'm going to click this little stopwatch icon, which is going to create a key frame.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.920
Now, a key frame is simply saying at this point, at this moment, I want you to be here.

11
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.980
And at this point, in this moment, I want you to be here.

12
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.770
Whether that's a scale change, a zoom in or zoom out, a motion change, whatever it is, it's saying

13
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.620
at this stopwatch moment, I want you here at this.

14
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.990
And so it creates that change over time.

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.240
So I'm going to create a key frame at the beginning of this clip, and then I'm going to scroll to the

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.720
end of the clip and I'm going to scooch the position over by dragging the position parameter points.

17
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.160
So as you can see now, when I scrub through the video, there's that motion that's been added.

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.880
OK.

19
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.500
So let's see how that does for that edit.

20
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.410
Oh, OK, perfect, and even kind of blends in to the next edit.

21
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.790
So let's take a look at that without what we just did.

22
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.950
So I'm going to go ahead and duplicate this.

23
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.200
And another way to duplicate is to click the video file that you want pulled out and drag it to wherever

24
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.620
you want it to go and let go of the click, let go folding it, and that's going to create another duplicate

25
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.700
of that same clip.

26
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.520
And I'm going to right click it and I'm going to remove the attributes that we just added to the clip.

27
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.470
So we have this version very stagnant, and then we have the new version with that motion.

28
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.220
So motion is huge when it comes to the flow of your videos.

29
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.080
If there's no motion, there's no movement.

30
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.820
There's not as much of a flow.

31
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.640
If you're linking motion in between your cuts, you're adding a whole new level of fluidity to your

32
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.270
entire edit.

33
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.900
So now that we did that, I'm going to go ahead and check that out for our list here.

34
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.370
So next, let's go ahead and move into the audio refining of our edit, and then we'll take another

35
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.500
pass through where we observe the entire edit as a whole and see if there's any more changes in the

36
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.250
video or audio that needs to be done as a final refinement.
