1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,160
So I want you to kind of play your footage while I'm playing mine and we're going to play it through

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,940
and we're going to just kind of neutrally watch the edit and we're going to see what catches our eye

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:19,350
or catches our ear that we have a feeling and gives us a feeling that there needs to be something changed

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,730
or updated for you.

5
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,160
OK, so what really caught my eye first is we've got a lot of great movement.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,530
We've got a lot of great action in all of these shots.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,870
And when we get to this shot, it's the energy stops.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,910
It's it's two still.

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,610
There's really no action going on.

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,630
So because we don't want that shot to stand out in that kind of way.

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,330
You can have contrast and shots where every shot has a certain look, a certain feeling, and then,

12
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,420
boom, we hit a different shot where we want to really emphasize or make that shot stand out on purpose.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,780
This is not one of those scenarios where we want to break that kind of rule on purpose.

14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,460
We want to do is make this shot match up with the other ones.

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,680
So this will take some experimenting.

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,910
So let's first start by highlighting the clip and we're going to go to the effects panel and we're going

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,460
to do a scale keyframe here.

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,700
We're going to hit the stopwatch to start our keyframe.

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,100
And we're going to go to the end of the clip and we're going to try scaling it up.

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,850
So I'm going to go from a hundred to, let's say, one O five.

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,820
And let's see what that looks like.

22
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,720
So that's a lot better.

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,790
I'm liking that.

24
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,360
Zoom in.

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,880
Any time you're zooming into something coming closer, you're creating more of a.

26
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,720
I don't put that into words.

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,270
You're creating more.

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,890
And if someone hands you a photograph and you really like what you're seeing, you're going to like,

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,520
oh, yeah.

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,800
And you going to pull because you're not going to go like, oh, yeah, put it away for you.

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,800
This is really great.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,550
I'm loving this.

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:16,210
So it's just two different feelings that it creates by going into something versus leaving something.

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,580
So when we do it scale up, we're creating more action going into the motion.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,900
When we do a scale out or zoom out, we're doing the opposite.

36
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,630
So if we have the zoom in here,

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,520
let's go ahead and flip it.

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,410
So I'm going to take that final key frame and I'm going to put out the beginning and put the beginning

39
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,520
keyframe at the end.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,150
So now we're going to be moving from one hundred and five for the scale to 100.

41
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,360
Let's see what that looks like.

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,500
OK.

43
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,750
I want to undo so we get back to the original.

44
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,050
So as an editor, it's good to remind yourself that if you want more interest, more energy, more intensity

45
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,750
of what's happening in your frame, you can zoom into it.

46
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,690
If you want to feel like that shot is ending or that scene is ending or that part of the video is over.

47
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,770
You can zoom out and create that effect.

48
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,670
Now, if I wanted to create even more intensity or let's say that for some reason this battery was really

49
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,460
important for the storyline or for the video you're working on.

50
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,740
We can scale it up even more.

51
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,620
So instead of one or five, let's hit 115.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,880
So you can see even more of a quicker zoom in.

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,540
So as a final kind of thing we can do here, because for this shot specifically and for other shots

54
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,110
that you'll be working with, there's always going to be a point of interest, an object of interest.

55
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,890
It's where the viewer's eye is naturally going to be drawn towards, because this image specifically

56
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,730
has no interest here in the background, not much interest in the foreground for the viewer to be looking

57
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:12,230
at their eye is going to be drawn to where the movement motion and objects are in the frame, which

58
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,230
is the battery, because we're zooming into the battery, we're creating more of an interesting shot.

59
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:30,890
But if we want to take things a bit of a step further, we can add a position key frame along with our

60
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,310
scaling zoom key frames that we're doing.

61
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,600
We can change the up and down, up and down side to side movement of our actual video clip.

62
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:49,700
So I'm going to slide over at the end of our clip, our video to the right, and I'm going to move it

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:59,660
up slightly so that we're kind of actually going to move it down so that we are gradually going into

64
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,070
where the battery is versus just scaling up the center of the image.

65
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,670
We're actually going to where the battery is in the frame.

66
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,600
Let's see that.

67
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:22,780
So what that does is it makes the focal point of where the viewer is looking even more laser focused

68
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,810
on the part where the camera is zooming into if the camera is zooming into the center of the image.

69
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,580
Yeah, it's going to be some like perspective change or there's going to be some more scaling up of

70
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,870
what's going on in the frame.

71
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,530
But if it's zooming directly into that object that they are probably looking at, it creates even more

72
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,880
of a dramatic effect.
