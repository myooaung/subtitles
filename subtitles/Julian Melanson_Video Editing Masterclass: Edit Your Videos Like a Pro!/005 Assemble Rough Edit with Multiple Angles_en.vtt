1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.190
So now I'm going to kind of make some extra room here in our timeline, because we're working with one

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.240
to seven different layers for this specific project.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
And we like that because why, as an editor, we like to have options.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.460
Right.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.230
So let's go ahead and start playing this through and see what are different angles are looking like.

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:33.880
I'm actually going to switch the resolution playback quality from full to half, even though I'm using

7
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.800
proxies on my computer.

8
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.590
There's still so much data in this multiple layered track that it's lagging a bit.

9
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.300
So this should fix the problem if that is ever happening to you on any of your edits.

10
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.270
You can use the resolution playback and you can go down even to one fourth resolution so that it plays

11
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.480
back more smoothly.

12
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.820
So we have this take.

13
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.050
I'm going to turn this down a bit.

14
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.110
And something that I'm kind of looking for right off the bat for the beginning of this is what we would

15
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.600
call a wide shot or an establishing shot.

16
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.810
If we start the video like this, there's no context for the viewer to pick up on.

17
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.510
There's no information that's been given that shows.

18
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.090
Who am I looking at?

19
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.120
What am I looking at?

20
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.710
Where is this happening?

21
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.880
When is this happening?

22
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.100
All of those questions that they're not really going to consciously ask themselves, but they're going

23
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.390
to view it and they'll be feeling that.

24
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:47.380
So if we want to give our viewer answers as the chef that we are, we want to use an opening shot that's

25
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.580
going to set the tone, set the vibe, and it's also going to set and give the proper amount of information

26
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.990
that we want to give.

27
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.670
So so I'm going to keep that in mind that this green one is a possible opening shot.

28
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.420
We also have this.

29
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.420
Oh, and by the way, the way I'm seeing in these different layers is I'm turning off the visibility

30
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.440
of each track that I don't want to see, and that's going to drop down the view to the track below it.

31
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.410
OK, I really like the sun flares off these bottom two takes, to be honest.

32
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.820
Artistically, I would choose these, but I was filming this.

33
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.830
So I do remember what was going on during the shoot day, which is nice to know when you are editing

34
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.490
a project.

35
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.220
These were our first two takes and she wasn't really warmed up yet.

36
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.760
So I know that there's no way, no matter how much I move around these first few notes that she's playing

37
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.940
on the violin, it's not going to sync up.

38
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.960
So our next option and sadly, we can't use these two.

39
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.910
I really like the establishing of this.

40
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.520
It establishes we're in the woods.

41
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.530
You get to see the whole scene.

42
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.460
You get to see the kind of set design that we have of the speakers.

43
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.370
You get to see the kind of immensity of how big the force looks and how tiny she is in this cool backdrop.

44
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.550
And we have some nice foreground here as well.

45
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.150
This whole thing was shot on a Steadicam.

46
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.690
So we'll be using really smooth camera movement throughout and of course, refining some of these movements

47
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.690
by doing a post-production layer of stabilization.

48
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.880
So that'll be at the end.

49
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.150
But let's focus here on choosing our opening shot.

50
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.260
So what I can do now is peel back these layers.

51
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.750
And remember, this is the rough edit that we're putting together so we don't need to have a super high

52
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.060
frequency is cutting this shot, this shot, this shot.

53
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.530
We want to make a really gradual, easy pass on the whole edit and have cut change, cut change.

54
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.560
And then on our second edit, we'll make a higher frequency of cutting and changing and really maximizing

55
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.300
all the different camera angles.

56
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:14.400
And this is a really kind of slow moving Symfony piece, kind of the exact opposite of the past few

57
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.690
edits we've been doing together.

58
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.510
So this is not going to be a hype edit.

59
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:26.940
OK, we're going to follow and listen to her performance and use that as the deciding factor on when

60
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.600
to cut.

61
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.280
So let's move all of our edits over to when the tone of the song changes.

62
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.910
Right, there is the perfect moment to do that.

63
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.690
So let's take a look at the performances and angles that we have.

64
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.800
OK, that one's OK, that one's OK.

65
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.380
It looks like we go a little bit out of focus there, so let's see what else we got.

66
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.010
That's kind of cool.

67
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.940
We're not going to be using that, so let's scoot out of the way.

68
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.440
Even that one is pretty cool.

69
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.640
I like this purple one.

70
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.050
Eat.

71
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.580
So what I'm going to do is make a cut on our main shot so far.

72
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.060
A.

73
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.590
Let's see what's below it.

74
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.230
So that one is blurry, so.

75
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.200
So that looks pretty darn good.

76
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:19.780
Let's keep moving here and from listening to the track, the next cut would be right where we see this

77
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.960
this peak.

78
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.140
So.

79
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.210
Right here where she starts another phrase.

80
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.230
So right there, they're going to mark that, and what we're doing right now is we're kind of working

81
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.330
our way in from a wide shot to a medium shot to now.

82
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.910
It would be really cool to then show a Close-Up shot.

83
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.750
So that's that was that's pretty cool.

84
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.670
That looks pretty nice.

85
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.120
Let's see our options, though, is.

86
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.220
Infini, not as much of a fan of that one, so I'm going to peel it back out of the way.

87
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.040
I don't know what I'm doing on this tag, but this ain't working and we're not going to be using that

88
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.910
shot for a while.

89
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.830
No, we don't need another wide shot in this one.

90
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.730
Let's see what we got here in.

91
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.300
I'm not mad at that one, so we kind of whittled it down between two different shots.

92
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.640
So we have the

93
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.320
kind of close up there and then we have really the really close, close up.

94
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.180
I really like both of these shots.

95
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.600
So why don't we keep both for now?

96
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.050
And maybe we can cut these together.

97
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.120
It's because I really like her facial expression, and that's what you're really you're cutting on,

98
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.350
you're cutting on emotion.

99
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.590
You're cutting on what is driving this story forward.

100
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:19.170
And what is really captivating or telling the audience how to feel.

101
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.760
So that shot we've just used right here, let's see.

102
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.720
OK, that works for me.

103
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.850
And we're going to see what's below here.

104
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.210
OK, so let's mark where our next cut is going to be.

105
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.590
It right there.

106
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:55.880
So you can see I just put a marker there because we're really just following the wave and the different

107
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.400
peaks and troughs of her performance.

108
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.830
That's a lot better.

109
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:21.760
OK.

110
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.740
This is our next cutting point right here.

111
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:32.710
I'm going to add a marker and let's go ahead and move everything out of the way.

112
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.660
And I'm going to speed things up here a little bit in the edit, because for this project specifically,

113
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.130
I don't want too much of your time to be focused on the rough edit phase.

114
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:47.830
I really want to get to the refining and upgrading process in the secondary edit.

115
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.590
So we're going to kind of time lapse and skip forward a little bit here.
