00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.910
So now we are at a time in our edit where we're ready to drop in our musical track, or at least, yes,

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.010
search for a few potential choices.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.400
Choose those and then find which one fits the best.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.890
So let's hop over here to the screen cap already on Epidemic Sound, and I'm going to be looking through

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.130
a few just so you can kind of see the process.

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.460
I do of kind of quickly going through a lot of tracks in a short amount of time, because finding the

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.180
right track for a video can take a lot of time and you really want to maximize what you're doing.

8
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.140
So let's go ahead and go to the Moutier and let's see if there's anything interesting under Epic.

9
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.870
We might get to Epic, but let's see.

10
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.760
So there's always going to be an intro for songs, and you can see the intro kind of ends right there

11
00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.760
singing.

12
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.070
OK, so now we have a beat here, and there's going to be a build and a drop somewhere around here.

13
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.260
So we're just going to skip ahead.

14
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.710
That's actually pretty cool track.

15
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.320
So I'm going to download.

16
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.000
Go to the next just by the look of this track, I can tell it already doesn't have enough of a beat.

17
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.470
You can tell this is all instrumentals with no actual spikes in the waveform that show a beat.

18
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.520
So this is going to be a more ambient atmospheric track.

19
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.840
That's not what we're looking for.

20
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.870
Too much kings of Leon.

21
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.230
Again, too much kings of Leon.

22
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.330
So you can see intro, the track starts here, there's a build here and there's a drop right here.

23
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.350
So I'm going to skip ahead.

24
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.010
It's just as cool a little too dubstep.

25
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.770
Again, to dubstep.

26
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.570
But what I want you to really take away from this is how to analyze the waveform of your music.

27
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.440
So as an editor, you can quickly navigate through it and find what you're wanting.

28
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.490
So I can tell here that this is like the chunk mean part of the song, and it's going to have a low,

29
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.380
relaxed vibe here and it's going to have the beat come back in here.

30
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.000
It kind of chills out here.

31
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.020
And then there's a drop here.

32
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.580
So let's see how correct I am.

33
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.610
The excitement is going to end right around here.

34
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.130
OK, Exactly, and it goes into a more calm, laid back part.

35
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.970
And the beat is going to come back in right here.

36
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.890
OK.

37
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.320
And then this is going to go on and there's going to be a build that starts right around here.

38
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.060
OK, and then there's going to be the job right here.

39
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.760
So that kind of analyzing the way forms of music really goes across a lot of genres that you will be

40
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.290
using, and that's a really clear way you want to be able to really be able to see.

41
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.510
I just said able like this.

42
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.550
Dubstep has got to be a little terrazzo.

43
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.300
Yeah.

44
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.170
End of the day.

45
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.450
The purpose of this is to really be able to quickly look at a waveform and analyze if it's going to

46
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.410
be the proper track or quickly see which part you want to use.

47
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.420
The video that we're currently working on.

48
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.890
There's really no intro or anything like that.

49
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.280
It goes straight into the content.
