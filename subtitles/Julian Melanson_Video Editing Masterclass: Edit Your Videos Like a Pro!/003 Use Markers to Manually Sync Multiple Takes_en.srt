1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,120
And now we are ready to start our actual edit.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:11,040
So let's first start by selecting all of the clips that we want to create a sequence from right click

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,210
the first clip and create a new sequence from this clip.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,010
Now, first thing I want to do here is label this timeline main sequence.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,230
And I'm going to create a sequence is, as you are getting very good at by now, main sequences folder,

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,170
drag that sequence into the folder.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,930
And we're going to start going here and pulling Selex on our footage.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,940
And I actually want to take a second here, because this is going to be a circumstance where, like

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,750
I mentioned, we have multiple takes of the same performance.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,530
This would be a scenario where in other situations, if we had the same exact timing on a clip, we

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:54,830
would.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,550
I don't want to see this in a different editing project.

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,150
We're going to be using the synchronized and multicam function of our editing software to sync multiple

14
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,980
takes together and multiple angles together automatically in an automated way.

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,520
Now, because she was doing a live performance on each one of these takes, if we look at the waveforms

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,890
here, we can see that it's different every single time, even though she's playing the same song.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,840
Each one is a different performance.

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:30,440
So we won't be able to use the automated synchronize function in this specific scenario.

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,690
And with different videos that you are doing different projects, you're going to be able to do it in

20
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,710
the automated way, which we will do together.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,150
But for this one specifically, we're going to find a point that we can mark on each one of her takes.

22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,880
There is going to be in the same moment, and then that way we'll be able to go and manually overlay

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,300
all the different takes together to have one multilayered take, to then be able to pick and choose

24
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,840
what shots we want to use for which moments.

25
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,640
Hopefully that makes sense.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,720
If it doesn't make sense right now, it's going to make sense as we go through this edit.

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,930
And I'm just going to continue here to label these different takes different colors.

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,170
OK.

29
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,700
Perfect.

30
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,530
Now we have all of our different takes are separate colors.

31
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,850
And now, like I mentioned, we're going to be manually creating a marker on each one of these takes.

32
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,430
So we can go in and manually line everything up.

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,350
So to do that, what I want to look for is somewhere in the waveform that has contrast.

34
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,600
I want to have no information and then a peek or a high amount of information.

35
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:48,260
That way I can scan these other waveforms and easily see where that repeating strong sound is happening.

36
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,560
So let's take a listen to.

37
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,270
So is towards the end of the routine.

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,920
OK, perfect, I think this is going to be a good moment to sink the rest of the clips, too, so I'm

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,010
going to take my cursor to the peak of this note that she plays towards the end of the track.

40
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,610
And I'm going to find that same moment on the next take.

41
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,590
OK, it's coming up right here.

42
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,470
Perfect.

43
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,100
Go to that peak, select the clip, go to the peak.

44
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,970
Hit em to leave a marker.

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,450
And now I'm going to add it to the rest of the sequence.

46
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,170
Boom.

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,680
Perfect.

48
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:42,110
Now we have our marker here on each of our takes.

49
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,820
Now what we're going to do is manually move our takes and layer them on top of each other.

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,080
So I'm going to drag the video for this one up,

51
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,420
match up these markers

52
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,970
and do the same thing for the rest of these clips.

53
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
It's.

54
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,700
OK, perfect.

55
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,630
And now we have all of our different takes stacked on top of each other.

56
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,750
So you as well by now should have all of your takes linked up together.

57
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,610
If you're using this footage to work with or if you're using your own footage to work with, you should

58
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,220
have all your takes ready to go and select.
