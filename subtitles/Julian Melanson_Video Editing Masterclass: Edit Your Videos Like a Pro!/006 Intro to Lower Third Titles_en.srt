1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,140
So we went through and we added this really nice looking intro card graphic.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,650
Now the next step and probably something you're definitely going to come across in a video like this,

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,540
is there's going to be other parts of your video where you want to label something or you want to give

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,020
some type of descriptive text to certain parts of the video.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:31,290
So I just added four of these kind of reminders for myself as I was going through this edit that these

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:38,410
are points in the video where I want to add a little some type of information about this property.

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:47,580
So what I did is I just typed out a few descriptor things like, you know, the location, the square

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:55,740
footage, indoor outdoor living room, what the bedroom and bathroom situation is for this property

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,520
specifically.

10
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:03,300
So I'm going to highlight the first title card that I want to add in to the edit.

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,850
And I'm going to go to this title card that I just kind of put as a temporary placeholder or we're going

12
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,660
to switch it around.

13
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,140
But I'm going to go ahead and paste this information.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,990
And let's go ahead and move this up now for information that you're putting in displaying on screen.

15
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,150
That's not a center.

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,230
Very important.

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:33,570
You know, intro graphic, when it's during the edit, you don't really want to have things on the bottom

18
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,210
middle.

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:43,350
Generally, it's best for this kind of information, like people's names, locations in the video times

20
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,780
of day, all those cool little pop up graphics that you see generally there on the bottom right of the

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,070
bottom left.

22
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,060
There are a few situations where it makes sense in the edit, you know, but you'll kind of see that

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,840
it just looks better and it fits better on the bottom.

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,660
Off to one side.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:11,190
Now, if we let's say we chose to go to the bottom left, it looks better if we also justify, I believe

26
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,640
it's called.

27
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,180
Yeah.

28
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,560
Or alignment to the side that we want to choose.

29
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,950
So if I want to go to the left and let me actually scale is down.

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,170
So it starts looking a little bit better.

31
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,500
Yeah.

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,240
That's a lot better.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,790
Generally, your text is going to look a lot better if you align it.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,950
So this is a left aligned.

35
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,160
And if I let's say I wanted to go to the right side, I would hit the right aligned side and I would

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,420
go ahead and scoot it over.

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,290
And that's going to look a lot better and a lot cleaner.

38
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,370
But personally, kind of like the same way we read a book from left to right.

39
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,980
I personally think that this kind of information does the best on the bottom left part of the screen.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,740
And you want to leave some padding.

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:03,780
You don't want to put this kind of information like that back in the day when things used to go on television.

42
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,740
Imagine that.

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,030
You know, if you were an editor, it would pretty much be only going most of the time.

44
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,730
You'd be editing stuff for television or for movie.

45
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,780
And those had different kind of display ratios.

46
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,460
So there was this thing called a title Safe Margin.

47
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:29,010
And you would never want to place your text or any part of the video outside of the borders that this

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,770
type of overlay shows you.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,660
So these days, when things go on YouTube and Instagram, we don't really have to worry about the way

50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,180
it's displayed on different types of displays.

51
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:48,600
But it is kind of nice if you do put on one kind of these kind of overlays, there's a safe margins,

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,300
transparency.

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,530
Good.

54
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,550
That's a bit different.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:04:00,000
There's even this ruler, one which I don't use, but the safe margins, a good way to have equal spacing

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,970
to the left and to the bottom, and just kind of use it as a guide frame of where it might look good

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,480
for your text to fit in the best.

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,360
And just a good rule of thumb is try to keep equal spacing below the text and to the left of the text.

59
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,040
If I have it kind of like this, it just looks a little bit funky.

60
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,280
But if the spacing is similar below and above, that's when it looks good.

61
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,320
If it's got a lot of space below, but not a lot of space to the left, it looks a little bit strange.

62
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,710
Right.

63
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,240
So this is a good rule of thumb to go for when you're adding this kind of graphic.

64
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:45,750
And there's no specific hard rule that you really need to follow unless your client is asking you specifically.

65
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,950
But the more you're centered, the more that this is the focus and what's behind it is secondary.

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,150
So if this is in the center, you're telling the audience that, hey, this is this, this is like the

67
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,230
center of a target.

68
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,310
You're always aiming for the center.

69
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,550
Right.

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,010
So if it's in the center, it's the main focus.

71
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,010
The more you bring it off to the side, the more it's secondary.

72
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,860
They're seeing what's happening in the image and then they get to see the details that you're providing

73
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,100
them.

74
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,270
So it's a fine balance.

75
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,990
You don't want to have it too far out towards the center.

76
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,790
You don't want to have it too far down.

77
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,090
So it looks like it's about to fall out of the image.

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,410
There's a middle ground so you can find that middle ground.

79
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,390
Some of it is just personal preference and then find that middle ground and just find something that

80
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,300
feels right and looks aesthetically pleasing.
