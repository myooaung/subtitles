00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:10.440
Now I want you to finish creating your second draft, edit using your own footage or the violinist footage

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.380
that we've been working on for this section.

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:22.350
Remember to use the techniques like shot, choice, shot, ordering, shot length, pacing, cutting

4
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.440
on movement, coloring and stabilization to really improve on the second draft of your edit before you

5
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.009
export it.

6
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.430
So remember with shot ordering choice length.

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.730
We're deciding what to use depending on this story we're trying to tell and the emotional response we're

8
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.620
trying to create in our viewer.

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.620
We're going to cut on movement to make our cuts as invisible and seamless as possible.

10
00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.240
And we're going to color our clips in a selective way to really choose what kind of colors and tones

11
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.030
we want to enhance and increase.

12
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:11.310
And we're going to then stabilize or you're going to then stabilize all of your shots so that everything

13
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.050
is looking really smooth.

14
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.510
When that's done, just like me, you're going to export your video.

15
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.000
You're going to upload it online.

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.930
And you can share your video URL in the Q&A section to get feedback from other students.

17
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.950
Or if you want to give feedback to another student's video, edit, you can respond to their post in

18
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.910
the Q&A section.

19
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.640
That wraps it up for this learning lesson.

20
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.010
And I will see you in the next chapter.
