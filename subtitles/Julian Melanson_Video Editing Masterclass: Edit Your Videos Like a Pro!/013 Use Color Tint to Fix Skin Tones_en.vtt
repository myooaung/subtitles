00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.940
Skipping on to the next clips here, that looks great.

2
00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.840
This is looking a little bit dark to my eye, so I'm going to select our clip.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
I'm going to add our color correction layer.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.170
And because she's a little bit dark, the background is a little bit dark and the shadows are a little

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.530
bit dark.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.120
So shadows are dark, mediums are dark, and the highs are whites are all dark.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.460
I'm going to just increase the overall exposure on this one, because I can tell that overall this image

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.550
needs to be pushed up in the level of exposure, not just the shadows, not just the highlights, but

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.270
the whole image.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.760
So I wanted to point eight.

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.290
OK, that's looking a lot better as before.

12
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.940
That's after.

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.960
And the reason this happens is, you know, I'm shooting on the same camera, the same lens, the same

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
location, but as you're shooting in an outdoor location, different times a day, clouds can mean clouds

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.230
come out.

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.820
So on projects like this in natural daylight, that's the benefits of having studio lighting.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.420
I don't ever have to change the color correction.

18
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.580
But when you are shooting outdoors, keep that in mind on these kind of projects is that you're going

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.620
to want to go through and neutralize and equalize all the lighting on your clips as we're doing right

20
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.950
now.

21
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.370
OK, so as I was scrubbing through, for some reason, this shot here is looking a little bit green.

22
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.780
I'm not quite sure exactly what happened.

23
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.650
If I was doing automatic white balance as the settings on my camera, it may have changed my balance.

24
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.250
I know for a fact I wasn't I was shooting on manual, so it could just be the lighting.

25
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.240
And what we're going to do to fix that is you can see that the overall color temperature is great here.

26
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.070
The skin tone looks natural.

27
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.870
It's kind of nice and warm.

28
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.050
But for this one, it's a little bit green.

29
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.030
OK, that's a little bit green.

30
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.050
This looks good.

31
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.320
A little bit green.

32
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.160
So what we're going to do is grab our trusty color correction filter.

33
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.140
And we're to use the tint function to balance out the greens by adding a slight bit of purple.

34
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.540
So if I grab this and take it down, it's going to be more green if I grab and take it up.

35
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.250
It's going to start to get purple.

36
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.030
So this is a subtle thing, but we're going to try and push it up five points.

37
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.300
Let's try actually seven here and now we have a much more natural looking skin tone.

38
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.340
So that's with I'm going to make this a little bit bigger here.

39
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.230
That's with and that's without with without a subtle but it looks a lot more natural.

40
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.050
OK.

41
00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.310
And that really goes for all of your footage, for all of your projects, if the skin tone is off,

42
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.160
the whole video is going to fall apart.

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.790
So if you have a great video, it looks, you know, with great cinematography and great sound, great

44
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.530
music and good editing.

45
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.460
But your skin tones are looking like this.

46
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.650
You know, it's not going to fly.

47
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.640
The skin tone really has to look like a normal human skin tone.

48
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.990
In real life or people are just going to pick up on it and there's going to be like something feels

49
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.630
really wrong and they're not going to know exactly what it is.

50
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.220
But now we have all of our shots nice and balanced.

51
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.070
Everything is looking pretty darn good.
