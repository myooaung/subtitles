1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,510
So you can continue to be cutting your secrets together.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,260
And choosing the best shots that line up with the best moments.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:16,190
And I want to kind of go even more into detail on shot choice, shot length and shot ordering.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
So when we have multiple takes in multiple angles like we've been working with.

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:29,950
You want to always ask yourself which shot best conveys the purpose of this specific scene.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,890
In other words, which shot has the best performance or wording from the subject?

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:44,080
Or, like in our previous edits, tells the best story through camera movement and through framing.

8
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:51,370
You want to keep in mind what is supposed to be seen, what is important, and even what is supposed

9
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,030
to be hidden.

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:59,320
Just like in our opening sequence, we didn't want any questions to be there for the viewer and just

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,730
show a close up with the violin.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:08,290
We purposefully showed a wide shot so that the viewer was comfortable knowing where the subject was

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,260
so that there wasn't any ambiguity for the viewer, wondering where the violin was hanging in space

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,520
randomly on a close up.

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,570
And they could instantly dive into and immerse themselves in the really cool backdrop we had for this

16
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,560
specific video.

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,260
So if it's important, make sure it's seen.

18
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,200
And on the other hand, if you want the viewer to have questions or curiosity, you can actually hide

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,750
things by not showing wide shots until there's a purposeful way of showing it.

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,630
Later in the edit, also with going through and choosing these different shots, you're looking for

21
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,470
that feeling that you get when you see the shot lined up with your audio.

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,250
That's that.

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, this is a type of feeling you'll know when you land on that shot.

24
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,780
So really pay attention to what your body and experience is in the moment while you're creating your

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,320
edits.

26
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,930
And there's a few important insights I want to share about deciding your shot ordering.

27
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,419
Generally, you want to start off with your mastership the way we did in this edit and work your way

28
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:10,690
in.

29
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,360
This puts the setting into perspective.

30
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,790
Then we move closer to our subject.

31
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,700
But like I mentioned, we can purposefully create wonder or mystery or curiosity by starting on the

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,950
close up and working our way to the wide shot versus the normal way, which is to start with the wide

33
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,440
shot and work our way into close ups.

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,110
The reason this is important is because it's all about ordering things in a way that makes your story

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,560
flow most naturally, which is all depended on your type of footage.

36
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,200
And we're going to get more into this in the montage section.

37
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,950
But I just wanted to kind of bring it up now while we're going through this edit.

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,240
The next principle I want to talk about is choosing your shot length.

39
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,320
The longer we hold a shot, the more information we give to the viewer.

40
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,360
So if I was just a flash, an image to you very quickly, you want to be able to really pick up a whole

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,470
lot on what's going on.

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:11,080
But if I showed you that same image for, let's say, 10 seconds, there's a lot more information you'll

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,070
be able to pick up.

44
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,500
So if there isn't a whole lot to be absorbed in your shot, you'll need to hold it for that long.

45
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,360
You'll know by feeling into it.

46
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,670
And if more information needs to be given or if the shot is ready to change.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,630
So if it's a complex moment, there's going to be extra time needed.

48
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,090
And so, like I mentioned, if I had a long paragraph of information, I want to just flash it to you

49
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,870
in one second.

50
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,210
You would want to let the audience.

51
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,410
This is a metaphor, by the way.

52
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,020
I don't literally mean a paragraph of information.

53
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,760
I mean a metaphor for that of how much information is in your actual shot.

54
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,580
But you would let it be read for a longer period of time by your audience before moving on.

55
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,640
That's why it's so important to watch your own footage as if you've never seen it before.

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,370
You're listening to what's going on audibly.

57
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:08,020
You're feeling what's going on visually, and you're trying to have a neutral first time experience

58
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,080
when you're watching back the edit, because your viewer is only going to be seeing it probably once.

59
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,899
And when that happens, it's going to be their first time seeing it.

60
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,890
When you're editing, you've seen a shot 10, 20, maybe 100 times.

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:30,160
So you kind of have to consciously erase that memory of what you're used to because the viewer is never

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,650
going to have that same memory.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,730
So here's a perfect example of explaining shot length.

64
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,450
I was playing football at first, but once I first started playing basketball Jacomo game, you know,

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,000
being in the best in world when you use the best players.

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,150
But that's up the line of long, so it's definitely expansion of official for.

67
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:11,080
So what we have here is the summarizing thoughts by our main character in this previous project.

68
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:18,280
He's really going deep in saying how appreciative and how much he loves playing in the NBA.

69
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:25,810
And we give a little extra beat, a little extra moment for the viewer to absorb his statement and his

70
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,690
thoughtfulness behind what he said.

71
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,460
This is a lot of information and subtlety to take in as the viewer.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,840
If we see the second example, we don't have quite as much breathing room and space for the magnitude

73
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,820
of what's being said and shown to really absorb.

74
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,310
Let's see what that looks like.

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,060
Send us up to date on the law.

76
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,750
And so if there is one huge national treasure for.

77
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,640
So, as you can see, it doesn't nearly have as much impact because we didn't create that space.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,130
There's nothing really analytical or logical about the decision of holding the shot longer.

79
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,930
It's purely an emotional and storytelling decision to extend that moment and leave that moment with

80
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,770
some time to breathe so that each moment on screen is purposefully there and being seen.

81
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,030
I think that rhymed.

82
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,690
I like that.
