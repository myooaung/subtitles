1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,000
So go ahead and make your way to your editing software.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,400
Perfect.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,710
So now that we have our editing file open, we're going to create a brand new project.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,530
OK, now I'm going to title this.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,210
The name of my trip, Mount Shasta.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,110
Edit.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,790
OK, perfect.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,010
And now that we put in the title of our project.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,250
Remember that folder that we created that we sent all the editing assets?

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:26,880
We're going to go.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,190
OK, that's where we're going to go to now.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,440
So go ahead and hit browse or select or find folder or whatever that looks like for you.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,240
Go ahead and choose the location.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,510
Mount Shasta, edit, select and boom premiere.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,150
This is where all the assets are going to go.

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,280
Choose perfect.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,630
And then we're going to hit, OK.

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,150
So now we have our editing file.

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:54,440
And the next step here is to drag in the footage that we're going to be editing for this project.

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,920
So I'm going to go to Finder.

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,830
I'm going to go to my footage that we selected.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,100
And I'm going to drag that into the project window.

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:10,680
And before we actually get into our edits, now that we have things organized, it's always, always,

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:20,670
always a good idea to back up your content on to to take to separate locations.

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,300
OK.

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,550
So I have all the originals that we just worked with directly on my laptop.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,080
Now, what I'm going to do is create a backup folder on a separate hard drive in a separate location

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,550
so that we have two copies of the same information.

29
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,520
So that just in case, none of it ever gets lost.

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,100
No matter how big or small your project is, I always recommend taking the time to do this extra step

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,260
and even though it takes up a little bit of extra room.

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,460
Yeah, I know.

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,140
It's kind of frustrating because we can run out of space quickly on hard drives.

34
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,390
It's going to be worth it in the long run.

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,380
So let's do that now.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,160
So I'm going to open up a new window and I'm going to go to my hard drive and I'm going to go to create

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,970
a new folder.

38
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,380
And I'm going to the tile at Mount Shasta back up.

39
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,190
OK.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:21,450
And then once you've done that, we go to our original folder and you can either copy the entire folder

41
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,850
or copy the contents inside the folder.

42
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,870
It's really up to you.

43
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,010
Does the same thing.

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,830
But what I did there is I copied the information in the folder, and now I'm going to paste it into

45
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,070
our backup folder on a completely separate drive.

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,210
And so now that we've gotten the basic logistic side of capturing our content, what I want to first

47
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,880
show you is an actual final edit with the footage that I'm going to be working with.

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,260
So you can kind of get an idea of where we're going to be heading in this learning exercise for the

49
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,610
rest of this learning exercise.

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,150
And you can see where we're going, and then we're going to build it from square one together.

51
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,070
So let's check it out.

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,100
Now that is the waterfall.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,570
Cool, so you can get a feel for what we're kind of going for here.

54
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,910
And I also wanted to mention it's very simple cutting, very straightforward cutting.

55
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,350
And majority of this edit, we want to be using the raw audio just to kind of understand how to, you

56
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,570
know, get used to just using raw audio.

57
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,250
And then later in the course, we're going to get into actually I think it's in the next learning exercise,

58
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,990
we're going to get into more adding in extra sound design and extra audio.
