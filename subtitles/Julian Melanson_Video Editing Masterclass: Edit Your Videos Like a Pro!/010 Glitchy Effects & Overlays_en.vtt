00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.780
So the edit is solid as usual.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.230
It's looking good.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.720
Now, what I want to do is add some overlays.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.650
There's going to be a nice kind of final glossy layer that we're going to do to really bring out the

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.840
cool kind of glitchy ness and Dungeness that I want to have in this edit.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.200
Now, I have an overlays folder right here.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:33.300
And what I'm going to do is just kind of go through and pick out a few that match up with the kind of

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.560
colored tone and overall scheme of the edit, because you can see these all have different colors,

9
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.810
kind of different styles.

10
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.350
Some are really techie looking.

11
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.020
Some are kind of softer.

12
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.360
Some are more computerized.

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.410
OK, this one's cool.

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.220
Yeah, this one matches the right vibe.

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.590
So I'm going to create a

16
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.440
overlays folder right here and I'm going to drag that when I really like.

17
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.360
And we'll pick a second one just in case.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.890
Don't don't need any purples.

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.120
This was kind of cool.

20
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.790
No, no.

21
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.640
Now.

22
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.820
OK, let's see this one.

23
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.750
This is just a backup.

24
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.810
OK.

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.960
And I want to go two points in the edit where we can use just a little bit of a glitchy overlay that's

26
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.790
going to make the moment look better.

27
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.990
So we have these two moments that skip forward and then that skip what's not necessarily skip forward,

28
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.680
but to scale up.

29
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.550
So we scale up there and then we scale up there.

30
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.000
So let's go ahead and double click our overlay.

31
00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.870
And we're just going to find the moments that have just the right amount of distortion.

32
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.510
So let's grab that.

33
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.480
We don't need a whole lot.

34
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.380
Just a little bit.

35
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.580
We can right click it and we can scale it to our frame.

36
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.500
Size has a different aspect ratio.

37
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.350
So you can see those these bars on the side so we can go ahead and scale it up so that it fills the

38
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.160
entire frame.

39
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.460
And just like what we did with the blending mode, we're going to click on the blending mode under the

40
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.400
opacity function of our clip.

41
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.080
And we're going to hit screen.

42
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.980
Now, we can also do lighton or we can even do darken and multiply.

43
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.810
So if we check out Darken.

44
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.740
Kind of a cool, super glitchy look.

45
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.930
It looks a little too dark.

46
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.180
Personally for me, so let's do the screen.

47
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.600
OK, I'm liking that a lot more.

48
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.840
And I want to scale this up even more, so I'm going to go 130.

49
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.900
OK.

50
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.060
Perfect, and let's grab another part.

51
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.990
It's the flag

52
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.800
right there.

53
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.750
Scale it up.

54
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.080
Increase the size and hit screen.

55
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.750
OK.

56
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.960
Now these look good as they are, but I think we can get a little bit more if we just go ahead and all

57
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.110
drag and duplicate these overlays.

58
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.370
And drag them on top.

59
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:04.630
So for this first one, it's almost the overlays too much, and it's actually we're losing this cool

60
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.140
masking that we did, so I'm going to move it over.

61
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.670
It's the rock.

62
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.780
And it's really just fine tuning, a lot of this is just super fine tuning.

63
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.720
So this one, I don't feel like needs an overlay.

64
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.210
This one can use, OK.

65
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.070
So let's do it like that.

66
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.440
OK.

67
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.400
And let's have a look back at these.

68
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.480
Of course, so those are looking really good, let's go forward in the edit and let's go to this point.

69
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.320
And there's already a lot going on in this moment, so I don't really know if we need another overlay

70
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.870
by.

71
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.510
Let's experiment a little bit here.

72
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.970
What if we grab a little bit of that dragon on top?

73
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.350
It's going to scale this up.

74
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.800
It's green.

75
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.290
So that's cool.

76
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.370
It adds a lot more energy.

77
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.360
So we have it like this.

78
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.790
Or if we take away that layer.

79
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.870
And then with.

80
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.960
Cool, I like that.

81
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.660
It adds just a little bit extra depth and we can even drag that stuff over here.

82
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.850
OK, and let's go to the end of the edit where we did this overlay, which I really like, and then

83
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.790
we have this outro, so this can definitely use some help.

84
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.560
This just needs a little bit more texture.

85
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.850
It feels a little bit forced and just a little bit.

86
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.560
There's no personality in here.

87
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.710
So let's find a good moment.

88
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.930
OK, like that.

89
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.380
So, boom, that's got a ton of personality that's really going to help this ending.

90
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.740
Scale it up.

91
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.150
It's screen.

92
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.560
And let's check it out.

93
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.570
OOiA.

94
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.200
OK, cool.

95
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.030
And just to experiment, what happens if we do darken?

96
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.230
Oh.

97
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:16.150
So I'm going to bring the opacity on this overlay down a little bit so that we don't lose too much of

98
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.030
our image, because here we're kind of losing a lot.

99
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.850
So this is without that's all the way up.

100
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.900
So if we kind of bring it back a little bit, let's say the opacity is at 70 percent.

101
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.890
Then we can still keep our image.

102
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.170
Let's actually go down more.

103
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.310
Let's check that out.

104
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.170
OK.

105
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.580
Let's try that.

106
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.000
Oh, yeah, I like that.

107
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:53.940
OK, so that should really help you out with a little bit more personality and adding more character

108
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.830
to your edits when you really need those cool moments like this, any shot is a perfect example.

109
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.370
Like this looks pretty -- cool and stylized and pretty highly produced when before, you know, we

110
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.950
just had this old thing, which looks good, too.

111
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.820
Nothing wrong with that.

112
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.040
And that little extra bit of ninja work really takes it to the next level.
