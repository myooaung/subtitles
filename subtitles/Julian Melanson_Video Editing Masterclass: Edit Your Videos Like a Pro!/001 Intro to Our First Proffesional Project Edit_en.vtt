00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.640
Welcome to this brand new chapter.

2
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:23.090
So we've graduated from the more simple, easier iPhone footage, social media, post type videos that

3
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.880
we've been working on to get comfortable editing and to build our structure and foundational understanding

4
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.050
as video editor.

5
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.530
Now, in this section, we're going to be doing some deeper, more complex editing techniques with a

6
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.550
new layer of series and principles.

7
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.050
You'll be able to use these new techniques that we're going to get into to improve your rough edits

8
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.570
and help you decide what to cut, when to cut, what to show all the more subtle things that you learn

9
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.170
as you develop your ninja editing skills.

10
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.150
And really, it's stuff that you would normally be learning over a long period of time, working with

11
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.350
a lot of projects.

12
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.770
But instead, my goal is to give you that information and those insights in a much shorter time, in

13
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.740
a time of days rather than years.

14
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.910
So for this section, you can use your own footage if you'd like, or you can download the same exact

15
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.250
shots that I'm going to be editing with.

16
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.710
And we will do our edits together.

17
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.130
If you do want to go in the direction of using your own footage.

18
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.550
Totally cool.

19
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.840
I would just recommend using a past project where you have multiple shot types to choose from.

20
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.870
Because we're going to be diving into shot tibs shot, ordering, shot, pacing, shot length.

21
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.790
All of these different kind of techniques.

22
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.670
So feel free to use your own footage.

23
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.350
If not, feel free to download the footage I'm providing.

24
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.900
And let's get into it.
