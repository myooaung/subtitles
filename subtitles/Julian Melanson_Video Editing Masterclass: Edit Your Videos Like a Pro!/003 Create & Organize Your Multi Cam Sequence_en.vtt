00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.760
So, yes, the multicam sequence is something I've been wanting to teach for a while in this course,

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.920
but now that we have an opportunity to do it, let's get into how to create this multicam sequence.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.560
So we're going to go to our footage tab and we want to select all of our performance and movie files

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.030
that we want to sync up.

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.770
So I'm going to select all those right click and I'm going to click create multicam sequence.

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.820
Now it's going to pop up a page that's just going to simply ask you, how do you want me to synchronize

7
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.680
these clips?

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.960
Do you want me to use in and out points that you said?

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.410
Do you want me to use timecode or do you want me to use audio?

10
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.040
Of course, we wanted to use audio because it's going to analyze the waveforms.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.640
It's going to click everything in place layered on top of each other.

12
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.570
And we're going to leave the sequence preset to automatic.

13
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.370
That means it's going to set our sequence to the proper settings, the same as our footage.

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.100
And we want to leave the camera names set to enumerate cameras.

15
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.800
It's just going to organize the clips that we synchronize together a little bit better.

16
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.940
So we're going to hit OK.

17
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.100
And now it's going to go through the processing function of synchronizing the different clips together.

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.640
And sometimes you will get this page.

19
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.420
It says, we could not synchronize one or more clips, which can happen for a few different reasons.

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.890
But let's say it, OK.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.010
And now we have our multicam sequence.

22
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.430
So we can already see we have our different shots lined up and we can view them all at the same time.

23
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.890
This is really the bread and butter and the cool part of the multicam sequence.

24
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.980
But as of right now, we can edit it.

25
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.400
So what we want to do is right click our sequence and hit new sequence from clip.

26
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.110
This is going to take our multicam sequence.

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.850
And it's going to drop it into the timeline with the proper settings.

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.600
And now we can see and if I hit shift zero, it's going to bring up all of our angles.

29
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.690
So you can kind of see that what we did in the other I think it was a second edit or third edit we did

30
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.590
together in the course.

31
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.240
We dragged all the layers and then we kind of peeled back the layer on top, which revealed the layer

32
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.960
on the bottom.

33
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.730
That's the normal way to do it.

34
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.770
The people have been doing for years and years.

35
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.190
This is a much more just quicker way to kind of click through and see all the shots and.

36
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.180
OK, perfect.

37
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.250
That's the perfect two seconds for this piece.

38
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.960
It's just a lot faster.

39
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.390
So but what we want to do next is a default labels your sequence the same as the first movie file in

40
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.920
the multicam, which we don't want to do.

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.320
So we're going to title this main sequence because we're going to be where all of our footage is going

42
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.680
to be.

43
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.770
And what we can do is if we double click the audio file from the multicam sequence, that's going to

44
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.390
actually bring us to inside the sequence, which is pretty cool.

45
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.710
So this is what it did.

46
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.980
It dragged and analyzed all these different shots using the audio, using the peaks and valleys.

47
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.110
You can see boom, boom, boom.

48
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.680
Right.

49
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.850
And that is how it organized.

50
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.490
Now, what I want to do is put these movie files on the same layer.

51
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.930
So I'm going to put this down.

52
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.670
I'm going to drag this down and I'm going to put yeah.

53
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.170
These are both performance three.

54
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.440
They're on different layers, which you'll see why we're doing this when we actually get to clicking

55
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.140
through the multicam is stuff that's on the same layer is part of the same window that we're seeing.

56
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.220
So we want to keep all the takes on the same window.

57
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.520
I'm just going to use these down to create

58
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.960
to take away this extra space.

59
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.240
And I can see something that's going on here.

60
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.530
See, we have two, but we don't see Toovey.

61
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.040
See, we have one, A, one, B, three, A, three, B for A, four B.

62
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.360
And we're also missing five B because we have six eighty six P.

63
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.840
We have five in two.

64
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.320
That warning window, if you want to call it that, that showed up.

65
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.670
It said we didn't get to synchronize all your clips.

66
00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:27.000
Sometimes it will, for whatever reason, when it analyzes all the files, it won't match some up and

67
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.150
it'll say, --, I don't know what to do with this one, guys, so I'm not going to put it in the

68
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.810
multicam.

69
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.360
That's what it did with our to be take in our five BTIG so we can see that missing in the timeline.

70
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.600
So we're going to have to go and add that in manually.

71
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.250
It's not the end of the world because we've already saved a ton of time with this, synchronizing the

72
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.050
shots for us.

73
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.030
But what I'm going to do is grab five B.

74
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.250
I'm going to drag it in.

75
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.810
And then I'm going to grab fire.

76
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.820
I know that was to.

77
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.890
OK, now I'm going to grab five B.

78
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.290
And I'm going to drag it in.

79
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:13.580
Now, what I'd like to do before I start actually editing is just to double check, because 90 percent

80
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.900
of the time this does a great job and it synchronizes everything.

81
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.850
There are a few times I've had where for some reason it just moved the clip this weird way.

82
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.330
It didn't, you know, put it in the right place.

83
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.100
So what I always like to do is to unmuted the tracks, because what it does is it's going to take the

84
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.370
first MLV file of the sequence that you selected.

85
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.100
And it's going to make that the main track and leave it unmuted.

86
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.650
And what it's going to do is is going to mute the rest of the tracks.

87
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.850
We're going to take the muting off so that we can see or actually so that we can hear that it's synched.

88
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.410
OK, sounding good, if it wasn't cinct, it would be like this if I were to move this over.

89
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.530
You hear how it's like sounding doubling.

90
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.220
They did.

91
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.810
It's doubling because one is from, let's say, a negative point, one seconds back.

92
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.600
Sometimes it's done in the past.

93
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.030
I'm going to undo the scooching of that over.

94
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.320
So it's in the right place.

95
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.430
And I'm going to go to the next track down here and I'm going to listen.

96
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.240
OK, next track.

97
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.210
OK, pretty -- good, so it did a great job.

98
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.660
I'm just going to move these audio files and put them on the same track, just the same way that we

99
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.270
did with the video files.

100
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.400
Take out any extra space.

101
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.540
It doesn't need to be there.

102
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.520
And if we didn't want to playback and listen, we could have also kind of looked at the waveform and

103
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:10.540
as well to make sure that these big spiky moments were on the same, uh, the same synchronization and

104
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.350
also say that.

105
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.570
But everything is looking really good.

106
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.110
So also what I'm going to do is take out these beginning kind of intro shots if we don't need, because

107
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.540
we know his performance starts here, because I can tell that he probably started here and then messed

108
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.780
up.

109
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:32.140
So the next thing I'm going to do is take out the beginning intro stuff that we don't need skewed everything

110
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.920
over.

111
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:39.100
And then I just like to take out the ending stuff that we don't need as well.
