00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.720
All right, so our edit is really starting to come together, and I think we're yeah, 48 seconds into

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.870
our demo reel, and I hope that your demo reel is coming together and hopefully you've been able to

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.250
use the footage that we've created together previously in the course.

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.460
So now what I want to do is go ahead and look at it from the beginning, because we're at a point where

5
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.790
I want to do something different, you know, because we're doing this together and we're taking the

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.110
time to edit this.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.800
I want to kind of take a risk.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.520
So let's watch our edit and then I'll talk about what my idea is and hopefully we can pull it off.

9
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.300
OK, so it's looking good, right?

10
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.780
It's coming together.

11
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.810
Now, we have this kind of like I mentioned earlier, the calm part of our track before it goes into

12
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.890
a more excited part.

13
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.030
Now, you can easily just take our footage, you know, and have it on the same track.

14
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.800
No problem.

15
00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:01.480
But I want to kind of try something, and I also want to find a way to bring in a portion to put this

16
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.080
great.

17
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.090
How do I say this, this awesome drone footage that we have?

18
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.180
So my idea is that in this compart, we'll kind of filter this track down.

19
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.900
We'll bring up the audio of our drone footage to create something unique and unexpected.

20
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.910
And when the drone footage is done, Zo will transition into a new track.

21
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.470
So rarely do you see two songs in one demo reel.

22
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.600
And that's what we're going to try to do.

23
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.950
So let's go ahead and paste this in.

24
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.230
I moved the rest of our great Selex back out of the way.

25
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.060
That will then place back in once we kind of finagle a way to use these shots.

26
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.980
Now, I know I want this portion to have sound design.

27
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.990
So I'm going to move these drone shots that don't have sound design to the back.

28
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.950
And I'm going to scoot over these other shots that do have sound design right here.

29
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.220
So let's see.

30
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.290
OK.

31
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.740
And what I want to do is I'm going to solo this track right on the hit where it goes into the compart.

32
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.650
We're going to create a cut.

33
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.950
Right there, boom.

34
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.650
And what we're going to do is go it's either a low pass filter or a high pass filter, I always get

35
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.330
it messed up, mixed up.

36
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.190
Let's try Lopez filter.

37
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.200
OK.

38
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.820
And let's go to the beginning of the cut we just made and let's make this not affect our clip.

39
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.490
Wait, let's turn it all the way up so that it's not affecting our clip.

40
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.400
OK, and let's make a keyframe and then let's go forward and then let's turn it down to maybe five hundred.

41
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.340
And let's hear.

42
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.960
OK, so I'm liking that, but what I want to do, you know what the Lopez filter makes it sound like

43
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.709
underwater, which is really cool, if we were to cut to the underwater shots that we have somewhere

44
00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.850
in our edit room like that sounds like the low pass filter.

45
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.720
But we are going up in the sky with the drone footage.

46
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.850
So I'm going to actually turn this effect off and I'm going to do a high pass filter.

47
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.200
Now, let's see.

48
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.700
Yes.

49
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.680
So that's doing the opposite effect as a low pass, the low pass is cutting off all the highs, the

50
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.690
high passes, cutting off all the lows.

51
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.480
Now let's go all the way down and go to the beginning of our clip.

52
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.420
Hit, cut off.

53
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.960
I'm actually going to skew the clip over as well.

54
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.910
Go a few seconds forward and then turn up are high pass filter.

55
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:12.840
So it should create a smooth transition from normal sounding audio to a very kind of high pitch or not

56
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.000
necessarily high pitch, but almost high end is what I'm trying to say, where there's no bass.

57
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.840
Oh, yeah, that sounds like it's in the air.

58
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.610
I'm loving that, so what I want to do is actually bring this effect in sooner.

59
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.380
Yep.

60
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.780
Perfect.

61
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.490
OK, I'm loving that.

62
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.660
And we want to get into our new song by the time this drop comes in.
