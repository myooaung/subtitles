00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.480
All right, let's do this, so download the footage if you haven't already or have your footage that

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.110
you're going to use.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.370
Ready to be dragged into your editing software.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.690
So because we've already done two projects where we've really done the beginning stages of the workflow

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.850
and of creating our proper folders, we're going to start spending less time on those pre preparation

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.140
phases and we're going to start spending more time on the more editing process, the finalizing process

7
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.530
and the refining process so that our exports are even better as we go through the course.

8
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.610
Now, like I mentioned, I already have my folders set up and ready to go.

9
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.020
I have an audio folder that has the audio that we're going to be using for the project.

10
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.480
I have a behind the scenes folder with footage and clips from the shoot.

11
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.730
We may use some of this.

12
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.780
We may not will see.

13
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.990
As you can see, that's how it went down.

14
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.709
And we have our footage folder.

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.350
This is our main footage that we're going to be using.

16
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.910
This content was shot in four case, will also be walking you through the creating your proxy's step

17
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.810
in this section.

18
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
And I already have the premiere folder ready to go.

19
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.620
And we have the student dallas' folder.

20
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.080
That's the folder that you'll be using for your footage.

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.040
So once you have all your folders ready, of course, your next step is going to be to back up that

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.480
footage in those folders.

23
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.890
So go ahead and copy your entire main folder.

24
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.440
Drag it and paste it into your external separate hard drive and create your backup duplicate version

25
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.910
of your project files.

26
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.380
And once that's done, we're going to go to our editing software.

27
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.410
We're going to create a new project.

28
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.100
I'm just going to title this, the violinist, because it is a violinist performance.

29
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.590
OK, the name.

30
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.110
And then we're going to set the location

31
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.320
inside the proper editing file.

32
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.930
And it OK, now that we have our editing project ready to go, the next stage is going to be to drag

33
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.610
in our main footage folder.

34
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.510
Let's go ahead and drag that in

35
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.840
and we can go ahead and drag in our audio folder as well.

36
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.570
For you, it may look different.

37
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.120
You might not have an audio and footage folder yet, but you navigate to your downloads folder for your

38
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.610
personal project folder and drag the proper clips into your editing software.

39
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.240
And now we have all of our footage.

40
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.530
And like I mentioned, the version of footage that you're going to be working on if you downloaded,

41
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.460
this is going to be a slightly lower resolution.

42
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.790
It's not going to be Forcier.

43
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.540
Otherwise it would take you days to download the footage.

44
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.410
I compressed the original video files so that you can easily download and actually access them.

45
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.940
So I'm personally working with the full resolution files, which means.

46
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:29.250
If I were to create a new sequence from one of these four K files and hit play, what's going to happen

47
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.300
is the computer will be able to handle it at first.

48
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.150
But rarely do you have a computer, a laptop, a desktop computer that can really handle four K files

49
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.420
being played back at full resolution.

50
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.800
So when you're shooting for K on your phone or on your camera or with a drone or whatever it is, and

51
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.580
you're noticing that you're playback isn't smooth and it's going it's getting choppy.

52
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.800
We don't want that that kills your creativity and that doesn't allow for you to really get into your

53
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.610
flow state.

54
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.220
And the best, easiest way around that is to create what we call a proxy file.

55
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:19.769
Now, a proxy file is simply a temporary copy kind of stand in of the original file.

56
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.470
But it's a lower resolution file that's easy for your computer to playback.

57
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.810
This is what you use while you're editing is the proxy file.

58
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.690
And then when you're ready to export the final video, you turn off your proxy files and export with

59
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.220
the four resolution files.

60
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.480
And even if your computer doesn't lag on just playing back one for K file, I guarantee when you start

61
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.640
to really build out your edit and you have multiple layers and there's a lot of things going on in the

62
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.050
timeline and you're trying to play back at four K file, there's going to be some Chipley choppiness.

63
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.310
OK, so let's now get into the workflow on how to properly create a proxy file.

64
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.900
So what I'm going to start with here is by taking all of our footage that we have, and I'm to highlight

65
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.060
it.

66
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:17.340
And next, I'm going to right click, go to the dropdown menu, go to proxy and click create proxies.

67
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.680
What's going to pop up next is it's going to ask me what of the preset options I want to use.

68
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:33.030
I'm going to choose low resolution, proxy file, of course, higher resolution, more data for your

69
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.730
computer to try to playback smoothly.

70
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.110
The lower the resolution, the less data, the easier and more flow.

71
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.980
Your computer can have to playback your high rez files.

72
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.620
So I'm going to click low res proxy.

73
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.660
And before we hit, OK, we want to set our destination folder, OK?

74
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.890
Otherwise, it's going to save our proxies in some random place in your computer, and you're not going

75
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.760
to know where they went.

76
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:05.130
So let's click on Browse and let's now navigate to our proper editing folder.

77
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.080
And I'm going to create a proxy's folder.

78
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.810
This is where all the proxies are going to select the folder and hit, OK.

79
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.840
Now for Premiere, what this is going to do is it's going to pop up Adobe Media Encoder and it's going

80
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.480
to add all these proxy files to a queue.

81
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.730
Now, for whatever editing software that you're using, there's going to be some type of similar process

82
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.320
where it's going to be added to a queue.

83
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.010
And it's very likely that you'll have to just simply click the start or play button to start that queue,

84
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.180
to start generating those proxy files for your original files.

85
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.290
And here we go.

86
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.280
It looks like Adobe Media Encoder is already cooking.

87
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.620
You can see it's got all the files that we just chose queued up, ready to go.

88
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.910
And we're going to take a second to let these explorer.

89
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.850
OK.

90
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.940
And so that's really got my computer on one.

91
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.980
So if you can hear the fan in the background, I'm sorry, it kind of sounds like spaceship, but sounds

92
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.580
like a Tesla.

93
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.360
But that's because it takes a lot of computing power to convert these files.

94
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.930
So my proxies are done exporting.

95
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:25.740
And the next step, if it doesn't already show in your project window a proxy's tab, what we're going

96
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.590
to do is right click the top, go to metadata display, type in proxy.

97
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.310
Proxy hit, OK.

98
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:43.830
And now, as you see, we have this proxy column and it shows on all the files that we wanted to create

99
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.850
proxies for.

100
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.860
We've got him, and that is how you create proxies.

101
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:56.700
So you can come back to this lecture for any future projects to revisit how to create proxies so that

102
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.050
your computer can handle the high resolution files that you're working on.

103
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:06.330
In the next lecture, we're going to start dragging the footage into the timeline and start building

104
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.530
out our edit.
