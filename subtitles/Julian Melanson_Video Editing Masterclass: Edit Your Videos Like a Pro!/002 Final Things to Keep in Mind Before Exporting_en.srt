1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,470
And I just wanted to add a few more of a little bit of a mental checklist to check off before actually

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,010
hitting the export button on the final final edit.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,420
So be sure that all of your sequences in the edit itself and all the different clips in the edit.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,090
Of course, everything is where it needs to be.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,270
The visuals are clearly synched up to the audio.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,270
You're cutting to the B, you're cutting to the dialogue.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,850
There's no cuts that are too quick, and there's no cuts that are too slow and boring.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,340
You want to find that middle ground and really find a rhythm and pacing that matches with the overall

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,110
vibe of that project.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,210
Of course, you want to color.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:51,060
Correct and get all the lighting exposure, color, temperature, tone, saturation, sharpness.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,680
Correct on your image.

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,170
And then you want to go through a do the grading process.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,100
So we spent a lot of time on which is then stylizing and adding a very unique aesthetic look to the

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,160
final footage.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,300
And then, you know, you want to do some cool effects.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,030
What are the transitions and overlays that you can add on to the edit that you're going to do multiple

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,710
times throughout that one video?

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,730
That's going to be the unique look and specific special effect.

20
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,460
You know, whether it's film burns or whether it's Ruchi type audio transitions or whether it's kind

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,600
of a glitchy style.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,240
There's going to be a specific look.

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,050
You really want to narrow and hone in on and develop for that project.

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,170
Then you want to smooth and level out all of your audio, all of your music using these techniques that

25
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,310
we've done using the bezier when you keyframe to really create a smooth in and out point and really

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,380
blend your audio elements together.

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,830
And finally, you want to drop in your final media assets, whether that's a motion graphic title card

28
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:59,610
at the beginning, at the end, showing your website, showing your client's product, URL, whatever

29
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,030
it is.

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,580
That'll be one of the final steps that you'll do.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,680
And when you take these and do all of these elements together in the way that we've done it throughout

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:16,950
this course and apply that all to one video, that is when you create a super amazing epic, interesting,

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:28,380
inspiring, educational, motivating and magnetic piece of art, piece of work that you do with your

34
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,250
own creativity.

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:39,060
So I hope that that little mini recap summary gives you some final tidbits on what we learned throughout

36
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,110
this course.
