00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.780
OK, perfect.

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.080
So let's dive right into the screen cap and let's get into this edit.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.560
So here we go.

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.119
We have our main sequence.

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.800
And as you can see, I've already pulled the Selex.

6
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.420
So if you're choosing to download the footage and work alongside with me, your footage is going to

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.860
be labeled like this.

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.790
Bathroom, bedrooms, day two, night transition, exterior kitchen, dining room, etc. So you're going

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:35.790
to get movie files that have all these super epic Steadicam smooth kind of dolly style of shots.

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.990
So bringing those into your editing software, pull your Selex.

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.480
And I would assume that if you've been following the course, you're going to want to use a similar

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.260
strategy to really organize and categorize your Viorel.

13
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.110
So right now, I have about two minutes of Selex in my timeline.

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.680
And I just went through and I labeled the 10 shots are these intro kind of exterior shots, the blue

15
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.160
shots.

16
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.600
We go into the house, these kind of pink magenta shots are the bathrooms and bedrooms.

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.510
Yellow shots are the pool in the backyard.

18
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.600
Oh, God, that looks so nice.

19
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.270
I want to be there.

20
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.930
So.

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.380
And then the blue shots are kind of these nighttime shots.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.680
And we're going to do a really cool date and night transition between these two shots.

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.320
But what I want to share in this video lesson specifically is that when you're dealing with a project

24
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.350
where you have a lot of beautiful B roll and you're going to edit it to a soundtrack and make a montage,

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.750
that's a showcase of some kind.

26
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.620
Even if you haven't shot the footage or the footage you're working with hasn't been shot with a story

27
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:58.420
that's being told, you have to kind of use your ninja skills and really work the story into the footage

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.380
by organizing it in a way that makes the most sense.

29
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.350
And I want to explain that by showing you that in this timeline, if we zoom in here, we have this

30
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.250
first shot is shot seven thousand six hundred and nine.

31
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.120
All right.

32
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.970
No, excuse me.

33
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.620
There's seven thousand sixty nine and seven thousand sixty eight.

34
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.500
So these were shot way later than seven thousand twenty nine, seven thousand thirty one.

35
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.510
I hope you can see these numbers there a little bit small, but we have seven thousand thirty one thirty

36
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780
seven fifty one.

37
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.040
So what I'm explaining is that these were shot like this one was shot first.

38
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.780
And then I shot this one and I shot this one.

39
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.620
I shot this one.

40
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.810
And then in this post-production phase of pulling Selex, I pulled and move things around where I don't

41
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.790
have to necessarily put the edit together in the order that I shot the footage.

42
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.480
Why?

43
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.300
Because I want to rearrange things to tell a better story.

44
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.470
So if I put this in the order of the way I shot it, you know, these shots would have been first and

45
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.930
then we would have had the entrance to the house.

46
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.210
We would have gone into the house.

47
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.510
Right.

48
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.080
Like this.

49
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.290
And so on.

50
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.980
So that might be obvious.

51
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.020
It may not you know, you don't want to be bound by what happened on the filming day.

52
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.920
You want to take what happened on the filming day, rearrange it, remix, edit it, and that's going

53
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.840
to help you create a better story.

54
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.760
So the story that we're telling here is basically the vision or the view that a customer or a client

55
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.080
would have for experiencing this specific showcase or this specific product, which is this high end

56
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.670
real estate property.

57
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.480
So they go into the house, they experience the living spaces, the living room, the dining room,

58
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.030
the kitchen, and then we go upstairs.

59
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.360
Right.

60
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.480
We're showing them where they're going in this process.

61
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.180
They see the bedrooms, the bathrooms, and then they kind of see the vacation space, the beautiful

62
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.900
backyard.

63
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.220
And then we transition into nighttime and we have these nighttime shots.

64
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.250
So they would experience what it's like, you know, living out this space and then ending on this really

65
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.230
cool chandelier shot.

66
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.760
Is that just simple kind of reorganizing of the footage just helps to further tell a story.

67
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.460
So I want you to really keep that in mind for your edits and specifically for footage that you have

68
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.220
where there's no storyline, there's no dialogue or script or there's no beginning, middle and end.

69
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.120
Initially of this footage that you have, you can use your ninja skills to remix that footage and create

70
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.710
something that tells a better story.

71
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.300
I think I repeated that a few times, but I really want to get this point across because it's an incredibly

72
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.820
important nuance and subtlety that some editors understand and some editors.

73
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.760
So I hope that helps you, and I will see you in the next learning lesson.
