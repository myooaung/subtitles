1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,710
So I hope you've been enjoying this process, putting your own edit together, and I hope that it's

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,930
been something that's been on like your hard drive of your phone space has been needing to get edited

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,090
into something interesting.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,490
So the next step that we're going to focus on here is really to start to refine our audience.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,020
Now, this is going to start to really bring everything together, and it's going to make the blending

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,030
in between our shots a lot more linked in and linked together.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,650
So there's a few different ways, two main ways that we can kind of lend our audio together.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,590
And let's take a look at the first way here.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:44,430
So if we select our audio in our timeline and we go to the effects tab here just by scrolling over to

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:53,210
effects and we type in Crossfade, it's going to give us these audio transitions.

11
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:53,730
OK.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,090
It's going to give us the ability to do a constant game, constant power, which are basically the same

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,440
thing.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:07,530
It's the amount of curve that it's transitioning or cross fading in between two clips.

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,330
And then an exponential fade is going to have a very steep drop off exponentially.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,140
So I wouldn't worry too much about the type of curve you're dropping on this.

17
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,650
The basis is the same.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,440
So let's go ahead and do the constant power here.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,460
Drop it in and let's see what that sounds like right out the gate.

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,500
So that's one way to do it.

21
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,940
For me personally, this is the quick, easy way to do things when it comes to audio transitions.

22
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,300
I personally don't like doing it that way.

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,760
So I'm going to show you another way to do it.

24
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,300
OK.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,890
What I like to do is layer things, because this you don't have too much manual control over how long

26
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,970
the feed is over here.

27
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,490
And it can be a short fade over here between two clips.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,810
I'm crazy.

29
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,730
And I like to have that type of control.

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:10,160
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to start pulling together these tracks on different layers

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,120
of the timeline.

32
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,870
OK.

33
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:21,080
So all I'm doing here is highlighting the audio portion of one of my clips, and I'm dragging it down

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,190
to the layer below.

35
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,300
OK.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,670
And you can see I'm alternating these layers between the two.

37
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:39,590
That way I can create more of a slope from one to the other by basically doing the same thing that a

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,870
filter will do.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,240
But I'm doing that process manually.

40
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,610
Now, the next step to really get this done is to highlight all of your clips.

41
00:02:50,090 --> 00:03:00,050
And you want to separate the audio from the video, because if I try to drag this over, it's attached

42
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,800
to the video layer, as you can see, whatever I do with the audio.

43
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,440
The video follows.

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,120
That's fine and well until you want to start refining just the video and just the audio.

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:19,040
So what we have to do is unlink those two things so that we can have a little bit more control manually.

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,520
And the best way to do that is to select a video clip where you want to separate the audio and video

47
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,040
so you can control them separately and hit command l.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,680
OK.

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,320
That's the shortcut in premier.

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,920
And that is going to d link our selection.

51
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:42,740
The other way to do that is to click the linked selection icon right here in the timeline.

52
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,330
This is going to do the same exact thing.

53
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,860
Both of these are linked.

54
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:52,640
If I tap that now, I can control them separately, which is what we want to do in this situation.

55
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,570
OK.

56
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,230
So I'm going to do that for all my clips in the timeline.

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,200
So there's two ways to do that as well.

58
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,560
I can highlight all the clips and hit command.

59
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,780
Well, now they're separated or I can hit command, eh?

60
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,040
Which, eh, for all highlights, all the clips in the timeline.

61
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,220
So it would be command a boom.

62
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,250
Everything is highlighted.

63
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,930
Command L, boom.

64
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,360
The audio and the video files are now separate.

65
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,460
So now we move on to manually overlapping these.

66
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,130
And I'm going to kind of drag this around a little bit so we can see things better here.

67
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,740
I'm going to pull this up.

68
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm a shrink that down.

69
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,340
So now we can kind of see our audio files a little bit more.

70
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,020
Now, when you're working on the video, you want to be able to see the video clearly so you can move

71
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,530
your layout of your editing software in a more appropriate way.

72
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,980
That's best for you to see it clearly when you're working on the audio.

73
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,500
You know, you don't really need to see the video as much.

74
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,040
So you can maximize the view of your audio.

75
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,910
OK.

76
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,550
But what I'm going to do is drag these to overlap.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm going to hit P, which is the pen tool, which is going to allow for me to create key frames for

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,700
the audio layer.

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,330
OK.

80
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,130
Like I said, this is the man we're doing manually what a crossfade is doing automatically.

81
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,450
But we want to be good editors that have control over on editing software, and this is how we do it.

82
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,650
So I hit P.

83
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,240
This brings up the pen tool.

84
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:33,740
And wherever I click on the volume line of our audio files, that is where it's going to create a key

85
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,370
frame.

86
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,640
And I can now create a fade.

87
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,510
So take a listen.

88
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,400
OK.

89
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,270
And the reason I do this is because I can manually drag.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,800
And create a short fade or a longer fade.

91
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,450
OK.

92
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:03,160
And have more control over how quickly the two audio clips are blending together, which is really important.

93
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,630
OK, so let's take a listen.

94
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,390
That's not too bad.

95
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,900
OK.

96
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,740
So I feel there's a little extra space there that we don't need.

97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,860
So I just scooted everything over.

98
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,260
And.

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm going to drag this clip over it, pee for the pen to create a key frame.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,050
And then create another keyframe at the beginning to create this.

101
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,930
Fade in.

102
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,090
OK, let's take a listen.

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,090
OK, and we're going to fade this out.

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,660
And the more we drag, the audio fade out under the next clip, the more they're going to kind of blend

105
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,850
together and the more they're going to kind of blur where the cutting physically or visually happens.

106
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,730
When you bring in the audio of the next clip, it leads in to the cut to show you what the next clip

107
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,150
is.

108
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,580
So sometimes the clip comes into abruptly.

109
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,010
That might mean that you need to fade the audio of that clip that's coming in sooner so that you're

110
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,150
giving the audience more of a heads up of what's happening next.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,340
OK, we're going to do the same process here, dragging over the audio, creating a crossfade.

112
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,980
Dragging over the audio, creating a crossfade.

113
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,580
Way better.

114
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,160
So you see how that happens there.

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,740
Those really seamlessly blend together.

116
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,600
Now, if we go to our backup and we have that same exact cut.

117
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,400
It looks like the map, the cut just doesn't match visually.

118
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,040
Why?

119
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,330
Because the audio is telling the viewer what to prepare for, what to feel, what to think.

120
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,080
And really, it gives a layer of, you know, how they interpret what they're seeing visually.

121
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,370
So let's look at it.

122
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,350
Looks abrupt and out of place.

123
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,690
And let's go back to what we're working on here.

124
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:38,760
Perfect.

125
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,299
OK.
