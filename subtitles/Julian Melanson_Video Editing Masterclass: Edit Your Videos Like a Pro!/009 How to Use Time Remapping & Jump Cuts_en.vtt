00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.630
We're going to do another kind of cool ninja trick here with our time remapping function.

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.780
So I'm going to right click this clip and I'm going to bring up again the time remapping function.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.440
And I'm going to remaps the beginning of this clip.

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.880
Let's add a key frame about right there and let's speed up the beginning of the clip.

5
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.840
So I'm even going to push it up a little bit more just to get that extra push through that first frame

6
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.750
and kind of give the shot a little extra sauce.

7
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.080
OK, cool.

8
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.030
I feel like now it rides the beat a little bit better.

9
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.610
You see how it gives the throw down right there, just a little bit more of a wimpiness that we want

10
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.920
for this specific scenario, and we're going to listen to the beat to see when the next time we should

11
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.880
cut should be.

12
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.860
Yeah, it's looking pretty good.

13
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.110
This cut right here is a little bit late.

14
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.750
So I'm going to scoot everything over.

15
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.600
Hold command.

16
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.620
Hit the left arrow.

17
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:28.470
I think this point right here where the song kind of that will be a good point to end the video, so

18
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
I'm just going to do a little mini fade at the end there, pen tool.

19
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.540
OK, it's OK.

20
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.040
It ends a little bit abruptly.

21
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.960
It's kind of one of those more punchy styles of edits, it doesn't really need to be any longer than

22
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.980
15 seconds.

23
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.690
So let's see what we can fit in that time frame.

24
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.540
And the higher the frequency of cutting that we're doing.

25
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.970
The higher the energy is going to fuel the edit.

26
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.290
So we're going to even squeeze these things even into a shorter time frame.

27
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.470
I want to cut it while that battery is still on its way out of the camera, because that's going to

28
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.259
cut really smoothly into this motion.

29
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.320
And this is going to be a perfect time to be able to do some skipping forward, this is kind of another

30
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.830
aesthetic artistic decision, same way that we did this time remapping here or we sped the clip up.

31
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.560
But for this one specifically, because there's a cool thing that's spinning in frame, I think it'll

32
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.670
look cool stylistically to do some jump cuts, jumping forward.

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.990
If you're doing normal storytelling, you don't want to break continuity and do jump cuts.

34
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.200
It can be a little bit not look so good.

35
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.620
But when it's done purposefully for a specific look, I think it works.

36
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.850
So let's find out where we want to do these cuts to the beat.

37
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.740
OK.

38
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.380
Right there.

39
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.040
And there's something I want to share here.

40
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.870
So let's change the color of this clip so we know we're focusing on make this purpose, OK.

41
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.310
And since I want to do these jump cuts, I'm to show you two ways to do it.

42
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.160
The first way is a normal way and the second way, the upgraded ninja way.

43
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.570
OK.

44
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.930
I think that's going to be the phrase we're going to start using throughout this course.

45
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.450
So I'm going to choose where I want to cut.

46
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.970
And there's a we can go and we can select our clip.

47
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:31.400
Let the track play and hit the marker or the end key to create markers of where we know the beat is

48
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.690
and where we want to make the cuts.

49
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.630
So let's see what that looks like when I do that.

50
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.950
So where these four markers are, that is where a cut can be.

51
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.330
That's writing the beat.

52
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.020
So now we can make these cuts.

53
00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.950
And I'm going to duplicate this clip so that I can show you the two different ways we can go about making

54
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.770
these jump jump cuts moving forward in time.

55
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.230
So I'm going to hold Alz, drag my clip up, and now we have a new clip we can work with.

56
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.830
So on this first beat where we want to make our cut, we can make a cut and then make another cut and

57
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.820
drag our clip across to create this first jump cut.

58
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.220
OK, we can go to the next one.

59
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.080
Create a cut.

60
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.830
And skip forward a little bit more.

61
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.130
And see what that looks like.

62
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.470
OK.

63
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.400
And I'm thinking that that'll be perfect timing,

64
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.400
perfect to go into the blue cliff here.

65
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.060
So that is option one.

66
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.530
You click drag, click, drag.

67
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.410
I want to show you a shortcut that's going to save you some time when you're doing it.

68
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.190
So we're going to create another clip and I'm going to do a cut again, like I did before.

69
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.530
But instead of making a cut, clicking, dragging, what I'm going to use on this clip is the slip tool.

70
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.890
And the slip tool is essentially letting you leave that clip in the same physical place.

71
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:28.060
But you're scrubbing through the clip, changing the time frame that is being used in that clip without

72
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.300
physically movie.

73
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.740
So it's a lot easier when you have a very complex timeline to not have to like drag and then drag over

74
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.690
and potentially mess up other clips.

75
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.960
So we're going to make that cut that we just did.

76
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.730
I'm going to hit you for the slot tool, and then I'm going to click and drag.

77
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:52.900
And you can see as I'm scrubbing through what I just did was without moving or dragging this clip physically,

78
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.080
what I did was dragged the time frame.

79
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.990
So it skips forward, right?

80
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.140
It's a same exact process, but a little bit more clean than the way we did it right here.

81
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.060
And now I'm going to do it again.

82
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.440
I'm going to make it cut.

83
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.800
And instead of stretching out this clip, making the cut and dragging it over, what I'm going to do

84
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:22.150
is select the clip, hit y for the slip tool and I'm going to click and drag.

85
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.790
So that we're scrubbing through that clip.

86
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.990
And skipping ahead in time, I'm going to hit Veha to get back to my normal arrow tool.

87
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.930
Oh, and there we go.

88
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.110
Two very quick ways to create a tasteful jumpcut.
