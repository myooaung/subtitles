1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,620
Where is your star?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,000
Do you see?

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,020
Take a deep breath in.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,480
Bringing in all the juicy Murphy yumminess and stickiness that life offers.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,060
And experience here sounds revitalized.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,290
Now, purposefully intent.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,550
OK, I love this sequence here.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,830
This is such a fun was such a fun sequence to shoot, and it was a really fun sequence to edit together.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,030
So we have a lot of different pacing changes here.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,470
We really follow the flow of her voice.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,770
So pay attention to the intonation and the energy and the kind of speed and rhythm of her vocals, and

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,410
then watch the speed and rhythm of the visuals as well.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:04,050
So we have one long shot here for quick shots, one shot, another shot, one medium shot, and then

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,990
we go to even longer shots back here.

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,260
So let's watch those two items.

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,420
So pay attention to what's going on here.

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,710
Take a deep breath in.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,140
Bringing in all the juicy, messy yumminess and stickiness that life offers.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,730
And experience yourselves revitalized.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,300
Now purposefully, intentionally carried out.

21
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,290
You OK, perfect.

22
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,110
So we are really riding the beat of her vocals.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
Now, what I mentioned about having a different type of overlay.

24
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,340
I did something here to really spice up these shots.

25
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,330
There is not as many sparks as you would imagine in the actual content, in the actual footage.

26
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,070
So I have these.

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:04,070
What we did is I had my cinematographer the day of the shoot film, a bunch of footage with just the

28
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:12,080
black sky in the background and sparks and embers coming up from the actual fire that we had on set.

29
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,110
But without the talent, without the character, without anything like that, he just filmed just the

30
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,660
sparks.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Now, I used those raw video files that we have overlaid right here.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,250
This is the overlays of the sparks.

33
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,170
This is the footage below.

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,900
I use these as a basically almost like a film burn, but more of an overlay.

35
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,990
So I use the same process of setting it to screen.

36
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:47,620
And if we take these out, boom, you're going to see the sparks disappear that weren't actually there.

37
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,790
So we have all these sparks take away.

38
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,630
It's just that.

39
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,340
So if I let that play for us.

40
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,190
So again, the computer is kind of lagging because these Forres files are so dense.

41
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,860
But I can't fully play this through.

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,160
But we have it without the sparks, with the sparks, without, with.

43
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,290
And as we go through, these sparks end up making a huge difference.

44
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,690
See, we have all this coming through, this part of the frame.

45
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,960
These guys, these vertical ones, if I were to remove that, then we don't have this whole area is

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,620
kind of empty.

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,980
And even in this sequence where I kind of overlay, you can see these sparks starting to come in here.

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,520
So if you go frame by frame, it looks kind of like something's odd.

49
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:41,180
But what I did was blend in this layer of sparks onto the image a little bit before just to spice things

50
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,600
up a little bit, because what she's saying and the vibe of that part of the track really needed something

51
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,870
in the yumminess and sticky that life offers.

52
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,120
And there's also, as you can see, a slight time remapping right here.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:04,760
You can see we speed up the footage was zoom just a little bit, stickiness, that light boom and experience

54
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,560
your sounds revitalized.

55
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,350
So, yeah, all this stuff in the foreground, all these really cool blurred out sparks.

56
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,250
Yeah, those are all added later on in the edit.

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,990
Now, there are a lot of other situations where you can do these kind of unique overlays.

58
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,100
You can film your own film, burns in your own overlays just like this.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Anything that has a dark background that you can film with a light foreground of what you want to retain

60
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,500
in that type of custom overlay that you're filming just like this.

61
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,700
I knew ahead of time I wanted this to look like a crazy bonfire scene.

62
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,820
That was something I knew going into the filming process that would be awesome to use in the editing

63
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,360
process.

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,880
So hopefully that gives you some cool insights and tips for getting the gears turning on some unique

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,150
stuff.

66
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,040
You can do with future edits.
