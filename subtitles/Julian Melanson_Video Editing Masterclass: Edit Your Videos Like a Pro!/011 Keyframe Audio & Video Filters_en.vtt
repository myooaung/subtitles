00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:07.200
OK, so I actually didn't have this video up and down, I wasn't planning on teaching this, but it

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.700
just came to my mind and I actually really want to share this technique of sinking audio cues with visual

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.100
cues.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.550
So we've been doing that to a certain extent in our edit where we have these overlays that we added

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.940
that sync up to, you know, big points in the track.

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.960
So if we hit play.

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.410
Yeah.

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.280
These cool visual moments sync up with the cool big audio moments.

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.700
But we can take this even a step further.

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.710
So what I want to show you is using a low pass and a high pass filter.

11
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.140
So if I turn this up and I apply a low pass filter to our edit, let's take a listen.

12
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.850
So it gives it the feeling that it's underwater, meaning it cuts off all of the high frequency of the

13
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.110
audio.

14
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.850
Now if we put a high pass filter.

15
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.510
It's going to do the opposite.

16
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.140
It's going to cut off all of the low frequency of the audio.

17
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.590
So let's go ahead and take that off and let's put back on our low pass filter.

18
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.330
And I'm going to keyframe this up.

19
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.480
And what I'm going to do is I want to engage this filter to make a cool kind of sound like you're kind

20
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.040
of going under water, going through a tunnel right before this big striking point.

21
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.260
Big moment of the song.

22
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.980
So if we take away all the low end, all the base of the track right before when the beat really is

23
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.990
predominant, that's going to make that more predominant part even more predominant by taking away the

24
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.780
base right before it.

25
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.150
So let's go to where we want to start our keyframe.

26
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.370
And I'm going to hit the stopwatch.

27
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.600
I'm going to go to where I want the key frame to be at its strongest.

28
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.630
I want the low pass filter to be at its most powerful.

29
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.830
And then I'm gonna go to right before where the beat comes in here.

30
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.660
And you can see I marked it off with these markers.

31
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.200
I'm going to do a third keyframe and I'm going to drag this filter all the way up, meaning it's not

32
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.030
cutting off any of the filter.

33
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.330
It's there.

34
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.940
So it's not cutting off any of the low end of our track.

35
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.760
So I'm going to do that at the beginning and at the end.

36
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.130
So what that's going to do if I zoom in here, this will be no effect added all of the effect added

37
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.660
and then no effect added.

38
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.670
So it's going to do a V is going to move kind of like that.

39
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.860
So if we take a listen.

40
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.530
It goes do do doo, do do right.

41
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.340
Without that effect.

42
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.840
OK.

43
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.910
Now, sounds pretty -- cool, right?

44
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.890
What I want to do now is create even more of a cool visual aesthetic for the sound that we're hearing.

45
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.950
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to nest these clips and collapse them into one clip so that I can

46
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.770
add an effect to all of these clips in this mini sequence.

47
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.900
OK.

48
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.630
And what I want to do is go to luminary color and we're going to keyframe.

49
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.430
Let's see the saturation.

50
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.680
So let me go to the beginning of the clip.

51
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.360
Hit a key frame.

52
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.140
Go to right before the biko's in, hit a key frame and go to the middle.

53
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.400
And I'm going to bring the saturation all the way down.

54
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.150
So what's going to happen is it's going to play.

55
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.620
It's going to get black and white.

56
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.420
And then it's going to go back to color.

57
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.430
OK, cool, so I want to get that effect to be even more dramatic, so I'm going to keyframe the shadows

58
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.510
and the highlights.

59
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.550
I'm going to go to the beginning.

60
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.370
Boom at the keyframes.

61
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.070
Go to the end.

62
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.220
And the keyframes go back to the middle.

63
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.720
Boost the highlights.

64
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.400
Drop the shadows.

65
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.890
So there's super tons of contrast.

66
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.580
And let's see what that's starting to look like, boom.

67
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.690
OK, so I want this effect to start a little bit earlier.

68
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.050
I want this to start going black and white sooner.

69
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.420
So I'm going to drag the keyframes over.

70
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.190
Here we go.

71
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.650
That's starting to look cool.

72
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.000
OK.

73
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.280
And then when we get here to this shot, that's when I want the color to start coming back, so I want

74
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.240
to put that to zero.

75
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.770
And that way, the saturation won't start coming back to there.

76
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.700
And then you can really see the transformation in the skin tone.

77
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.710
And you really see the effect.

78
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.030
OK.

79
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.940
So I want to take this even a step further.

80
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.910
Let's add let's say a little bit more distortion just to really get even more.

81
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.940
Of the kind of feeling that the visuals and the audio are getting distorted together, so creaky frame

82
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.070
right there I go to the beginning keyframe.

83
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.190
Ending keyframe boom, so right at the center.

84
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.910
Let's bring us up to, let's say, 50.

85
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.590
And you can see instantly what that does, all this little noise in here.

86
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.010
So to render this.

87
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.000
And hit play

88
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:43.640
and let's go ahead and full screen it so we can really see the audio in the visual that we just created.

89
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.660
OK, perfect.

90
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.900
So that's looking super cool and super stylized, so that's just a bit of a bonus tip.

91
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.150
You know what, actually, let's put up the protip graphic.

92
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.270
Yes, that was a bit of a pro tip that I wanted to throw in there for your edits.
