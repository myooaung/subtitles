00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.260
Now, the question we want to ask ourselves in our edit is what kind of video is this and what is the

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.370
overall tone and vibe?

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.360
I know I kind of see that a lot, but that is really the most important part is creating a cohesive

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.710
look and feel.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.050
So hopefully not sound like a broken record, but it's one of the biggest things that takes a lot of

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.810
time and kind of intuition, being intuitive and really feeling in to the edit to really make these

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.090
right decisions, which comes with experience.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.060
So with our last edit, we used the color correction or color grading layer with a luminary lutt preset

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.310
look to really make it punchy, because that works for the vibe of that edit.

10
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.570
This is a much more natural outdoorsy.

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
It's already pretty colorful.

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.230
It's already pretty well lit.

13
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.930
I want to keep it natural so we're not going to focus on using a lot for this learning lesson.

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.730
But what we are going to do is selectively boost the color on certain parts of the image to get a really

15
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.060
natural but also elevated looking image.

16
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.640
So let's start with the next step by creating a new adjustment layer.

17
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.550
This way, we can use one single filter to effect all the clips in our timeline.

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.460
I created the adjustment layer here, and now I'm going to drag it into our timeline, move it up one

19
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.780
layer.

20
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.200
So it's on top of everything.

21
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.950
And I'm going to go ahead and drag on our color correction.

22
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.930
Filter.

23
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.470
I'm going to open up our little panels here.

24
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:48.570
And what I want to do is just very slightly adjust and saturate the greens in this image, because a

25
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.250
lot of this project is about the performance of the artist and the background.

26
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.850
And there's kind of that's the whole thing.

27
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.270
We're not having all these cutaway shots of other stuff to help tell a story.

28
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.050
It's really one character in one location.

29
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.259
And I want to just kind of subtly boost the location we're in and make it look as good as possible.

30
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:19.110
So if we scroll down and make sure you open up your curves, toggle on your color correction filter.

31
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.480
And if we scroll down, we can see the spectrum of color that we have here.

32
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:34.200
We have hue versus saturation, hue versus hue, hue versus luma and luma versus saturation and saturation

33
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.550
versus saturation.

34
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.260
These bottom two ones I have literally never used.

35
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.330
But what we're going to focus on are the first two and particularly the first one.

36
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.160
So what we can do here is create two key frames.

37
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.650
And you can see if I kind of scale this up a bit.

38
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:07.680
We can see we have the reds or magenta as our blues are kind of light blues, topaz or teal, our greens

39
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.720
are yellows and are orange.

40
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.820
We want to focus on the greens here.

41
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.750
So I'm going to create a keyframe at where green ends and I'm going to create the keyframe are right

42
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.220
around where green starts.

43
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.400
OK, this is similar to the speed remapping that we were doing, where we're selecting only a certain

44
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.290
part of our clip.

45
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.420
But instead of doing that with time, we're going to be doing that with the color of the image.

46
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.840
So I selected a beginning and end of where I want to select the color of my image, and now I'm going

47
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.360
to create one in the middle and bring it up.

48
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.130
Now I'm going to do this dramatically so that we can really see what we're doing and the effect that

49
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.820
we're creating.

50
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.440
So that's our look.

51
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.380
Now, if I undo it, that's the original.

52
00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.210
So you can see her skin tone stays the same and all the other colors in the image, like these flowers

53
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.590
down here stay the same color.

54
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.990
But we're boosting the green.

55
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.420
So that's with the boost.

56
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.860
That's without the boost.

57
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.090
That's with.

58
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.550
And that's without.

59
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:23.660
So it's a really cool effect that we can use to selectively enhance specific parts of our frame.

60
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.130
Now, the second option that I mentioned, which is going to be a little bit weird for this scenario,

61
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.800
because we're working with green and the color of plants in nature, so we don't want to change the

62
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.530
hue a whole lot.

63
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.090
But let's let's just check out and see what this effect will do.

64
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:51.590
So I'm going to create a similar set of key frames here so that we can select the same color spectrum.

65
00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:02.990
I'm going to push this up and you're going to see what it's doing is shifting the hue of just that color,

66
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.810
which is a really unique look.

67
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:18.500
So we can totally change the vibe completely off our edit something like this compared to what we were

68
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.350
working with before, which was this.

69
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.840
Pretty big difference.

70
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.060
Like I mentioned, we don't want to go for an over stylized look for this kind of project, we want

71
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.500
it to feel natural, but if this was more of an artistic music video or some kind of more sci fi type

72
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.400
of content, this would be something really unique that you could play with.

73
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:56.150
I personally would never change the color of plants and greenery, but what I do like to do.

74
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.490
I don't think we have any sky shots.

75
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.340
Yeah, we don't have any sky shots in this one.

76
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.760
But I do like to change the blues of the skies in all my videos to more of a Teale rather than a blue.

77
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:18.290
But let's say for experiment sake, if we wanted to change, if we wanted to change the color of our

78
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.520
flowers here, I'm going to go ahead and reset our parameters here.

79
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:31.430
You can always individually reset something that you changed by using these undo little back swirl thingamajigs.

80
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.140
So I could literally click that to undo our color, enhance on the greens.

81
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.980
But now let's focus on shifting the hues on our flowers.

82
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.830
So it's this magenta kind of pink.

83
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:51.630
So I'm going to go ahead and create two points around the color magenta in our Hue versus Hue panel.

84
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.380
And I'm going to push that up.

85
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.260
There we go.

86
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.960
Now we're getting some blue flowers.

87
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.050
And if I bring it down, we can get more orange.

88
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.860
So let's see if we get the blues.

89
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.980
So now we have more of a blue set of flowers.

90
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:25.510
But you have to be careful because as you can see, there's some magenta tone of color on her.

91
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.700
It's a brownish pinkish kind of tone on her violin.

92
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:36.120
So you've got to be careful when you're changing cue or boosting saturation and really look through

93
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.450
the rest of your edit to make sure you're not accidentally changing parts of the frame that you don't

94
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.140
want to change.
