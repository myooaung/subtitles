1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,900
OK.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,850
And this brings us to editing pace now a good way to kind of think of this is if we look at a timeline

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,450
here that we've been working to create for this first edit, each one of these blocks of footage is

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,200
creating a beat every single time we have a cut.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,520
It kind of actually looks like musical notes when you see it like this.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,980
And the reason that's interesting is because each one of these cuts is creating a beat.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,100
Each time there's a change right there, boom.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,670
That's a B.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,450
Whom there's another be so visually, we're creating almost a visual song, and the visuals are cued

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,750
up to how I explain this.

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,550
Oh, darn.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,270
OK, so the editing piece that we're deciding to create by the frequency or tempo of cutting.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,730
Right.

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,820
This is a low amount of frequency of cuts.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,230
This would be a high frequency of cuts, a high tempo of cutting.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,390
When we're doing that, we're dialing up and dialing down the overall energy of our edit.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,920
The higher the frequency and tempo, the higher the energy, the lower and lower energy doesn't necessarily

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,690
mean a bad thing.

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,900
It's all about the overall experience of your viewer that they're having from the vibe of your edit.

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,980
And if we go ahead and hit play here, if this is a slow intro.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,780
With a low number of cutting.

22
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:04,200
And it feels good to watch because the frequency and tempo of cutting is matching the tempo of the actual

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,860
song.

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:16,040
If it if so, if we were to take our backup sequence here with all of our shots and we're just going

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,290
to call this high tempo and it's going to be a little bit of an experiment.

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,080
Now, even though we have all these amazing shots to work with and you have a great shot for that moment,

27
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,180
it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to have shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.

28
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:39,290
If the emotion and tone of that part of your scene needs that, perfect.

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,020
But I want to show you an example of even though the shots are good, we don't need to use all of them.

30
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,940
We need to show the one that gives the right amount of information and creates the right response.

31
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:58,370
So it's kind of randomly make some cuts here with a really high tempo of shot choices.

32
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,720
And let's see what happens.

33
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,120
OK, we're going to use the same track.

34
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,350
We have the same footage, but we're just going to change what the viewer is seeing and.

35
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,650
And so that was a much more rapid pacing and tempo of cutting, there was still doing a good job of

36
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,110
showing all the great shots we were using.

37
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,240
So nothing bad about it.

38
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,350
It's just different.

39
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,190
Now, let's take a look at the edit we made together and see how the rhythm and editing pace compares

40
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,920
in and.

41
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,370
And.

42
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,620
In a.

43
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,890
So as you can see, same shots, but the frequency of cutting the tempo has increased.

44
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,200
So I'm saying this because there's no right or wrong.

45
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,040
It's all a creative decision.

46
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:12,910
But I want you to be aware of your options for all your projects moving forward so that you can really

47
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:21,610
consciously choose what to do and have all the tools in your arsenal as possible to make the best edits.
