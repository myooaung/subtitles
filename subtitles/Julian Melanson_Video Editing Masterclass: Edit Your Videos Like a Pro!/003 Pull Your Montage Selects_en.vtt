1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.120
Perfect.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.090
And now let's start pulling our Selex.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:14.040
So this first shot that we have is kind of an example of what this process looks like without any editing

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.400
done.

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.410
And.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.760
OK, as you can see, nothing special.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.280
But that is the purpose of post production to make something average look extraordinary.

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.090
So I'm going to label this clip Magenta, and I'm just not going to delete it, but I'm going to move

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.020
it to the back of the timeline, just so we have it as a reference later in our edit.

10
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.410
Next is this type of project that we're working on right now.

11
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.520
We already know ahead of time we're not going to be using the audio from our shoot, because, first

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.110
of all, everything is shot at 240 forty frames a second off my iPhone.

13
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.220
So the quality of the sound.

14
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.370
Is not going to be good because everything is slowed down, I think eight times slower than normal life.

15
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.400
And we're going to be using a musical track.

16
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.880
So there's two things we can do.

17
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.820
We can either select all of our clips, a command l like we did in our previous edit and delete the

18
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.730
audio, leaving the video to work with.

19
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.180
Or we can mute the entire track and layer of the audio.

20
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.410
Both do the same thing.

21
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.750
If you are doing it, edit and you temporarily want to get rid of your sound.

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.360
But you don't want to delete it just in case you're going to use it down the road.

23
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.000
You can use to track if you know 100 percent for a fact, you're not going to use the edit.

24
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.430
You can delete the track instead.

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.870
So with that done now, let's move into pulling our selects.

26
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.510
And there's going to be a lot of empty spaces here because we're shooting at such a high frame rate.

27
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.040
So it's going to be a lot of scrubbing ahead.

28
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.000
So what we're doing is we're trimming out what we don't need.

29
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.720
So we're going to scrub for it to where the action happens.

30
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.000
OK, he's pulling on the camera.

31
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.260
Open about the so that was actually a mistake, we're not making a blooper reel here, so we're not

32
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.230
going to be using any mistakes in this edit scrubbing forward.

33
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.910
OK.

34
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.330
Pulls up the camera, opens the battery, throws it on the ground, loads in a new battery and raises

35
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.810
the camera.

36
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.150
So this is kind of a master or a wide shot that is showing more of the whole process.

37
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.660
So we're going to be saving these different types of takes.

38
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.130
And then after we save all of them, then we're going to go back and watch them all the way through

39
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.450
to decide which one of the three of a specific take to use.

40
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.990
So this actually saves you a lot of time in the long run.

41
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.550
When you're doing a personal project that you shot with friends or a client project and you're trying

42
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.060
to put the edit together, but you're getting ahead of yourself a little bit by trying to make the final

43
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.250
product, when in reality, the editing process is a slow refining version by version.

44
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.270
Process where you're getting closer to the final product with each pass on your footage.

45
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.130
So we have another wide shot here.

46
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.850
And the other reason I'm to keep these different ones is because I want to have different options.

47
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.310
That's another part of post-production here, is having options to work with.

48
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.230
OK, so I'm going to take these two wide shot, someone to label them the same color.

49
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.850
So we know that these are wide shots.

50
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.360
And then we have these close ups where he's raising the lens.

51
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.550
I'm going to now label these.

52
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.960
Do a triple delete to get rid of that black empty space.

53
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.360
OK, now we're going on to a different shot where he's opening up the battery cartridge, letting the

54
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.000
battery fall very zero seven James Bond.

55
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.250
OK, we have another version of that, so I'm going to scroll to where the action happens right before

56
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.170
he opens it up, make a cut there.

57
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.330
Oh, everything looks so good in slow mo.

58
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.300
And now we're moving on to a different shot where now he's loading in a new battery.

59
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.160
OK, that one was a mistake.

60
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.010
So we're going to continue to scrub forward, OK?

61
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.060
He's pulling out the battery, kind of fumbles it and then brings it in the frame.

62
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.450
So we're probably not going to use this part because that doesn't add any value to our viewer or to

63
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.200
our audience.

64
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.540
It's something you want to really keep in mind here.

65
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.710
What is adding value and what is the essential information?

66
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.100
You don't want any frames in your project that don't need to be in the video unless it's adding some

67
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.940
type of value.

68
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:22.040
Looks like we have another angle here of him dropping the battery.

69
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:36.420
OK, so let's scoot that one over so that we're a little bit in the proper chronological order here.

70
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.410
And then I think, yeah, we have this final shot of just the closing of the battery hitting the ground.

71
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.710
So I'm going to scrub to right before the battery comes into frame.

72
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.140
OK.

73
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.530
And you can scrub one frame at a time with the left and right arrows on your keep.

74
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.750
OK, right there.

75
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.590
And make a cut.

76
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.180
Delete what's not needed.

77
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.830
Oh, I'm going to make it cut after the battery has been on the ground for a minute.

78
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.720
We definitely don't need any of this.

79
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.010
Delete that.

80
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.110
And let's put that roughly where it's going to go.

81
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.890
So he throws the battery.

82
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.820
OK.

83
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.580
And then the battery hits the ground.

84
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.640
And again, I held command.

85
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.250
When I drag this clip, if I were to just do that, it's going to delete the front of the stream clip.

86
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.470
So if I undo that and I drag and I hold command and drop, it scoots over the green clips and everything

87
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.970
behind it instead of deleting it.

88
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:42.180
So what we now have is a string of all the potential shots that we are going to use.

89
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.150
Once you have all your potential shots and you're going to use all your Selex have been pulled.

90
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:56.910
We then go to the sequence that we created these selects in, duplicate that sequence and update the

91
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.540
name of it.

92
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.450
Hyp edit back up.

93
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.690
Let's just say I bet it selects backup.

94
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.120
Put it in the sequences folder.

95
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:17.590
And now we can very easily pick and choose the best shots with the best camera movement and best performance

96
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.760
from our character.
