1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.450
So our edit is looking great.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.680
It's sounding great, we've got all of our musical tracks in here, I believe we have six, which is

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.400
perfect.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.660
And now I wanted to go to part of the edit where now that we have our audio sounding really good.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.680
There's a few moments in here that can really be brought up in value with experimenting with a little

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.950
bit of adding assets on top of your footage.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.830
So at this point in the edit, I'm talking about these three inspirations that I gathered.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.770
And we're going to take a listen and then we're going to see what we can add to make this better for

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.340
the viewer.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.380
And we want to gather inspiration.

11
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.250
So I went through a full three creative spaces that I really like.

12
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.540
I got this lifesaver guy.

13
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.070
We have this creator has a really nice, minimal, modern, clean space, but it's a little bit cold.

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.060
And then we got this Belizeans, Armondo, really cool space.

15
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.290
Very OK.

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.450
So I'm talking about what's in the background.

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.790
Now, this comes to mind is like I want to have some arrows pointing at.

18
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.560
I call this guy light saber guy.

19
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.370
I want to have some arrows pointing at this guy's litterers.

20
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.840
And then I'm talking about her background.

21
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.370
And I want to like circle that and I want to, you know, have like an arrow or a circle on that.

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.610
Then we have this guy, Armondo.

23
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.880
Right.

24
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.040
I want to have some arrows, some square or something.

25
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.460
Something.

26
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.880
So what I do have is this pack of animated shapes that I bought.

27
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.040
So I'm going to scroll through here and find, OK, I like this one, actually.

28
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.980
So you can do this with anything.

29
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.010
Don't worry if you don't have this exact pack of shapes, but you can do this with tags.

30
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.380
You can do this with digital downloads.

31
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.010
You can do this with anything that is an animated layer.

32
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.100
That's really the purpose of this learning lesson, is learning when and how to use these.

33
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.040
So because I'm sharing something where I want the viewer to look somewhere, specifically, I'm going

34
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.410
to have these assets that further tell the story that I'm saying here.

35
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.860
So I'm just going to adjust this.

36
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.500
So it kind of feels right.

37
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.830
So I rotate that a little bit more, move it up, maybe scale it up just a little bit.

38
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.810
That's too much right there.

39
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.090
OK.

40
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.520
You got this lightsaber guy?

41
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.210
We have.

42
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.230
OK, perfect.

43
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.470
So this animation is only this long.

44
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.030
Now I can duplicate it.

45
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.920
But for this scenario, it's going to slow down to 80 percent.

46
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.980
Now I'm going to duplicate it and drag it up.

47
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.580
OK.

48
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.930
And what I'm going to do is because I want one over at the white saber, so I'm going to go in here

49
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.970
and I'm going to type in mirror.

50
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.020
No, no, no.

51
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.540
Flip.

52
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.300
Yeah, flip.

53
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.990
OK, so we can either flip something horizontally or vertically, vertically.

54
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.840
It's going to boom.

55
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.690
Flip it down horizontally.

56
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.120
It's going to flip it horizontally.

57
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.580
So now all I have to do is kind of rotate it a little bit, get it in place.

58
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.390
And let's see that I really like you got this lightsaber guy.

59
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.870
We have this creator.

60
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.870
If we want these to have a little bit of a different animation so that they're not perfectly mirrored

61
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.110
and in sync with each other, we can stagger it a little bit so that now this light saber game, you

62
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.190
can see that one kind of comes up first so that they don't really look like duplicates of each other.

63
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.510
It's a little bit of a trick to throw people off.

64
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.630
OK, so now they look like different animations.

65
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.570
And now for this part, I want to highlight this and I want to highlight this.

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:52.690
So I think we can kind of use another one of these arrows, but to get away with it.

67
00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:02.290
What I want to do is change the scale so that it definitely looks like a different arrow.

68
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.760
We don't want to make it look like we're using the same things all the time.

69
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.420
So actually, what I'm going to do here is kind of rotate it and then flip it.

70
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.519
So now you can see the arch is the arches like that.

71
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.070
And then now the arch is going to be the other way.

72
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.700
So here we go.

73
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.140
And we have this creative cool.

74
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.280
So that looks like a different asset.

75
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.290
So we're kind of replicating things and duplicating it, but not making it look cheap.

76
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.820
So now let's go and find a cool circle.

77
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.560
OK, I like that sounds cool.

78
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.570
Now, I also wanted to add that these already have the background removed.

79
00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.120
If you had a asset like this and the background wasn't removed, you can go to track mat and it hits

80
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.630
green and that's going to remove the background.

81
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:12.180
So on a scale this down and we put it on this light and I'm going to slow it down to kind of slow down

82
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.180
the animation we have.

83
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.800
This creator is really nice, minimal, just kind of scaling things up a bit here.

84
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.020
And as you can see, we have a problem.

85
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.450
This cuts out and then this cuts out.

86
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.580
And that's the entire length of the clip.

87
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.890
So the easy way around that is to go with the animation starts.

88
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.080
I'm going to cut and then I'm going to alt and drag to duplicate, select both all and drag to duplicate

89
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.190
and actually end it there, because that's the end of this clip.

90
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.650
And I'm going to do the same for the arrow.

91
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.810
But we don't want to grab the whole arrow, because if we duplicate it from here, it's going to keep

92
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.640
starting and not starting.

93
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.030
Right.

94
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.180
So what I want to do is grab it from there.

95
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.650
So Alz drags like both all drag, select all four.

96
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.440
Actually, I don't even need to just do two more.

97
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.030
And boom.

98
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.020
Now let's see it.

99
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.580
You got this lifesaver guy.

100
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.070
We have this creator has a really nice, minimal, modern, clean space, but it's a little bit cold.

101
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.980
And then we got this guy, Belizeans, Armondo.

102
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.970
Okay, cool.

103
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.980
Now it's kind of switch things up and see if we can get a different shape.

104
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.090
And then we got this guy, who is Armondo, I believe his name's Armondo.

105
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.810
That's great.

106
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.180
OK.

107
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.230
Really cool space, very unique.

108
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.180
I'm just going to duplicate one more of these assets.

109
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.030
Kind of rotated around and scale this one up.

110
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.720
And I'm going to start duplicates there.

111
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.910
Click it all, click drag.

112
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:16.710
LA now faces that I really like, they got this lightsaber guy.

113
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.100
We have this creator has a really nice, minimal, modern, clean space.

114
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.200
It's a little bit cold.

115
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.080
And then we got this guy, Belizeans, Armondo, really cool space, very unique background, excellent

116
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.620
lighting.

117
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.240
So those were the three that I wanted to use and remakes into my own space.

118
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.160
Next up is our breed.

119
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:35.650
Cool.

120
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.590
I'm loving that.

121
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:44.670
So I know that there's another moment here where I'm like in the brainstorm phase and I'm imagining

122
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.070
what's going to go on the walls here, which we show later in the edit, which are these.

123
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:57.750
So I want to add like a cool animation and then a rectangle animation at this part.

124
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.470
So let's see if we can reuse.

125
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.310
Some of the stuff in here.

126
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.250
So I'm going to take that square.

127
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.400
And take this circle.

128
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:24.170
But this here now, what I do put on the wall is more of a rectangle than a square.

129
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:32.150
So something that we can do when we're adding in animations or assets or really any kind of shapes to

130
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.659
our edit.

131
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.140
You see this tab, the uniform scale tab.

132
00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:46.320
That means when I scale this up or down, then it's scaling up and down the image equally horizontally

133
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.310
and vertically.

134
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.150
The width in the house is getting scaled proportionately.

135
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.540
If I were to take off that uniform scale.

136
00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:02.010
Now what I can do is scale the width and the heighth, which is pretty darn cool.

137
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.450
Independently.

138
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.680
So, because we want to change our square to more of a rectangle.

139
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.570
Let's set this to 18.

140
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.300
But I unclipped uniform scale.

141
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.070
And now let's kind of scale this up so we're more rectangular.

142
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.590
And because this wall ekho, it's at an angle.

143
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:34.260
What we can kind of do is just rotate slightly to get a little bit of a fake perspective style so that

144
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.280
it kind of almost looks like it's actually on the wall.

145
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.530
We gather some line with it.

146
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.220
OK.

147
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.680
Not bad, but I want to scale it up a little bit.

148
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.660
So I'm going to add two points to each vertical in the horizontal.

149
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.440
And now let's get our circle in the right place.

150
00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:00.720
This one, we don't have to change the uniform scale because we actually want the circle to stay as

151
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.200
it is.

152
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.190
A long line.

153
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.730
What people are doing if you're doing what they're not doing.

154
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.860
OK, so I'm just getting the endpoints that I want both of these animations to come into, and then

155
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:20.800
we're going to duplicate them so that they extend this variation in regathered so long to see what people

156
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.390
are doing, what they're not doing.

157
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:23.920
OK, perfect.

158
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.430
Now let's duplicate our animations.

159
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.450
In the inspiration that we gathered from online.

160
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.670
What people are doing, what they're not doing, and we're going to mix that with the space that we

161
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.360
chose.

162
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.220
So I'm doing a test shot here.

163
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:47.820
Cool.

164
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.780
So that looks pretty good.

165
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:55.290
So that's just a quick way that you can add assets on top of your footage to further tell your story,

166
00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.180
to spice up the way your footage looks and to make your video a little bit more interesting.
