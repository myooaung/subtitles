1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,500
And just like that, we made it to the end of our YouTube video edit.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:14,450
So in this learning lesson, I simply just kind of want to sit back and view the work that we put together

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,390
together.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,000
So this is not going to be really me doing any kind of lecturing or talking too much.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,070
I'm going to sit back and watch this with you.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,070
We're going to hit play and we're going to see the edit.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,870
And I also cued up the actual timeline.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,630
So we'll be able to see what's happening in the final edit on the screen, on the top, and then we'll

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,590
see how that edit was done in the timeline below.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,490
So without further ado, let's check out the YouTube video that we created together.

11
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,540
Man, I know this doesn't look like much.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,250
I know it doesn't sound like much, but I'm going to show you how I went from taking this studio space

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,050
like this and made it look like this.

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,680
Yep, I got a lot of work to do.

15
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,170
So let's get right into it.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,500
First, if you want to do, is choose your filming space.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,550
I'm choosing this extra room at my house because I can renovate it.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,060
I can move things around.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,640
It's a clean slate to work with.

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,630
I mean, look at it.

21
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,040
It's a pretty dang clean slate.

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,080
Empty walls, empty floor, empty ceiling, everything super echoing here.

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,520
But we're going to fix that in the later steps.

24
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,560
So when you're going and you're choosing your filming space, make sure it's somewhere at your house

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,510
that's not going to get a lot of extra noise from outside and that you're going to be able to move things

26
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,450
around and really make it unique to you.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,620
Then we want to gather inspiration.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,490
So I went through I pulled three creative spaces that I really liked.

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,840
We got this light saber guy.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,850
We have this creator that has a really nice, minimal, modern, clean space, but it's a little bit

31
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,330
cold.

32
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,160
And then we got this guy, I believe his name is Armando.

33
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,720
Really cool space, very unique background, excellent lighting.

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,340
So those were the three that I wanted to use and remix into my own space.

35
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,660
Next up is our brainstorming in concept creation phase.

36
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,560
This is where we're taking the inspiration that we gathered from online.

37
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,990
What people are doing, what they're not doing.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,500
And we're going to mix that with the space that we chose.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,330
So I'm doing a test out here.

40
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,080
I got my camera out with rough framing of what I want the shot to look like.

41
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,190
And I'm getting some work done, moving the hands around, you know, busy day here.

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,790
But the goal of this is to see if the ideas that we came up with are going to work in our space.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,370
Next up, we create our purchase list and we really want to max out our credit cards here, because

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,340
that's going to give us more motivation to really take our video, creativity and career a lot more

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,970
seriously.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,360
Why?

47
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,670
Because there is no choice.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,940
We got to pay off our debt.

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,320
No.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,420
And all serious here.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,480
What we want to do is create a purchase list of all the items we're going to need for our space.

52
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,690
I found that the best way to do this is to create two columns.

53
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,320
One column has all of your equipment list purchases, and then one column has all of your aesthetic

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,360
list purchases of what's going to go in your space to really give it more style and more character.

55
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,540
And that leads us to the Christmas phase.

56
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,370
This is going to be where you're at your peak of overwhelmed during this process, because you're going

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,630
to end up with a bunch of packages at your house when you don't even really remember what you ordered,

58
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,160
but there's just a bunch of boxes.

59
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,230
So I use this overwhelm to create a cool little montage with a really pointy object.

60
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,160
And after putting any band aids on for minor cuts and scratches from that last montage, now it is time

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,830
for our initial test shots and set up phase.

62
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,840
So what you want to do is grab your most important equipment.

63
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,450
Mine's going to be my key light, my main lighting source, my camera, my desk in my chair.

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,070
And I'm going to kind of move things around in my studio to find out what's going to be the best location

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,220
in the backdrop so you can continue to move things around, wave your hands around, do a little bit

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,940
of a dance.

67
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,990
And after all that testing, just move things back to where you figure they were going to be in the

68
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,680
first place.

69
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,730
But now that we've done that, we have our set up ready to go.

70
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,010
And all we have to worry about in the future is sitting down and hitting record because we know we're

71
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,740
maximizing our space because we did these test shots.

72
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,600
And now that we've done that, it's time to second guess all the decisions we made up to this point.

73
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,100
But we don't have a whole lot of time for that, because now it is our building process.

74
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,220
This is where we get to lift things, marks and things drill's some things use a cool laser thing.

75
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,640
And ideally, by the end of this process, we've hung these things on the wall and they are staying

76
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,770
on the wall and voila, there we go.

77
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,050
Now we have our shelves in the background, and I'm going to put some lights on in the background to

78
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,780
see how things are starting to come together.

79
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,610
Which leads us to our painting and styling phase.

80
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,930
This is where we get to use a green tape thing to tape up all the bits of the wall that we don't want

81
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,770
to get paint on.

82
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,170
And now that my room has got a cool kind of Tron vibe, it's time to start the painting process.

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,340
I went with a matte black because it matches the professional and minimal feeling that I'm going for.

84
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,770
And I know with this stuff that I'm going to have on the shelves and the warm lighting that I'm going

85
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:45,180
to have, it's going to really want the space and balance out the kind of cold minimalist that just

86
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,810
a plain black wall has.

87
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,760
But I really feel like these two styling choices are really going to balance out the perfect amount

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,310
of minimal with warm and inviting.

89
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,410
And once you finish painting, you want to pull off your green tape things and put things back on your

90
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,690
wall that you had to take off for the painting process.

91
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,310
So I put my shelving back on.

92
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm hanging some new curtains that are blackout curtains.

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,170
And then we want to put things in the background that match up with our personality, the theme of our

94
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,780
videos and the overall style we want to go for.

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,570
So I'm adding these cool lights to match it with my personality and of course, some vintage cameras

96
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:25,510
and some lenses in the background that also match up with the theme and direction of all my video content.

97
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,930
And now that our room is looking pretty -- good, it's time to upgrade it for better sound dynamics.

98
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,810
So I'm going to start with taking off this big ceiling fan.

99
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,110
And, yep, you can see I'm doing a bang up job there.

100
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:45,430
And now what I'm going to do is add sound paneling to the main walls that's going to be reflecting the

101
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,080
most amount of noise.

102
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,120
So to get that done, I'm going to tape off all the important things in my room so I know where they

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,570
go.

104
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,040
Move them out of the way.

105
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,490
Get out my sound panels that we ordered back in the Christmas phase.

106
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,950
Contemplate how the heck I'm going to get this done.

107
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,270
And just start slapping some super glue on some cardboard panels and see what happens.

108
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,320
Okay, cool.

109
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,370
That actually worked pretty well.

110
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,790
Now I'm going to measure the walls, find the center, start nailing things in.

111
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,440
But yeah, these nails bend.

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,850
So I'm going to get some different nails.

113
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,900
And voila, these nails are keeping my sound panels on to the wall, which is really ideal.

114
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,740
And I got super McGyver with these magnets because a part of my wall had this big metal door on it.

115
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,540
And we did a great job.

116
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,040
These are a thing of beauty.

117
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,440
So now it is time to get your audio and microphone dialed in.

118
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,460
So the main thing is to get whatever microphone you're using as close to you as possible while you're

119
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,060
speaking.

120
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,450
Once you've gotten that situated, then we want to move to our settings.

121
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,430
Now, you always, always want to have your recorder set to manual.

122
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,690
And of course, set your recording format to the highest quality possible.

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,160
I use WAV files because it doesn't compress your audio at all.

124
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,160
And you want to have your audio levels peaking somewhere between negative 12 and negative six.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,400
And a good protip is to speak louder than you would normally would on your recording and speak quieter

126
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,930
than you normally would when you're setting your levels that way, you have a good range of what the

127
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,580
levels are going to be like, so you don't mess up your recording and you get the cleanest audio possible.

128
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,500
We're doing a pretty darn good job here.

129
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,380
And now it is time to dial in our lighting, our camera settings and our framing.

130
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,340
So we're going to start with cutting out our ambient light that way.

131
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,960
Our main lighting source, which is our key light, is going to start really illuminating our scene.

132
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,610
That is what it looks like with the key light, without any practicals on in the background.

133
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,049
And boom, those practical lights in the background really warm up the space.

134
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,810
And to get that more cinematic kind of dramatic lighting, you want to have your key light at least

135
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,140
45 degrees off to one side of your camera.

136
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,750
This is going to create a good amount of shadow.

137
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,190
On the side of your face, opposite of the light, the more shadows, the more dramatic your lighting

138
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,760
and the less shadows, the more of a beauty blogger type of vibe.

139
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,170
Your video is going to have.

140
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:10,040
Next, we want to set our picture profile into our camera to a log profile or a neutral profile.

141
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,140
That way, all of our contrast, saturation, sharpness is all the way down, and we can turn it up

142
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,120
selectively in post-production.

143
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,700
Then we want to set our white balance to the same exact color temperature as our key light and set your

144
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,270
frame rate to 24 frames per second and have your shutter speed double that at a fiftieth of a second.

145
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,610
And as a little added bonus, we can add a splash of color in the background.

146
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,020
This is going to create a little bit more character and a little bit more personality for our footage.

147
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,970
And so to recap, here's how this space looks without any lighting added.

148
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,770
Here's how it looks with the practicals in the background.

149
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,970
Again, that add that character and personality and really warm up the space and boom, this is how

150
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,990
it looks at our key light.

151
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,940
And with a little bit of background light, that's going to help separate me, the subject from the

152
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,580
background.

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
It's looking really good.

154
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,160
But lastly, I wanted to talk about focal length.

155
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,900
So here's our shot at.

156
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,010
Twenty eight millimeters.

157
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,930
I really feel that this is the best for YouTube, Instagram, any kind of online content.

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,470
And here's what it looks like at 24 millimeters, it's OK.

159
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,020
I always feel like it's a little bit too wide.

160
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,500
The shallower you go with the focal length, the more professional it's going to look.

161
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,770
And here's how it looks at 35 millimeters more depth.

162
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,030
The field more narrow of a frame, but a little bit more of a documentary feel.

163
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,890
And boom, here's how it looks at 50 mil.

164
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:38,450
This is a great focal length for documentaries and short films, but we really lose the feeling of the

165
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,670
background and it doesn't feel as much that we're sitting with the person on camera.

166
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,270
And that is why I always go with 28 millimeters for this kind of videos, because it's the perfect balance

167
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,430
of a professional look while still having a wide enough perspective of the other things that's going

168
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,570
on inside the frame.

169
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,170
And as a little bit of a bonus, final touch, I added some PVC pipes to hide the cables.

170
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,760
Get that off here.

171
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,870
Oh, yeah, OK, OK.

172
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,600
And I added some artwork on the walls, replaced my more bulky professional tripod with a much slimmer

173
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,180
small footprint tripod, hid all of these extra cables.

174
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,980
God knows we needed to do that and added these super cool led strips.

175
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,100
That allows for me to change the feeling and the vibe of the room at one click of a button.

176
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,650
So there you have it.

177
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,990
All of our hard work has paid off.

178
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,150
This is what we started with.

179
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,550
And let's see that beautiful before and after shot.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Wow.

181
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,130
Whoo!

182
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,840
Baby!

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,770
That is a work of art right there.

184
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,490
I completely love how this space came together.

185
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,040
All the little details were perfect.

186
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,490
I really enjoy working here.

187
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,120
I really enjoy editing in here.

188
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,790
And I really enjoy just chillin in this space.

189
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:08,000
So I hope this video really gave you some insights and inspired you to go out and create your own space

190
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,310
that's uniquely yours.

191
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,010
If you like this video, be sure to check out the rest of my content where I share my other tips and

192
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,660
techniques on how to become a better video creator.

193
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,970
And I will see you in the next video.

194
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:34,000
Food, yes, so I hope that gives you a cool insight into how when you're the viewer watching the final

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,200
edit, it's like one continuous stream of imagery.

196
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:44,500
But when you actually see the timeline right along with what's actually going on, you see how many

197
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:52,150
cuts in microseconds and little moments and things were created in the post-production process to create

198
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:57,730
that steady stream of content that every video has or every good video has.

199
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:05,530
So it's been a long journey just for this chapter of this course, but that wraps it up for the YouTube

200
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,420
video chapter.

201
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:14,830
And I will see you in the next chapter where we're going to dive into even more intermediate to now

202
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,070
expert level editing techniques and topics.

203
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,160
I will see you in the next chapter.
