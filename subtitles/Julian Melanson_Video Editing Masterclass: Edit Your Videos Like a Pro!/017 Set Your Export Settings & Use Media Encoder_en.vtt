1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:08.550
We just finished the Selex phase, the rough edit phase, and the second edit refining, color correcting

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.930
stabilization phase of this learning lesson.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.600
Now it is time to export our content for the proper media platform.

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.450
So I'm going to select my timeline here.

5
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.640
I'm going to hit command AM or I can go up to file export media.

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.390
I'm going to make sure H2 six four is selected.

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.700
And I'm going to go to the presets here.

8
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.290
Now, let's say I want to go to YouTube now.

9
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.940
Mine was shot in four K.

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.140
So I'm going to choose this YouTube for K function.

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.870
And of course, I did mention in a previous edit a little bit of a hack is even if your footage is 10

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.380
ATP and you're going to upload it online to YouTube or Facebook or Vimeo, and you want it to have just

13
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.320
a little bit better settings, you can add the preset at four K, even if it's not a four K.

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.490
This is going to compress your footage less outside of the export during the exporting process from

15
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.450
your editing software.

16
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.610
And it's going to compress your footage less as well during the upload process.

17
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.020
When YouTube and these online platforms do, they're crunching, compressing and optimizing process

18
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.420
on anything that you upload to their sites.

19
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.050
So we're going to select four K now.

20
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.990
You can see there's these black bars at the top of the page.

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.750
That is not what we want for the specific video.

22
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.420
So I'm going to click match source.

23
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.010
That's going to change the aspect ratio to properly fit our sequence.

24
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.330
Then I'm going to go to audio and I want to make sure our bit rate is set to 320.

25
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.160
Everything else is set to high.

26
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.420
And then I'm going to go to render my click render at maximum depth use, maximum render quality.

27
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.380
And lastly, before we click the output name, for this example, I want to show you a really great

28
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.030
technique on exporting.

29
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.470
And what that is, is using ACUE versus exporting something directly out of your editing software.

30
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.350
You can add it to an external queue and another software, and this will allow you to export multiple

31
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.810
edits at the same time.

32
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.340
So traditionally, I choose where I want it to go and hit save, and then I'll click export and then

33
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
a window would pop up and then with a loading bar and I wouldn't be able to do anything in my editing

34
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.380
software.

35
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.810
I'd have to wait for the export to finish.

36
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.770
Now, with this extra step, because we're working our way, becoming editing Ninja's, I'm going to

37
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.570
navigate to our proper editing folder that we set up at the very beginning of the project.

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:01.950
I'm going to create a new folder called Exports, and I'm going to title this Vieaux violinist, YouTube

39
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.450
V1.

40
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.560
OK.

41
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.260
And I'm going to hit ADD to queue.

42
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.600
What this is going to do is it's going to take all the data, all the information from our sequence

43
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.580
with the proper export settings.

44
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.070
Add it to Adobe Immediate Encoder.

45
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.370
And it's going to allow for me to continue to operate inside my editing software and make changes.

46
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.020
Now, what I want to do for this example is export again.

47
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.590
And this time I'm going to set my settings for Instagram.

48
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.150
So I'm going to be exporting my YouTube version and my Instagram version at the same exact time.

49
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.860
So it's got a preset.

50
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.920
And I'm going to go to Mobile Device 10 ATP and of course, I'm going to click match source or aspect

51
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.000
ratio is correct.

52
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.260
I'm going to go to audio.

53
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.220
Scroll down.

54
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.250
I'm going to go to bitrate, it's 320.

55
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.960
I want to choose for maximum rendered depth and maximum quality.

56
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:16.180
And then I'm going to go up to the output name and I'm a type in violinist, Vieaux, violinist instr

57
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.680
Instagram.

58
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.830
Version one, I'm going to hit save and then I'm going to add it to the queue.

59
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.890
Now we have our two exports ready to go, and all we have to do is hit the start queue button.

60
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.960
So I'm going to start the queue right now.

61
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.880
Boom in the bottom.

62
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.500
You have a little heads up panel that's showing where it is in the export.

63
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.890
And while that's happening, we can continue to make changes or we can continue to edit a different

64
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.150
project entirely.

65
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.490
So while this is exporting, I just kind of wanted to talk about something.

66
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.740
You know, everything is so much of it is about patience, you know.

67
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.930
Right now it's like, OK, I got to wait for this export and then you're editing is OK.

68
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.590
I got to wait for my clip to render.

69
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.020
And you're like, OK, well, I got to find the right shot.

70
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:18.330
And a lot of it is a time consuming, kind of slow trial and error process of maybe this is maybe this

71
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.780
will work.

72
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.240
Maybe this is the clip and.

73
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:35.320
It takes a very, I know, flexible mindset and some level of patience and acceptance to really become

74
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.680
a good editor that doesn't really just know how to do the techniques, but to create something different

75
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.900
and special and something that's uniquely you to your creative style and to find your own aesthetic

76
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.170
and find your look that people see that and they say, wow, OK, there's something interesting about

77
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:03.220
this video that takes a lot of patience and time and sitting in front of the computer and freaking,

78
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.940
wanting to like throw the laptop out of the window.

79
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.400
Sometimes, you know, like when you're editing a software crashes after you've been doing 20 minutes

80
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.040
of work and haven't hit the save button and having to restart and I mean, going through the years and

81
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.120
years of doing that.

82
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:28.310
And then at the end of the day, I always have such a big payoff and such a big reward in my chest.

83
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:36.160
And this feeling of proudness and satisfaction and excitement about when I do have the final product

84
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:44.440
that took so many hours of patience and working 30 minutes on a five second sequence or three hours

85
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.920
or three days on a five or 10 second sequence.

86
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:56.240
So have patience, you know, be OK with being slowed down.

87
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.590
I want to say buy the technology, because sometimes our brain is working and we know what we want to

88
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.010
do.

89
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.600
But to translate that out of the brain, into the body, into the keyboard, through the computer,

90
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:14.230
get the right shot in the right place with the right effect and sound and filter and timing takes a

91
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.020
lot faster than, oh, I know what I want to do.

92
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:24.190
And that takes a lot of practice allowing that process to happen and not getting too frustrated with

93
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.560
the technology that's kind of standing in the way that you're trying to work with.

94
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:36.250
So just something to think about as we continue to move forward and progress as video editing ninjas

95
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.390
in this chorus.

96
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.140
All right, and now we have our final exports, we have our YouTube version, this is ready to upload

97
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.950
online.

98
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.650
It's Farez at four K and then we have our Instagram version.

99
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.940
That's a smaller size.

100
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.810
And that wraps things up for this learning lesson.
