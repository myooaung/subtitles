1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.070
So let's go ahead and play ahead, and then when we get to here, we're going to want to make an addition.

2
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.600
OK.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.840
So

4
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
if I want to add, it's just it feels like there's something missing in the shot.

5
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.370
And let's say I don't want to do a cutaway, but let's say I just want to add a little bit of maybe

6
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.980
a cool jumping forward.

7
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.940
I'm going to make a cut.

8
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.990
I'm going to use a slip tool and I'm going to slip forward ahead.

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.950
In this clip.

10
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.640
Now, let's see.

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.690
OK, cool.

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.290
So see how he skips around in the frame boom right there before we just kind of dance without.

13
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.880
And we just accentuate.

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:06.230
The movement now, if we wanted to take it a step further, we could even go and add a flip filter to

15
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.420
flip the orientation, and it's going to make this jumpcut even more dramatic.

16
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.660
Now, I'm not going to do that for this one, because that's a specific look, it's a little too much.

17
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.050
You want to be subtle.

18
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.850
You want to make it look cooler, but you don't want to make it look cheesy.

19
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.530
That's a little bit cheesy for my taste for this specific one, but it's an option.

20
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.720
So let's go to the next blue part, which is right here.

21
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.600
OK, so to kind of mix things up, I want to add a cool kind of, you know, a fast molik right here.

22
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.940
So let's go ahead and turn that clip off.

23
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.090
Let's go to our trusty bureau and let's find a cool kind of moment.

24
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.710
Let's see this.

25
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.930
Let's let's grab this.

26
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.759
Let's go to our sequence.

27
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.870
I'm going to lock the bottom and I'm going to paste this on.

28
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.730
And let's see.

29
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.500
OK, it's not fast enough, it doesn't have enough energy in its current state.

30
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.290
I really want to give it a wimpiness.

31
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.960
So I really wanted to add to the overall energy of the edit.

32
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.760
So let's speed it up five hundred percent and let's cut it down so that it's matching the amount of

33
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.560
time that we want it to take up.

34
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.280
And let's see.

35
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.840
Oh, a lot better.

36
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.180
So that's looking better.

37
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.440
So it kind of goes in, throws down, throws the viewer down into the next shot.

38
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.270
So for comparison, let's see it without.

39
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.630
Of course, so not much going on, and then if we put it back.

40
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.720
Cool, just a little accent, so I'm liking that.

41
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.380
Let's go to our next blue areas.

42
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.660
Looks like these two that I marked off that should be updated.

43
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.590
OK.

44
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.750
So, yeah, let's start with this one.

45
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.520
So I want to cool another kind of cool throwing movement because this is a huge striking point in the

46
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.150
song.

47
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.190
So let's go to our unusable beer.

48
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.810
All right.

49
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.240
And let's see.

50
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.640
Let's see how that works.

51
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.410
So I'm going to grab this.

52
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.010
Let me put it here.

53
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.060
Lock the footage and I'm going to speed up because I know we're going to need to have a high energy

54
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.900
amount of movement.

55
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.930
So, OK, I'm liking that.

56
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.090
Let me actually go 700 percent and let's make it shorter.

57
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.150
OK, so actually what I want to do is rather than shortening it, I'm going to school it because there's

58
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.950
a little bit of extra space here.

59
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.950
So I want this cool fast clip to start sooner.

60
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.020
Let's see that.

61
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.920
Yeah, there we go.

62
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.410
So without.

63
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.610
OK, and then with.

64
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.230
Nice.

65
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.540
You know, and when you have these moments where the viewer doesn't really have time to pick up on what

66
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.370
is going on because it's happening so quickly, it naturally just kind of gives you this, whoa, what

67
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.900
the heck?

68
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.970
Kind of excited pie, good confusion where it's confusing in a good way.

69
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.460
Something to keep in mind.

70
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.590
So let's see one more.

71
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.260
Where I am right there.

72
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.280
Let's see one more.

73
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.390
What are we not used?

74
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.950
Let's go ahead and use this clip.

75
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.910
OK, so when you grab that and paste it and shorted down.

76
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.830
OK, and then just going to fine tune it a little bit.

77
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.040
Yeah, there we go.

78
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:20.920
OK, cool, so we went through and we updated and added in our B roll to create a much more stylized

79
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.740
and a much more unique video overall.
