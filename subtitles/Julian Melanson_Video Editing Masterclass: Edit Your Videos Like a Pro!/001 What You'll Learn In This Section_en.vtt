00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.830
Now, I really want to hop in to the main part of this course, and I don't know, I'm really excited

2
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.800
to start actually editing together with you.

3
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:27.980
So for this first main learning lesson, what we're going to be doing is focusing on the first aspect

4
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.400
of editing, which is creating your rough edit.

5
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.670
Now, we're going to start by doing something that's really easy for all skill levels.

6
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.250
We're going to start simple and then we're going to build our way throughout this course from concepts

7
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.860
and techniques that are easy to more advance.

8
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.180
So from beginner to intermediate to advanced.

9
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.080
So depending on your skill level and what you want from this course, you can follow along to this less

10
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.510
complex section or you can skip ahead as you wish.

11
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.850
Whatever's best for you.

12
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.820
But I'd highly recommend going through this course front to back, because that's really how it's designed.

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.670
And so to get into this section, you're going to follow along with me and you're going to edit footage

14
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.380
from your phone.

15
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.670
So you're going to choose a recent trip, a recent memory, a recent anything that really sparked your

16
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.220
interest maybe has been sitting on your phone.

17
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.090
We all have smartphones these days with pretty decent cameras.

18
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.440
So I really thought this would be perfect exercise to kind of get the ball rolling.

19
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.610
But it can really be anything that you have that has at least five to ten shots that you can work with.

20
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.120
Secondly, we're going to transfer the footage from the device and we're going to edit side by side

21
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.480
together.

22
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.010
So we'll be diving into editing workflow, creating backups to keep all your projects safe.

23
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.770
The project files and self editing your main sequence, pulling your selects and then refining your

24
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.280
edit.

25
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.960
And after this section, you can export and share your video.

26
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.540
You or whether that's a YouTube URL, Vimeo URL, Dropbox, Google Drive, whatever it is.

27
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.130
You can post it on the assignment at the end of this section.
