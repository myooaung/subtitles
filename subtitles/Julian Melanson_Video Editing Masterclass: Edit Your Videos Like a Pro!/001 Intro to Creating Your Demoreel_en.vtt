00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.970
So here we are.

2
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:23.210
We made it to the final editing project of this entire journey in course, and just experience that

3
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.170
we've been on together.

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.720
So in this chapter, what we're going to do is actually hold on, I have some slides for this.

5
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.020
Now that you're editing me editing.

6
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.970
Yeah, let's do this.

7
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.720
We're going to get started here with something really fun.

8
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.600
We're going to take all of the beginner, intermediate and advanced techniques that we learned together.

9
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.420
And we're going to use that.

10
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.080
Is this a typo?

11
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.740
Advanced techniques and creating a demo reel?

12
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.300
Oh, I don't know if that's Tibo or not, but we're going to take everything that we've learned, advanced,

13
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.060
you know, medium hard, all this stuff, expert.

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.610
And we're going to create a demo reel.

15
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:13.010
Now, a demo reel and show reel are two interchangeable terms that are basically a compilation or a

16
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.470
montage of all of your best videos, all of your best shots.

17
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.900
If you're an actor and actress, a demo reel or a show reel is all of your best acting edited into one

18
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.380
video.

19
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.230
So if you have three hundred hours of videos, you edit that all into one three minute or one one minute

20
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.710
video.

21
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.210
If you're an editor, it's all your best editing.

22
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.500
If you're a cinematographer, it's all your favorite cinematic shots in one video.

23
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:50.420
So you can use this as almost like a digital resume for whatever skill set or whatever area of work

24
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.910
or type of job that you have.

25
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.190
You can use a demo reel to.

26
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.540
Yeah, showcase the best of what you have to offer.

27
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.750
So it's an amazing tool to use to get clients to get work, to get higher paying budgets and a lot of

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.820
great tools, a lot of great aspects that you can use it for.

29
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.650
So you're going to follow along with me on this final lesson, and we're going to create your demo.

30
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.770
Now, what I want you to do is gather the final exports of your favorite videos that you have.

31
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.790
It can be a culmination of whatever line of work that you work in, or it could be, you know, all

32
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.010
of the edits that we've created together.

33
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.230
You can now edit those new edits that you created into this Magu.

34
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.290
Amazing, super, ultra awesome.

35
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.190
Demario edit.

36
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.890
Now, I want you to gather all that footage together, and then I want you to bring it into your editing

37
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.790
software where we're going to pull the selects on that content.

38
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.040
We're going to choose the proper music.

39
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.490
We're going to create our rough edit and we're going to refine it and add some awesome final touches.

40
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.560
Then at the end of the chapter, you can export and share your video URL that you uploaded online in

41
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.080
the student Q&A for feedback for me and your fellow students.

42
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.830
So now this is the home stretch.

43
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.650
This is I wanted to put this at the end because I felt like it was going to be a really cool way to

44
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.290
just put in all the work that we made together.

45
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.670
And for you to walk away with now a demo reel that's basically.

46
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.220
Yeah, a compilation of all the amazing tips and tricks and tools that you've learned in this course.

47
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.940
Now, you can walk away with this amazing thing, which is a lot better than a certificate.

48
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.670
It's an actual piece of art and work that you've created.

49
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.110
So in the next video lessons, we're going to hop into the step by step on creating your demo real.

50
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.730
So gather your footage and I will see you in the next video lesson.
