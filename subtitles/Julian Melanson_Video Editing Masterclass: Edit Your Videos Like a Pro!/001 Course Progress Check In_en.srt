00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,910
Welcome to this brand new chapter.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,970
And at this point in the course, we've done a lot together, we've done LouisI here, we've done our

3
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,220
hyp edit, we did our travel edit with our iPhone footage.

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,120
We've done our violinist's live performance video.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,220
We've edited an entire vlog together.

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,460
We've done professional client types of edits.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,500
And we've done personal project edits and we've done showcase video.

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,440
It was a high end real estate walkthrough video.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,510
I think there's a few of the things that he did in there, but it's been a long, long, long journey

10
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,470
together.

11
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:55,730
And now moving forward at this part in the course, now that we've worked together to really build up

12
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:03,080
our skills, working on the very, very beginning all the way to the end of each and every edit.

13
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:14,330
Now, what I want to do is zoom out a little bit and start to focus on more advanced and pretty complex

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,000
edits.

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:22,370
And these are going to be more case study and break down type lectures where rather than dragging things

16
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,400
in, we're going to look at the timeline together and we're going to look at edit it's edit.

17
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,530
It's edits that I've created for clients.

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,470
And we're going to break down and deconstruct what was going on there, what techniques were used,

19
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,200
why they were being used, and then the effect that they have.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,990
So, yeah, I'm excited about this part because we're going to kind of switch things up a little bit

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:52,650
and we're going to really be able to dive into more complex topics and even cooler editing tricks.

22
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,240
So in these remaining lectures, that's what we got.

23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,540
Oh, that's what we'll be diving into.

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,120
And yeah, I will see you in the very next video lesson.
