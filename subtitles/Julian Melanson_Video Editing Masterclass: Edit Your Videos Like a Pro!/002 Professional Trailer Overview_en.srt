1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,770
OK, so we're going to start this process by deconstructing and diving deeply into the most important

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:16,830
moments of this trailer for a large client of mine that produces online courses, very similar to Masterclass,

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,210
very similar to that kind of content.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:27,710
So they hired me to produce film and edit one of these trailers for their upcoming course.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,630
So we had two camera angles to read Comodo Angles shooting at six each.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,940
And we also had a separate dialogue track connected to our zoom handheld recorder, recording really

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,240
high quality dialogue of the teacher speaking.

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,190
And then we have music bed underneath and a lot of different layers.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,190
So let's hop over to the screen cap and let's see what we're working with.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,320
So we have the edit here.

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,380
As you can see, it's a pretty complex timeline.

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,690
Here are all of our video layers.

13
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,850
Here is our audio track.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,430
Here is our different music.

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,250
And then the shorter ones, these shorter audio files are going to be all of our little sound effects.

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,930
So we're definitely in a dive into that in this chapter.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,420
Now, if you go over here, we also have our project window.

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,050
So we have our talking footage.

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,530
We have our main sequences.

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,120
These are the same exact steps and processes, processes that we went through earlier in the course

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:37,230
of pulling our Selex, of creating backup sequences properly, bringing in possible tracks that we're

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:44,700
going to use for our edit color coding, labeling everything properly, and choosing the best kind of

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,550
music for our track.

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,070
We have our screen captures.

25
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,380
We have all different layers.

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:58,050
And that's why the organization that we focused on so much during this course is so key, because once

27
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,440
you get all these kind of different media assets going in your timeline, in your project, as you start

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,229
to grow and develop as a video editor, you're going to be really happy that you took this course and

29
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,100
we did this together.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,720
So let's do this.

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,970
I'm going to go ahead and queue up this edit and we're going to hit play and watch all the way through.

32
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,930
It's about three minutes, and I'm going to pick out some very important moments that will then zoom

33
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,680
into and discover what was done, why I was done, and how you will be able to do a similar effect for

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,190
your edit.

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,810
So let's watch this edit.

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,290
The question is not how to get better at AP lit.

37
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,070
And the question isn't even how do we go from being high school level readers and writers to college

38
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,210
level readers and writers?

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,120
The question is actually, how can we see stories in a more accurate way?

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,810
Getting better at reading requires seeing the written word differently once you get the hang of that,

41
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,210
the writing comes naturally.

42
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,190
Can study in literature make you better at every subject you'll ever study?

43
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,220
I absolutely believe the answer is yes.

44
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,440
My college students would come up to me on the first day of class and they would say, you know, I'm

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,610
really worried about this class.

46
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm a science person.

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,590
I'm a math person.

48
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm not a literature person.

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,960
And I would say, OK, you're a science person, so you love questions.

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,810
You love identifying evidence to support an argument.

51
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,620
Sounds like you've everything you need.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,490
Literary analysis is analysis.

53
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:45,870
It's about assessing, cataloging all the pieces of a text and finding a question that you're going

54
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,410
to answer your why questions are what's going to lead you to that college level thesis development.

55
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,740
You'll go from understanding the words to understanding the forces, working between the words.

56
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,840
So what makes a poem, a poem?

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,910
If a poem can be in paragraph form and prose can utilize the concrete space on the page.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,220
Then what defines a poem?

59
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,590
You actually get to answer that question.

60
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,640
So oh, captain, my captain by Walt Whitman, I love this poem because I love the sound quality of

61
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:24,820
it.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,770
So pay attention to the moments that are getting stressed.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,860
And we can call this, you know, our poet's ear.

64
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,760
We're trying to build our poet's ear.

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,730
Oh, Captain, my captain are fearful.

66
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,750
Trip is done.

67
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,030
The ship has weathered every rack.

68
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,680
The prize we saw is one.

69
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,630
The port is near the bells.

70
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,140
I hear the people all exulting while falo eyes, the steady Neil, the vessel grim and daring.

71
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,500
So in those first four lines, we're getting a military drumbeat, right?

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,930
Oh, captain, my captain are fearful.

73
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,680
Trip is done.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,760
It's like but a da da da da da da da da da da da da.

75
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,530
And then we have what's called the Volta.

76
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,740
This is where there's the vibe change, right?

77
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,220
But oh, heart, heart, heart with the sound, the difference in the sound and the difference in how

78
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,800
the words literally look on the page.

79
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,070
We are suddenly thrown into urgency, were suddenly thrown into an emergency.

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,370
And that's where the angst of this poem lives.

81
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:36,350
Each one of these quizzes, premium learning lessons and study guides is going to give you the tools

82
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,910
you need to totally transform the way you experience literature.

83
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,910
So if you're ready to get started, you can choose your membership plan and become an annual member

84
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,360
today.

85
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,320
OK, so pretty in depth, there is a lot of lot of things going on there, we had swoosh audio transitions,

86
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,090
we had visual transitions, all those things.

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,750
So now let's just start from the beginning.

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,270
This is going to be like a shotgun mishmash of a bunch of different types of tips.

89
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,880
So, yeah, let's start at the very beginning and let's just start with what we're seeing first.
