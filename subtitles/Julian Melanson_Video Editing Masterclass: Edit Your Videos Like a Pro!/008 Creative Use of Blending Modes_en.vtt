00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.680
Now I want to talk about something that I've been meaning to talk about, but we haven't had a chance

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.580
yet, and that is using track mats and blending modes.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.630
So if we select our clip and we go to our parameters, we have our opacity here and we have our blending

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.190
mode and the blending mode.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.060
How do you explain this?

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.570
So you basically tell the computer, the almighty editing software, how to interpret your footage.

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.250
And the best way to see this is if I go and I drag in a logo, because this is going to make it a lot

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.220
easier to kind of understand how the track that is actually working.

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.300
So actually, what I want to do here with this is logo is a PG.

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.610
So there's no background.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.770
But I actually for this.

12
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.690
Lesson, I wanted to have a background, so I'm going to go create a black video.

13
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.450
Now we have our logo with the black background, no black background and together.

14
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.990
So I'm going to nest these two so that they're one clip.

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.760
And if I go to this blending mode and let's see, I go to screen what this is going to do.

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.250
Is this going to tell you're almighty editing software to only display the lighter parts of the image

17
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.230
and screen and lighten or both?

18
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.540
Very similar in the way that they do the blending mode.

19
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.990
Now, if I were to do darken, it does the opposite.

20
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.340
It removes the white part of the image and it allows for that part of the image to be transparent.

21
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.500
So you can kind of see is kind of cool.

22
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.730
You can get some really cool looks going with that.

23
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.420
Now, multiply is very similar to darken, just the way screen is very similar to Leighton.

24
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.110
Now the screen lighting and darken multiply.

25
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.270
These are going to be your two main ones.

26
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.900
The other ones, they garner, they kind of get a little funky.

27
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.070
The color burn one, I mean, it's like when are you going to use that?

28
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.400
It looks like a 70s, 80s music video, linear burn.

29
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.340
It's kind of, I guess, similar to Darken.

30
00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.580
All of those are really similar, but just the darken one is really the best one, in my opinion.

31
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.980
Then we have the color dodge.

32
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.610
This one's a little hard to tell with this example, but we'll use a more complex example.

33
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.050
But I just want to show the basics first.

34
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.080
So then there's the overlay.

35
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.480
And you can see instead of darken, where it's taking away the white part of the frame or screen, where

36
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.790
it's taking away the dark part of the frame.

37
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.160
Darken is almost ermin overlay.

38
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.690
Excuse me.

39
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.480
Is overlaying and keeping the dark part of the frame.

40
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.270
But what that does is affects the image below it.

41
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.330
So there's slightly different ones.

42
00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:01.450
Soft light is doing that similar one as overlay, but it's affecting the dark parts a little bit less

43
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.370
below the image.

44
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.650
So you can kind of mess around with these other ones.

45
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.140
But like I said, they kind of do funky, weird things.

46
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.280
I haven't ever in a decade of editing found a use for any of these ones down here.

47
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.270
Sometimes overlay is nice.

48
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.530
I used it in a recent music video.

49
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.230
That creates a little bit of a softness to your logo.

50
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.450
But that's kind of another thing.

51
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.390
What I want to do now that you understand the basics.

52
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.790
Now, what I want to do is remove this logo example, and I want to use this blending mode for our actual

53
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.360
clips.

54
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.160
And one cool way to do that that I found over the years is to use the screen blending mode.

55
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.610
Now, just by itself, I just switch the bloody mode.

56
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.590
But you can see it didn't change anything.

57
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.270
The reason is because there's nothing below it.

58
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.140
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag this clip, the intro and outro with this clip just a few

59
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.990
frames before the shot in front of it and a little bit after the shot behind it.

60
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.410
So what that ends up doing is this.

61
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.670
It adds just a little bit of a flash between the frames.

62
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.590
Now I can see by my eye this second one is held for too long.

63
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.930
So I'm going to shorten it and let's look at it again.

64
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.190
So it adds.

65
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.410
So it's adding a little bit of a punchy and a flashiness, there's kind of a cool overlay going on here.

66
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.750
Just for a split second.

67
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.020
And the viewer is not going to really be able to put their finger on what's going on, but it's just

68
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.220
going to feel like a cool moment.

69
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.840
So let's move forward in our edit.

70
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.280
And let's see where else could use a similar aesthetic.

71
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.920
So, yeah, let's use this moment where we created this cut earlier.

72
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.320
Let's move this clip up.

73
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.420
Let's extend the intro of the clip and the outro of the clip, just a few frames.

74
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.870
Let's go to the blending mode and its screen.

75
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.530
Now, I mentioned there's just a slight difference between screen and light.

76
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:43.720
And if we go to light and instead it's going to make it less apparent, I guess I want to say it's going

77
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.580
to overlay less so you can see screen.

78
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.830
You can really see this secondary shot.

79
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.920
When you do lighton, you see more of the original shot.

80
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.800
So I honestly prefer the look of the screen because it adds it brings up the exposure.

81
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.240
And just for when you bring up the exposure just for a few frames, that's kind of what's creating that

82
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.230
poppy snapping.

83
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.610
So let's check it out.

84
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.880
Cool.

85
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.820
So without.

86
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.850
And with.

87
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.690
And like I mentioned, there's also the Darkin and multiply.

88
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.480
So if we put it to Darkin, it's going to retain the dark parts of the frame rather than the opposite

89
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.120
of retaining the light parts of the frame so we can start to get some kind of cool, glitchy moments.

90
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.470
Right.

91
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.380
I really like this one, this one's pretty cool, this second one I'm not a huge fan of.

92
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.720
So let's say we really liked the dark.

93
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:59.600
And look, you know, we can extend this and then let's say we wanted to we were really happy with that

94
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.530
cool kind of vibe.

95
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.750
But for this one, we wanted that flashy look.

96
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.800
We can extend this and make a cut and put this back to screen so that we're getting because this looks

97
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.840
a lot more aesthetically cool as an overlay.

98
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.880
So let's see them both combined.

99
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.950
Yes, OK, cool.

100
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.710
So we get that cool clon kind of effect and then we get this cool kind of extra flash in between frames.

101
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.570
Let's find one more area in the video that can use this technique.

102
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.350
OK, so I love this moment.

103
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:51.000
Let's go ahead and extend this out and let's try the screen blending mode.

104
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.490
OK, cool.

105
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:02.070
So there's just a little extra boom right there and then it cuts and then boom right there and then

106
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.610
it goes.

107
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.130
So you can see the layer behind it.

108
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:05.880
Right.

109
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.660
And then here you can see the layer behind it as well.

110
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.840
So you can get really creative, you can do some really cool things.

111
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.290
You can really use this to spice up the edit.

112
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:24.230
And I'm really happy that I finally found a moment in this course to talk about the blending modes,

113
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.780
because it's something I use in the refining process for a project like this to really be a ninja and

114
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.700
get in there and create those cool moments.
