00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.470
Now I'm going to do a simple, just kind of high hat sweep, sound effect, so let's go ahead and drag

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.140
this in by the boom.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.850
You can find these super easily online, there's tons of packs, you can buy them.

4
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.600
You can download it for free.

5
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.970
It's just any kind of soundtrack that you can find online is going to have hundreds and hundreds of

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.450
sounds.

7
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.420
So that's our sound.

8
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.280
It's just a simple drum sound of what's that called, a symbol, something like that.

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.900
But what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to expand our track and let's duplicate this

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.230
by holding alt and clicking.

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.020
And now I'm going to reverse my direction.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.740
Like this of UPS.

13
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.020
Speed, direction, reverse, boom.

14
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.830
Wait.

15
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.790
Yeah, there we go.

16
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.760
And now let's put this at our transition right about there and let's solo it just to hear what it sounds

17
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.030
like.

18
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.110
Little bit of extra space here between where the sound is and isn't, so I'm just going to scoot over.

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.650
Boom, as you can see.

20
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.780
Now let's take another listen.

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.890
OK, still an extra space.

22
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.540
Boom.

23
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.210
Actually, you know, we can do to to make it really sound like it's different.

24
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.780
I'm going to just slightly slow down the second one, and that's going to drop the pitch down.

25
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.440
OK, maybe we can just do not so much do ninety five instead of 90.

26
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.080
Now, 90 actually sounded better.

27
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.610
And now I'm going to free compose or nest these together to treat him as one clip and we're going to

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.750
add a reverb filter to really just kind of customize this audio layer.

29
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.760
I'm going to add a studio reverb on here.

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.930
I'm going to go up to the effects controls for this clip.

31
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.990
I'm going to go to my favorite preset, which is Great Hall.

32
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.970
I always start with the Great Hall preset.

33
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.000
Turn up the room size, generally turn up the decay.

34
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.340
We talked a lot about this type of filter earlier in the course, turning down the dampening diffusion

35
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.910
so that the effect lasts for longer.

36
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.330
I'm not going to worry too much about turning the dry all the way up.

37
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.610
The dry is just the original sound itself.

38
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.090
The wet is the effect that is added to the sound.

39
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.640
So if I turn the dry all the way down and leave the wet up, you're just going to hear the reverb of

40
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.240
the sound.

41
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.020
OK, so the second piece of audio is too loud, so I'm going to drop that down.

42
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.780
OK, cool.

43
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.350
And I don't think we need that much reaver, we can kind of turn these down a little bit and let's unmuted

44
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.720
this and see how it's sounding.

45
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.350
OK, so that definitely helps.

46
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.450
Now you can see where redlining over here.

47
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.160
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a hard limit or I know we're getting into sound design.

48
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.860
All of a sudden I wasn't planning on this.

49
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.190
We're supposed to be doing video editing, not doing any audio, audio design yet, but here we are.

50
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.540
So I'm going to type in and put a hard limiter on.

51
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.410
You can use any kind of compressor.

52
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.220
You just want something to create a ceiling on top of your audio and bring down its maximum amp, maximum

53
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.150
amplitude.

54
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.620
So it's not going to hit zero and peak or distort.

55
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.460
So we're going to do negative two for this audio track, the sound design below it.

56
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.840
And for our first audio track as well.

57
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.490
So everything is cohesive.

58
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.690
OK.

59
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.620
Perfect.

60
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.950
Now, I'm just going to do an extra point, negative three.

61
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.620
And just bring down a little bit of the second part of this doesn't need to be quite as loud.

62
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.750
We really want the leading in part the beginning part so that we get that show.

63
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.590
We don't really need the rest of it to be as loud.

64
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.970
Perfect.

65
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.670
So if you listen to it without our sweep that we just added.

66
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.570
And with the sweep.

67
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.530
So that kind of swoosh helps to carry us between the transition between these two tracks.
