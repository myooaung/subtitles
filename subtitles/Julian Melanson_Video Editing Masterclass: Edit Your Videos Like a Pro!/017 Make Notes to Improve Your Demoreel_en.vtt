00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.490
So we have our exported video file ready to be viewed.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.050
And like I mentioned, the reason we do this is because you're going to see things differently when

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.330
you watch it in this way.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.820
So what I do when I have feedback or I'm refining one of my edits is I watch it like this and I'll open

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:31.380
up a notes tab and let's title this demo, real editing notes, and then I'll start a bullet point list

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.350
right here that is going to let me know the changes that need to be made.

7
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.060
So, for example, if I go through the edit and, you know, at 17 seconds, I wanted to change something,

8
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.260
I go 17, you know, update X, Y, Z, and then if there was something at one minute, I would say

9
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.220
one minute, you know, change X, Y, Z.

10
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.640
Right.

11
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.620
So let's go ahead and get into that process.

12
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.400
OK, sweetie, so it's looking pretty good.

13
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.730
There's definitely a few things that stuck out to me, and I don't know if I mentioned this, but you

14
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.840
want to watch this as if it's your first time seeing it.

15
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.210
You know, the track selection you made.

16
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.040
You know the shots you chose.

17
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.570
You know the pacing.

18
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.280
You know what's going to happen next?

19
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.740
And your viewer is seeing it for the first time.

20
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.510
So before you sit down and review your rough edit to plug in your editing and revision notes, try to

21
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.360
have that mindset and try to have that frame of mind.

22
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.600
You got to have a little bit of a short term memory here to just, you know, show up to what you're

23
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.220
watching with no preconceived feelings or thoughts about it.

24
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.910
So anyways, let's talk about the edit now.

25
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.610
The audio for the two track transition from one track to another was a little bit abrupt for my ear.

26
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:42.560
I would probably spend another hour or so smoothing that out, probably adding a longer swoosh affect

27
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.180
to alert the viewer that there was an audible change about to happen.

28
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.340
But actually, you know, we could probably help that out by adding a film burn that will help make

29
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.310
this transition a little bit cleaner.

30
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.290
So let's actually make that our first video.

31
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.540
So right here, one or four, that's where this transition happens.

32
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.350
So I'm going to say add film burn.

33
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.920
That's going to be able to just assist the transition between our two musical tracks.

34
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.370
Now, there was, I think, two or three other things that really stuck out to me.

35
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.220
There's so much movement in all these shots.

36
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.520
And then we get to this red shoe and there's no movement.

37
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.460
It's a tripod shot.

38
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.490
So we need to add some movement to this shot at 22 seconds.

39
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.620
Add movement.

40
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.370
And then there was.

41
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.180
What was it?

42
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.820
Yes, OK.

43
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.740
This shot is really cool.

44
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.150
This dude is like teleporting kind of.

45
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.750
And it matches up really in a cool way to the audio.

46
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.580
But again, there's a lot of movement going on.

47
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.580
And then this shot is just so static.

48
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.200
It's such a still look and try to watch.

49
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.570
Not a fan, especially with this zoom out shot right after.

50
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.320
So 30 seconds and zoom out.

51
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.450
What else?

52
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.590
Let's.

53
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.080
So as I was watching it, I was just kind of passively hearing listening and feeling how the edit was

54
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.840
hitting me, how is making me feel.

55
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.080
And those three things really stuck out.

56
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.680
Everything else was pretty good for this beginning.

57
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.460
Rough edit.

58
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.050
Now, the reason we do this is because now that we have these timestamp notes, now I can go right over

59
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.140
to my editing software, go to 22 seconds right here and make the change.

60
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.550
Otherwise, if you don't have these kind of notes going, you know, you open you're editing software

61
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.130
again, after doing your rough edit, you start playing it, you start watching it, maybe you make

62
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:59.270
a little change here or there, but you don't directly address the big things that showed up for you.

63
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.410
And it will also show up for the viewer when they're watching it for the first time.

64
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.780
So let's go ahead and knock out our first change.

65
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.050
I'm going to scale this up and then we're going to do a position key frame.

66
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.850
So let's move it to one side at the beginning.

67
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.140
Go to the end.

68
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.700
Move it to the other side.

69
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.550
And that's going to give us this kind of smooth pattern.

70
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.350
Now, let's check that out.

71
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:34.560
OK, so that's definitely helping out a lot, and even with this shot, it's got that still moment.

72
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.750
I think if we just kind of scale this up, it's going to also help the following shot.

73
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.120
So we're doing one hundred at the beginning and we'll do one or five at the end.

74
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.650
Well.

75
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.830
OK, cool.

76
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:55.860
Now, what we do is we check off that change and we go to the next one, which is that 30 seconds.

77
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.760
So we have these three shots, which is one single shot.

78
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:09.270
And let's go ahead and test it so that we can affect globally the whole shot as one single clip.

79
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.660
I'm going to do two scaling keyframes.

80
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.860
Go to the beginning.

81
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.000
Let's do one twenty.

82
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.150
OK.

83
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.620
Oh, and we can go ahead and add a position.

84
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:30.640
So we're scaling out, zooming out, and then we can also do a bit of a tilt boom.

85
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.380
Let's see that.

86
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.970
Cool.

87
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.120
We can do even more of a zoom out by scaling it up just a little bit more at the beginning.

88
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.450
I actually liked it better at one time.

89
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.860
So let's keep that.

90
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.940
Perfect.

91
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:01.340
And you see how effective this is, we're just going through and fixing exactly what needs to be fixed.

92
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.670
Not lotty dating, you know, and not wasting any time.

93
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.850
So now let's go to one or four.

94
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:18.110
Yes, this is where we have our music change, and it needs something.

95
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.490
So let's grab a film, burn here

96
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.100
and let's experiment, let's see if we can do something with this one.

97
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.950
I really don't know is going to work.

98
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:38.309
This is I've never used the film burn that look like this, but maybe it will.

99
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.620
OK, let's just kind of see.

100
00:08:59.240 --> 00:08:59.610
Tony.

101
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.580
It's a little bit distracting for my eye, so let's try a different kind of Filburn.

102
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.180
Let's grab this one and throw it in.

103
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.420
Turn the blending mode to screen.

104
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.160
Now let's see.

105
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.640
OK, that's better.

106
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.090
Still a little bit of in.

107
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.980
OK, let's see without.

108
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.610
And let's see it with.

109
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.250
Perfect.

110
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.000
OK.

111
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.120
I am liking the way that looks.
