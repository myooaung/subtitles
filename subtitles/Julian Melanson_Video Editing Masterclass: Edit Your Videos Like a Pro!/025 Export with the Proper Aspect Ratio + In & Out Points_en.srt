1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,689
So now that we finished these important first steps for this section, I want to now go through the

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,340
exporting process and some of the really just key fundamentals with that.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,080
Now, we've been working and it's likely you've been working as well in the vertical video format category.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:28,110
So we'll walk through what it is like exporting for vertical video, horizontal video, and really also

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:34,230
keeping in mind that you want to export with the proper settings of where that video is going to live.

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,600
If that Liddie video is going to live on YouTube, you're going to export with certain settings.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,870
If it's going to live on Instagram, it's different settings and so on.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,920
So let's hop in here and see our final edit here.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,420
And I want you to pull up your footage as well so you can follow along.

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,050
And we're going to go up to file.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,120
We're going to go to export.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,460
And we're going to click on media.

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,390
And actually, before we do that, we want to make sure that the in and out points in our timeline are

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,570
in the proper place.

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,940
You can see up here on the top bar of our timeline.

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,870
We want to have it so that it's the endpoint is at the beginning, and of course, the outpoint is at

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,240
the end.

18
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,550
What'll happen if the outpoint I'm hitting I for endpoint over outpoint.

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,180
By the way, if the output is here, it's going to export everything up to here and not include the

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,600
rest of the video.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,160
So we always want to make sure that are in and our points are set properly for exactly when we want

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,790
to export.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,350
Yeah.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,340
And one thing that I'll say that's kind of a little bit handy is if you want to kind of test something

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,180
or share one part of your video with someone or.

26
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,350
Yeah, like what I'll do sometimes when I don't know if a certain scene is working, but I don't want

27
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,430
to export the whole video.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,840
You can set an endpoint and an outpoint for just, you know, a little 10 second clip and just export

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,410
that part.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,160
Right.

31
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,800
So there's some cool uses for doing it.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,520
But for this circumstance, we're going to set the endpoint at the beginning.

33
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,090
Yeah.

34
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,370
Point at the very end in good file.

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,770
Can you go to export and go to media?

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,600
Or we can hit command.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,530
And and that's going to do the same exact thing.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,660
This is going to bring up our export settings panel.

39
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,780
And what we want to do here is make sure that our format is aged out to six four.

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,180
This is really the best format for online video.

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,260
Anything that you're sharing online where you want to retain as much quality as possible, but have

42
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,990
it in a more manageable and optimized codec or format for online use, which is pretty much going to

43
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,810
be almost every single one of your exports.

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,350
Rarely do I ever use anything else in here if I'm exporting just audio.

45
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:05,200
I'll go and I'll use waveform audio and then I'll set my sample rate a bit rate to 32 bit.

46
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,810
That's going to give it the max quality as possible and choose the destination.

47
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,560
But that's separate.

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,800
So right now, what we're focusing on is exporting our video.

49
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,670
So we're going to go out to 64 and then we're going to go to the preset tab and we're going to click

50
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,510
that, OK?

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,860
Because this is going to be for this video specifically viewed as an Instagram story format.

52
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,920
What I want to do is choose the mobile device HD function.

53
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,640
OK.

54
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,630
If this was going to be a YouTube video, per se, then I would go to YouTube video to NAACP or Fourcade,

55
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,760
depending on what it was shot ads and a little bit of a pro tip here.

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:57,610
When you are exporting a 10 ATP high def video file, which most almost all cameras are shooting, and

57
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:04,150
it's very likely that that's the format you'll be editing in, whether it's going to Vimeo, Facebook

58
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,930
or YouTube, a little bit of a hack is to click the four K function so you can do four K for YouTube

59
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,630
here for K for Vimeo right here, and you can do four K for Facebook.

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:24,970
What that's going to do is it's going to compress the information less and it's going to give more space

61
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,910
for all of the pixels, all of the data and all for the all of the information, even if it's a 10 step

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,540
file.

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,620
So you'll see that if you export a 10 ATP video for YouTube and that same exact 10 A.P. video at four

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,510
K for YouTube, and you look at them side by side, you're going to see the four K file is going to

65
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,050
look a little bit more crisp.

66
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:51,280
There's going to be little bit more detail and a little bit more color and overall data that's in your

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,740
footage and in your video, because YouTube is compressing it less in these platforms are compressing

68
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,860
it less because you're telling it it's a much larger file.

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,770
So let's hop back into what we're currently exporting.

70
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,370
This is going to be playing on a mobile device for Instagram.

71
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:17,380
So for doing that, I always go to mobile device and ATP and we can see our audio video effects, multiplexer

72
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,090
captions publish.

73
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,900
OK.

74
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:27,040
For audio, what I always do as well is it's going to depending on your export preset, it's going to

75
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,700
change your bit rate, depending on the quality that you're expending, as when you do do mobile device

76
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,060
and ATP, it puts your bit rate at 128.

77
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,590
OK, we want to have our audio at the highest settings as possible.

78
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,280
We're going to make sure audio quality is set to high as well.

79
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:53,890
We're going to go to the video tab and we can also scrub through our export to get a preview of what

80
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,000
it's going to be looking like.

81
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,500
Now, you can see there are these really big black bars on the side.

82
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:06,220
That's because our aspect ratio is 10, 80 by 1920 instead of 1920 by 10, 80.

83
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,610
So to get around this issue and not export of video with these big black bars, we're going to match

84
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:19,810
the source of our sequence settings and make that match the settings for our export.

85
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:28,660
So I'm going to click match source and we can also click render at maximum depth and use maximum render

86
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,290
quality.

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,520
This is going to allow your editing software to work more frame by frame on each different characteristic

88
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,080
in detail that's in each frame.

89
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,670
And then we have the multiplexer tab.

90
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,730
I've really never go into here.

91
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,180
These are really not parameters that you ever need to be changing for.

92
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,430
Ninety nine percent of your edits.

93
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,890
We have the caption tab as well that you really likely ninety nine point nine percent of the time you

94
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,000
will not be using.

95
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,540
And then we have the publish tab, which this can be handy if you want to link Premier directly with

96
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:08,800
your Behance profile, Adobe Profile, Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo and YouTube.

97
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,210
I personally don't ever export directly out of premier directly to another platform to me that I've

98
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,460
spent so many years not having that function.

99
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,660
It's just weird to me.

100
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,620
Maybe I'm too set in my ways here, but I always like to have the individual file that I'm then dragging

101
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,510
into where I want it to go.

102
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,500
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I don't ever use the publish function.

103
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,480
But of course, take the time.

104
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,360
If it's applicable to you and would speed up your workflow, take the time to set it up.

105
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,800
And now that we've got all these parameters set up, the final step is to click our output name to determine

106
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,790
the name of our video file and the location, which is where the video file is going to be exported

107
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,100
to.

108
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:01,540
And I'm sure you can guess we're going to be keeping everything very organized and exporting it to the

109
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,640
proper video folder.

110
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,000
So I'm going to go to Shasta edit and I'm going to create an export folder.

111
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,170
OK.

112
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,650
And I'm going to title it Mount Shasta.

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,130
And this is a good time to kind of talk about labeling your exports.

114
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,790
Now a lot of the time you export something and you think that's possibly going to be the final one.

115
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,850
And then you realize, nope, there's some major changes that need to be made or something's not working,

116
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,539
whatever it is.

117
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,590
The best way that I found, of course, you can label it by the date Mount Shasta edit.

118
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,940
So and so date.

119
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,070
But what I've learned over the years is best to do version one, version two, version three.

120
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:55,680
So most of the time, almost all the time, I'll do the name of the project for the export name.

121
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,210
And then the one if it's vtu, it would be v2 v three.

122
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,720
V three.

123
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,380
OK.

124
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,930
So the one and I also add where it's going to live.

125
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,270
So in this case, this is going to be an Instagram story.

126
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,140
OK.

127
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,870
So if it was going to be a normal post to just be Instagram post, if it was going to be YouTube video,

128
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,380
B, Instagram R, it would be excuse me, Mount Shasta V1 YouTube.

129
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,160
OK, Mount Shasta, V1, Facebook.

130
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,600
So Mount Shasta, the one Instagram story we're going to hit save.

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,430
And later we're going to go down to hit the export button.
