1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,840
Now I have after effects open, I downloaded the template and double clicked it, and now this is the

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,830
main screen for the after effects editing process.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,180
Now, when you buy one of these templates, the cool thing, this is our timeline down here.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,020
And the cool thing is you'll see that they'll come with multiple logo styles.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,550
So we kind of have this more dark, you know, black background.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,360
It's a little bit more, you know, techi, I would say a little bit more of a technological type of

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,410
product rather than a real estate kind of vibe.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,850
So we're not going to go with that one.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,260
This one looks nice.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,360
It's got kind of a 3D look to it.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,560
And then this one looks nice as well.

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,850
It looks more there's a shadow down here.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,820
There's a lens flare.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,920
So when you do purchase one of these premade templates, always look through the multiple types of logos

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,740
that they give you in that template and choose the one with the color scheme that matches up the most

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,140
with the style of video you're creating.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,170
Now, we have are different types of logo styles that we look through up here.

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,930
They're always going to have multiple folders that have the different kind of elements of the edit.

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,790
So we don't need to worry too much about the elements, the footage and textures.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,580
These are basically all of these things like the blur, the noise, the optical flair, different shapes

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,570
that it's adding in there.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,340
That's all what they did for you.

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,340
So you don't need to worry about that stuff too much.

24
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,800
The only thing you really want to worry about is there's always going to be a sequence that you can

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,250
open.

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,620
It's going to allow for you to replace the logo and text.

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,880
So let's go ahead and let's double click that sequence.

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,190
I'm going to load it up here.

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,430
Perfect.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,430
Now, what we have is the sequence where we can replace the standard logo, this Envato logo, because

31
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,780
that's like the name of the main website.

32
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,520
We don't want that in our motion graphics.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,120
So if you have a logo, your client's logo, your personal logo, your brand logo, your product logo,

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,560
whatever it is, now would be the time to go on your computer.

35
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:27,560
I just downloaded a lion page because why I feel like lions.

36
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,280
It just really matches up with this kind of kind of royal vibe of this expensive property.

37
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:44,730
So let's follow the guides that these vertical lines and horizontal lines that this template is showing.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,680
And I'm going to, of course, turn off the example logo that the edit came with.

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,430
And I already know that I want to go with logo number three.

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,130
So I'm going to go ahead and close out these other sequences with the other logos you don't need.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,480
And let's load this up and see how that's looking.

42
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,390
And that looks super clean.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,040
Now, of course, we don't want to have the Envato dot com.

44
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:17,610
That's just a placeholder that these kind of templates will leave for you so that you can add your own

45
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,420
website or address whatever it is.

46
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,300
So because what was the name that we put here?

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,620
OK.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,450
Hills Hillcrest property.

49
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:34,820
So let's just to Hill Crest property dot com.

50
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,090
OK.

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,250
Let me load that.

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,210
So that's looking pretty good.

53
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,430
Just, you know, from a design point of view, I'd say the logo is looking too big compared to our

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,970
font.

55
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,430
Now, we can fix this a few ways.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,910
We can scale up the font or scale down the logo.

57
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,770
I think we can do both, because if font looks honestly pretty tiny.

58
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,640
So on a scale this up from 50 to 60, OK, that's looking better.

59
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,040
And it's a little bit thin.

60
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:16,140
So what I'm going to do is add right here, we have the similar stroke function, just like in from

61
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,410
here.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,630
This is how we can set our stroke with.

63
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,200
So I'm going to take it from zero to two.

64
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,480
Now, next thing would be would be to scale down our logo.

65
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,370
So I'm going to double click our logo.

66
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,420
So I'm going to open up the logo sequence.

67
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm going to hit s to open up the scale function.

68
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,590
And I'm going to scale it down from one hundred to 80.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,420
Now, in AfterEffects, you can see you can change all of the parameters of the clip that you've selected

70
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,500
right underneath it.

71
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,140
It's different than in premiere.

72
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,920
All that stuff is up here in the top left.

73
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,780
And after effects, boom, it's right with the clip.

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,730
So after effects is good for a high amount of.

75
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,680
Refinement and editing on, let's say, a five second piece of a video when something like Premier is

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,810
perfect for putting together the entire three to five minute video.

77
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,020
And then you go in after effects to really create a very specialized look for just a very short amount

78
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,860
of that video.

79
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:26,300
Now, I know that there's alternative templates inside this one with different color schemes, and there's

80
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,030
this other one that also looks really good.

81
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,800
So honestly, both would match.

82
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,600
Both have that same kind of elegant, professional, high end kind of feeling.

83
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,200
Any kind of Lione logo automatically makes it feel high end.

84
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,370
And these are very clean, modern, minimal graphics styles.

85
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,870
So honestly, both would work, I think, for this example.

86
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,670
I'm just going to go with this version.

87
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,380
It's super clean and it's perfect for this style.

88
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,870
So now what we can do is once we've gotten our logo in there and we've gotten whatever kind of title

89
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:10,610
or text that we want on screen, we can kind of go and edit the, you know, overall other stuff that's

90
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,600
going on in the image.

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,200
This is going to be our optical flair.

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,490
So you can see this blue light.

93
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,130
There it is.

94
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,260
And then without.

95
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm going to personally take it out because we don't need any kind of Star Trek over the top.

96
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,510
You know, we don't want it to feel over edited.

97
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,580
We want it to be clean and simple.

98
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:38,150
If it was a more high energy video with a more futuristic theme and feeling, boom, leave the lens

99
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,920
flare in there, that would be perfect.

100
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,800
But we're really wanting to go for subtlety.

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
Now we can do other stuff like take out the drop shadow

102
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,170
just like that, or put it back in by using this icon.

103
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:01,160
For each one of these layers, we can selectively turn the visibility on and off for the different layers.

104
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,760
So what we can do is kind of preview the intro of what this edit or motion graphic is starting to look

105
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:07,960
like.

106
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:14,240
So I'm going to go ahead and select the first two seconds and I'm going to start to load a preview so

107
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,020
we can check it out.

108
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,420
And boom, this is the first few seconds of the animation.

109
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,180
Now, it looks freaking amazing.

110
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,530
Like I said, this would have taken me days or an entire day to put together.

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:34,940
So I'm super happy to pay 15 bucks to then have this kind of template for all my future projects.

112
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,250
You know, and of course, we can go in and there's tweaking we can do.

113
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,520
There's all these different layers.

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,030
We can mess with the blurriness, the intro, you know, all the different stuff, the shadow, the

115
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,320
reflections, all the animations.

116
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm going to leave this as is for now.

117
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,040
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to export it, and then I'm going to drop it in to our premiere

118
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,150
sequence and see what it looks like as the ending title card.
