00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.940
We also talked about our color correction.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.410
Now, we did a really similar process as the other edits that we did together.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.560
So what we have here is our luminary color.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.620
And you can see I'm boosting the highlights.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.600
Way up to a hundred and fifty.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.620
I'm adding a little bit of contrast.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.180
It's going to create a little bit more depth in our image.

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.020
That's with no contrast.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.610
And then the more we bring it up, the more dark, dark, the more dark the dark star and the more bright

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.300
the brights are.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.350
But I'm going to undo that.

12
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.290
We put it at 10 and we boosted our whites.

13
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.180
We brought up a saturation.

14
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.470
Almost 200 originally was at 100, which is that and it's no energy, no personality, no colors.

15
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:55.140
So we needed to basically double the saturation from in camera to what we made in this adjustment layer.

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.150
And then we chose a lot.

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.630
This just worked really well for this edit.

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:10.410
You know, I could have gone with a lot of other luts, you know, but the one that I chose really matches

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.490
with the theme and professional feeling.

20
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.920
We want to have, you know, some other lights.

21
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.160
They may look good, but this is just washing everything out too much.

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.840
And it's not that kind of video.

23
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950
We want everything to feel solid, professional and clean.

24
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:35.080
For this project, I also moved up the sharpness of 50 points that just helped with sharpening up parts

25
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.450
of the image, especially when we have like this text on screen.

26
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.380
I don't know if you'll be able to see in the screen capture, but if I undo the sharpness and put it

27
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.070
to zero, all of these shots are just a little bit soft.

28
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.130
They're not quite jumping off the screen.

29
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.690
So that is why I put the sharpness up to 50.

30
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.370
Boom, it sharpens up all the dull areas of our image.

31
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.880
And I didn't do anything too fancy down in the creative tab.

32
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.980
I didn't boost up any specific colors.

33
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.300
I think I might have actually done that.

34
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.270
This is our B roll that we're looking out here.

35
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.490
I think I did that for our mean talking footage.

36
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.880
So that's the original.

37
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.680
This is with our color correction.

38
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.710
We use the same exact techniques that we worked on together earlier in the course.

39
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.140
And I feel like I might have added some boosting to the blues because we have this nice blue indigo

40
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.730
shirt that our character has.

41
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.570
We have this cool blue couch in the background.

42
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.300
So let me see here.

43
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.600
Yep.

44
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.350
So we boosted the saturation of our blues in this image just to give it a little bit of extra character

45
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.870
and personality and make these colors stand out.

46
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.910
So without boom, you see that subtle change.

47
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.630
It's more gray with it's definitely blue.

48
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.460
This is just a little bit gray.

49
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.330
So that was another step in this color correction process.

50
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.470
RB roll didn't really need it.

51
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.830
I could have done it a little bit in here, but our talking footage definitely needed a little bit of

52
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.930
that in the color correction process.
