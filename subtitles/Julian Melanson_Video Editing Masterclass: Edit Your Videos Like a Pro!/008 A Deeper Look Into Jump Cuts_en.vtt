00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.010
So we are on a roll here, so I want to keep this going, so let's talk about understanding jump cuts

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.530
now like we learned before.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.000
This is when the difference between two cuts isn't enough and it's jarring or distracting for the viewer.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.240
And the reason that is, is because you need a certain amount of contrast between two different shots

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.760
to create a clean cut.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.450
All of the cuts in our violinist video that we've been working on are all clean cuts.

7
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.240
So you can kind of think of it as black text on a white screen.

8
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
If the text is dark enough, there's going to be enough contrast for you to read the letters.

9
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.700
If there isn't enough contrast between the black and white, there's not going to be enough for you

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.710
to tell the difference between the two.

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.170
So as you can see, I like metaphors.

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.650
These things aren't to be taken literally, but it's just another way of looking at the same answer.

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
And, you know, YouTube has really made jump cuts a lot more acceptable.

14
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.120
But back in the day, I mean, when I came up in the filmmaking world, that was like a scene if you

15
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.590
had jump cuts in your video.

16
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.540
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.380
But the.

18
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.430
But the bottom line is that if you do it, you really want to do it with style and with purpose.

19
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.430
So like in our hyp edit, we were doing jump cuts, cutting forward in time.

20
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.450
And it worked.

21
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.490
But if I were to create some jump cuts with this edit that we're working on, let's see what that would

22
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.030
look like.

23
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.930
So clearly that's not going to be a stylistic decision that we're going to do purposefully, it does

24
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.640
not work with the vibe and the overall aesthetic of this current project.

25
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.420
And with that said, here's an example of the contrast between dark and light that I was talking about.

26
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860
Here we can easily see this wonderful quote from the Homy, Alan Watts.

27
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.220
You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself.

28
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.990
That's the baby that's deep.

29
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.010
But if we see the contrast between these two things disappearing, you then can't read the day in quote,

30
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.570
there's not enough contrast between what's light in the frame and dark in the frame.

31
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.520
Now, that's a metaphor.

32
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.300
Let's look at a more practical example where not creating enough contrast to make a clean cut actually

33
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.270
is used stylistically to make a cool look and edit.

34
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.240
So as you can see, we have our character going into their car and we're jump cutting ahead in time.

35
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.850
So this is working because it matches the vibe of this specific video.

36
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.570
So just to recap this thought here, all of these cuts in this current project have enough change in

37
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.530
each clip so that each shot has a clean change between one to the other.

38
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.860
And if there wasn't enough change, let's say I did this,

39
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.930
that would create a jumpcut which does not work with this project specifically.

40
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.200
So add that one to your arsenal and remember to use your jump cuts consciously and creatively.
