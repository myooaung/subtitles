1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,410
OK, so as I've been pulling the SELEX, I've been removing parts that were mess ups on takes, choosing

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,420
the best takes, making the proper cuts and refining and taking out what's not needed.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,700
I've been labeling the clips that signal and show me as the editor when the topic is changed or when

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,550
the scene may change or any other kind of thing that I should know when I go back to the edit now,

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,860
because we're working more with dialogue and getting more into these intermediate level steps where

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,070
we want to have more refined audio and videos.

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,170
I want to kind of show more of this process of refining audio.

8
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,830
It's going to be very applicable to all your future projects, because a lot of being an editor is making

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,460
smooth dialogue and a lot of recordings to the dialogue doesn't happen all the time front to back where

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,920
you just do one take all the way through and it's clean.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,860
So we kind of got a ninja our way in here.

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,820
So I wanted to take a second and continue to kind of show what this process looks like and how we get

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,800
a seamless cut in our edit.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,050
And I'm shooting at two point eight.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,170
OK, we're going to make a cut there with the ISO at four.

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,750
When eight with the eye and when you're making these kind of cuts to take out the empty spaces.

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:38,830
You want to be able to play it back, close your eyes and listen to hear if you can hear a cut being

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,340
made.

19
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:47,230
Now, if I'm visually looking at this while I'm watching it eat with the I see a cut being made and

20
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,020
it makes it OK that there's an audio change.

21
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,410
The trick is, if we play this back and we don't look at our edit at two point eight with the eyes,

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,310
I hear a little bit of an extra gap.

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:08,740
OK, what I'm going to do to fix the gap right here, 8:00 with the OK is to select our clips and scoot

24
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,900
them over a few frames.

25
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,850
And I'm going to close my eyes and playback.

26
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,170
I'm shooting at two point eight with the eyes.

27
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,570
So there's still a little extra gap.

28
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,030
I want it to be a seamless sentence that doesn't have any weirdness.

29
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,470
OK, so let's take out a few more frames here.

30
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:35,960
And I'm shooting at two point eight with the IESO and I'm shooting at two point eight with the eyes

31
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,070
so perfect, so that to me doesn't send any red flags in my brain.

32
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,480
It doesn't say there sounds like there's a cut there.

33
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,320
There needs to be more space or less space.

34
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,460
That's perfect.

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,110
Now, let's continue, because this is actually a really well lit, brightly lit circumstance, the

36
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,500
invo.

37
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,220
Here's another scenario where there can be something kind of refined here.

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,830
I repeat myself a little bit, and there's an extra earth that we don't need brightly lit.

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,200
So let's make a cut after the Earth.

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,600
This is actually a really well lit, brightly lit circumstance.

41
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,430
OK, so I say well lit, brightly lit, so we could try to cut in the well.

42
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,440
But I already say brightly lit.

43
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,860
So what I'm going to do instead of making the cut here brightly lit, is make the cut here circumstance

44
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:33,290
after circumstance and just completely skip these two attempts to fix my audio.

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,520
I'm just going to skip those.

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,290
So you're really well lit circumstance.

47
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,370
OK, perfect.

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,660
And there's a little too much space, really well lit circumstance, the really well lit circumstance,

49
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,190
really well lit circumstance, the cool.

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,550
So that's a pretty seamless edit.

51
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:59,740
In one cut, we took out an extra hour and we took out an extra repetitious, repetitive phrase.

52
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:06,310
And the reason we're doing that is, A, making this seamless edit the people's attention span is like

53
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,710
that.

54
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,170
Right.

55
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,700
So we want to really take out any extra information that doesn't need to be there.
