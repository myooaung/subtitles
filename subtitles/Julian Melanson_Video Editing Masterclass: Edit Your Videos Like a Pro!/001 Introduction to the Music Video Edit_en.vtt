00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.880
All righty, so I hope you enjoyed that last set of learning lessons for that client project.

2
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.410
Now, I'm excited about this one because we're going to dive into advanced techniques.

3
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.480
We're going to do another break down and kind of case study on a music video.

4
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.420
Now, this one's going to be exciting because we shot everything on all red cameras.

5
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.270
So four K and six K is what we're working with here.

6
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.130
We shot all of our underwater stuff on the red epic.

7
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.980
I want to say huge underwater housing.

8
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.780
Really cool everything.

9
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.250
We shot at one hundred and twenty frames per second.

10
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.460
It's super slow mo.

11
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.490
And then we shot everything that's normal, like heat time or on land.

12
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.450
Footage is shot on the red Comodo at 60 frames a second.

13
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.060
And I'm placing this directly after what we just worked on, because this is kind of the opposite.

14
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:17.600
The other project had a lot of complexity in the audio level of things, different sound effects, multiple

15
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.160
soundtracks, music layers, dialogue coming in and out.

16
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.860
And a lot of different moments and a lot of beats.

17
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.390
Now, this is the exact opposite.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.140
So I wanted to have contrast for you so that you can learn how it's over here on this side of things

19
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.730
and how to do things over here on a different side of things.

20
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:44.420
So this is going to be a very complex video segment with only one audio track throughout the whole edit.

21
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.660
So there's really no audio transitions, no different music tracks, no going from dialogue to this

22
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.930
or that.

23
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.700
So it's the exact opposite to the other track.

24
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.810
And I already said this, but that's why I'm putting these back to back.

25
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.050
So let's go ahead and hop into the screen cap and view what the project looks like.

26
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.710
And then we're going to dive into breaking down some really unique moments.

27
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.510
OK, so what we have here is our music video edit.

28
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.200
And like I mentioned, we have one audio track here.

29
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.490
There's one very, very minimal just sound of that.

30
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.430
I additive just ocen at this very ending outro where the client's logo comes up.

31
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.930
But I mean, look at this.

32
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.180
This is a pretty -- complex.

33
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.750
Excuse me.

34
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.140
Dang.

35
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.150
Complex timeline.

36
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.360
So we're going to dive into these different aspects.

37
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.210
And let's first, before we watch the video, let's go ahead and just kind of review here.

38
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.760
So we have our bro Selex.

39
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.930
We can go ahead and click that.

40
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.540
And this is just like we've what we've done earlier in the course, which is to go through take our

41
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.160
raw footage and translate that into select.

42
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.060
So like I said, I mean, look at that.

43
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.840
We have some really cool stuff that we're going to be working with.

44
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.480
And because this shot was so shooting intensive, there's a daytime shooting sequence, there's a fire

45
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.410
shooting sequence, all the different locations have their own sequence themselves.

46
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.480
So this is literally 12 minutes of Selex from just one location in the daytime.

47
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.140
So you can see we've done the process that we've worked on together earlier in the course of labeling

48
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:41.360
and coloring our content to properly organize things in a way that we believe is the easiest to jump

49
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.110
back into this edit and finding exactly what we're looking for.

50
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.880
We then have this selects from our nighttime fire sequence.

51
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.220
So this is really cool stuff, shot at 60 frames per second.

52
00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:04.700
We had a bonfire going, the artist dancing, moving in front of the scene and performing it.

53
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.560
And then we have the nighttime is singing sequence for this specifically.

54
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.930
I went ahead and pulled the Selex, but because it was a performance, I linked and synched up all of

55
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.940
the best shots so you could see them layered here that this is basically the same as this as far as

56
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.570
pulling selects.

57
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.460
But because she's singing, I made the best ones, the best performance visible.

58
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.800
And that's why things are stacked for this kind of Selex sequence.

59
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.270
So if you take a listen.

60
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.370
Let go.

61
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.940
Diffusing.

62
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.740
Think.

63
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.320
OK, cool.

64
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.050
So those are the best singing Selex that we have.

65
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.310
And then we have this really cool out of water mermaid vibe type content.

66
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.360
Then we have some stock footage that I purchased for the project and I pulled Selex on, but that we

67
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.300
actually didn't even end up using in the project, which that's going to happen.

68
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.480
That's definitely gonna happen.

69
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.520
You know, there are a few disor multiple times in your project.

70
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:29.170
So now that we know the process that we've gone through to get to where we are now in this main sequence,

71
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.010
I'm going to close these other sequences and we're going to watch all the way through this edit and

72
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.300
then we're going to deconstruct it.

73
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.920
Take a deep breath and find your feet.

74
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.220
Breathe it all the way out.

75
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.460
Take another deep breath and bring honor and dignity to your spine.

76
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.770
Breathe out.

77
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.830
Strong backed, soft front and close your eyes,

78
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.420
allow your tummy to relax in your breath, to flow naturally.

79
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.320
What's showing up for you today?

80
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.690
Notice your thoughts, feelings and sensations.

81
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:52.750
As you sift and sort through them like clouds passing in your sky, see the sun setting and twinkle

82
00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:01.540
lights appearing bother's sky full of lights, dear mermaid.

83
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.970
Where is your North Star?

84
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.400
Do you see it?

85
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:17.770
Take a deep breath in breathing in all the juicy Nancy, yumminess and stickiness that life offers,

86
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:28.390
an experience yourselves revitalized now purposefully, intentionally buried out your vision all the

87
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:38.440
way across the sky, touching every twinkling star across the room, watching it hit the wall across

88
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.180
and all the way around the world, all the way back into your next deep breath and see the world, the

89
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.960
ripple with your contribution as your North Star.

90
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.820
Whether it's behind clouds or not guides you.

91
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.620
What is your purpose?

92
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.980
What is your why?

93
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.870
Open your eyes, see your North Star and fly.

94
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.170
Toby?

95
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.080
Let go.

96
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.190
The first big.

97
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.790
Kerry.

98
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.590
And bottle.

99
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.520
Oh.

100
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.150
OK, so a lot of stuff going on here.

101
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.330
There's a lot of different pockets of slok weight.

102
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.810
So there's a lot of different stuff going on here.

103
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:37.400
And in the next video lesson, we're going to hop in and start breaking down one of these fast.

104
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:39.920
OK.

105
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.670
And the next video lets you know, want to start?

106
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:42.690
We're going to do something.

107
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.550
So I'll see you in the next video lesson.
