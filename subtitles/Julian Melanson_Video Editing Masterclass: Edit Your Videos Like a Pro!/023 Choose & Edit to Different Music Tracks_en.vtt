00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.100
So now let's go here to our actual edit.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.770
What I'm going to do is I'm going to click this lock icon.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.140
Now, what we're doing here is locking off all of our audio for our project.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.870
Why I'm doing that is because when I drag in and start moving around this music that we're going to

5
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.580
add, I don't want to mess with anything that doesn't need to be changed.

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.890
OK.

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.260
So in your editing software, it is optional.

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.220
You don't absolutely need to.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.190
But I would recommend locking off stuff that you don't want change once you get to that stage of your

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.490
edit.

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.380
So let's go to our first track here.

12
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.310
I'm going to double click it.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.580
And I like doing it this way, where I double click it and bring it up in this window so I can see the

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.390
waveform.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.170
This is going to tell you exactly what's going on in the track.

16
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.200
OK, so I know here is the drop of the song.

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.710
I know.

18
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.430
Here's a break.

19
00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.910
I know.

20
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.780
Here's another drop.

21
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.450
And this is the intro and there's kind of an outro here.

22
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.980
So if we listen to the intro.

23
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.510
I don't think we would really use the intro, so let's just make an endpoint by hitting I right before

24
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.960
the drop.

25
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.160
OK.

26
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.750
Yeah.

27
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.110
Every once in a week.

28
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.710
And then we'll hit an outpoint at the end of the track and we can obviously move things around a little

29
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.960
bit.

30
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.320
But we just want to get a feel for right away.

31
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.700
We'll be able to see if this audio and visual lines up.

32
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.160
I'm not a huge fan.

33
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.080
I feel like the pacing is way too different for this song and this edit, for example.

34
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.750
What I'm going to do just to kind of illustrate that point is I'm going to duplicate this and I'm just

35
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.820
going to title this music tests, because I want to show you what it's like when you want to match up

36
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.970
visual and audio.

37
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.790
So in my mind, if I were to make this song, match this edit, if I really wanted to use this song

38
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
with this footage, let's say I really liked it and I wanted to make it work, I wouldn't do that.

39
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.360
But for this scenario, we would want we would want to pick up the pacing of our edit, which means

40
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.740
the frequency of our cuts.

41
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.480
We're cutting slow, cutting slow and doing this very slow nature story.

42
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.240
So if you were to drag in a track like this for your edit and you wanted to make it match up more,

43
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.350
I would listen to the beat cut.

44
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.060
OK.

45
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.320
And this is going to be a little sloppy, we're not doing anything really cleanly here, I just want

46
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.040
to show you.

47
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.350
OK, good.

48
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.250
And let's not worry about the audio from our shot from our shots here.

49
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.480
This is the type of song where you can introduce some jumping ahead.

50
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.190
Because that's going to really match up the vibe of the song.

51
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.010
And

52
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.290
I'm listening to the kick in the snare, which are the two strongest elements of the track, and you

53
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.300
really want to ride and listen to what the track is telling you to do with the edit.

54
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.410
So let's just take a look at what we've done so far just to see.

55
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.140
So that should give you an idea of a track that is it really right for the edit, but if you wanted

56
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.420
to kind of make things work, if the track is got a little bit more energy than the actual footage or

57
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.760
more of a faster tempo of your edit, you can kind of speed things up, slow things down.

58
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.260
Editing wise to make those things sync up and really be a little bit more cohesive.

59
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.050
So let's go ahead and get rid of this track, though, for now.

60
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.670
And let's go to the next option.

61
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.490
Here's a good lesson that we can kind of learn here is that if we look at the wave form, we can see

62
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.780
that this is the intro and that this is where the excitement happens, the drop right where the beat

63
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.270
comes in and the energy really gets picked up.

64
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.750
So what I want to do is add a marker there by hitting him.

65
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.290
OK.

66
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:13.530
And the cool thing is you can use a part of a track like that to really accentuate a moment that is

67
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.430
impactful.

68
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.290
This is called a striking point.

69
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.300
So what I want to kind of do here to give you a little bit more insight, and hopefully you're going

70
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.580
to be able to experiment with your footage.

71
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.580
And a track along with me is two.

72
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.980
Now, what we've done so far is really edited with a pacing that matched the audio of our environment.

73
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.570
Now we're switching around our pacing to match the audio of our music track.

74
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.320
So I'm going to lock this music track to keep it in place.

75
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.140
And that will allow me to freely move around everything else and not affect it.

76
00:05:49.170 --> 00:06:01.020
OK, so I know that for this marked spot, I want to have footage with the most movement and kind of

77
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.060
excitement as possible.

78
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.710
And for this example, we're just going to use this one, so I'm gonna scooch this musical track over

79
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.440
to match up with to match up with when this shot comes in.

80
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.320
And we're going to be looking for moments to kind of cut a head and make things feel a little bit more

81
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.710
quick.

82
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.050
OK, right here, we can make a cut.

83
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.660
And slide everything over so it skips forward.

84
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.670
OK, now on this big hit right here, we will bring in our next visual.

85
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:55.690
Now, what we'll do is kind of trim up the intro to further match this vibe of this track.

86
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.290
So instead of using this whole intro here, let's go ahead and start it.

87
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.390
If we take a listen, we can see that the beginning of track starts here.

88
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.170
But there's going to be another moment where we can cut in and it'll still feel right.

89
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.640
It's going to be right boom right there.

90
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.970
So we saved ourself about 10 seconds of not having to use that intro.

91
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.870
So for simplicity's sake, I'm just going to temporarily cut this music layer and I'm going to drag

92
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.340
it over to the front of our edit.

93
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.040
That way, we're going to scrunch everything down here that can fit in the intro.

94
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.230
We're going to scrunch it down so that it fits and it'll flow seamlessly into this part that we just

95
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.680
edited.

96
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.120
Boom.

97
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.890
I want to skip forward air.

98
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.490
And then right on this compart right here.

99
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.360
That's perfect for a little meditation yogi part.

100
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.390
So let's take a look at the thing all the way through.

101
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.570
So as you can see, of course, we would want to fill that out a lot more and have more of a proper

102
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:18.820
definitive ending, but we've taken our edit really quickly and completely changed the entire vibe of

103
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.350
the overall final product.
