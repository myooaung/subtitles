1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,610
So now let's find our next moment to transition into our third track, where you're at your peak of

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,410
overwhelm during this process, because you're going to end up with a bunch of packages at your house

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,100
when you don't even really remember what you ordered, but there's just a bunch of boxes.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,170
So I use this in room to create a cool little montage with a really pointy object.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,900
So we're going to need to drop out our track here so we can do one of two things.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,430
We can either just drop the track out, kind of like what we did before.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,820
But I don't like doing those back to back either, like doing a fade out or an echo.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,570
Because if you do the just straight dropping the track out, it's kind of a dramatic moment.

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,610
And if you do it a bunch in the video back to back.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,060
Kind of loses its power.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,400
And to me personally, it feels a little bit repetitive.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,570
Some people might not even notice it, but let's see what else we can do for this one.

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,550
As with the pointy object.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,080
So that would work if I wanted to do that.

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,050
But let's see what a fade sounds like.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,820
So I'm happy for the pen tool and I'm going to do a little bit of fade.

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:06,870
Let it play.

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,280
Remember what you ordered?

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,810
But there's just a bunch of boxes.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,880
So I use this in room to create a cool little montage with a really pointy object.

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,590
OK, the fade works, too.

22
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:28,730
So I want to show another option, which is kind of another use of the echo or reverb.

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,290
So there's this beat.

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,950
And what I'm going to do is isolate it.

25
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:44,780
So I'm going to make a blade cut in front of it and I'm going to turn down the track before that comes

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,020
in.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,870
So I just want to really isolate this part.

28
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,510
Yeah.

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,610
So I'm going to make that and then I'm going to fade it out.

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,110
Mm hmm.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,320
So now we have that just kind of one hit.

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,860
But the problem is, it fades out so away around that like we did before.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,169
We're going to nest this and we're going to add another reverb layer.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,790
And actually, I'm just going to grab for times sake, the one that we did earlier in the edit.

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,650
I want to paste it on.

36
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,910
And let's hear it.

37
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,640
So that is a more of a gradual it's not really a fade out.

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,370
It's not really a straight drop off like we just did.

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,810
It's kind of in the tween.

40
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,390
And it sounds professional because you're making that part of the track kind of sound like that.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,210
That's the end of the track, which is when we want it to stop.

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,200
So it kind of is a little bit more cohesive.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,660
Let's hear it with the rest of the audio.

44
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,160
That's when you don't even really remember what you ordered, but it's just a bunch of boxes.

45
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,230
So I use this all along to create a cool little montage with the really pointy object.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,240
OK, cool.

47
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,170
So we got to use the echo.

48
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,610
As another kind of creative tool to make the transition between tracks, so we're only like two ish

49
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,850
minutes in the video and we've already got two tracks going, which is great because that's going to

50
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,030
keep the overall pacing and tempo moving forward.

51
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,780
Now, let's go to the end of this montage, because this is a sound driven montage.

52
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,350
We don't want music under it.

53
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,990
But when we do come back into this moment, when there's talking again, this is when we're going to

54
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,760
want to start our next track.

55
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,800
So let's take a listen without our track.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
And after putting any mandates.

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,510
Now let's get our track.

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,260
And let's put it right here where we're changing.

59
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,850
Our scene.

60
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,470
Turn it down to about negative 12, because that's really working well for this audio.

61
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,070
And after putting any band aids on for minor takes and scratches from that last montage, now it is

62
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,950
time for our initial test shots instead of AIDS.

63
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,959
So what you want to do is grab your most important equipment.

64
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:25,200
Mine's going to be my light and I need lighting source the camera at my desk in my chair, and I'm going

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,010
to kind of move things around in my studio to find out what's going to be the best location in the backdrop

66
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,000
so you can continue to move things around, wave your hands and do a little bit of a dance.

67
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,380
And after all the testing, just move things back to where you figure they were going to be in the first

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,770
place.

69
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,420
But now that we've done that, we have that lined up pretty dang well.

70
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:53,820
This part where the beat really came in matched up perfectly with a point where my audio kind of picked

71
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,900
up energy as well.

72
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,750
So so you can continue to move things around.

73
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,420
So I kind of picked up my tempo and you can kind of even see the increase in the volume that I went

74
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,780
up because I was saying something I was more excited about at this moment.

75
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,810
You can see him kind of lower and more quiet here.

76
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,510
I speak up louder here because I'm more excited.

77
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,940
And that matched up perfectly with this beat that came in.

78
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,390
So I'm super happy with that.

79
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,930
Now I'm going to go in and add the remainder of the tracks to this edit, and then we're going to get

80
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,280
into some more intermediate refining steps in the next lesson.
