1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:10,230
Let's go ahead and duplicate our top clip and let's take off our cross dissolve and let's zoom out here

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,680
and let's create a.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:23,340
Mask, so I'm going to hit the square and the mask under opacity to create a new masking layer.

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,140
And now we can actually scale this up.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,530
So if you can see here what this is doing is now we can do something interesting.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,930
So I'm going to turn off our crossfade and I'm going to only focus on what we're doing with the mask.

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,760
Now, if I turn up this feathering and what we have now is this overlay shot of where we're going to

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,060
transition to only appearing at this really cool part of the image, that actually makes a lot of sense

9
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,710
for this kind of thing.

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,830
So masks are really great for selectively adding certain elements in parts of your frame that you can

11
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:04,470
like frame things inside of doorways, inside of windows, inside of a coffee mug, whatever creates

12
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,489
a frame around it.

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,020
That's a good time to mask and use that natural part of the image that's already framed and create something

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,250
cool editing wise.

15
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,730
So let's go ahead and start to keyframe our expansion.

16
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,720
This is going to tell the editing software how much to spread out the mask that we already have.

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,510
So I'm going to hit it at zero at the very beginning and go here and go to, let's say, 100 percent.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,300
And then what that does is that kind of style of transition.

19
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,600
Now that's looking a little bit cheesy.

20
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,240
So let's go ahead and feather this out as much as we can.

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,610
OK.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,440
And let me adjust some of where our mask starts.

23
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,870
This way, the feather is just going to equally fill the entire frame and it doesn't have to be perfect,

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,880
but let's go ahead and fix that.

25
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,380
Turn this down.

26
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,040
And let's go ahead and add a fadin.

27
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,090
Now, because, like, for example, the sky disappears and it kind of creates a really big shift,

28
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,810
I think what we can do here is duplicate this mask layer.

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,460
Let's go ahead and delete this mask.

30
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,320
Let's turn off this layer below it real quick and let's try something.

31
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,440
So let's create a new mask and let's drag it to the top of our image now.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,510
I'm going to scale this down so I can, you know, move this mask around properly.

33
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,000
And let's go ahead and take off this cross dissolve.

34
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,980
So now what you can see is we have just the top of our nighttime image.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,810
I'm going to feather this out just a bit.

36
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,250
Bring this mask down.

37
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,400
And now that doesn't look so good, but there's something we're going to do here.

38
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,050
Let's go ahead and create some keyframes with our mask layer.

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,720
So I'm going to go to mask path.

40
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm going to go to the beginning.

41
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,850
I'm going to hit a key frame.

42
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,020
And I'm going to drag this all the way over here.

43
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,940
And let's create this a little bit bigger.

44
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,040
And let's go to where we want our edit to start coming into frame.

45
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,110
And let's go to about here.

46
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,340
And we know we're going to feather this, so we got to create a little bit of a bigger mask.

47
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,800
And so now what we have, is it all so it doesn't look so good right now, but this is going to create

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:50,180
a lot more depth by having two different parts of the frame transition into our image at slightly separate

49
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,780
times.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,750
OK.

51
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,490
Yeah, trust me, edge feathering is everything.

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,910
It makes such a big difference.

53
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,730
So, OK, let's just fix this and now drag this to the end.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,670
And we need to fix this.

55
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,700
OK, so it's not perfect.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,510
We don't want to obsess over the little bit of frames, but we just want the overall transition to look

57
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,930
cool.

58
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,970
OK.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,940
And now we can even feed this one in and turn on the layer below it.

60
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:47,210
So it could use a little bit of fine tuning, but it's still a lot more unique than just a simple crossfade.

61
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:55,760
Now, that's a great way to use masks in different parts of your image to overlay and bring in a shot

62
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,270
slowly and in a much more stylized way.
