1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,550
Moving forward here, we're now at the 54 second mark of our edit.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,540
We've already broke down a lot.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,790
We haven't even made it a minute into this edit yet.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:17,130
So we have at this portion, we have more of that really clean, simple version of a motion graphic

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,060
or not even emotion.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,860
This is just text with a simple fade and it looks clean.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,060
Now, what I did add is this background layer.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,540
I felt that it looked a little bit too bland without something in the background, because all of these

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,550
shots are really colored nicely.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,440
A lot of character.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,700
There's a lot of like brick and, you know, color in the background that we have.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,130
But when it just cut to this black screen here at the one minute mark, it didn't really work.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,290
Earlier in the edit, when we showed our overall video title card, it worked here.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,620
But at this portion of the video, I just felt that it needed a little something.

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,370
So what I do have is this clip that we shot.

16
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,930
And I brought down the opacity to 19 percent.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,760
So originally it was like this, which is clearly too much.

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,090
You can't see what's going on.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,200
It's too distracting.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,990
But when I brought it down to 90 percent.

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,690
It's a perfect balance.

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,910
You get a feel for what's going on in the background, your subconscious brain picks up, there's a

23
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,650
book page churning, OK, that's nice.

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,230
It's pretty, but it's not distracting you too much from the text that's on screen.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,330
That's actually more important to read.

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,350
Just like with the audio that we were talking about, you always have primary audio, audio and secondary

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,110
audio when they're speaking in your video.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,980
Talking is primary and music is secondary.

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,240
So speaking should be the loudest and most clear.

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,990
Audio should be a little bit quieter and a little bit less frontal.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,860
More background.

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,759
This is a similar kind of scenario, but we're taking that same principle and applying it for our visuals.

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:19,320
So we have the primary focus of this two second clip is for the viewer to read or at least absorb some

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,700
of these lines, because it's explaining the contents of the course that this video is a trailer for.

35
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,870
So we have the primary stuff and then we have the background secondary items item, actually, which

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,190
is this background image.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,970
And rather than turning down the sound like on a music track and vocals, we turn down the opacity.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,710
So something to really think about.

39
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,810
It's kind of a cool way of looking at that.

40
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,350
Now, as we move forward, we have now we have a cool looking motion graphic.

41
00:02:52,390 --> 00:03:00,240
So we have our background layer of normal footage, and then we have this motion graphic on top.

42
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,170
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,630
Literary analysis is analysis.

44
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,890
It's about, OK, so we got a few things going on here, we have this motion graphic that pops in.

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,690
There's actually two motion graphics.

46
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,120
That's why it's in a nested sequence.

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,080
So if I were to double click this, we have our top sequence and then we have our bottom sequence.

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,050
That's this like definition of literally literary analysis.

49
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,420
The top sequence is, you know, the words literary analysis.

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,720
And then we actually have a third aspect to this kind of custom moment here.

51
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,490
We have this red line that comes into the frame.

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,880
So this was simply this kind of emoji file.

53
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,720
And what I did to take it, from what it looks like over here to what it looks like in the final edit

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,090
is I'm going to select it.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,790
I'm going to go up to our effects controls.

56
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,490
And you can see I change the uniform scale.

57
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,810
I put the width of this item all the way down to 15 and put that heighth of this item up to 245.

58
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,590
So if I were to undo the uniform scale and it would keep the scale of the width and height the exact

59
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,100
same.

60
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,990
This is what it would look like.

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,490
It's not ideal.

62
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,510
Originally, the line was too wide, but I really wanted to use it because it had the right amount of

63
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,290
movement and it was perfect for the edit.

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,430
So that was the very first thing I did was I changed.

65
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,680
That was the original right there.

66
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,650
Actually, when we change this, this is the original.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,910
So I change the motion by using uniform scale that change the kind of aspect and made it more of a squished

68
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,970
longer line.

69
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,710
And then I also added a mask layer to this.

70
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,900
I felt like it was a little bit too wide like this.

71
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,600
So just slightly I added this mask that basically just cuts off wherever I want it to.

72
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,480
We talked about that earlier in the chorus, but I just added a little bit just because, like I mentioned,

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,820
this was just a little bit too wide for my taste.

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,130
The next thing I did was I went to my effects and then I added what's called a ramp.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,770
Now, this really just allowed for me to change the color of this overlay from white to literally any

76
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,960
color that I want to.

77
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,020
So it's a totally different vibe.

78
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:42,300
So, you know, you can go in and with something like a ramp, you can really move where the color is

79
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,830
affecting your overlay pretty easily by just switching a few parameters around.

80
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,230
But let's go ahead and undo that.

81
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,640
The reason I chose the white and red, because I felt that that matched the vibe of this edit the most,

82
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:03,300
is kind of a cool teacher on a white board or on a chalkboard kind of feeling.

83
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:11,730
So we have the red line, we have the main letters, and then we have the definition of the letters

84
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,300
as well.
