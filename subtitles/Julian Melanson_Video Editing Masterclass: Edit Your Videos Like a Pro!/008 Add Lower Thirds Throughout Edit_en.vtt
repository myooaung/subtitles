00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:08.189
Now I'm going to quickly go through and take the rest of the information that I want to be overlaid

2
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.660
in our edit at these different points where I have these placeholders and I'm going to apply the same

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.630
graphic style and animation to these title cards.

4
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.660
So I'm going to my notes tab.

5
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.950
I'm copying it going here, hitting paste.

6
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:48.070
I'm going to change the thickness of the font again so that there's a little bit of a variance and a

7
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.350
little bit of a different weight to this.

8
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.370
Different fonts.

9
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.440
And let's go to the next one.

10
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.220
I'm going to copy the filter that we like.

11
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.930
I'm going to go in.

12
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.480
I'm going to turn this to the light font type.

13
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.760
And I'm going to turn on the stroke.

14
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.430
Put this in to five bedrooms, six bathrooms.

15
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.720
It's a lot of bedrooms.

16
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.840
OK.

17
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.190
And our final one with this nice, huge pool.

18
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.140
I really want to swim in that.

19
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.090
OK.

20
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.680
Boom.

21
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.970
And stroke two.

22
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.780
Oh, OK.

23
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.449
OK, great.

24
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.520
So these are looking really good, and in the next video lesson, I'm going to go over how to create

25
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.890
an even more upgraded motion graphic for the end of this specific project.

26
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.030
So in this video lesson coming up, we're going to actually be diving into this process in After Effects.

27
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.230
And I will see you there.
