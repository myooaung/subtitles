1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,040
As I've been going through and pulling Selex on our sequence here for this YouTube video, I got to

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,240
a point in the shoot where I do the kind of intro hook statement that starts the whole YouTube video.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:21,000
And I want to show you in real time how you can go through and really decide on which states to use

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,280
and kind of chop up those takes, because on something like a YouTube video or any video where you're

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,700
talking to the camera, it's very likely that when you're trying to deliver a line to camera, that

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,740
you mess up, try again, mess up, try again.

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,190
Sometimes there's a good part from the first take and the second half.

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,990
You want to use parts in the second take.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,460
So we're going to dive into that right now and see what we can do.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,580
So here we have the beginning shot, which is a wide shot where I take the pelican case in the center

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,530
of the room and I set it down.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,730
OK.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,510
And then I move in and shoot a close up of that same exact movement.

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:12,050
Oh, I know this doesn't look like much now, but in a few days, this is going to be my brand new film

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,610
recording space.

16
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,420
So that's one take.

17
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:24,740
So let's go ahead and label these a specific color so that they stand out from the rest of our sequence.

18
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,940
So I'm going to go with Rose and then let's go and skip forward.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,790
Not going to be using any of this.

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm reading the waveforms, a.k.a. looking down at my audio here to find out where to bring the player

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,260
head next, which is right here before I deliver another option of that same exact take.

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,590
So in this video, I'm going to walk you.

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,470
So in this video, I'm going to walk you.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,790
So in this video, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,690
Now we can see I restart my line here.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,090
I restart again here and I restart again here.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,690
Now, what I'm going to do is go to where there's no space so we can get a clean cut right here.

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,340
We don't need those first mess ups.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,229
So I'm going to create a cut in play.

30
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:18,050
So in this video, I'm going to walk you through this step by step steps that I went through to take

31
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,980
this studio space from this to this.

32
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,780
OK, that might not make sense.

33
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,720
Now what I'm saying.

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,740
But in the final edit, you understand why I'm saying this line anyways.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,370
What I also heard in that tape was there's a little beginning noise that we don't need.

36
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,330
That's something you always want to keep in mind, especially when you're cutting dialogue together.

37
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,210
The exit.

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,090
Mm hmm.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,580
All that stuff.

40
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,360
You can take it out because you just it adds no value to the viewer.

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,830
So in this video.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,120
So I find this so in the moment.

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,610
So in this right there.

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,400
So in this week and sometimes.

45
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,280
Let's see if I even cut one later.

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:16,340
So we missed this problem you run into sometimes we have a noise that the subject makes before the actual

47
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,950
line that we want to cut into now.

48
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:26,630
So there's a little kiss before the first word that I speak as I'm clearing my throat or whatever I

49
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,170
was doing.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,120
And if I want to do a frame later to cut into, I'm then cutting into.

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:39,530
So when this the first kind of syllable or hit of that first word, the way around that is to bring

52
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,660
down by creating a key frame.

53
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,820
I hit P to bring up the pen tool, and then I create a little bit of a fade in.

54
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:55,700
So in this, that creates a lot more of a clean beginning of my sentence, because when we speak, most

55
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,140
of the time, we're blending words together in our sentence.

56
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,410
Like when I say this, it goes into that.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,980
It goes into that.

58
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,580
It goes into that.

59
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,850
And if I try to create a clean cut, sometimes the end of that word is at the beginning of this word.

60
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,450
And so you'll be able to really clean up those kind of things by creating fade ins and fade outs like

61
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,170
we've done previously, but that we haven't done yet to vocals.

62
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,500
But it's an excellent, excellent tool to create those clean cut.

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,550
So we know that these were my two mistakes.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,130
I read the audio waveform to get to the tape that we wanted.

65
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,810
Now we're going to delete this excess and let's scrub through right here.

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,540
Well, let's get into it.

67
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,570
OK.

68
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,830
This is the beginning of a second take for the whole sequence.

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,670
May it be OK?

70
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,830
You can see I tried to say the line, but I lost my train of thought, didn't know what I was going

71
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,160
to say.

72
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,940
So let's go ahead and skip ahead right to where before the sound is telling us where the take is going

73
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,570
to begin.

74
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,490
And I'm going to delete this mess up.

75
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,600
We're not going to use that.

76
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,790
Man, I know this doesn't look like much.

77
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:16,290
I know it doesn't sound like much, but in a few days I'm going to show you how I went from taking this

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,870
studio space like this.

79
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,740
And made it look like this.

80
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,900
OK, so when I snap in the footage and the actual edit happens, I'm going to show cutaways of the before

81
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,630
studio that to the after studio boom, which we have footage of that we haven't gone through yet.

82
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:45,430
And if I read this waveform here and if I look at this waveform here, it looks like all of these are

83
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,850
me delivering this ending phrase and made it look like this.

84
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,150
So it looks like we're going to have a lot of options to work with.

85
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm going to go ahead and delete these empty spaces.

86
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,780
This is going to allow for us to be able to play back to back these multiple takes in, easily choose

87
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,640
the best one who.

88
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Oh, perfect.

89
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,170
And so what we just did is we pulled the Selex on our very first shot.

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,870
We have two different takes to choose from.

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:31,430
Oh, I know this doesn't look like much now, but in a few days, this is going to be my brand new film

92
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,990
recording space.

93
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,970
Man, I know this doesn't look like much.

94
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,350
I know it doesn't sound like much, but in a few days I'm going to show you how I went from taking this

95
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,800
studio space like this and made it look like this.

96
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,450
OK, so I see something that you may run into when you're doing videos similar to this.

97
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,650
There's a line here that I see that it straight up doesn't make sense.

98
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,920
I say in the next few days sound like much, but in a few days, in a few days, I'm going to show you.

99
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,570
And that's not what I was trying to say.

100
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:19,160
So I have another take that I do say the proper line, and I want to use this as an example to see how

101
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,960
we can splice two different takes together seamlessly so that we get the right information that we're

102
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,220
trying to convey to our viewer.

103
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,800
So in this video, I'm going to walk you.

104
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,910
So I want to start at this.

105
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,840
So in this video, I want to start that clip there and I want to end this video before I say in the

106
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,100
next few days, I.

107
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,430
I know it doesn't sound like much, but in a few days, I'm going to show you how I went from tape.

108
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,300
But so I'm going to try to cut it after I say.

109
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,710
But we'll see how that works.

110
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,360
So I make a cut there and I'm going to drag this in bold command.

111
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:02,120
OK, budg but so in this video, I'm sound like much, but I know it doesn't sound like much.

112
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,210
So in this video, I'm going to walk you through.

113
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,510
OK, so let's say we were happy with that, right?

114
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,150
That we were happy with the splicing that we made.

115
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,170
If you wanted to get rid of this jumpcut, much so in this video, let's say we were really happy with

116
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,630
the audio.

117
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,010
We didn't have to fine tune it.

118
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,760
I would find to it a little bit more, maybe add a little bit of a fade to this clip much.

119
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:37,549
So in this video, and we can even drop this on a lower layer and push them together so that we don't

120
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:43,330
have any empty space and see if that helps the line to flow a little bit more cleanly like much.

121
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,550
So in this video, I much I know it doesn't sound like much.

122
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,680
So in this video.

123
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,560
OK, so that's clean enough audibly for now.

124
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,080
But let's see.

125
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:59,600
We want to do something like I was saying about this jumpcut an easy way to get around that if you don't

126
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,700
have two angles that you're working with.

127
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,820
See, this would be a perfect time to switch to a different angle for this situation.

128
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,980
I don't have that.

129
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,740
But what we can do is select our clip that we're cutting into.

130
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,660
Go up to the effects tab.

131
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,710
And we can increase the scale of our clip.

132
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,420
Let's say we increase it 20 points now because I increase the scale.

133
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,310
It's cutting off the top of my head.

134
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,480
We don't want that.

135
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,780
So we're going to push it down a little bit and we can center.

136
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:37,730
Now, we have more of the frame to move around because we scaled it up beyond the borders of our actual

137
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,630
frame size.

138
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,580
And now let's see what that looks like.

139
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,360
Man, I know this doesn't look like much.

140
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,170
I know it doesn't sound like much.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,630
So in this video I'm going to walk you use.

142
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,700
So that cuts together a lot better.

143
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,830
I know that the like the cutting between these words in this sentence isn't the cleanest example, but

144
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,160
it's more about how to splice two different takes together.

145
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,160
And if you don't have multiple cameras to work with, how do you fix something that would be a distracting

146
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,670
jumpcut?

147
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,450
An easy fix for that is to scale up the image like much.

148
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,980
So in this video, without that scale up, if we go and remove what we just did, here's what it looks

149
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,430
like and don't like much.

150
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,870
So in this video, I'm not very good.

151
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,010
And then with our scale down like much.

152
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,830
So in this video, I'm going to weigh cleaner.
