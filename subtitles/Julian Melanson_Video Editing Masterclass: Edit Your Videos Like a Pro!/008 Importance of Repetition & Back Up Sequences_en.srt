1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,980
This is a slow motion shot.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,300
I don't feel like that's going to fit in the edit that we're doing here.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,760
That's something to keep in mind when you're doing your edit.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,040
Is it a bunch of normal real time footage that's not slow motion?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,880
And then all of a sudden we have this, you know, footage is shot at 240 frames a second when the rest

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,850
of our footage is thought, it shot at 30 frames a second.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,660
If you do something once randomly in an edit, then it's just random out of the blue if you do something

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,230
twice.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,150
Then there is like a theme going on that makes it very likely to happen a third time.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,770
So that's something to think about, is that things generally do better in pairs or triplets.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,990
If you're going to do some type of stylistic choice or slow motion footage, don't have one slow motion

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,410
clip in your footage.

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,060
It'll be like a random blip, OK, if you're going to do that.

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,270
Have two, three slow motion shots or the whole thing is slow motion.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:10,710
So this is a really cool shot, but the audio is not going to be usable.

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,930
So that's something that we're going to get into here in a minute.

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:22,140
And we kind of have our last shot here, which is all these little yogis here meditating in front of

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,670
the waterfall, which is kind of cool.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,480
So if I scrub through here, there's really no change in this clip.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,280
So even though this clip is about 30 seconds, because we're sitting still and there's no information

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,130
that's changing in the actual footage, what's being shown on screen.

22
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,500
Doesn't matter too much where we create our in and out point.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,470
But I will kind of look and see if there's anything cool.

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,480
The waterfall kind of does a cool splash here of kind of mist.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,470
So I'm going to create the endpoint there, actually.

26
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,210
Yeah, it happens there.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
This starts to be some of that mist that comes in.

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:09,610
So let's go ahead and make this blue and let's put this with the waterfalls.

29
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,440
And to recap, what we've done is we've captured all of our footage.

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,950
We've organized it on our computer laptop.

31
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,090
We've created a backup to keep everything safe, keep two copies of things.

32
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:29,380
And we've pulled our Selex, organize everything and labeled our clips in our timeline.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,470
This is the step where now?

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,090
We want to create a backup sequence.

35
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,500
All the work we just did.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
And there's a reason that we're going to be doing this.

37
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,520
And that reason is when we're going in this edit and we start moving things around and we start, you

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,290
know, trimming things down and deleting clips we think we're not going to use.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,170
Sometimes we don't make the right decision, which we think is the right decision at the time.

40
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,450
But then later on, we're like, oh, where's that one shot?

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,850
I know who's in there, and it's gone.

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,840
So over the years, I've really learned that creating a backup of your Selex is going to save you a

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
lot of time down the road.

44
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,860
So this is kind of a little extra protip here.

45
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:25,310
We're going to click our main sequence in our project window, and we're going to hit command C or we

46
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,980
can go and right click it and copy.

47
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,440
And then we're going to paste, which is command V or right click and hit paste.

48
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:40,500
So now I have this backup sequence of the selects we pulled.

49
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,000
What I'm now going to do is label it what it is, which is main sequence backup.

50
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:48,960
OK.

51
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,920
And drag it and put it in the sequences folder.

52
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,000
So now I can always come back to this backup if needed.
