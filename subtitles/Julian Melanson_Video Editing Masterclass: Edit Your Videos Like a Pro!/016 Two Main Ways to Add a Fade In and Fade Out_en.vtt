00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.220
So now that those main important steps are done and as an editor, we want to do everything in our power,

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.240
use all the techniques that we have to further create a world for our viewers to go to when they're

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.530
experiencing our video.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.190
Now, there's a certain softness to this project in particular.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.480
There's a certain organic ness and naturalness that I want to really create at the beginning as our

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
video starts, almost like the beginning of a story and a nice gradual ending.

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
And one way to do that is to create a fade in and a fade out on a project.

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.160
I really don't use these very often, but for this project in particular, I think it's going to work

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.900
pretty well and just be a nice little subtle way to start the video and way to end the video.

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.170
So right now, our video starts like this.

11
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.780
But I think if we add just a subtle cross dissolve at the beginning, it's going to look pretty nice.

12
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.170
So there's two ways to do this.

13
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.980
We can select our clip, go to our effects panel and type in cross dissolve.

14
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.250
This is going to give us the cross dissolve transition that we can drag and drop to the beginning of

15
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.730
our clip.

16
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.190
And that kind of creates a nice little visual intro.

17
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.060
OK.

18
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.380
We miss her first note.

19
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.930
We don't really see her striking her first note.

20
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.430
So it's two things we can do.

21
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:40.200
We can either select and make this dissolve shorter or what we can do is look at our whole timeline.

22
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.600
And we can select all of the clips in our timeline by doing command A.

23
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:59.250
And then we can scoot our entire edit over and we can increase the beginning of this clip to make more

24
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.760
time for this new cross dissolve that we added to finish before the actual song starts.

25
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.870
Let's see what that looks like.

26
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.300
So now we have just a few extra frames that we added to compensate for the fade that's coming in here

27
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.150
and still get this first strike that she plays at this opening note right here.

28
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.440
Now, the second option we can do to add the crosses of is to first delete this transition that we dropped

29
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.720
on and bring up our pen tool.

30
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.230
Okay.

31
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.450
I'm going to hit P to bring up the pen tool and we're going to use this pen tool to manually go in.

32
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.150
And it's very similar to the way we use it to create the time remapping by speeding up and slowing down

33
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.830
our footage in our previous project.

34
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.030
But instead, we don't need to go down to show clip frames and change anything down here like we did

35
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.020
for time remapping.

36
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.950
It's always going to be displaying the opacity as a default.

37
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.200
So all of the clips in my timeline, this line on the clip is always going to be displaying the opacity

38
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.640
parameters.

39
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.100
So I'm going to bring up my pen tool.

40
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.770
I'm going to click where I want to cross, dissolve to end, and I'm going to click where I want it

41
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.370
to begin.

42
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.160
I'm going to hit V to bring up my normal arrow selection tool, and I'm going to drag that down.

43
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.950
And what that does is the same exact thing as this crosses all function.

44
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.980
But we're going to have a little bit more control by.

45
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.430
Right.

46
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.850
Clicking any of the points, clicking bezier.

47
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.810
Right.

48
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.070
Clicking the beginning point.

49
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.310
And we can use this lasso to change the angle and speed and trajectory, if you want to call it that,

50
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.740
of our crossfade.

51
00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:03.780
So, for example, we could start it really going very slow for a long time and then to finish, OK,

52
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.800
that's one style.

53
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.760
We can kind of extend this a little bit and smooth this out.

54
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.000
We don't want to create too drastic of a curve here, but I'm going to create a nice looking slope.

55
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.950
So there's a nice gradual introduction to the image.

56
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.410
OK.

57
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.670
And bring up the sound.

58
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.390
It's perfect.

59
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.780
So that's the second option that you can use, just to have even a little bit more control.

60
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.380
Now, to end the video, I want to do it the same way that we started.

61
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.170
So let's go to the end of our sequence.

62
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.190
And we have the final note of the performance, so just on that note, I'm going to create a key frame.

63
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.820
And at the end of our clip, I'm going to drag it down and I'm going to right click these key frames,

64
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.930
click bezier.

65
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.850
Kind of make a nice little curve so we've got something with a little bit of taste and class to it.

66
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.830
And let's see what it looks like.

67
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.750
So that matches up a lot more with our audio versus the original.

68
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.910
That just cuts to black, so that crosses all is perfect for this kind of scenario.
