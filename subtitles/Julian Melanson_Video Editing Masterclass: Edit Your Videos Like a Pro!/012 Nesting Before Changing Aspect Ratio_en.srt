1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,520
And I also want to mention the reason for scaling or no excuse me, the reason for nesting this sequence.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,540
Now, if I go back to, let's say, this sequence where we didn't nest it, but we have a new sequence

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,390
setting, everything is going to change independently.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,450
So we have our adjustment layer.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,670
We have our overlays.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,100
So everything gets scooted over.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,110
And because we were originally this big rectangle and we went to the square.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,690
We're missing the size of our image.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,360
And now everything is scooted over.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,470
So if we wanted to, let's say, move her, but then the overlays didn't move, so then we would have

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,320
to go in and move the overlays to.

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:55,230
And there can be a lot of different issues, and it just saves time to nest the sequence before adjusting

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,020
the overall sequence ratio.

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:06,060
Now, the same exact process is going to be for when you do, let's say, even a nine by 16, which

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,280
would be a post for tick tock or Instagram stories.

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,360
So let's do 10, 80 by 1920, about a boom.

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,590
And now we have that vertical phone aspect ratio.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,680
And of course, we can go in and with our nested sequence, scooch things around.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,160
And also scale it down so that it's filling the frame properly if it's scaled up.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,190
That means we're missing a lot of information on the sides and the top and bottom because we went from

21
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,200
horizontal to now vertical.

22
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,040
So you always want to make sure you scale it down so that the video is just barely filling the frame.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,360
So at one hundred percent, we were actually losing a lot of information or a lot of X external side

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,700
parts of the video on the side and top and bottom.

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,170
Now, we are having a lot more video in the frame.

26
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,790
And if we wanted to do that same thing over here, you know, we would have to scale this down.

27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,610
OK, now it's fitting perfectly.

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,300
And then the overlay is, OK, you got to scale these down, OK?

29
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,960
And this other overlay right here, boom.

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:30,710
So I wanted to share this, really create protip really great protip on a final process, especially

31
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:38,750
when you have a client asking for multiple exports with multiple different ratios.

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:46,100
So we have the versions that are ending with her main logo, ending with the now available logo at the

33
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,650
end, ending with all these different kind of edits.

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,460
And then we have the nine, but our 16 nine by 16 edits as well.

35
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:05,000
So this is a great way to do that as efficiently and easily as possible.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,360
I will see you now in the next video lesson.
