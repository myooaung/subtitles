00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.070
Now we have our Shoki.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.700
OK, so we have our showcase ending graphic that we just exported out of AfterEffects, and now we're

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.450
going to drag it in, pull it into our editing software.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.150
And we're going to go to the end of our video and we're going to drag it in our timeline.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.920
And here we go.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.620
Let's check it out.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.790
OK, great.

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.290
So it just needs a little bit of a fade in and fade out, but I love it.

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.370
Now, the other thing with some of these templates is sometimes, you know, you don't want to use all

10
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.490
of it just because you explored the whole template.

11
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.720
Doesn't mean you need to use all of the beginning of it or all of the end of it.

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.870
I'm not a huge fan of all of this, like flippy lion spinning around stuff.

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.260
I'm OK with this second one.

14
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.820
But this first one, it doesn't really do a whole lot for me.

15
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.290
So personally, I'm going to start the fade in during the second lion flippy thing.

16
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.560
And I want to make it all the way faded in before just before this text comes in.

17
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.750
So I'm going to do the fade in and let's just see how that looks.

18
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:33.280
OK, so first off, we can extend this outro so we're not cutting off the music and I think this fading.

19
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.750
Let's see it.

20
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:46.500
Let's actually put our lie in below our footage so that it comes from underneath.

21
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.670
Yeah.

22
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.100
OK.

23
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.960
OK, now let's do a simple fade out, it's already got a really nice blur to it, so the image already

24
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.990
kind of does the blur, which is perfect because that matches the styling of the rest of our graphics.

25
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.000
OK.

26
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.940
Cool, let's watch that back one more time.

27
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.530
Perfect.

28
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.330
So I'm loving that.

29
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.560
Now, if we weren't happy with I love the amount of detail that this has, so I personally feel like

30
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.370
it needs anything.

31
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.560
But, you know, if we wanted to, let's say, change a little bit, you know, you can add a color

32
00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.220
correction, layer a sharpening layer, whatever you want to motion graphics just the same exact way

33
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.930
as you can do it to footage.

34
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.240
So if I wanted to tan it up, if I wanted to make it more blue, if I wanted to bring up the highlights

35
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.570
more, if I wanted to make it more contrasted, if I wanted to add a vignette on the outside of the

36
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.020
image.

37
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.710
Right.

38
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.260
You can do all the things that you would normally do to other footage, to your title cards.

39
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.920
I could sharpen it up to create a little bit more of a crispiness.

40
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.900
I could add a faded look to it.

41
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.440
So it looked more of like a vintage kind of logo.

42
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.170
By bringing out the grays in the image.

43
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.980
So there it's kind of softer, more old fashioned looking.

44
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.000
I don't think it matches for this specific style, but there's a lot of options.

45
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.920
You can do is a lot of different things you can do.

46
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.560
Now, one last filter that we can also add is we can invert any text that you're using.

47
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.390
For example, let's say we weren't happy with the white font.

48
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.790
We could easily go to our effect's tab.

49
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.890
Go to invert and drag that onto our text.

50
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.750
That's going to invert any color.

51
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.210
So it's going to make white, black.

52
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.320
It's going to make black, white.

53
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.130
It'll make red, blue.

54
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.640
So if I dropped it onto an actual piece of footage, you see all the dark parts of the image are now

55
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.030
white.

56
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.770
All the tan parts of the image are now a bluish kind of as a cool ghost look.

57
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.600
But that's how we're going for here.

58
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.210
But for example, this is a lot of a white background with a little bit of dark text and a logo.

59
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.350
If I drop this on, it's going to make a black background with white text and a white logo, which kind

60
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.370
of matches with the white text in the rest of the project.

61
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.940
Right.

62
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.950
So if I go and hit play.

63
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.400
It

64
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.400
doesn't look super professional for this kind of project, but I have definitely use that in the past

65
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.850
and it's worked really well for specific types of text and overlays.

66
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.610
So that's just a little bit of a protip man.

67
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.300
We got lost on our pro tips.

68
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.220
Put up the protip right now.

69
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.970
OK, great, so yeah, that's one of the last pro tips that I want to share with you.

70
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.400
For using one of these motion graphics.

71
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.650
So just in about 20 minutes together, we created this super professional, high end looking motion

72
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.220
graphic.
