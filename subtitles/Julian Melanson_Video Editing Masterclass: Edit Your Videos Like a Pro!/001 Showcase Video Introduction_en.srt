00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:18,420
Welcome back to a brand new chapter now, I hope you learned a lot and had a good time doing the promo

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,050
chapter of this course, and we're continuing to get more into the refining and more of the subtleties

3
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,890
and more of the professional side of video editing.

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,160
So in this chapter, what we're going to be doing now is we're going to be doing more of a professional

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,620
style.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,740
We're not going to do all the flashy swooshed transitions and that stuff, but we're going to get more

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:49,950
into what it takes to create a much more seamless, clean and professional video for you in the future

8
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,080
when you might be doing client work, you might be doing a video for a product, and you don't want

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,140
to have all of the stuff.

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:07,080
You want to make a much more classy and a much more grounded and well-rounded overall video that has

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,270
a much more professional feeling.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,460
So let's get into it.

13
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,850
So in this chapter, you're going to follow along with me.

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,910
And you can either edit past footage that you already have or you can download the footage, which is

15
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,200
going to be a high end real estate walkthrough.

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,050
This is like a 10 or 20 million dollar property.

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,690
So I'm really excited to edit this along with you.

18
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,480
And I want you to gather either your own footage that resembles kind of something similar.

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,010
It doesn't have to be real estate.

20
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,200
It doesn't have to be house, doesn't have to be more of a destination, location, travel style.

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,870
It can be really good roll that you may already have of a product or an object or something.

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,550
So if you have that footage.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,390
Awesome.

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,920
If you don't have that footage, download the assets in the folder that I provided.

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,930
And you can go ahead and start by creating your initial rough edit.

26
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,570
Just like in the last lecture.

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,670
I'm not going to be going through those beginning processes, processes that we've already completed

28
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,150
together in previous chapters, in many previous chapters.

29
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,430
I'm going to walk right into going from right where I already have all the selects pulled out, already

30
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,490
organized everything.

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,520
So if you have questions about that process, you can go to the previous chapters.

32
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,040
I believe chapters two through four, two, three and four, possibly even five, they'll quote me on

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,280
that.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,360
But we already go through the organization categorizing process.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,700
So we're going to go over in this chapter shot arrangement, editing down our music, doing some custom

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:52,890
transitions, working with some, working with split screens, coloring and refining our footage to

37
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,100
get that professional looking polish.

38
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,520
At the end of the chapter, you can export and share the video that you created alongside with me in

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,330
the student Q&A and get feedback from myself and other students.

40
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,920
And like I mentioned, these are techniques that you'll be able to use for any kind of showcase video.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,120
It doesn't have to be real estate with a big mansion.

42
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,830
It can be a product video for, you know, your friends coffee brand.

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,000
You know, it can be a product video for an app if you have good bureau footage.

44
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,720
All these techniques will work for that.

45
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,250
But we're going to just dive into the professional side of how to upgrade goodlooking b roll and make

46
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,600
it look just that much better.

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,550
So I will see you in the next video lesson where we will dive into these new techniques.
