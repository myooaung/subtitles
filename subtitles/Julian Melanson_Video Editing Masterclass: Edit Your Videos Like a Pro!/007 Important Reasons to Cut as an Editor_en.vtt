00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.510
And so I want you to continue with me going through and pulling Selex on the rest of your video footage.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.500
OK, so I have this clip here where I'm kind of walking pan until up to the sun and I'm not super into

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.980
that shot.

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.700
So I'm going to go ahead and delete.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.630
I'm going to repl delete here as well to empty, to get rid of the extra space here.

6
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.200
That's kind of a cool shot.

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.140
So I'm going to keep this one and I'm going to cut it right about there because we don't need to really

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.040
see this whole Stehr stone floor.

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.540
But I'm going to cut here.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.870
OK.

11
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.510
And then I'm going to cut there, actually, so this is a good example of the other reasons to cut as

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.900
an editor.

13
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.880
So we have our shot here.

14
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.660
Everything looks great.

15
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.350
And right there.

16
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.360
So if I go back.

17
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.090
You can see that the camera.

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.330
Yeah, you see that the camera is trying to pull focus on my phone, so we don't want that.

19
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.080
We don't need that.

20
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.090
So that's a perfect, obvious reason, a less subtle reason, a very direct reason to cut.

21
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.420
So right before that happens, I'm going to go ahead and.

22
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.050
Got that?

23
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.280
And by the way, in premiere, this little squiggly line, I don't know, it's called let me put it

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.240
up on screen right now.

25
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.940
Wherever your cursor is hovering on screen, if your cursor is over here on the the viewer window,

26
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.750
if I hit the tab, it's going a squiggly line, whatever it's called.

27
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.790
It's going to expand if it's here.

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.930
It's going to expand.

29
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.160
OK, same thing for there.

30
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.530
So when you just want to see your program window, which is like where your final edit looks like,

31
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.350
you know, it's a perfect way to use it.

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.750
So we're on to our next shot here.

33
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.110
And this is great.

34
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.200
I'm going to cut out the beginning from the script forward here.

35
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.280
OK.

36
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.740
So the shot can either end right here and I can add a cut right there.

37
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.930
Or it can continue and then you kind of see more of the nature.

38
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.680
So that's a good example of two different options.

39
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.690
The shorter shot, so this shot starts at 33 seconds and then the main one ends at forty one.

40
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.310
So that's if I do simple math here, that's eight seconds.

41
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.940
That's already plenty long for one shot.

42
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.570
So even though this next shot has some nice nature in the background, I'm not going to use that.

43
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.140
OK.

44
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.110
But what I will do is that now we have these two selected and cut, trim down, and they're from the

45
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.920
same location.

46
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.580
I'm going to highlight both.

47
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.500
I'm going to right click and I'm going to label these.

48
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.850
Choose your favorite color.

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.010
This all this stuff kind of has a yellowish vibe to me, a yellowish orange vibe.

50
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.140
So some footage feels really bright.

51
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.780
I choose more of a yellowish tone for labeling.

52
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.520
Some footage is like nighttime.

53
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.860
I choose more of a bluish tone for labeling.

54
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.850
So this is like a lake, you know, that can be used to create that.

55
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.670
So as you're skimming across your time, learning, looking for the shots, you want to use, boom.

56
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.770
The color is key.

57
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.400
Trust me.

58
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.300
So moving forward now, we have this waterfall here, and I believe there's three different shots of

59
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.690
this.

60
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.490
So let's let this play through.

61
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.570
We have shot one.

62
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.560
This is shot number two.

63
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.370
And this is the third shot.

64
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.290
OK, cool.

65
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.190
So there's a few different practical ways to choose which shot to use if you have three or four options,

66
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.880
whatever it is.

67
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.190
We have this one that's very cool kind of povi of a person in nature.

68
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.920
It gives it a little bit more context when we just have waterfall or something that we're shooting.

69
00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.160
Sometimes it's hard to feel scale.

70
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.980
Sometimes it's hard to feel how like awe inspiring a location can be with what we're shooting without

71
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.020
some type of reference, without having a person in it or something else in it that gives the brain

72
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.380
something to be like, OK, --, that's a really cool place.

73
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.460
That is one reason to go with to choose your shot.

74
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.350
Another reason is like what's going on in your shot?

75
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.570
We have the same waterfall here at different angles and at different times of day.

76
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.460
So here, waterfalls in the distance, it's not super impactful.

77
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.860
We see the stream.

78
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.000
I know this is kind of like funny to be talking about waterfalls and streams, but it goes across all

79
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.950
editing decisions and choices, choices regardless of the footage you're using.

80
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.710
So waterfalls in the background, it's kind of cool.

81
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.710
And waterfall is a little bit more zoomed in here.

82
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.550
So we have more of a close up shot.

83
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.250
We have a wide shot, and then we have kind of this povi shot.

84
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.580
Right.

85
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.700
We also see that as getting back to what I was originally saying, different times of day, different

86
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.650
lighting and different shot types.

87
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.790
Now, this time of day with this lighting obviously stands out so much more.

88
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:39.620
The gold and stuff that's going on like where I was when I was shooting, this is so much more interesting,

89
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.260
impactful, tells more of a story and gives more information to the viewer than these other two shots.

90
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.900
So, boom, all those different questions you're asking yourself are going to be pointing you towards

91
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.660
which shot to go with when you're sitting here with all of this raw footage.

92
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.060
Right.

93
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.170
So let's delete one of these.

94
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.160
I'm definitely not going to use the second one.

95
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.660
I really like this one.

96
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm sure this is going to be the go to.

97
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:12.260
I'm going to move this in front of the other one and I'm going to color code these let's just say Teale.

98
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.510
OK, now we have this empty space and I'm going to remove by doing a triple delete.

99
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.040
We have a new location.

100
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.080
So I would say that we can kind of trim off some of the excess stuff here.

101
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.420
Kind of step in, which is cool.

102
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.040
OK.

103
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.580
And this is another scenario when you can ask yourself, is the whole cliff really needed?

104
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.440
This clip is starting at 54 seconds and ending at one six math.

105
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.650
That's 12 seconds.

106
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.380
OK, we're probably not going to use 12 seconds of this clip.

107
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:52.980
So here's another opportunity with footage that you're editing to have the long form, OK?

108
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.180
I might use that whole thing or just simply trim out where the shot is likely to end.

109
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:08.780
To me, we're tilting up, seeing the water, seeing the view, and we can cut there versus starting

110
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.520
kind of a brand new shot where now you're looking at a different scenery, even though it's the same

111
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.400
shot, you're starting a second shot, which we don't need.
