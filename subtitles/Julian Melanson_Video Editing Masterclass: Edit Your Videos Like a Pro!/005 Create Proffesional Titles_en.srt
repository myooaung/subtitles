1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,840
So we have already looking pretty good, as usual.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,390
And what I want to go into now is effectively using title cards.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,379
So this is a great opportunity in any kind of showcase video you're doing to have text on screen that

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,140
explains something further.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,720
So what I basically want to do is a title card at the intro.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,380
And then there's a few moments where we can explain further what's on screen.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:36,240
But the information's not there, like about how many bedrooms this property has or about how many square

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,060
footage or how many square feet the property is.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,210
So if you're doing the same kind of video, it's a product you can say things like it's a hard drive

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:54,330
and it's five terabytes and the data speed is this much and it's built to withstand a five foot drop

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,920
and so on.

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,510
So this can be used for any kind of video.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,130
But let's go to the beginning and let's kind of create an intro title.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:09,350
So I'm going to hit T for the text tool and I'm going to say welcome to the.

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,470
And just going to make of a name here, Hillcrest.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,400
Residents.

17
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,200
No, OK, Hillcrest property.

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,080
Sounds nice.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,910
OK, Hillcrest property.

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm going to go over here.

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm going to center it.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,190
And then I'm going to scale it up a bit.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,360
Actually, it was scaled back a bit and a good way to create.

24
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,550
Let me actually turn down the opacity of this, OK, to make the text kind of stand out a little bit.

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:48,130
A good way to create a more of a professional text when you have things on two lines is to vary the

26
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,810
amount of thickness.

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,450
You want to use the same font family.

28
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,780
You don't want to have multiple font families, at least in a professional type video.

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,750
If it's more like a kid's video or something that's supposed to be kind of the young, playful feeling.

30
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,510
You can have multiple font families, but for a professional video for a client, you want to have one

31
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,930
font family for basically the whole video and to get it to look cool if it's on multiple lines.

32
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,110
You can vary the width of that font.

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,360
So personally, this is a little bit too light.

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,650
All I have is the light sembled and extra bold for the specific font.

35
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:31,540
But what we can do is increase the stroke of the font, and the stroke is simply going to be the amount

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,580
of thickness that you're adding.

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,870
To the text.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:46,090
So if we go to maybe add to of the stroke, then we could start to see how this is starting to look

39
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,070
a bit more professional and pop versus just looking like that.

40
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,560
So we got the font looking good.

41
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,010
We can even probably scale this down a little bit.

42
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,680
And that's the other thing that you can do is you can vary the size of the fonts.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,500
So the welcome to is kind of secondary.

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,100
And then the primary focus of this specific title is the title or the name of the property.

45
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,880
So we scaled down the top row and we bring down the thickness of the font.

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,980
That way, we're creating a little bit more of a unique looking title card.

47
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,710
So let's go ahead and drag this out all over the front clip.

48
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,610
And what I've found, too, and we're going to create a little bit of space between these two.

49
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,760
So there's these different parameters.

50
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,980
This is the space between the letters.

51
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,800
This is the space between the letters.

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,730
But vertically.

53
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,370
And then this is the space, but with both of the lines changing.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,290
So we can create a little bit more space vertically and.

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:08,980
I've definitely found that adding kind of a very minimal small line with the same color as our phone

56
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,710
when it dropped this on, this is just a full solid, but I found a little bit of a hack a few years

57
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,029
ago.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,120
If we take off the uniform scale and we scaled down the heighth.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,850
We can then create this.

60
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:30,560
Really, if we put this like point five, this tiny line where it can either go across the whole screen.

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,460
But, you know, ideally we're creating something like that.

62
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:41,660
And we can put it between both of our lines or on the bottom of both lines is really a lot you can play

63
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:41,990
with.

64
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:49,010
But this is kind of a unique thing where that's starting to look a lot more produced.

65
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:57,020
And a cool thing about this kind of uniform scale or taking off the uniform scale is that we can actually

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,870
keyframe our width.

67
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,910
So I'm going to go to the end of an add of keyframe.

68
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,900
I'm going to go to the beginning and I want to make it go down.

69
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm going to take the width and shrink the width.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,460
And so if we play forward now, we have this nice growing of this line.

71
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,900
So we're adding a little bit of motion there to this graphic.

72
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,770
And next, what we would definitely want to do is add a fade in that's going to also help with making

73
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,600
it just look a little bit more professional.

74
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,930
OK.

75
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,990
And if we want, we can also vary the fade in so that the property comes in first and then the line

76
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,500
comes in.

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,850
Or we could do it the opposite way.

78
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,420
But for now, let's just have the line come in a little bit after.

79
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,610
And another thing that we can do, just add a little bit more, is to scale up our text.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,550
OK, so I'm going to go to the end of this text.

81
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,430
I'm going to go to.

82
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,640
Scale, I'm going to hit keyframe.

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,060
Go to the beginning, scale it down a few points, I'd say ninety.

84
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,650
Hit play.

85
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,610
So we can see it's moving forward.

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,060
It's a little bit slow so you can actually scale it up a little bit more, let's go to 105.

87
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,090
And now we have our text moving forward.

88
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,170
It's moving with the cool line that we created that we just kind of whipped up there.

89
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:57,250
And now we can also add a fadeout, because this just cutting to straight, just disappearing, it's

90
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,110
not very elegant.

91
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,380
So let's extend our texts and let's extend our keyframes, because right now the keyframes is just going

92
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:05,920
to stop.

93
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,830
So if we extend the key frames, the animations that we created are going to continue and then we can

94
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,030
create fade out.

95
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm hitting the P for pen tool.

96
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,860
There we go.

97
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,030
OK.

98
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,200
So just like that, we just whipped up a nice little intro, Grafik.

99
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,340
If I wanted to add a little bit more, let's say that this wasn't doing it for me and I wanted a little

100
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,690
bit more of the uniqueness, I can go in and add filters to the text.

101
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,570
So let's say I want to go in here and add a fast blur.

102
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,330
Now, what this is going to do is it's just going to act like as if you had your camera out of focus.

103
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:05,320
It's going to take the fight and blur it so we can animate this property as well.

104
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,410
So I'm going to hit the stopwatch to create a keyframe.

105
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,970
I mean, go to the beginning of the clip and I'm going to bring this up to, let's say, 90.

106
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,860
That way, when it fades in, it also blurs in.

107
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,470
Let's do that same exact process.

108
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,100
Let's do that same exact process as we fade out.

109
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,440
And let's see what we got.

110
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,539
OK.

111
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,799
Looking pretty good.

112
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:45,180
Let's copy this blurring effect that we just did and let's add it to our line that we created.

113
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,680
OK.

114
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,130
Looking pretty good, so I'm pretty happy with that.

115
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,650
That's a quick way to make a much more professional looking title card.

116
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,990
What we started with was this.

117
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,140
Pretty average, you see that in some videos.

118
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,950
But, you know, the key is really to just create some animations, to create some variance in the text

119
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:33,440
size and the text with or the stroke of the text, and to have, you know, a fade in, a fade out,

120
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:40,070
a blur, a little bit of motion and a little bit of animation that just takes that plain text on screen

121
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,940
and has a little bit more character and personality.
