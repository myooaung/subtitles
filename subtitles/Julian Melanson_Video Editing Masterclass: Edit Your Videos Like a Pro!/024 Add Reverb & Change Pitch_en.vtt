00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.010
Awesome, so let's play our intro, our video.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.640
And we're going to find this moment, actually two moments where we're going to use reverb and possibly

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.620
a little bit of changing pitch of some of our audio to create a cool effect.

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130
It's made.

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.310
I know this doesn't look like much, I know it doesn't sound like much, but I'm going to show you how

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.170
I went from taking this studio space like this and made it look like this.

7
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.130
Yep, I got a lot of work to do.

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.280
And booms, and then it'll go into probably we'll put our first music track right here because it's

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.300
when we're actually starting the video.

10
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:58.050
But what I want to do here is kind of amp up these two snaps that and this and the coolest, best way

11
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.630
to do that.

12
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.830
So what we're going to do is kind of isolate these together.

13
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.300
So I'm going to cut in front of the snap from both of them.

14
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.980
And let's actually move this down, because what we're going to do is add some reverb.

15
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.510
So if I add reverb and the clip stops here, suddenly the reverb is going to drop out.

16
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.680
So I want to extend these as much as possible.

17
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:32.790
And what I'm going to do is because I'm putting a volume down to key frames on this clip.

18
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.800
If I add reverb, it's suddenly going to drop out here.

19
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.640
So the way around that which we visited earlier in the course is to nest the sequence on the second

20
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.890
clip.

21
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.160
I don't really need to, because we have the sound at the very beginning that we want to add reverb

22
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.580
to.

23
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.030
And for simplicity sake, I'm just going to do the same thing to this clip by the boom.

24
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.910
And now what I'm going to do is go to effects, type in reverb.

25
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.250
Drag the river on to this clip.

26
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.380
I'm going to edit.

27
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.680
I'm going to go to you can experiment with any of your reverb filters that your software has.

28
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.500
There's going to be tons of different presets you can do.

29
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.830
Honestly, I logit always go for the Great Hall preset.

30
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.610
I don't know why the other ones, they don't really do it for me.

31
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.740
So I really urge you to experiment and find which kind of reverb you like.

32
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.670
So I'm going to open up this room sized room sizes, basically smaller room, less reverb, larger room,

33
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.510
more reverb.

34
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.250
So I open that up all the way.

35
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.310
I'm going to turn down the dampening and the diffusion.

36
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.680
You don't need to get too complex with it, but the higher the dampening and the higher the diffusion,

37
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.820
the faster that the reverb gets dampened and taken away.

38
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.120
We're going to turn our DRI all the way up and our wet all the way up.

39
00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.800
Dry means the sound of the audio without the effect and the wet means the audio without the previous

40
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.070
sound.

41
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.120
That's hard to explain.

42
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.520
So I'm just going to put the wet all the way down.

43
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.000
Play it.

44
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.160
That's the original.

45
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.170
And then I'm going to put the wet all the way up and the dry all the way down.

46
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.250
And I'm going to solo it.

47
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.060
So you can hear the effect that we're adding is the that in the background.

48
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.210
OK, so we're going to put them both all the way up.

49
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.010
That means the original sound, the dry sound is going to be 100 percent playing.

50
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.440
And the new filtered sound, which is the wet sound, is going to be one hundred percent playing as

51
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.920
well.

52
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.500
Let's see how it sounds like this and made it look like this.

53
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.170
OK, that's pretty good.

54
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.660
So I'm going to copy this filter.

55
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.970
We don't need to fine tune it a whole lot.

56
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.110
So I'm going to paste it on our second snap.

57
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.570
It's OK, so this one could use a little bit more.

58
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.020
So I'm going to turn up the decay, the decay is how long the effect is sustained.

59
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.320
The longer the decay, the longer the short the shorter the decay.

60
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.200
You know, when someone decays, it goes away.

61
00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:16.570
Right.

62
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.930
So if we extend that decay, it stays for longer.

63
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.519
So.

64
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.050
OK, so let's take a listen.

65
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.400
Studio space like this and made it look like this.

66
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.570
And let's hear it without.

67
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.490
This and made it look like this.

68
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.440
And with this and made it look like this.

69
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.370
Yeah.

70
00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.820
So a really cool little effect that you can add there that just works in some scenarios, just adding

71
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.890
a little bit of reverb.

72
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.690
You know, this is a before and after shot.

73
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.090
So adding reverb to anything makes it sound a little bit more epic with vocals.

74
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.670
It doesn't work very well, but with sound effects and with hits or impacts in your video, reverb is

75
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.600
a really cool way.

76
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.780
Now, one final thing I want to say before we move to the next lesson is I initially thought we were

77
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.080
going to change the pitch of one of these clips if we take a listen.

78
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.500
But they already have a different pitch.

79
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:40.460
This one's lower and this one's higher, which it's kind of cool to when you have two different sound

80
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.560
effects that are similar.

81
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.330
What I generally do for some reason, these are different pitches, because I guess I snap slightly

82
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.870
different in real life when I recorded this.

83
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.640
But let's say that that wasn't the case.

84
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.870
What I would do would be to highlight one of these clips where we wanted to slightly change the pitch.

85
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.810
When I right click it, I'm going to go to speed, duration, and I can slow it down or speed it up

86
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.760
like 20, 10 or 20 percent if I speed it up to, let's say, one 20.

87
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.830
Now it's going to be a lot more high pitch.

88
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.170
Right.

89
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.600
If I did the opposite where I slowed it down from 100 percent to 80 percent,

90
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.300
it has a different kind of hit.

91
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.650
Right.

92
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.360
It feels different and made it look like this.

93
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.550
So that sounds and looks great.

94
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.380
It really makes this aftershock really kind of stand out more.

95
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.130
So that's a really cool tip you can do.

96
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.800
You can add reverb to sound effects in the background and you can change the speed, which inherently

97
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.410
or in turn is going to change the pitch.
