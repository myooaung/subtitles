00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.020
Now that we've gotten everything set up in our editing software, the next step is going to be pulling

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.220
our Selex.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.390
And simply put, pulling your Selex is choosing the shots that are going to be in the video and taking

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.310
out the shots that aren't going to be in the video.

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.390
So, for example, if you have something with multiple takes in this stage, you're going to be taking

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.330
out the best version that you want and cutting out the rest.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.060
This is all about building your foundation of your edit.

8
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.260
It's not about making the actual rough cut yet or something that's viewable or ready to be seen by friends,

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.420
families, clients, whatever it is.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.130
And so there's two fundamental ways to do this.

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.050
The first way is by labeling the clips in your project window or by cutting the clips in the timeline,

12
00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.250
labeling your footage in the viewer allows for kind of more precise editing, but really keeps track

13
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.260
of exact shots where they are.

14
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.700
By labeling them.

15
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.370
And the second way, which is bringing everything into the timeline, which is what we've done, and

16
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.420
then pulling selects is a lot quicker and a lot more practical.

17
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.210
I personally like this timeline method.

18
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.310
It's way easier to put the clips in order.

19
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.610
And then I use color to kind of categorize them in the timeline, which is what we're going to walk

20
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.150
through here.

21
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.910
And a nice little extra tip is that once we've pulled our selects, we're going to actually create a

22
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.400
backup sequence of that timeline sequence of selects.

23
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.160
So let's get into this process now.

24
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.630
Like I mentioned, the first and my least favorite way to pull selects is to double click them in your

25
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.310
project window and kind of scrub through here and say, okay, cool, this is that crystal cave place

26
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.390
that I was shooting at.

27
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.860
So, OK, if we go to the part that we want to use, let's say that we want to start here.

28
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.050
I'm going to hit I and that's going to create an endpoint on this clip.

29
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.550
I'm going to let it play here.

30
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.590
OK, I like that.

31
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.770
And let's say I want to cut right there.

32
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.510
I'm going to hit.

33
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.100
Oh, which is going to create an outpoint on the clip.

34
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.390
Then the next step of this cutting method would be to click that original file and title it in your

35
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.590
project window.

36
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.670
So let's say Crystal Cave.

37
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.910
And I think these are called stalactites, y stalactites and stalagmites.

38
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.920
One, huh?

39
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.400
Yeah, well, the OK still lag, still lag things.

40
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.650
Let's just say that, OK, still I don't know yet.

41
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.710
Now I have this label right here, and if we move to the next clip.

42
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.960
OK, cool.

43
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.240
This is that kind of boomerang that I did at sunset.

44
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.270
So we'll say boomerang at sunset.

45
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.280
And as you can see, if I were to go through and do this to every single clip that I want to use, I

46
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.740
would have a kind of a more library categorized by letters version of where all my clips are.

47
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.520
OK.

48
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.900
The second option is my much more my favorite a lot more practical, a lot more easy is to have all

49
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.000
this footage here, the sequence, and scrub through it.

50
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.790
And I want to do that same process.

51
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.250
But it's actually going to be happening in the timeline.

52
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.530
And your timeline is where your video takes place.

53
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.930
So we can scrub through, let's say I want to start at this point here.

54
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.900
I'm going to hit see to bring up my blade tool and I'm going to click to create a cut.

55
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.400
Then I'm going to delete that extra footage that we're not going to use.

56
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.500
And a little bit of a hack here.

57
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.510
Is to hold Alz when you hit delete.

58
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.870
What this is going to do is create what's called a ripple delete, which essentially is going to take

59
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.790
out this empty space.

60
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.480
OK.

61
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.810
So another way to do that is to hit delete on what we don't want.

62
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.580
And you right click and you see out highlights that empty space boom, ripple delete.

63
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.820
So ripple delete is essentially taking out what you don't want, but then scooting over the entire sequence

64
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.000
to fill that empty space of what you just took out.

65
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.240
I'm then going to scrub through and right about there, I'm going to create another cut.

66
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.020
And really, what you're looking for here in pulling these Selex is finding that good two to three second

67
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.490
moment.

68
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.460
Could be ten seconds, could be one second.

69
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.920
It really depends on the shot type.

70
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.750
But there's always going to be.

71
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.950
And as an editor, you're keeping in mind what you want the viewer to be seeing.

72
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.270
So for any shot that you're shooting, there's always going to be a beginning and an end.

73
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.820
And it's kind of a it's a feeling that you'll have.

74
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.060
But if I undo what we did here, this is not the best example, but it should work for what we're doing.

75
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.610
If I hit play, you can see there's kind of an intro that's going here.

76
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.750
Not much happening.

77
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.160
And then we start this nice vertical movement and you see, wow, look at this cave.

78
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:37.330
And then the pan and the tilt that I was doing by hand with the camera stops and then it starts heading

79
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.990
the other way.

80
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.580
So to me, when I'm seeing that, I'm seeing the end of the first shot and I'm actually seeing the beginning

81
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.780
of a different shot.

82
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.550
This is kind of a different shot, right?

83
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.120
That's a totally different shot.

84
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.630
So you kind of have in this situation and with your own footage, you'll see you have two different

85
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.860
options for one shot or very much one clear option.

86
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.290
Or, you know, it's going to be different for every single kind of shot.

87
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.200
But it's very clear here that not much going on, not much going on.

88
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.130
And then, boom, as I'm tilting up.

89
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.770
OK, that's where I want my clip to start.

90
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.410
I play it through.

91
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.290
It's interesting.

92
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.880
I'm looking.

93
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.120
There's a lot to see.

94
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.890
And then.

95
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.680
Boom.

96
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.000
It kind of ends there and the camera starts to go a different way.

97
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.560
If I really wanted to continue that shot, it's possible if there was something else there was important

98
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.940
that happened at this point, then we would keep it in.

99
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.830
But in this phase of pulling Selex, we want to really trim out what we're not going to use.

100
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.670
So because I know this is the end of the shot, I'm going to create that cut and just kind of pan through

101
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.680
to make sure I'm not missing anything interesting.

102
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.330
And then I know I'm not, so I'm gonna rip or delete.
