1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,340
So we have this transition that we've been working on.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,350
Now, what I'm going to do is highlight both of these clips and I'm going to show you how to bring these

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,440
into after effects to create a little bit more of a stylized look and have a little bit more control.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,680
So I'm going to right click those clips hit open with an after effects composition that's going to automatically

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,360
transfer these to video files into an after effects comp.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,020
And I'm going to title this showcase video transition.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,690
OK, great.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,800
Now we have both of our shots.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,890
So what we're going to do is kind of a similar process of dragging over our shots so that there's more

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,760
of an overlap.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,850
Now, I'm going to go to this top layer and go to effects and presets, which is over here.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,520
And I'm going to type in Luma Key.

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:02,590
I'm going to drag this on to our top layer, and what it is going to do is just like in a premiere,

14
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,900
it's going to remove our top layer.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,960
But the great thing about after effects is that it allows for you to feather, which, you know, the

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,580
feathering is key, as you know, by now, feather this effect.

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,930
So let's start first by creating a key frame of the threshold.

18
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,200
That's how much the effect is applied to our clip.

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,640
And then I'm going to go to where I want the transition to end, roughly about right here.

20
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,280
And I'm going to turn the threshold all the way up.

21
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,300
Now, you can see there's some part of the image that's not getting removed.

22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,660
Now, we're going to fix this with a similar masking overlay kind of technique that we were doing in

23
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,110
premiere.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,880
But let's start by also adding an edge.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,700
Feather feathering is our best friend.

26
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,430
This is going to create a lot more of a clean look.

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,760
Oh, look at that.

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,940
It's already looking pretty cool.

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,470
So let's go ahead and create an endpoint by hitting the letter B, create an outpoint by hitting the

30
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:05,710
letter.

31
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,430
And I'm going to hit command zero to start at the preview.

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,270
And let's check it out.

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,640
Oshkosh, OK.

34
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,460
That's looking so good.

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,620
OK, perfect.

36
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,890
So just in a few seconds, there is saved a lot of time.

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,960
Now, I like the speed of the transition.

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,540
You know, it can even go a little bit slower.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,470
Actually, I won't mind that for something like this.

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,350
That looks so cool.

41
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,290
You don't want to speed it up too much.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,600
So I'm just going to drag this key frame to start a little bit sooner and end a little bit later.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,280
OK.

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,760
Now we have a little bit more time to enjoy this transition.

45
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,030
And what I want to do is duplicate our bottom layer, which is the nighttime, nighttime shot.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,700
And I want to fix this blip, this glitch that happens in the top, because the exposure difference

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,930
on this specific image.

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,700
The sky is blown out.

49
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,260
So there's no information there.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,530
And the filter, the Lumia key filter doesn't know how to.

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,730
It doesn't have any information.

52
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,590
So it doesn't it can't create the effect they were wanting in this part of the frame.

53
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,370
So we're going to have to kind of do that manually.

54
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,150
So I'm going to take our bottom layer to duplicate it, drag it to the top.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,790
Right.

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,610
But as you can see now is taking away our effect.

57
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,010
So what we're going to do is turn this off for now by hitting the little icon right there on the left.

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,310
And I want to create a mask layer.

59
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,600
So I'm going to zoom out a little bit.

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,350
And I want it to come across the screen from here and go, whoosh, similar to what we did in from here.

61
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,950
So what I'm going to do is cue for the mask tool.

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,580
I'm going to create a square shaped mask.

63
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,510
I'm going to add a path keyframe at the beginning.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,520
I'm going to go to the end of the clip.

65
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,360
Right.

66
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,490
Is that transitions coming in?

67
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,880
And where I want this to be finished, I'm going to select both of these nodes, these points, and

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,920
I'm going to drag it across our clip.

69
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:18,310
Now, if I turn this layer back on, you're going to see that we've replaced the sky.

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,310
So as that comes in, wash.

71
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,910
OK, great.

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,380
So now we fix that problem where now our sky comes in gradually before the sky started to come in and

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,020
hajjis all of a sudden, Nosik.

74
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,250
So we don't want that.

75
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,490
So, OK, we have this guy coming in gradually.

76
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,900
We duplicated that layer.

77
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,350
Now we're going to use our best friend, which is, of course, the feathering tool.

78
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,760
We're going to feather this up.

79
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,180
I'm going to expand this a little bit.

80
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,580
And now let's see how that looks.

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,760
Wash.

82
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,340
OK, cool, so that looks good, there's no glitching, it's it's starting to look really nice, but

83
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,560
honestly, like the sky kind of comes in way too fast.

84
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,500
We want this to feel more elegant.

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:21,000
So let's extend the speed and slow down the quickness of this Skyy transition.

86
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:29,520
OK, and we can even fade in this guy transition so that this guy doesn't just wipe from white to black,

87
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,600
from white to black, but more comes in gradually.

88
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,540
So let's go to let's say about here.

89
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,730
Let's hit the opacity icon, the stopwatch more hit 100 hundred right there.

90
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,140
And then we'll go to the beginning of our clip.

91
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,130
Go to zero.

92
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,680
Perfect.

93
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,210
So that's a super cool looking transition.

94
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,380
It's gradual, it's elegant, it's clean, it doesn't look over edited.

95
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,650
It allows for us to transition from this daytime shot to this nighttime shot in a way that just looks

96
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,050
cool.

97
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,270
So that's how you do it in After Effects.

98
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,740
This is a great way to transition between shots, using masking to mask out specific parts of your image

99
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,280
and using something like the Luma key filter with our best friend, the edge feathering function to

100
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,990
really blend these two shots together.

101
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,730
And that's the best way to do it.
