1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,880
Now, as I move forward through this edit as well, we're pulling Selex on all of these parts, gathering

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,960
all these great clips.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,030
And I got to a part in the footage where we have this really cool camera movement, where I'm going

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,100
from the handheld recorder, and we pull back.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,510
Go to the microphone.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,190
That's perfect.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:32,310
But I will say there are scenarios when you might want to reverse the direction or orientation of the

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,759
cliff.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,700
And so we haven't dropped in my voice over yet.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,310
But let's say in my voiceover, I'm talking about the microphone and how the microphone is attached

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,790
to the zoom.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,870
That's great.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,630
But this shot shows the zoom and then it shows the microphone, which isn't really that bad.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,700
But I want to show you a little trick that we can do in that kind of situation where I'm going to duplicate

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,240
these clips.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,620
So we have our old version here.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,270
And I'm going to highlight both of these clips that normally play from the zoom handheld recorder.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,240
And then we're going back and then the microphone comes in focus.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,100
So we're going to highlight these clips.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,120
We're going to right click and we're going to choose speed and duration.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,800
And here's the trick.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,410
In this setting and in this panel, we can actually reverse the speed of the clip.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,460
So we're not going to slow things down.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,770
We're not going to speed things up.

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,980
But we're going to make the ending, the beginning and the beginning.

26
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,460
The end.

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,560
So I'm going to click that function.

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,610
Hit, OK.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,360
And now what we have is this same great shot.

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,690
But we're moving from the microphone, being in focus and doing a push in.

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,270
To the handheld recorder.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,410
And let's see the second version of that.

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,760
Where we go past the microphone again and do a really nice push and shot to the zoom.

34
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:07,160
So that is just a really handy trick that you can use to better make your visuals cue up to what's going

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,570
on in your audio.

36
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,970
So I'm really excited to see you implement that little ninja trick into your future at its.
