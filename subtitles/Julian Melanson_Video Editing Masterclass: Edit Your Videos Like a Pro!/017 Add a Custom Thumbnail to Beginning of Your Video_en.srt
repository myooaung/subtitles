00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,000
So it's time for this little kind of extra hack that I wanted to share with you, which is perfect for

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,750
being able to have the thumbnail that you want for your video.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,820
For example, when you upload to Facebook or Instagram, you can't go and export another thumbnail like

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,630
you can on YouTube where you have your video that's there.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,680
And then you say, I want to choose my thumbnail, upload the thumbnail, and then boom.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,670
No, no, no.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,720
Some platforms don't allow you to do that.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:36,600
They only allow for you to choose a specific part of the video itself to grab a thumbnail from.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:45,870
So there's two ways to create a thumbnail and place it that will go over the fix that fixes this annoying

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,960
problem, but then also allows for you to agree.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,850
I cannot do this right now, man.

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,470
OK.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,230
That also allows you to create really great looking thumbnails, which is very important for your Instagram

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,760
grid and feed.

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:08,430
So let's first start with option number one, and I'm going to scrub through our video and I'm going

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,420
to look for a really cool moment that sums up the whole video.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,520
OK.

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,610
That is kind of cool.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
There's some action going on.

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,690
You can see he's loading a battery into a camera.

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,330
I'm not like in love with it, but it is a potential.

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,390
So I'm going to add a marker right here by hitting M.

23
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,280
Now you can see our marker is right there.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,190
And let's keep scrubbing forward.

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,040
That's OK.

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,420
That's OK.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
That's kind of cool.

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,320
That gets my attention, so I'm going to hit him right there as well.

29
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,600
So we have two options.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,320
So what I'm going to do is go to where our marker is.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,070
I'm going to right click our clip and I'm going to click Add Frame Hold.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,210
Now we have a still image of this really cool shot.

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,060
OK, I'm going to enlarge our timeline here so we can see a little bit more.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,900
And I'm going to drag that still image to the very beginning of our sequence.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,930
Now, before we move to the beginning of the sequence, we need to fix this right here, because we

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,880
just created the frame hold moved it, and it's leaving a blank empty space.

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:31,390
All we have to do is simply drag our original clip to replace what we just did with the normal video.

38
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:38,580
And we can scroll to the beginning of our video now and look what we have, a really cool still image

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,220
at the beginning of our clip.

40
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,240
Now, what we want to do is make this still image only one single frame.

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,400
That way, Instagram and Facebook.

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,240
We can select this part of the video as the main cover photo, still image, thumbnail, whatever you

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,520
want to call it, of the entire post.

44
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,710
So we're at the beginning.

45
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:05,190
I'm going to hit the right arrow just to go one frame over, grab my blade tool, click and remove the

46
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,400
excess so that this is only here for that one split second.

47
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,470
That's option number one.

48
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,880
Option number two.

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:24,330
If you have other shots and photos from your shoot that wasn't in camera from the video that we've been

50
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,190
working with, you can grab that from your, you know, camera or from your phone, which is what we're

51
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,540
going to do in this circumstance.

52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,150
So I'm going to open up my phone.

53
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,480
I'm going to go to my photo album from this shoot.

54
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,880
OK, I'm going to take this photo.

55
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,920
This behind the scenes shot that kind of also tells the story of what the video is about.

56
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,770
And I'm going to share.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,540
And I want to airdrop it to my laptop.

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,550
You can text it to yourself, email it to yourself, send it anywhere you like.

59
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,040
But personally, airdrop is the easiest.

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,390
And now we're going to go to our downloads folder on our laptop, and we're going to drag in that still

61
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,840
image.

62
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,210
And we're going to kind of do the same thing here.

63
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,260
We're going to drag it and we're going to go to the very beginning of our sequence.

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,760
Drag it in.

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,890
We're at the very beginning.

66
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,690
Go over one frame.

67
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,390
Delete what we don't need.

68
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,440
And now what we can do is scale up our image to match our frame size.

69
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,840
So I'm going to click the photo.

70
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,950
Go to the effects control scale of the image.

71
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,790
So you can see an issue that we're running into here.

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,080
We can't fit all of what we want while filling the entire frame.

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,580
We can't fit me and the subject into our shot.

74
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:52,470
So if you're familiar with the way platforms like Instagram use thumbnails only in a square one by one

75
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,620
aspect ratio.

76
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,100
Let's bring it up so we can see what we're talking about.

77
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,540
You can see that it only shows a thumbnail in that square ratio.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,580
But if I actually go to one of the posts, it's not a square.

79
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,580
It's actually vertical or it can be horizontal.

80
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,410
Same with this clip.

81
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,510
The thumbnail itself is square.

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,870
But the post is a different aspect ratio.

83
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,440
So we have a very similar thing going on here with our post.

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,400
So the way to get around that and kind of ninja your way through this problem, we want to fit everything

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
in our frame.

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,820
And we also want it to be framed nicely when a platform like Instagram cuts off the top and bottom of

87
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,390
our frame.

88
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,710
And the way around that is to select our beginning thumbnail.

89
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,630
Scale it down.

90
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,210
OK.

91
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,560
Frame it up the way that we want.

92
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,460
And then we're going to duplicate this image.

93
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,310
OK.

94
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,660
So I'm going to hold alt drag it up.

95
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,600
Now we have two copies, one on top of the other of our beginning photo.

96
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,210
And I'm going to click the bottom layer.

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,510
And now I'm going to scale up this bottom layer and to blend these two images together.

98
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm going to go to the effects tab type in fast blur.

99
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:24,660
What this is going to do is blur out the pixels of the background image, which creates a lot more of

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:32,940
a smooth overall photo because the colors are the same in these two photos, because they're the same

101
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,280
photo.

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,650
One is just scaled up differently.

103
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,680
So, of course, things don't line up perfectly.

104
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,480
But the coloring, the contrast and the exposure of the image is the same.

105
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,950
All we did was blur the back.

106
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,000
Background so that we're filling the entire frame with the same image, but we're keeping the framing

107
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,580
and the aspect ratio that we want for the final product when it's living on a social media platform

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,080
to be what we want.

109
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,760
So now we have two options.

110
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:07,310
We have this first one as our thumbnail image, or we have an actual still screen grab from our video

111
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,060
itself as the other alternative thumbnail.

112
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:19,940
Now, you can also to take things one step further, stylize this beginning thumbnail the same way we

113
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,790
colored all of our footage in our edit.

114
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm going to drop on and luminary color effect and we can even drop on the same.

115
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,600
Lutt reset as the actual edit turned down the intensity.

116
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:48,840
So that it matches a little bit more the vibe of the actual video, so that's without the color correction

117
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,410
and with.
