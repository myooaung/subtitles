1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,880
Now, there are two things that really stuck out to me.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:09,690
There's two clips here that the audio from the environment is not working, OK.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,100
It's this first cave clip where it's talking in the background and a lot of footsteps.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,320
And then this final clip when my group is, you know, talking about I don't know where we're going

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,590
to have for lunch or whatever we're doing here.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:32,670
So you'd be surprised at how much of the television movies, videos that you see actually don't have

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,110
audio coming from that actual moment of what was being filmed.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,960
A lot of the time the voices are replaced.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,280
A lot of the time, the environment or a sound of the characters making in frame inside what's going

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,770
on.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,850
The action is being replaced in post-production.

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,650
And a lot of the times.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,290
Yeah, audio is taken out from the actual footage and replaced with post-production sound design.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,660
So what comes out to mind here is I'm going to highlight these two clips so we know what we're working

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,080
with here.

16
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,920
And I'm going to make these I want to make these brown so that they kind of stand out against the other

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,310
ones.

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,440
And it's something that we want to replace.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:23,050
We can take either the audio from the same clip and try to get a different part of that clip.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:30,580
Sometimes this happens, let's say you're recording at a I don't know, a church now.

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,910
Let's say you're recording at the beach, OK?

22
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:41,170
And you have your clip and the section of that clip you decide to use for your visual happens to have

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,330
not so good audio for that section.

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,570
But at other portions of that same exact overall clip, there's really good sound of the waves crashing

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,600
the birds or whatever it is that you're looking for, for that specific clip.

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:59,680
Then you can grab that part and put it, even though it's not from that same exact moment in time.

27
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,760
But you can still put it there and no one will know it'll be your little ed secret.

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,140
That's option one.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,910
Option two.

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,810
Option two is to completely replace the audio from that section completely.

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,450
And there's a few different ways you could do that will walk through.

32
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:23,650
But let's first start with option one to see if for either one of these two clips that we marked that

33
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,030
needed to be updated.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,420
Let's see if we can find a good section for any of those clips.

35
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,370
So let's go to this first one here.

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:37,450
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a duplicate of what we already have here for this

37
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,070
audio section of this clip.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,830
I'm going to hold alt click, drag it out.

39
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,270
Now we have it over here.

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,800
What this is going to allow me to do is to like open it up, take out the edit that we made on it without

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
messing with anything in our timeline.

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,930
Next thing I'm going to do is click on our little key frames here so that the cross fades are taken

43
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,350
out.

44
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,990
And this is going to allow for us to listen to the clip in its entirety in the woliver till we have

45
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,130
to leave, whichever one comes first.

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:20,530
OK, it's sounding like there's really not any good moments in that clip that we can use.

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,770
Let's look at our second clip where we want to replace the audio here.

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,240
Let's do the same thing.

49
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,380
I can also highlighted, do you command C to copy it?

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,280
Move the player head over here and you command V to paste it and then drag out the ends of the clip

51
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,780
and delete the keyframe so that we have the clip in its entirety.

52
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,490
So it's full.

53
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,020
There you have it ready.

54
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,160
That's not going to work either.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,740
So because that's not going to work either.

56
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:04,430
Let's go ahead and take a listen back to our edit as a whole and see if maybe there's some other clips

57
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,000
we can pull from, for example, this one.

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,490
I know has really good sound, so I'm going to grab that and bring it over here.

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,790
OK.

60
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:24,760
I'll pull it out and I'm going to delete the key frames, and actually we know we use this part.

61
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,270
OK.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:33,610
So what I'm going to do is see if maybe later in the clip, which we haven't used, we'll be able to

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,260
use for an entirely different clip.

64
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,380
That's pretty good, so I'm going to move that keyframe over here.

65
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,260
Delete the part that we've used previously.

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,070
And I'm going to try and see what that sounds like.

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,980
Instead of the current audio for our final shot.

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm going to select this.

69
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,730
Actually, I'm going to mute this entire layer, so that's going to mute the audio that's currently

70
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,700
there and it's going to leave the new audio underneath that we just dropped in playing without the other

71
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,180
audio.

72
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,620
OK.

73
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,040
So I'm going to create a similar crossfade so that these kind of line up a little bit.

74
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,040
And let's see how it fits.

75
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,000
Not bad.

76
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,030
That's not bad.

77
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,690
That's a lot better than.

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,380
Yeah.

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,120
Okay.

80
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,350
Whenever you guys are ready.

81
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah.

82
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,600
Not bad.

83
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,000
That's sounding pretty darn good.
