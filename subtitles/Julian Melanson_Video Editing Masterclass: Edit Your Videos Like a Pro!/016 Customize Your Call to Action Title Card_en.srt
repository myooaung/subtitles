1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,009
Now we have this outro right here.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,939
And let's go ahead and drag in.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,150
You know, you can do any kind of title card.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,000
You can go ahead and do it.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,190
You know, the good old fashioned way WW W and your website do with plain text.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,840
We've done that earlier in the course.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,850
You can do it anyway.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:30,390
For this example, I'm going to use just grab one of my kind of go to motion graphic templates.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,280
Again, you can buy these really easily online or even find them for free by just searching the name

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,100
of your editing software and free motion graphic or motion graphic template.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,590
OK.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,930
Now, let's see what we can do to kind of customize this.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,290
I'm going to take this top line and let's say demo reel.

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,010
And it looks so much cooler as one word.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,690
Yeah.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,000
And let's face this.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,280
W w w Julian discovers dot com.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,690
So we have my website.

19
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,360
And let's take away the gradient.

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,350
We want it to be all white and we can scale it down.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,490
And instead of Demerol, actually, let's make this say.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,890
Port folio, OK.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,150
Boom.

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,910
And let's center this.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,610
Scale it up a little bit more and let's see.

26
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,690
OK, perfect.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:58,240
So I already know ahead of time that I'm going to want to have this cool intro that this template has.

28
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:04,210
And you can do this same thing about to do with any kind of template or you just redo, do what I'm

29
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,560
about to do with what you created.

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,700
Does even have to be a template.

31
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,500
But we're going to duplicate this layer.

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,600
And now I'm going to reverse the speed of the copy that we just made.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,940
I'm going to go to the end, which was the beginning.

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,020
And it's now the end.

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm going to cut and I'm going to remove the part we don't need.

36
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,790
I'm going to take our original.

37
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,220
Remove the ending that we don't need.

38
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:31,030
So now what we have is intro, animation, our text, and then a reverse of the intro, which now becomes

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,470
our outro animation.

40
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,010
Perfect.

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,480
OK.

42
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm loving that.

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:51,790
Now, we can kind of spice up this outro graphic a little bit before we kind of review our edit.

44
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,720
So I know I could kind of use an overlay.

45
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,310
It looks kind of plain.

46
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:07,870
So let's go ahead and grab some film burns and just get this motion graphic looking a little bit more

47
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,440
unique.

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,970
So let's start with this and we'll try to do a little cool, kind of glitchy something here.

49
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,620
So I'm going to drag in this film Burn.

50
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,040
And I'm going to put it in our timeline.

51
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,030
I'm going to change the track mat or the blending mode to screen, which is just going to leave the

52
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,790
light parts of the image and take away the dark parts of the image.

53
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,150
Let's go ahead and delete the beginning.

54
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,750
OK.

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,370
Hmm.

56
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,180
We don't need the whole thing.

57
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,650
I don't think we need the whole thing like on Frayne the entire time, so let's just have it at the

58
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,460
beginning.

59
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,460
Yeah.

60
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:09,210
OK, so let's start it right here and let's make the film burn at its max.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,980
Let's make it right here when it's at its max before it goes back out of the frame.

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,230
Let's put this point at the transition between shot one and shot two.

63
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,310
So I'm going to shoot it over.

64
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,180
So it's going to go in more, more boom, less, less, less.

65
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,220
And then we can cut the rest.

66
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,490
Actually, we can cut it right there because we don't need this weird bounciness, it's not looking

67
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:37,880
too good.

68
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:46,790
And let's cut in right there and let's use this part for the ending.

69
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,160
So I'm going to take you here.

70
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,400
Boom.

71
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,180
OK, we don't need quite as much.

72
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,640
Let's speed it up, because that doesn't really feel right.

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,020
So a go two hundred percent.

74
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,700
OK, let's scoot it forward.

75
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,830
Yeah.

76
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,880
Why don't we put this one over here?

77
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,800
OK.

78
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,110
And then let's put this one over here and yeah, we're going to switch these.

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,580
Perfect.

80
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,590
OK.

81
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,110
And it could even used.

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,050
I don't know if we can do anything with that.

83
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,590
Let's kind of experiment here.

84
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,010
So I'm going to drop this in and I won't change the Bleaney mode of this to difference.

85
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,200
Now, that looks kind of crazy, but we're only going to have it for like a split second.

86
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,470
Yeah, OK, now we're talking.

87
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,840
OK, I like that.

88
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,050
OK, we don't need it quite so much.

89
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,470
We will take it.

90
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,130
And let's look back at that.

91
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,280
Perfect.

92
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,980
OK.

93
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,190
Loving that.

94
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,890
So just feel a little bit of a, you know, a proper amount of a film burn with the right amount of

95
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:09,840
blending mode with this animation of our text created a really cool and unique, more dynamic feel.

96
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,860
Let's see what else we can get done in our next lesson.
