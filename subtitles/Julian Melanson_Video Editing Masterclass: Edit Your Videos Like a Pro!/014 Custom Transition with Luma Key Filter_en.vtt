00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:08.039
We have this part of our edit where we have two shots that I filmed that are very similar and we want

2
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.020
to do some kind of cool transition between the two.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.810
So I'm going to kind of explain this in an easy way that we can do inside of premie or maybe a few different

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.280
ways to do it inside of premiere.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
And then we'll explain a more complex way to do it inside of after effects.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.740
So let's first start with creating some space for this transition.

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.030
So I'm going to move up our adjustment layer and we want to start with overlaying these two shots.

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
So I'm going to go ahead and drag out some time of both shots.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.010
Bring the intro of the shot longer and bring the outro of The Shot below it longer as well.

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.870
Now, I want to overlay these two shots as symmetric.

11
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.720
No, not symmetrically, but as closely as possible before trying to create our transition.

12
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.240
So what that's going to entail is basically right now we have this shot.

13
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
So right now, we have these two shots, these two shots.

14
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.070
And you can see this part of the image.

15
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.950
One shot is a little bit earlier than the following shot.

16
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.460
So I'm going to go ahead and select the top shot and I'm gonna start shooting this over until it's as

17
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.770
closely synched up to the shot below it as possible.

18
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.090
OK.

19
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.310
So you can you can see the ghosting of how these shots are overlaid, it looks pretty similar.

20
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.540
It really does.

21
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.240
So let's go ahead and see what this looks like with just a overall crossfade.

22
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.460
And I'm going to go ahead and take our adjustment layer, because right now you can see this pop of

23
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.970
color change right there is happening because we have two different adjustment layers that were affecting

24
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.500
two different clips separately.

25
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.360
But now we're blending these clips together.

26
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.490
That's not going to work.

27
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.410
So I'm going to take this adjustment layer copyists filter paste it onto our bottom track, delete the

28
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.330
adjustment layer that we don't need anymore.

29
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.210
Take the adjustment layer that was affecting this clip.

30
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.410
Now it's affecting both.

31
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.200
And I'm going to copy its color filter, paste it onto our clip, delete that.

32
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.610
And now we don't have that pop of exposure that's messing up our transition.

33
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.550
OK, so that's not even like terrible.

34
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.110
This is like kind of a cool thing that if most people see that, they'd be like, whoa, how do you

35
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.800
do that?

36
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.300
Right.

37
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.380
So that's the basic of basic ways.

38
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.910
OK.

39
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.350
Now, there's a few of the things that we can do with masking that we can do in premiere without having

40
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.650
to export things to after effects.

41
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.030
And actually we can even do a luma key as well.

42
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.180
We're going to be able to fine tune that a little bit more in after effects.

43
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.370
But I want to show you the process in in premiere, because we're going to be able to I'm going to minimize

44
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.890
our color correction.

45
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.030
Here's our Luma key filter.

46
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:18.500
Now, what this is going to do is it's going to basically use different exposures to slowly fade in

47
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.370
our image.

48
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.020
So you can see it's bringing in the dark parts of the frame and it's using Luma, meaning light blue,

49
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.630
using those different parts of the frame, different light intensities to bring in the image that way

50
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.620
versus a fade where you bring in the whole image at once.

51
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.980
Right, so let's go ahead and take off our crossfade and let's go to our Lumo filter.

52
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.600
Let's go to the beginning of our clip.

53
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.090
Let's turn it all the way up.

54
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.970
So that means it's not being affected yet.

55
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.660
And we're going to hit the stopwatch and we're going to go to about where we want to finish our transition.

56
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.000
We're going to go to zero and let's hit play.

57
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.070
OK, so you can see it kind of has a more view kind of thing.

58
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.339
One of the problems with this filter is that it doesn't really start to take effect with this specific

59
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.640
image because so much of the image is already dark.

60
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.300
It doesn't start to take effect until really late in the process.

61
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.700
You can see it's only starting to really engage when it gets to around 10 percent.

62
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.900
So let's go ahead and set the actual starting point, not at 100 percent, but rather let's try it at

63
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.830
20 percent.

64
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.130
Let's delete our old keyframe and drag that over.

65
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.620
So that gives us a much more gradual fade.

66
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.810
But the problem is with Premier, it doesn't allow for you to feather this transition so we can, you

67
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.300
know, try to fix that a little bit by doing a crossfade.

68
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.950
Let's see that.

69
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.130
OK, so this kind of a cool little, you know, unique effect that's going on, emceeing a pretty big

70
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.110
difference in this where the house is located in the frame.

71
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.130
Let's see if we can.

72
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.900
So what we can do for that is to take our bottom image.

73
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.790
Scale it up to, let's say, one 10.

74
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.260
And let's go ahead.

75
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.620
And now we have space to move it over.

76
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.570
OK, cool.

77
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.460
You see what we just did there?

78
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.900
We really made this part of the transition really aligned perfectly, because this is where the eye

79
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.380
is going to be.

80
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.330
The eye is going to be looking at the bright part of the frame.

81
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.610
It's going to be looking towards the center of the frame.

82
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.590
And that's where the effect kind of looks the best in this transition.

83
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.300
But, you know, I'm not super happy with the way the Luma key thing works in after four Arendelle excuse

84
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.020
me, in premiere.

85
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.180
So let's remove that and let's try a different kind of effect.
