1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,360
So this first shot catches my eye and this one's a little bit tough.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,410
There's a massive exposure difference with the sun coming in through the window.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,070
What I'm going to do is travel.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,020
What I want to do is go ahead and make a cut here.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,950
And rather than dragging on a new loom, the tree color and bringing down the highlights, what that

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,330
would be doing is that would work.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,940
But we're going to be combating the exposure increase that this one's giving and then reversing it by

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,750
trying to push it up.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,930
So in this kind of scenario, for this specific type of problem, let's go ahead and cut our adjustment

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,900
layer so that we're only affecting this image.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,150
Let's bring down that exposure a few points and let's bring down our highlights.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,790
Let's say negative 30, and we don't need to boost our shadows a whole lot more.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,620
So let's bring that down to 10 and say play is much better.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,400
OK, great.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,930
This one didn't need a big this one did not need that much of a boost.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,970
It already had radio.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,379
Oh, man, I can't talk.

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,460
So this one really didn't need that much of a boost.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,220
It already had a lot of light going on.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,480
So let's continue.

21
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,760
This is looking nice.

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:24,610
OK, so let's create a cut here, and this one needs a lot of help.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,770
So I'm going to bring up the exposure.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,810
I'm going to bring up the highlights.

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,180
Okay.

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,570
That's looking way better, we can't even bring up these highlights.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
Let's go to 100.

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:45,660
Now you can see something that's starting to happen here when I'm when I'm increasing the exposure on

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,140
this image.

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,250
It's very subtle, but there is a 10 light purple that we have in the whites.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,430
So the white balance was pretty different.

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,360
And the coloring in these two rooms is the same colored walls.

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,210
But these lights are a different color temperature.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,000
The daylight and these warm lights mixing into this room is creating very tan walls.

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:16,500
This is creating very almost a purple light, light, light, light, light purple because of the lighting

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,590
is different in here with this green almost yellowish.

37
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,080
This is more of a green light that we have coming up here.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,990
So that's a bit of an issue.

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,030
It's not the end of the world.

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,240
But what we want to do is to kind of try to blend these colors a little bit better so that we have more

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,140
of a cohesive work.

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,810
So quick way to do that is I'm going to bring up the temperature.

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,160
It's bringing up the four points.

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,000
OK.

45
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,190
A little bit better if that's not doing the trick.

46
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:51,960
What we can do is go down to our creative tab and we can selectively change the color of the highlights.

47
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,740
So the bright parts of the frame are now getting pushed to the blue.

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,420
And we can selectively change our shadow, which is changing the color of the dark parts of the frames,

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,370
the frames selectively.

50
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:13,680
So it takes what you have up here a step further and allows for you to only change specific parts of

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,950
the frame, depending on their quality of light, depending on their amount of exposure.

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,740
So because we want to get this a little bit more tan, let's see how it looks if we bring up the tan.

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,530
I'm pushing this more to the yellow.

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,030
On the highlights, so the highlights would be walls, these would be bright.

55
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,870
These would be dark.

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,710
So if I were to change the shadow on this image, I would be changing the color of the dark part so

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,270
that plant would start to go blue and all the other dark parts.

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,730
So that's looking better.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,070
Let's bring in even a little bit more tan.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,760
OK.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,250
And a little bit more highlight, because this is still looking a little bit dull for my eyes, so let's

62
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,030
go to 120.

63
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,350
Even boost this up to one point nine.

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,260
OK, that's good enough for now.

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,970
Let's keep moving.

66
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,620
OK.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,850
We have these.

68
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,800
So this looks good, but we have this one.

69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,690
It's a little bit too tan.

70
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:38,930
So I'm going to bring the temperature down negative five and I'm going to boost these a little bit more

71
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,260
light.

72
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,650
So I'm going to go one point two, OK?

73
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,400
And what I'm also seeing here is, is a lot of saturation in this one compared to this.

74
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,750
So I like the colors and the amount of saturation of this one.

75
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,030
This is looking to saturated.

76
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,880
So sometimes you actually want to bring your saturation down to match some of your other images.

77
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,380
OK, let's try that.

78
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,750
Ooh, much better.

79
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,490
OK, so before we had it like this to that, it was very yellow to a nice white.

80
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,750
Now we have it nice white across both of these images.

81
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,590
OK, this all looks great.

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:29,340
OK, and we need some help here, so let's go and let's bring up the exposure one point.

83
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,930
Bring up the highlights.

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,540
Let's say 30 points and boost the shadows.

85
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,150
Let's say 30 points as well.

86
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,600
Before?

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,290
After.

88
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,470
Hmm.

89
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,180
OK.

90
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,190
So what I'm seeing is I like the exposure of these two bathroom shots, these two.

91
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,000
But it gets a little bit dark and a little bit dull with these bedroom shots.

92
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,350
So I'm going to create two cuts.

93
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,410
I mean, go here and I'm going to continue to boost.

94
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,210
Let's go to the highlights, the 70.

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,480
OK.

96
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,720
And let's go here and let's do the same.

97
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,000
Great.

98
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,370
Now we're to the outdoor pool area.

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,420
Let's bring up the exposure point five and the highlights 60.

100
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,370
And the way I'm deciding, you know, how much to bring these up is I've been doing this for a while,

101
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,240
so I know soon as I look at the image, I got a feeling for the amount of increase or decrease in whatever

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,940
parameter it's going to need, and you will start to develop that same exact sensitivity.

103
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,370
So now these are starting to pop.

104
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,070
Now I'm going to increase our saturation.

105
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,670
Bring that up.

106
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,870
OK.

107
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,310
Looking good.

108
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,830
OK, cool.

109
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,260
Yeah, that's our transition scene that we're going to get to.

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,700
Okay.

111
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,820
Now we have all this nighttime stuff and this is dark.

112
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,510
Oh, geez.

113
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,690
So we're going to bring up the exposure one point five.

114
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,870
And let's bring it to highlights.

115
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
Let's say 70.

116
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,860
And now this last shot, it has an overlay under it or a graphic under it, so we're not going to be

117
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,520
able to pop over this adjustment layer because it's going to affect this.

118
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,730
So, for example, if I drag this adjustment layer on top, you see what we're doing.

119
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,490
We don't we love and we really enjoy.

120
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,720
Right.

121
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,560
We have a perfect exposure, everything on here.

122
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,280
So what I'm going to do is on a copy, the filter on this adjustment layer, go directly to this clip

123
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,470
and hit paste so that we're not going to be affecting what's underneath it, which is our title card.

124
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,530
Now, this can use some more exposure and it's a little bit purple.

125
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,150
So I'm going to counteract that by bringing down the tent, which boosts the greens.

126
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,090
The more I bring down the tent, the more it's going to take out the purple.

127
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,950
We just want to do a little bit negative for.

128
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:23,800
Great, so now we have the exposure's everything is equalized, we've done our color correction across

129
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,270
our entire editing timeline, and in the next video lesson, I'm going to show you how to do a really

130
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,179
cool custom transition between these two similar shots from day to night.
