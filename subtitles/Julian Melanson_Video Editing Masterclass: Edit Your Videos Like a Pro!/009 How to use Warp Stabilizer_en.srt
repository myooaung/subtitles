1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,060
And so you should be by now becoming a level 10.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,650
Maybe not Lyttleton yet, but maybe a little eight little nine editing ninja.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,210
So next up, now that we've gotten a really cool understanding, pacing, editing shots, we shot links,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,700
all these little intricacies and subtleties as an editor.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
We have these new things in our arsenal.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,860
What I want to do now for the rest of this learning lesson is to now hone in on some of the final refining

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,650
steps that's really going to take this video and elevate it to a higher level of production.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,080
And so if we take a look here, I'm going to actually turn this down.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:53,400
This was all shot on a gimbal, but there's definitely a lot of noticeable shakiness and jerky motions

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:01,980
and movements that I'm not super happy with and doesn't match the flowing tone of her performance.

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,340
So a really excellent and effective final polishing layer.

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:15,330
Once you get to the second draft edit like we're at now is to apply post-production stabilization.

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,460
Now, what this is going to do is it's going to tell your software to analyze all the movements and

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,530
shakes and wiggles and jostles, all those kind of verbs.

15
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,400
It's going to analyze those and it's going to decide where movement is happening.

16
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,840
And it's going to scale up your image and make a steadiness and really undo those motions.

17
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,960
So if the camera moves this way, it's going to actually do the exact opposite movement, which cancels

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,560
out the unwanted shakiness that we have in our footage.

19
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,140
So let's go ahead and go to our first clip here.

20
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,020
And I'm going to grab our warp stabilizer effect.

21
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,790
This is what it's called in premiere in other editing software, as it might be slightly different wording.

22
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,960
But you want to grab your postproduction, stabilizing effect and drag it on to the first clip they

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,949
were editing with here.

24
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,160
Now, what this is going to do is it's going to analyze the footage frame by frame.

25
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,420
And when it's done analyzing, then it's going to scale up that image depending on how much movement

26
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,460
is in the actual clip.

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,130
The more movement, the more it needs to scale it up to come back that extra movement.

28
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,840
And as you can see, our warp stabilizer has finished analyzing the clip.

29
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,600
It's scaled up our clip from one hundred percent to one hundred and two percent.

30
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,570
So just a little bit.

31
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,550
And let's see what that looks like.

32
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,530
So a lot smoother if I undo the clip.

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,140
You can see it goes back to 100 percent scale and there's like that jitteriness.

34
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,980
See the difference?

35
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,420
The downside to this, when there's a lot of movement in the foreground, in the background, the computer

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,180
can't tell depth in your flat image, you can't tell that you were shooting in a three dimensional area

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,090
where if I'm moving the camera here, this is in the foreground.

38
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,290
That's how you in the background.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,110
And it has a hard time knowing that there is a separation here.

40
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,740
So for this clip in particular, we have this wobble and this kind of underwater look.

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,320
So this is the effect and filter that you really want to find, too.

42
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,360
You really want to turn it down to the point where it's still stabilizing your footage.

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,450
But on some shots, it has a really hard time knowing that this is in the foreground and this is in

44
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,080
the background.

45
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,010
So it's warping the whole clip as one big thing.

46
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,120
So we're going to find a way to get around that once we get away from this tree.

47
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,630
It looks pretty dang smooth compared to without the stabilization.

48
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,750
There's all that extra shaking going on.

49
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,370
So let's see what we can do to fine tune this clip.

50
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,600
So we're not getting this under the sea.

51
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,330
Look here.

52
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,020
OK.

53
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:22,620
What you can do to minimize that warp is change the smoothness function every time you apply this filter

54
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,220
to your clip.

55
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,510
The automatic value is going to be 50 percent smoothness.

56
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,510
This means how much you're applying the filter to the clip itself.

57
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,880
Now, let's turn this down to, let's say, 20 percent.

58
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,380
Now it's going to reanalyze quickly and it's going to restabilize the clip.

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,630
So now we're only scaling it up one hundred and one point nine percent.

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,550
And let's hit play to see.

61
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,210
OK.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,640
That's looking better.

63
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,410
There still is some definite unwanted war penis.

64
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,690
So we're going to have to bring it down even less, let's say, 10 percent.

65
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:13,970
And the other thing that we can do is change the method at which this effect is analyzing our clip.

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,930
OK.

67
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,870
If we go from subspace warp, which is the default main method, it usually does a great job.

68
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,830
But what I've noticed when there's foreground in the clip, in the background subspace work, you get

69
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,820
a little bit Werbe.

70
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,740
So we have perspective position, scale rotation in position.

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,310
Let's see what these other options do for us.

72
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:44,210
So if we go to position and hit play, it's only going to be analyzing and moving your footage on an

73
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,690
axis and X and Y axis, the position left, right, up and down.

74
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,250
OK.

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,100
That we don't really want.

76
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,700
I never used just the position method because it doesn't really do a whole lot to your clip.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,170
If we try the position, scale and rotation method, it's now applying changes on the position up,

78
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,830
down, left, right, the scale and the rotation.

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:15,230
So it's adding more axis of change to better smooth in the image.

80
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,480
So that's actually looking a lot better.

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,160
And the last option, which is my favorite for this kind of scenario, when we're not getting a very

82
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,270
good stabilization on some tricky shots, I click perspective instead of subspace work.

83
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,470
Let's check that out.

84
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,360
So that's starting to look pretty good.

85
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,650
There's still a little bit of war up there just at this beginning.

86
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,260
But we could fine tune it more.

87
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,580
But I really want to move forward onto the other clips so we can continue this refining process.

88
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,850
So let's check out the set of the next three shots.

89
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,340
So there we've got a lot of shaking going on.

90
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,270
This one is decent.

91
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,350
There's not a whole lot of excess shaking, and that one is not too bad either.

92
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,240
And this one's definitely got some extra movements.

93
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,760
So let's start with this first one.

94
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,820
I'm going to apply.

95
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,350
This warp stabilizer to all of these cliffs.

96
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,400
Now we're going to play through and see how good these clips work with the default settings of the stabilization.

97
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,110
It's likely that we're going to have to do some fine tuning, which is very normal with this type of

98
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,260
filter, because every shot is different.

99
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,700
There's different foreground background, camera movement.

100
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,940
Contrast where everything is is different per shot.

101
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,860
So it's not a one size fits all when it comes to this type of filter.

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,440
Ooh, that's looking good.

103
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,380
OK, a little too much warping right there.

104
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,290
So that looks so good.

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,770
It's just right in here when we get a little bit too much.

106
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,330
So let's see what it did for default.

107
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,560
Of course, smooth.

108
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,010
This is smoothness is always default set to 50 percent.

109
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,240
And it only scaled up our image to one or four, which is not bad.

110
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,840
So but let's bring this down to, let's say, 30 percent.

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,230
And let's see if that gets rid of this excess.

112
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,690
OK, that looks great.

113
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:40,390
OK, there was still little it's subtle, but we don't want it to be obvious that there's stabilization,

114
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,590
we want it to be seamless.

115
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,290
And there's just these artifacts that show up of that underwater worthiness that makes it really obvious

116
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,880
that everyone knows who knows knows that you were using a warp stabilizer.

117
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,200
We don't want that.

118
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:59,680
We want everything to look smooth and invisible in a way not obvious that we apply to filter.

119
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,230
So let's bring it down to 20 and let's hit play.

120
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:05,960
OK.

121
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,360
I like that next shot.

122
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,350
Looks pretty good.

123
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,570
There's some extra bumping going on here.

124
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,380
OK, so let's bring this down to, let's say, 10 percent, because there is a lot of movement in this

125
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,620
one.

126
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,830
The more movement, the more you have to bring down the smoothness, because otherwise the stabilization

127
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,990
that it does cancels out how good it looks, because you go from shakiness to underwater and you don't

128
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,470
want that.

129
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,510
It looks pretty good at 10 percent.

130
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,260
But as you can see, it kind of does a bounce with her movements and we don't really want that.

131
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,600
So let's try perspective on this one.

132
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,060
And.

133
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,210
OK, we're still getting those movements.

134
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,230
So let's drop it down even more to, let's say, five percent.

135
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,400
Even more, two percent sometimes even do two or one percent, and honestly, it's good enough.

136
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,460
You don't need to take out all of the movement.

137
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,760
You just want to take up the distracting little shakiness, OK?

138
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,160
We don't need to really take away all of this movement with the camera, but it's just these actions

139
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,170
that kills the professional.

140
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,130
Look for your video.

141
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,810
Perfect.

142
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,430
So I've gone through and I fine tune the rest of these warp stabilizer filters now on a lot of these

143
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,730
clips.

144
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,580
As you can see, it's down to one percent on a lot of them, because for this specifically, there is

145
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,920
a lot of movement going on.

146
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,810
There is a lot of changing in the frame, closeups, trees in the foreground, other things in the foreground.

147
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,470
So it's really going to depend on the type of footage that you're working with.

148
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,490
But now, before we wrap up this lesson, I want to see a side by side with the footage where we took

149
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:06,930
the extra step and time in our second edit to add this fine tuned stabilization and see that next to

150
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,610
our edit, which looked good.

151
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,320
But until we see it side by side with one that's even more refined, you're going to see a big difference.

152
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,690
Let's check that out so you can see a lot of extra bouncing, a lot of extra shaking.

153
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:27,840
So that extra 10 to 20 minutes that we spend on that step can literally add an extra 10 to 20 percent

154
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,320
of production quality to our final edit.

155
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,500
And that's what footage that was shot already on a gimbal.

156
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,490
So you can really do even more with hand-held footage and with other shots that need just a little bit

157
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,690
of extra oomph to get to that level of professionalism that you're looking for.

158
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,710
So in the next lecture, we're going to finish this project by adding our final step for this process,

159
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,770
which is our final color correction layer.
