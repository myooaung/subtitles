00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.510
I will say that my editing software may look different than yours.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.150
You could be using even the same exact software, but if it's a different year or we have a different

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.420
updated version, it's going to look slightly different.

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.470
So if you're in final cut, if you're in a movie, if you're in premier, if you're an avid, if you're

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.500
in a Da Vinci resolve, if you're in any of the softwares.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.040
Don't worry too much about the appearance of mine.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.980
That's not the goal of this course.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.810
The goal is to give you the techniques that you can use across any of the software.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.950
So just know that ahead of time, be patient.

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.630
You can pause the lectures.

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.630
You can rewind.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.820
You can watch the back.

13
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.370
And I guarantee you that the information that you're going to be receiving is going to work regardless

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.360
of your software.

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.040
Now, I will also be supplying the downloadable footage for a majority of the chapters that we're going

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.470
to be going into and the learning exercises.

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.860
So you're going to actually be able to edit a right alongside with me with the same abo ve files from

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.400
Fourcade, footage from music videos from different kinds of projects, or if you like to, you can

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.970
edit with your own footage and follow along with me as well.
