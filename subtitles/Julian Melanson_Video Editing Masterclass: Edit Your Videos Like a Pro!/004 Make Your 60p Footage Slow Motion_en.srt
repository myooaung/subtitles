1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,640
Now that we have all of our footage into our editing software and the peek files have been generated

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,870
or good to go and start this edit, and this is a perfect opportunity to learn about how to work with

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,580
different frame rates.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,090
Now, if we take a look here, we can see our frame rates.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,230
All of these clips are shot at twenty three point nine seven six, which is going to be most of the

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,000
time the frame rate that you're working with for normal speed footage, a.k.a. twenty four frames a

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,390
second.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,600
Why cameras in the US shoot at twenty three point nine, seven, six frames per second instead of 24

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,260
frames a second.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,510
I don't know if, you know, maybe leave it in the Q&A, but that doesn't matter so much.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,250
What does matter is that this footage is always going to playback in real time.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,230
OK, there's not going to be any speed changes unless we add that in post-production.

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,019
But what I want to focus on is utilizing clips that you may have and that we have in this edit that

14
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,990
are shot at double the standard frame rate, which is 60 frames per second, or because I don't know

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,360
why camera companies do this, fifty nine point nine four frames per second.

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,280
They just kind of add that little point zero six frames per second.

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,910
I don't know.

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,930
It doesn't make sense to me.

19
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,430
But what we're going to learn here is how to slow down this footage so that when we drag it into our

20
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,960
timeline, it's automatically playing back as smooth battery B roll, slow motion footage.

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,280
Now, the first step is to highlight all of the footage that we want to adjust the frame rate playback

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,790
from.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,580
And then the next step, which you'll see why we do this in a moment, is to label it and change the

24
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,000
color.

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,840
Now, the reason we're going to do this is because now we know that all this is going to be our slow

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,800
motion footage.

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:05,640
Generally for YouTube videos, you're going to have your AROL coverage or your main interview.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,550
You talking to the camera, like what's going on right now?

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,680
And then you're going to have your cutaway shots.

30
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,870
So if it's a travel log, you have you speaking to the camera, doing your travel log thing, pointing,

31
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,620
doing whatever.

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,810
And then there's going to be footage that you shoot where you're getting slow motion footage of cars,

33
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,320
of scenery, of really cool places that you're shooting.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,000
And that's going to be your B roll or secondary shots or cutaway shots.

35
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:38,820
Now, I never and you should never shoot your normal interview talking footage at slo mo 60 frames per

36
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,190
second.

37
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,290
You should always shoot it at the normal frame it twenty three point nine, seven six.

38
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,400
So seeing this frame rate tells me that this is all my Bairo cutaway shots from my YouTube video.

39
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,620
Now I labeled it and changed the color so that I know that it's going to be my cutaway shots.

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,460
And the next step to change the frame rate so that when we play it back in the timeline, it's the cool,

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,980
slow, mo look that we want for our cutaway shots.

42
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,210
We're going to right click.

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,040
We're going to go to modify.

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,800
And we're going to interpret our footage.

45
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,660
Now, you can see at this frame rate tab, what it's doing is it's playing the footage at its normal

46
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,190
frame rate that it was shot at.

47
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,860
But what we want to do is click, assume the frame rate of this clip.

48
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,970
Now we're going to type in twenty three point nine seven six, which is going to tell the computer and

49
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,990
the editing software.

50
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:41,460
I want you to play this back as if it was normal speed footage, but it's it was shot at double the

51
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,430
speed of that normal speed footage, meaning when the clip is played back, it's going to play back

52
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,010
at half the speed of real life, which is going to give us the cool, slow mo that I've been talking

53
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,370
about.

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,120
So we put in twenty nine, twenty three point nine, seven, six, and we hit OK.

55
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,020
Now, if I were to double click this clip.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,730
And hit play.

57
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,540
Let's find a let's find a better example.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,670
You can see this is not the best example because there's not a lot of movement going on this clip.

59
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,330
But you can see it's playing back in slow motion automatically without us having to select the clips.

60
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,990
Go to the speed duration.

61
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,300
Slow it down a half speed.

62
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,180
This will give us a smooth, slow motion playback.

63
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,380
So now that we understand that the next step is to go to the remaining folders of footage that we have

64
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,840
and do that same process to all of the slow motion viral shots that we have.

65
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,850
So that when we drag everything into the timeline, it's all playing back at our desired speed.

66
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,160
So I'm going to close the folder that we just made, the update and navigate to the next folder.

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,060
Scroll.

68
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,370
And I'm looking at this frame rate column.

69
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,490
OK.

70
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,650
We have some slama footage here.

71
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,790
I'm actually the double click this first one so that we can see what it looks like.

72
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,150
OK, so normal speed, right?

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,970
You can see I'm getting some close ups.

74
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,100
And what we're going to do now is select these clips.

75
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,110
We're going to color them.

76
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,470
Let's just say Teale, and then we're going to right click, go to modify, interpret footage.

77
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:34,020
Assume the frame rate is 29 excuse me, twenty three point nine seven six instead of 60 frames a second

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,790
and hit, OK.

79
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,890
And now if we watch that same clip we were just looking at.

80
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,690
You can see it's got that nice slow motion aesthetic.

81
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,770
Now we've got one more folder in here.

82
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,180
This has got a lot of footage.

83
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,410
Oh, my gosh.

84
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:02,510
And it looks like this last folder is probably all talking footage because I don't see any slow motion

85
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,050
shots.
