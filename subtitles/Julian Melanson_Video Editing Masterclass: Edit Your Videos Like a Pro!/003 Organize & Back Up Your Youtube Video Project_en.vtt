00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.700
OK, so at this point, you should either be ready to follow along with me or if you have footage that

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.830
you're going to be editing with alongside me while I'm going through these techniques, you should have

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.750
that footage cued up on your computer and ready to pick and ready to be organized.

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.190
So let's hop in here.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
So here we have all my raw footage from my shoot for this project.

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.650
Now, it's already in three different folders because I shot it on two separate cameras.

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.420
So one camera I captured the one footage or one folder.

8
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
I captured the card from the one footage on another folder.

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.550
I captured the footage from the card on the five D.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.200
And this one is a mixture of both from a day where I was shooting all the intro shots for the project.

11
00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.940
So you can organize the sections or categories of your raw footage in folders, depending on whatever

12
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.430
way makes more sense for your project to specify that raw footage if it's all day time footage that

13
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.390
you want to keep together.

14
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.920
Put that in the daytime footage folder if it's all intro or outro footage you want to put together.

15
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.250
Put that in the folder at this step.

16
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.800
Now, the next thing that we would do would be to copy our raw footage and then navigate to a separate

17
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.790
space that's off of the hard drive that your raw footage is on so that we can have a backup separately.

18
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:47.370
So I'll create a vlog backup and then I would simply go ahead and copy this footage and paste it into

19
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.960
the backup folder.

20
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.260
And once that's done, we have our footage ready to go.

21
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.510
We have a copy of it.

22
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.010
Next up is to open up our editing software and get things cooking.

23
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.380
I'm going to go ahead and create a new project.

24
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.430
I'm going to title it filming studio vlog, because this is a project where I'm showing the behind the

25
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.170
scenes in the whole process of setting up my brand new studio.

26
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.310
So that's going to be the title.

27
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.800
And then now we're going to go to the original folder right here, and we're going to create a editing

28
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.560
software file, just like we've done before, hit, choose and hit, OK?

29
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.890
That's going to keep all of our editing assets in the proper folder.

30
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.640
Next up, we're going to drag our raw footage into our editing software.

31
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.540
And as you can see, this is a hundred and ninety eight gigs.

32
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.890
So it's going to take a second.

33
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.210
We're going to go ahead and skip forward.

34
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.270
This is why I wasn't able to transfer this specific footage from this project to you guys.

35
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.470
Perfect.

36
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.420
Now we have our raw footage in our editing software, and you're going to notice at the bottom right

37
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.330
of the screen, it says generating peech files.

38
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.750
And it's going through the different movie files that we have.

39
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.980
What that means is it's generating the audio waveforms for our different shots.

40
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.950
So depending on how much footage you have, that's we will dictate how long that process is going to

41
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.340
take.

42
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.720
You can still start your edit while this is happening, but you won't be able to sync up your footage

43
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.000
because it hasn't developed the waveforms to sync up footage to yet.

44
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.060
OK.

45
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.190
And while this is finishing generating our peak files for our footage, because there's a lot of it,

46
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.010
I actually wanted to give a little pro tip here.

47
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.920
Now, you may have noticed that while I was clicking through our raw footage, you might have noticed

48
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.450
this labeling that I did here with color on the side of our clips.

49
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.600
Now, the reason I do that.

50
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.000
So let me just explain by plugging in.

51
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.950
Kill everybody.

52
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.790
There you go.

53
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.650
By plugging in the Sieff car with footage on it, and if we navigate to the main place where the footage

54
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.820
is kept on this card.

55
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.600
We can see that I'm using these color labeling as well, so we have all of these photos from the card.

56
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.440
That are that are one color from one shoot, and then once we go down the card, we have another color

57
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.390
from a different shoot on that card.

58
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.620
So the color is telling me that it's from a specific shoot.

59
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.940
And the color is also telling me, which is very important, that this is content that I captured off

60
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.660
of the card.

61
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.870
If you've done it before, you know that sometimes you pull information, content off the card, you

62
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.700
put it on a hard drive, and then you bring out the card another time and then you don't know.

63
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.850
I did I capture that.

64
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.990
Did I not capture that?

65
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:04.480
Any time it's labeled with a color, I know 100 percent that it's been taken off the card, put on a

66
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.270
hard drive, and it's ready to be formatted or deleted off the card so that it's not taking up any extra

67
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.810
space.

68
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.400
And the card does it fill up on my next shoot, which is really important.

69
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:22.790
So if we take a look here, we can see that there's content on this card that hasn't been captured yet.

70
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.380
Why?

71
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.360
Because it doesn't have the labeling.

72
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.570
So that's just a mini protip that I wanted to give you.

73
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.310
That's going to help you as you progress to this intermediate level of editing when there's a lot of

74
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.380
different content from a lot of different shoots or scenes on multiple cards.

75
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.990
So put that trick into your editing tool kit.

76
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.730
And let's hop back into the edit.
