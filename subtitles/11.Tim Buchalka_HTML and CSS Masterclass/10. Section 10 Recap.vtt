00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.670
In this section we learned about working on the layout of a webpage.

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.350
First we looked at how we can responsively size each team out elements on our webpage to responsively

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.750
size images we can assign them percent based values for their width and height as opposed to hard coded

4
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.080
pixel values.

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.650
The max with max height properties are useful because they prevent us from scaling the images past their

6
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.190
original size.

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.550
We learned about viewport with units or the double use which we can use for our font size as opposed

8
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.580
to a hard coded pixel value.

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.640
This ensures that the text size on our Web page will be based on the size of the browser window.

10
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.120
After that we looked at how we can create menus and hetero bars for our web page by using a div as a

11
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.750
container for our web page links and then giving the div a fixed position top value of zero and with

12
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.010
of 100 percent.

13
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.530
We can ensure that our head or bottom menu is always at the top of our web page even when the user scrolls

14
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.040
down on the webpage.

15
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.680
Then we learned about bootstrap the latest version of bootstrap is bootstrapped for.

16
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.510
We learned that bootstrap is the most popular web development framework for developing web pages that

17
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.570
scale responsively and look good on mobile.

18
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.300
We also look at the lines we need to add to our HVM.

19
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.180
In order to gain access to the bootstrap framework and import it into our program next we learned about

20
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.490
how we can use bootstrap to position elements on our Web page bootstrap uses classes to give elements

21
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.370
certain functionality the container class lets us set up a container for grid the role class allows

22
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.630
us to define a role for our bootstrap grid.

23
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.800
We can add columns to our role using one of the five card class values that range from extra small devices

24
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.560
to extra large devices.

25
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.330
Bootstrap allows us to give our columns A with from 1 to 12 using the grid system we can easily lay

26
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.950
out columns at the waste we want them and we just need to make sure that each row adds up to a total

27
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.730
with 12 based on all the columns in that row.

28
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.010
Then we learned about how we can create menu items and UI and bootstrap to create a dropdown menu.

29
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.860
We use bootstraps dropdown class we can add a button that opens our dropdown menu by assigning it a

30
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.200
class of dropdown toggle and a data toggle value of dropdown to create the actual dropdown menu.

31
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.240
We use the dropdown menu class and give each item in the dropdown a class value of dropdown item.

32
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.860
We also learned how we can create a horizontal nav menu using bootstrap to create a nav menu.

33
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.850
We create an unordered list of links for our nav menu.

34
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.940
We use the nav nav item and NAV link classes to define the nav items and links for our menu to change

35
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.000
our menu from horizontal to vertical orientation.

36
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.300
We can add the flex column attribute to our opening unordered list.

37
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.260
Tag a nav bar is a menu of links placed at the top of a web page to create a nav bar.

38
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.010
We use the nav element and give it a class value of nav bar.

39
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.440
We give our unworded list a class value of nav bar nav.

40
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.210
We can also add a background to our nav bar.

41
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.840
We can easily add a dark background to our nav bar by assigning a class value of B.G. dark.

42
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.630
After that we learned how we can modify images using bootstrap we can position images to the left or

43
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.900
right of our Web page content using the float left and float right classes to give our image rounded

44
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.750
corners.

45
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.930
We can use the rounded class if we want to display our image with a round border like an ellipse or

46
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.840
circle.

47
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.140
We can use the rounded circle class if we give our image a class value of image thumbnail.

48
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.730
We can add a thumbnail border around it creating an image carousel is quick and easy using bootstraps

49
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.350
built in classes as they allow us to define the content and controls for our carrousel using a few HVM

50
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.980
Mal development.

51
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.250
After that we looked at how to modify text using bootstrap bootstrap gives us for display having classes

52
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.020
that allow us to create headings that stand out on a web page.

53
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.080
We can also easily stylize text using bootstrap bootstrap Lets as easily make text bold then or italic

54
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.460
using the font weight.

55
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.280
Bold font weight light and font.

56
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.050
Italic classes.

57
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.680
We can change the capitalization of text on our web page using the text uppercase text lowercase and

58
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.510
text capitalized classes.

59
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.950
Finally we learned about some other useful bootstrap classes.

60
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.480
We learned that we can easily add a background color to an HMO element using one of the predefined B.G.

61
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.920
classes bootstrap gives us access to.

62
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.550
Then we looked at how we can easily create and stylize buttons using bootstrap using the between classes

63
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.410
that bootstrap provides.

64
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.770
We learned how to draw attention to important content on our web page using the Jumbotron class.

65
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.390
Finally we learned about what a card is and bootstrap and how to use bootcamps card classes to our advantage

66
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.970
in the next lecture.

67
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.960
We will get hands on each team l practice building a website.
