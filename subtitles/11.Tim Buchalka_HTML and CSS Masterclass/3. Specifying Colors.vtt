00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.380
In this lecture we will dig deeper into the topic of color as we look at more ways that we can specify

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.920
color using C Ss some built in color related keywords and some of the basic concepts of color theory

3
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.820
color is extremely important in web development as it can make or break the aesthetic of your web page.

4
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.960
Some of the color names that you can use in CSSA have other keyword counterparts that specify the same

5
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.740
color.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.520
For example magenta and fuchsia are keywords for the same color for this example we will add to paragraph

7
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.300
elements to our Web page.

8
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.290
The first will have an idea of magenta text and the second will have an idea of fuchsia text.

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.160
Next we will add an opening and closing style tag to our Web page.

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.730
We will give the element with an idea of magenta text the color of magenta and the element with an idea

11
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.180
fuchsia text we will give a color of fuchsia.

12
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.530
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

13
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.010
as you can see both of our text elements are the exact same color as magenta and fuchsia both refer

14
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.170
to the same color.

15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.450
Let's jump back to the editor Additionally auction saw and are also keywords for the same color.

16
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.740
Let's change the IDs of our elements to aqua text and saw in text respectively.

17
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.190
Then we will use these IDs and give the elements their proper colors and our style code.

18
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.530
Let's go to the web browser and run our code to see the result of these changes.

19
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.480
As you can see both of the text elements are the same color.

20
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.220
This is because aqua and cyan both refer to the same color.

21
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.430
Let's go back to the editor.

22
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.380
Also note that there are two spellings of gray g r e y and G R A Y are both acceptable.

23
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.640
To illustrate this using our current code architecture we will give our first text element an idea of

24
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.280
grey text spelled out g r e y.

25
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.470
Our second paragraph element will have an idea of grey text spelled out G.R. a y we will use these ideas

26
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.000
and give our first element the color of gray g r e y.

27
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.060
And our second element the color of gray G R A Y.

28
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.760
Let's go to the web browser and vote our code as you can see both of the text elements are the color

29
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.620
gray.

30
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.910
Let's go back to the editor

31
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.240
aside from color names.

32
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.290
CSSA gives us two main color related keywords that we can use to our advantage transparent and current

33
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.110
color the transparent keyword specifies a fully transparent color.

34
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.920
The same effect can be achieved by setting the value of a color that is zero.

35
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.620
For this example we will have one paragraph element on our Web page with some example text then we will

36
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.260
give our text the color of transparent.

37
00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.680
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our text is not visible on the web page

38
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.850
since we gave it a color of transparent.

39
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.180
Let's jump back to the editor.

40
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.350
The current color gives us the current value of n elements color property.

41
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.750
If we set the color property to a color value we can use the current color keyword to specify that same

42
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.850
color to another property.

43
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.550
Let's change the color of our text to green then we will add the background color property to a paragraph

44
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.330
element and give it a value of current color.

45
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.530
This will make the background color of our element green.

46
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.180
Let's run our code in the web browser to see the result.

47
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.070
As you can see both the text color and background color green using the current color keyword allowed

48
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.340
us to use the current color of text which is green as the background color for our text.

49
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.300
Let's jump back to the editor.

50
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.620
Let's take a look at some of the basic ideas of color theory as this will lead into more CSSA scripting

51
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.990
material.

52
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.920
There are three main color systems R G B C M Y and R Y B.

53
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.110
But we will cover R G B and C and Y in this tutorial.

54
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.660
Primary colors are the main base colors in a color system that can be mixed to form every other color

55
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.420
the primary colors and the R.G. be color system or red green and blue.

56
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.440
And the primary colors in CM y are cyan magenta and yellow secondary colors are created by mixing two

57
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.590
primary colors tertiary colors are created by mixing two secondary colors.

58
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.710
Aside from the hex codes that we looked at there are also three and four digit hex codes for color code

59
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.240
has repeat values for the R G or B digits.

60
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.190
We can combine them into a three digit hex code.

61
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.070
For example the hex color code for red is faffed 0 0 0 0 0.

62
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.550
We can condense this into a three digit hex code recognized by CSX the three digit hex code would be

63
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.990
EF 0 0.

64
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.000
Let's give our a hex color of x 0 0.

65
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.990
Then we will run our code in the web browser or see the result

66
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:16.090
as you can see our text is the color red the 2 x 4 the read value were condensed to 1 to 2 0 for the

67
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.840
green value were condensed into one and the two zeros for the blue value were condensed into one.

68
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.100
Let's go back to the editor

69
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.920
this concept can also be applied to the alpha channel as well and turn into a four digit hex code.

70
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.560
Let's add a trailing zero to the current color and then run our code in the web browser.

71
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.980
As you can see our text has disappeared.

72
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.470
This is because that last zero we added at the end of our hex color represents the alpha value which

73
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.190
is zero in this case making our text invisible.

74
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.210
We will go back to the editor and look at another example.

75
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.980
There are also other color functions than those we looked at earlier.

76
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:07.690
For example the HWB function allows us to define our color using HWB HWB stands for Heugh whiteness

77
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.880
blackness.

78
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.740
Let's give our text the color value using the HWB function.

79
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.160
We will add the function name and the opening and closing parentheses and then go step by step through

80
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.810
each of the parameters.

81
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.380
This function takes four parameters the first three parameters are required.

82
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.380
The first parameter of this function is the Heugh similar to the H.S. cell function.

83
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.440
We supply the Hew as a value on the color wheel from 0 to 360.

84
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.250
We will pass a value of 240 and for the hue of the color.

85
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.100
The second parameter of this function is the value of a certain amount of white.

86
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.480
That will be mixed in with the hue given as a percent out of 100 with the percent sign after it.

87
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.660
We will give our function a whiteness value of 15 percent.

88
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.060
The third parameter of this function is the amount of black to be mixed in with the hue.

89
00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.590
It is given as a percent and as the percent sign after it we will give our element of blackness value

90
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.260
of 15 percent optional.

91
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.940
You can also supply an alpha value in the range of 0 to 1 as a decimal value.

92
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:14.750
Let's make our color half transparent by assigning an alpha value of 0.5 to see the result of the color

93
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.500
we just created using the HWB function.

94
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.680
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

95
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.850
in the next lecture we will learn about saturation and how we can apply it to images using CSF.
