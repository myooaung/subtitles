1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,380
In this section we will learn the fundamentals of each team.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,910
First we will look at what HVM is and the history of each GMO then we will look at the format of an

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,800
AGM document.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,090
Next we will learn about tags.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,240
The building blocks of each team.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,670
After that we will break down the structure of each team l code to learn about concepts like elements

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,350
and attributes and take a closer look at the syntax of HVM our code.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,960
We will then learn about page and title headings and their importance in an HMO document not only to

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
the user viewing your web page but to the search engine filtering search results.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,650
We will then look at paragraphs and text and different options we have for controlling how text is displayed

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,690
in the browser.

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,250
A look at the style attribute will benefit us in learning how we can add styles to our elements to control

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,220
how they are rendered to the browser.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,780
We will learn how to format text in HVM in terms of aligning text on our Web page and different effects

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,040
we can add to our text like highlighting and cross-out.

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,490
Next we will look at hyperlinks and how we can allow the user to click on elements like text and images

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,660
on our Web page to load.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,390
You are rolling a closer look at images and HVM will let us explore some more image display options

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,030
and how we can make parts of an image clickable.

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,340
Finally we will learn how we can add comments in our age Chimo code and then we will look at a recap

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,480
of what we learned in this section.

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,300
By the end of this section you will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts and basic

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,640
programming constructs of HVM L and you will be able to create basic web content to display on a web

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,740
page in the next lecture.

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,080
We will learn about what each animal is and some of the history behind it.
