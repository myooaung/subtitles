1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,820
In this lecture we will lay out the basic foundation for our website and include the code needed to

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,750
import bootstrap into our project.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,570
First we will led the team L5 doctype at the top of our program the signal to the browser that we are

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,120
writing HVM L5 code.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,510
After that we will put the opening and closing HVM tags into our code.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,110
We will add the language of our web page to the opening HVM l tag to specify that our web page will

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,140
be in English.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,350
We will give the langue property a value of n.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,950
Next comes the heading section for our webpage.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,140
We will add an opening and closing head tag to our code inside of the opening and closing head tags.

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,770
We want to specify the character in code and we are going to use in this case we will specify the carousel

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,390
UTF 8.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,370
We do this using the meta tag and specifying the carousel property value as UTF 8.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
The title tag is mandatory for any webpage.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,170
Remember that the title you give your web page is displayed in the tab at the top of the browser but

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,010
not visually on your web page.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,450
For this example we will call our title pizza Web site.

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,970
The next four lines of code will come after the title but still within the head tags of our web page

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,750
they are used for importing bootstrapped for into our project.

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:29,920
The first line will be a link to the bootstrap for CSSA style sheet.

21
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:38,050
The second line imports Che Querrey into our program.

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:47,840
The third line imports the popper J s library into our project.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,970
The fourth line imports the bootstrap for javascript library into our project

24
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,100
under the closing head tag.

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:05,260
We will put an opening and closing body tag the closing body tag will come before the closing HVM Elkhead.

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,360
Now that we have set up the basic outline for a web page we are ready to jump into developing it in

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,680
the next lecture and the next lecture.

28
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,740
We will add a header bar to our webpage.
