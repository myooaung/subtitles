1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,630
In this lecture, we will learn about CSX entities, CSX.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,430
And these are combinations that allow us to display characters in HDMI.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,600
There are many, many CSX entities.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,090
But we will cover some cool ones in this lecture.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,960
The format for a CSX entity is as follows open, quote, escape character for characters that are letters

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,590
or numbers.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,970
And finally, a closing quote for the first set of examples we are going to look at.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,990
Let's create a paragraph element with some example text inside of it to start things off.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,270
Next, we will add an opening and closing style tag to our page so that we can write some style code

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,240
inside of our style tags.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,870
We will add a style to the paragraph element and use the before pseudo class to specify that we want

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,820
to insert content before our text.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,200
We will also use the CSX entity code to six to F to display a yin and yang symbol before our text.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,900
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,740
As you can see, there is now a yin and yang symbol to the left of our paragraph element.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,780
Let's jump back to the editor.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,290
There are tons of CSX entities that we can use to insert cool characters into our Web page content if

18
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,650
we want to, instead of playing cards speed symbol before our text.

19
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,840
We can change the code to two six six zero and run the code to see the change.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,220
As you can see, there is a speed symbol to the left of the text.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,860
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example to insert a club playing card symbol

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,730
before the text.

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,280
We use the code two six six three.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,350
Let's change the code to two six six three and then go to the Web browser and run our code.

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,630
We will see a club to the left hand side of our text.

26
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,220
Let's jump back to the editor.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,110
A code of two six six five allows us to add the heart playing cards symbol.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,800
We will change the code to two six six five and then wrote our code in the Web browser.

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,770
You will notice that a heart symbol is now displayed to the left of our text.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,540
Let's go back to the editor.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,140
Changing the code to a two six six six will let us say the plane code diamond character to our text.

32
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,390
We will change the code to two six six six and then go to the Web browser and run our code.

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,510
As you can see, there is now a diamond on the right hand side of the text.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,350
We will now go back to the editor.

35
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,490
Want to add all four characters in a row before our text.

36
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,130
Simply add all of the codes to the content.

37
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:42,090
We will add the code to six six zero two six six three two six six five and two six six six, all to

38
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,050
a string of content.

39
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,860
Of course, don't forget the escape character before each.

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's go to the web browser and run our code to see the result.

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,210
You will notice that all four playing cards, symbols are now displayed on the left hand side of the

42
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,690
text.

43
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,490
Let's jump back to the editor.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,740
To add a music note to our content, we can use the character code two six six be.

45
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,170
Let's change the code to two six six B and then go to the Web browser.

46
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,530
When we run our code, you will notice that a music notice now displayed to the left of our paragraph

47
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:14,830
element.

48
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,770
Let's go back to the editor.

49
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,260
If you want to add a warning similar before the text content, you can use the CFS entity Code two six

50
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,010
eight zero.

51
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,440
We will change the code to two six eight zero and then run our code in the Web browser.

52
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,770
Now there is a warning sign to the left of our text.

53
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,510
Let's go back to the editor.

54
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,860
Another cool thing we can do with these CSX entities is to use them as bullet points for lists that

55
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,430
we create.

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,220
To illustrate this concept, let's say at an unordered list to our code and give it three list elements.

57
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Item one, item two, an item three.

58
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,750
Then we will change the style to a plug to the ally tag instead of the P tag.

59
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,500
We will also give our ally element a list style type of none.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,810
We need to do this in a new block of code since the current block is using the before pseudo class.

61
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,450
Let's use the entity code two seven one four to add a checkmark character before each item in the list

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,340
to see the result of these changes.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,260
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,590
You will notice that a checkmark is next to each item in the list.

65
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,870
Now let's jump back to the editor.

66
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,730
If we want to add a checkmark with a different look and feel to it, we can use another checkmark entity

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,680
that has a code of two seven oh five.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,300
Let's change the code to two seven oh five and then run our code in the Web browser to see our change

69
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,020
take effect.

70
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,950
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example, some CSX entities are arrows.

71
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,560
These also make for good list item markers.

72
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,430
Let's change the entity code to two one D2 and run our code to see the result.

73
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,560
There is now an arrow next to each item in the list.

74
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,480
Then we will jump back to the editor.

75
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,440
Another style of Arrow has entity code two one nine two.

76
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,550
Let's change the code to two one nine two and then run our code in the Web browser to see the result.

77
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,790
Then we will jump back to the other.

78
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,330
Another useful entity for drawing attention to list items is a hand with a finger pointing at the list

79
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:13,630
item.

80
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,680
This entity has a code of two six Wante one.

81
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,490
We run the code.

82
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,410
You will see what this looks like in the Web browser.

83
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,070
Since there is a lot of detail in this entity, you may have to zoom in to see it clearly.

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,060
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

85
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,900
We can also use CSX entities as content.

86
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,060
At the end of our element, let's go back to using a paragraph element with example text inside of it.

87
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:43,210
Then we will change our style to use that after Shuto class on the paragraph element to add an ellipsis

88
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,300
character, we can use the entity code two oh two six.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Let's go to the Web browser and run our code.

90
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,900
Now, there is an ellipsis character on the right hand side of our text.

91
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,240
Let's jump back to the editor.

92
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,520
If we want to add a double exclamation point after our text, we could use the entity code two or three.

93
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,100
We will change the code to two or three C and then run our code in the browser to see the result.

94
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,540
As you can see, there is now a double exclamation mark to the right of our text.

95
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,140
There are many more CSX entities that you can use.

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,280
This video just showed an example of how to use some of them in the next lecture.

97
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,200
We will learn about CSX unit.
