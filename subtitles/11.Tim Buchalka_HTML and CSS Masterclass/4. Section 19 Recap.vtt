00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.530
In this section we learned how to stylize lists using CSSA.

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.530
First we learned several properties that CSSA gives us to modify the style of lists the list style type

3
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.430
property allows us to specify the type of marker used for the items in our list for unordered lists

4
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:31.560
we can assign the list style type property several values including desk circle square or none of value

5
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.690
of Disc. will mark the items in our list with Feldon bullet points of value of circle will mark the

6
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.530
items in our list as hollow circles without the center filled in a value of Square.

7
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.100
We'll mark the items in a list with square bullet points giving the list style type property a value

8
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.740
of None will remove markers from our list items ordered lists can have several other values for the

9
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.530
list style type property assigning the list style type property value of decimal will number the items

10
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.690
in the list of value of decimal leading 0 will number the items in the list with the leading zero in

11
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.840
front of the number of value of lower alpha to the list style type property will add lower case letters

12
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.930
next to each item in the list giving the list style type property value of up or Alpha will mark each

13
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.050
item in the list with an uppercase letter of value of lower Rollman to the list style type property

14
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.720
will add lowercase Roman numerals next to each item in the list.

15
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.990
A value of upper Rollman to the list style type property will add upper case roman numerals next to

16
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.390
each item in the list.

17
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.220
The list style image property lets us mark the items in an unordered list with a custom image as opposed

18
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.050
to a bullet point shaped as a desk circle or a square.

19
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.730
The list style position property lets us specify of the list the item marker should be placed inside

20
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.970
or outside of the list item element the list style property allows us to specify the list style type

21
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.150
position and image all in one.

22
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.120
After that we learned how to add color to our lists.

23
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.630
We learned that we can add color to both the entire list and each list item.

24
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.290
We also learned how to differentiate between applying styles to an unordered lists items versus an ordered

25
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.650
list items if both are in a web page in the next section.

26
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.540
We will learn about creating animations using SS.
