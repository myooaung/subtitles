00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.530
In this lecture we will learn about the mouse events that each female gives us access to the mouse events

2
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.690
that a [REMOVED] gives us access to or on click on double click on mouse down on mouse move on mouse out

3
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.970
on mouse over on mouse up and on mouse wheel for these examples.

4
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.860
We will add a paragraph element with the on click attribute specifying a function we will write next.

5
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.990
Then we will add some example text to the paragraph element we will add an opening and closing script

6
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.550
tag.

7
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
Then we will create or function and make it display an alert that says fire in a mouse event.

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.820
If the user performs the mouse event that we specify the On Click event fires when the user clicks an

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.780
element.

10
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.830
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

11
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.950
when we click on the element you will notice that the alert is displayed.

12
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.670
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

13
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.690
The on double click event fires when the user double clicks on an element.

14
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.210
Next we will go to the web browser and run our code

15
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760
when we double click on the element.

16
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.860
You will notice that the alert is displayed.

17
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.350
Let's jump back to the editor

18
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.850
the on mouse down event fires when the mouse button is pressed down on an element.

19
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.320
Next we will go to the web browser and run our code

20
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.300
by pressing the left mouse button while the cursor is over the element.

21
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.300
You will notice that the alert is fired.

22
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.390
Let's jump back to the editor on mouse move is a mouse event that fires when the mouse cursor moves.

23
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.830
And it has over an element.

24
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.110
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

25
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.570
when we move the mouse and the cursor is over our element.

26
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.850
You will notice that the alert is displayed.

27
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.940
Let's jump back to the editor the on mouse out event fires when the user moves the cursor off of an

28
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.840
element.

29
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.680
Let's go to the web browser and run our code when we move the mouse cursor off of the element.

30
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.560
You will notice that the alert is displayed.

31
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:32.270
Let's jump back to the editor the on mouse over event fires when the user moves the cursor over an element.

32
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.800
Next we will go to the web browser and run our code when we move the cursor over the text.

33
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.930
You will notice that the alert is displayed.

34
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.520
Let's jump back to the editor the mouse up event fires when the user releases the mouse button over

35
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.420
an element.

36
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.780
Let's go to the web browser and run our code when we release the mouse button while the cursor is over

37
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.360
our element.

38
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.710
You will notice that the alert is displayed.

39
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.520
Let's jump back to the editor the on wheel event fires when the mouse wheel rolls up or down over an

40
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.430
element.

41
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.340
Next we will go to the web browser and run our code.

42
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.120
If we move the mouse wheel while the cursor is over an element you will notice that the killer is displayed

43
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.020
HVM ellos mouse events are useful when we want to write code that will fire based on mouse actions and

44
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.300
the next lecture we will learn about drag events in HVM L..
