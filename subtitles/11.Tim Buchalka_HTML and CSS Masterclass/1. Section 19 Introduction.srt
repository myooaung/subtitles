00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,550
In this section we will learn about how we can stylize HDMI lists using CSSA.

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,970
First we will learn about several list properties that we can use to modify the style of ordered and

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,650
unordered lists.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,530
We learned how to customize the type image and position of list markers or bullet points that appear

5
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,830
next to each item in a list.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,530
After that we will learn how to add color to the different parts of our list.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,680
We will look at how we can add a background color to the whole list and also specify a background color

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,730
for just the list element by the end of this section.

00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:47,240
You will have an understanding of how to use CSSA style customize and color HDMI lists and the next

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,050
