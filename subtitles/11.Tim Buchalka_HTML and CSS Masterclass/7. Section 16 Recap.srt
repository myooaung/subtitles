00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,070
In this section we learned about color and how we can use the properties and functions that CSSA provides

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,340
us to modify the color of HVM elements.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,260
We first learned about what types of elements can be colored as we know text can be colored using the

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,200
color property the CSSA background color property can be used to give a background color to any HVM

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,700
element.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,960
Next we looked at assigning a border collie using the border color property.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,030
We learned how we can specify colors for individual parts of the border by using the border top color

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,710
border right color border bottom color and border left color properties to add color to our columns.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,050
We can use the column rule color property to add color to a carrot in an input field.

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,870
We can use the carrot color property.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,900
Next we look deeper at how we can specify colors using C.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,950
We learned about some alias's for color names that specified the same color like magenta and fuchsia

13
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,110
or aqua and cyan.

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:10,010
We also learned about two important color keywords and CSSA transparent and current color transparent

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,650
allows us to specify a fully transparent color current color is a keyword used to reference the color

16
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,380
specified in that element's color attribute.

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,940
We also looked at some of the basic ideas of color theory as they apply to web development.

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:30,260
We learned that there are three types of colors primary secondary and tertiary Primary Colors are the

19
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,260
main base colors of a color system.

20
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,830
Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors tertiary colors are created by mixing two

21
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,640
secondary colors.

22
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:48,320
We also looked at how we can condense six and eight digit hex colors into three and four digit hex colors.

23
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,750
We learned about another color system the hue whiteness blackness color system and how we can use the

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,050
HWB function to specify colors using this color system.

25
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:04,160
After that we learned about saturation saturation refers to the amount of pigment in a color or intensity

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,610
of the color the saturate function allows us to modify the saturation of an image if we supply this

27
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,610
function of low value it will lower the saturation of an image if we apply this function of high value

28
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,870
it will increase the saturation of an image.

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,480
Then we learned about opacity the level of transparency an image has CSSA gives us the opacity property

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,500
to modify the opacity of an image.

31
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,730
Finally we learned about how we can apply filters to image elements by using the filter properties see

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,270
SS The Blur filter allows us to blur our image a specified amount the brightness filter allows us to

33
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:47,420
modify the brightness of our image a specified amount the contrast filter allows us to modify the contrast

34
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,690
of our image to drop shadow filter allows us to add a drop shadow to our image the grayscale filter

35
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,510
allows us to modify the scale of our image the hue rotate filter allows us to rotate the hue of our

36
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,840
image the invert filter lenses to invert the color samples in our image the set the filter allows us

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,590
to convert the image to a set the tone the opacity filter allows us to modify the opacity of our image

38
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,010
to saturate filter allows us to modify the saturation of the image we can assign multiple values to

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,670
the filter property to combine filter effects on our image.

40
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:29,150
We can also specify a filter value of None to display the image without any filter applied in the next

41
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,760
section.

42
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,720
We will learn about CSSA properties.
