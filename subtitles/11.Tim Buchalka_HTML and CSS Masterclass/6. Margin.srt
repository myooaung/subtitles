00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,040
In this lecture we will learn about the margin properties that CSSA allows us to animi CSSA allows us

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,630
to animate the margin margin bottom margin left margin right and margin top properties.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,890
For this example we will animate the margin top property to make the text move down on our webpage.

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,370
First we will create the text that we will use in this animation.

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,480
Next we will add our opening and closing style tags to our text.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,270
We will add an animation called text and Im a duration of two seconds and make it loop by using the

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,560
infinite key word.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,110
Next we will write the code for the animation we will call our animation text and im and we will make

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,010
it animate from a margin top value of zero pixels to a margin top value of 100 pixels.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,260
When we run the code we should see the text move down on all web page

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,250
and the next lecture we will learn about the padding properties that CSSA allows us to animi.
