00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.040
In this lecture we will learn about the tigs new to HVM L5.

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.580
Several of these tags we learned about during this course already.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.810
So we will just review those tags briefly any tags that are new to each team L5 and haven't yet been

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.480
covered we will cover in detail many of the media tags that we learned about in the embedding media

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.490
section of this course are new to HVM L5.

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.670
These tags are audio source and video the audio tag allows us to embed audio into our web page that

7
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.870
the user can listen to the track tag is another new addition as of HVM L5 and can be used to add subtitles

8
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.090
or captions to audio or video files.

9
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.260
The embed tag is used as a container for plug ins or interactive content that we can add to our webpage

10
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.700
on the HTL graphic side of things we already learned about two new additions canvas and SVGA other new

11
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.680
tags that we have already covered.

12
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:18.290
Our article aside details fig caption figure footer header Mark menu item nav summary and section.

13
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.460
Let's learn about some of the new tags to HVM L5 that we haven't covered beady eyes issue of bi directional

14
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.150
isolation and the be-I tag is used to isolate a part of the text that could be formatted in a different

15
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.200
direction than the surrounding text.

16
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.020
This particularly comes in handy when embedding certain language texts like Arabic to our Web page.

17
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.040
Since Arabic is written from right to left the dialog tag allows us to create pop up boxes and modals

18
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.510
on our Web page to see an example of this.

19
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.030
Let's.

20
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.080
First they had an opening and closing dialog tag to our Web page.

21
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.510
The content that we had between these tags is displayed within the dialog window.

22
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.090
Then we will add the open attribute which tells the browser that the dialog box is open and displayed

23
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.560
on our Web page.

24
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.340
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

25
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.910
We should see the dialog displayed on our Web page.

26
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.360
Then we will jump back to the editor.

27
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.650
The main tag is used to define the main content on a webpage.

28
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.960
Each web page can have only one main element on it.

29
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.780
Anything inside of the main element should be unique to the document.

30
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.440
For this example we will add an H1 element and a P element inside of our main element.

31
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.380
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

32
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.930
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

33
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.990
The meter tag allows us to display a gauge on our webpage.

34
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.670
Let's add an opening and closing meter tag to our code.

35
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.840
Then we will use the value property and provide a decimal value between 0 and 1 percent of the gauge

36
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.570
that will be displayed as full.

37
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.350
Let's jump over to the web browser

38
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.460
when we run the code.

39
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.180
You will see the gaged displayed as 50 percent full we will then go back to the editor the progress

40
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.000
tag allows us to display a progress bar on a webpage.

41
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.780
We used a value attribute to show the current value of the progress bar and the max value to represent

42
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.600
the maximum value that the bar goes up to in order to be full.

43
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:39.380
In this example we will give our progress bar a value of 40 and a max value of 100.

44
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.400
Then we will go to the web browser when we run our code in the browser.

45
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.450
You will see that the progress bar is 40 percent full.

46
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.890
Let's jump back to the editor the time tag allows us to define a human readable date or time.

47
00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.160
This tag also makes it possible for programs to send time based alerts and reminders to users and also

48
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.350
helps search engines to display better results.

49
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.890
We have the option of adding the time as content to be displayed or using the date time attribute and

50
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.720
giving it a date time value.

51
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.050
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code as you can see the time that we typed is displayed on

52
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.290
our Web page.

53
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.600
We will go back to the editor

54
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.560
the WB our tag specifies where it would be okay to add a line break.

55
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.070
WB stands for word break opportunity.

56
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.650
It helps to prevent the browser from cutting off long words making the text less clear for the reader

57
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.660
by adding one or more WB elements to a long line of text.

58
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.830
We get help to ensure that the web browser breaks at specific places.

59
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.670
Let's go to the web browser when we run our code in the web browser we can resize the browser and observe

60
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.170
the breaks in the text that happened at the places that we specified.

61
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.890
The WDR element

62
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.880
in the next lecture we will recap what we learned in the section of the course.
