00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,540
In this lecture we will learn about pseudo elements in CSSA we use pseudo elements to style specific

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,860
parts of an element.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:20,320
There are five pseudo elements in C Ss before after first letter first line and selection double for

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,480
pseudo element allows us to insert something before the content of an element to illustrate an example

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,000
of this.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,180
Let's create a paragraph element with some text content then we will use the before pseudo element on

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,310
our paragraph tag and specify content that should be put before the current content of example text.

8
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,300
For this example let's add a hyphen or dash character before the text.

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,310
When we run our code you will see that the hyphen is displayed before the text.

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,790
Let's go back to the editor the after studio element lets us insert something after the content of an

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,490
element.

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,240
Let's go back to our example and change the before pseudo element to after then when we run our code

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,100
in the web browser you will notice the hyphen inserted after the text.

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,280
Then we will jump back to the editor.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,650
The first letter pseudo element selects the first letter of our text to apply a style to let's modify

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,600
our example code so that it uses the first letter pseudo element and changes the color of the first

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,170
letter of our text to read.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,300
When we run our code.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,700
Now we should see that in our example text be the color red and the rest of the letters be the default

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,570
color black.

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,790
Let's go back to the editor using the first line pseudo element.

22
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,090
We can add a style to the first line of a block of text.

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,540
Let's change the first letter pseudo element in our example code to first line.

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,010
Then when we run our code you will notice that the whole line of text is now the color red.

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,280
Then we will go back to the editor the selection pseudo element modifies the style of the part of an

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,590
element selected by the user.

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,070
Let's change our pseudo element in our example code to selection.

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,690
Then when we run our code and select the portion of the text you will notice that the text that we select

29
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,550
is change to the color red in the next lecture.

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,830
We will recap what we learned in this section of the core.
