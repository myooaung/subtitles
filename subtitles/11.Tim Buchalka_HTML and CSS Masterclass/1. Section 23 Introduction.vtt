00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.320
In this section we will learn about selectors and pseudo classes and CSSA selectors allow us to specify

2
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.680
what elements to apply styles to suit all classes or selectors that allow us to define special status

3
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.910
for our element.

4
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.670
For example there are pseudo classes that allow us to detect if the user hovers their mouse cursor over

5
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.120
an element or if the user selects an element first we will learn about some general selectors that CSL

6
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.780
gives us to select which elements to apply styles to then we will look at pseudo classes that depend

7
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.400
on user input.

8
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.380
After that we will learn about pseudo classes that allow us to select elements based on their element

9
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.770
type and attributes then we will learn about pseudo classes that apply to lynx or anchor elements.

10
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.820
Finally we will learn about pseudo elements by the end of this section you will understand what pseudo

11
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.290
classes are and how they use them in your CSSA code to add states to your HVM elements in the next lecture.

12
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.960
We will learn about general selectors and see SS.
