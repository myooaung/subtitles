00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.820
In this lecture we will learn how to animate our button using success.

2
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.840
We will cover how to create a button pulse animation for when the button is idle and a button press

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.150
animation for when the user clicks the button first we will create a button element using the button

4
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.950
tag inside of the opening and closing button tags we will type the text that will be displayed on our

5
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.640
button.

6
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.730
We will specify the type of our button to be button.

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.750
Next we will write our style code.

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.920
We will specify some styles to apply to a button element.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.680
The width will be 100 pixels and the height will be thirty pixels.

10
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
We will also write some code in preparation for our animation.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.310
We will specify the animation name to be pulse the animation duration to be 1 second and the animation

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.680
iteration count to be infinite.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.930
Next we will write the code for the animation we will name our animation pulse.

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.600
We will specify keyframes for our animation when specifying keyframes we can use percentages to specify

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.550
at what point during the duration of the animation.

16
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.280
A property has a certain value to create or a button pulse animation.

17
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.850
We will animate the scale of our button using the transform property at 0 percent the first keyframe

18
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.380
we will give our button a scale of 1.

19
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.030
We will do the same for the keyframes at 30 percent and 40 percent on the middle keyframe 50 percent

20
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.590
we will specify a value of 1.10 at keyframes 60 percent 70 percent and 80 percent.

21
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.980
We will give our button a scale of 1.

22
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.030
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

23
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.710
as you can see our button in its idle state is now pulsing on our Web page.

24
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.280
Let's go back to the editor

25
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.860
next.

26
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.760
Let's look at how we can create a button press defect to do this.

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.910
We are going to utilize the CSSA hover and active selectors.

28
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.310
We will start with the same basic button element as we created before we will give our button a background

29
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.750
of white and a box shadow of 10 pixels on the bottom.

30
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.860
We will also give our button with 100 pixels and a height of 50 pixels.

31
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.180
We will lead the hover selector to our element and define what will happen when the user hovers over

32
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.350
the button.

33
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.090
In this case let's change the background color to gray when the user hovers over it.

34
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.620
We will use the active selector to define the behavior when the user clicks the button.

35
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.730
We will change the button background to black add a box shadow of 5 pixels on the bottom and translate

36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.660
our button for pixels in the y direction.

37
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.930
Now when we run the code we can click on the button in our browser and see the button appear to click

38
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.490
in 3D in the next lecture.

39
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.400
We will recap what we have learned in this section of the course.
