00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.310
In this section we will learn about how to debug HVM l code.

2
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.590
It is important that all programmers understand how to find and fix errors in their code as errors are

3
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.000
an unavoidable part of programming.

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.300
The quicker you become at fixing errors the quicker you will be able to write effective code.

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.810
First we will learn what debugging is we will understand common terms related to debugging and the larger

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.870
role that debugging plays in programming.

7
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.850
Then we will learn about some common HVM errors and how to fix them.

8
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.460
We will look at what each error means possible causes of the error and the approach for fixing the error.

9
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.010
Finally we will look at how to use an h m l validator to find errors in our code.

10
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.830
By the end of this section you will have a better understanding of common H.T. M-L errors how to fix

11
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.860
them and the ability to use debugging tools and techniques to figure out how to fix other errors you

12
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.150
may encounter during your journey as a web developer and the next lecture.

13
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.130
We will learn about what debugging is.
