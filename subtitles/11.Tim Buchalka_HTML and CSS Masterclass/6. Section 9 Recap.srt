1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,840
In this section we learned about events and HMO events and H-G MLA or used to call a function when the

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,210
user performs a certain action.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,870
First we looked at keyboard event the keyboard events.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:24,700
HTL gives us access to her auntie down on key press and Auntie up the auntie down event is fired when

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,520
the user presses a key down on the keyboard the on key press event is fired between the on down and

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:37,570
on key up event the on up event is fired when the user releases a key Tomales keyboard events on key

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,540
down on key press and on key up are useful when we want to run code when the user presses a key on the

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,670
keyboard.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,690
After that we learned about mouse events the mouse events each Chmela gives us access to her on click

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:59,440
on double click on mouse down on mouse move on mouse out on mouse over on mouse up and on wheel the

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,720
On Click event fires when the user clicks on an element the on double click event fires when the user

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,850
double clicks on an element the on mouse down event fires and the mouse button is pressed down on an

13
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,640
element the on mouse move is a mouse event that fires the mouse cursor moves and is over an element

14
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:23,440
on mass out event fires when the user moves the cursor off of the element the on mouse over event fires

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,930
when the user moves the cursor over an element the on mouse up event fires when the user releases the

16
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,820
mouse button over an element the on wheel event fires and the mouse wheel rolls up or down over an element.

17
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,470
HVM Ellas mouse events are useful I don't want to write code that will fire based on mouse actions.

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,140
Then we learned about drag events.

19
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:54,250
Each team has drag events or on Drag start on drag on drag and on drag enter on drag over on drag leave

20
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,660
and on drop the Ondrea starter event is fired when the user starts to drag the element the on drag event

21
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,660
is fired when the elementis dragged the on drag and the event is run at the end of the drag the.

22
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,660
Enter event is run when an element is drag to a drop target on drag.

23
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:20,680
Over is a drag event that is fired when an element is created over a drop target the on drag leave event

24
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,170
is run when an element leaves a drop target the On Drop event is run.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,960
When an element is dropped HVM those drag events are useful when we want to code functionality around

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,830
dragging and dropping elements on the web page.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,800
Finally we learned about clipboard events the HMO clipboard events are on copy on paste and on cut the

28
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,730
on copy event is fired when the user copies an element the on paste event fires when the user pastes

29
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,780
content into an element the on cut event is fired when the user cuts the contents of an element.

30
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,940
The h t m l clipboard events are useful when you want to fire an event when the user copies pastes or

31
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,380
cuts the contents of an element in the next section.

32
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,090
We will learn about layouts and web pages and HVM Mel.
