00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.290
In this lecture we will learn about CSSA syntax.

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.840
Let's take a closer look at the syntax of CSSA code.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.080
There are three ways that we can reference in each DML element we can access the element by Tag ID or

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.600
class when we want to access an element by tag we simply type the tag name.

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.390
For this example let's add a paragraph element to a web page and give it some text content.

6
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.700
Then we will add an opening style tag specifying the paragraph element tag name and then give our text

7
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.110
the color of blue.

8
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.190
Finally we will add a closing style tag by specifying the paragraph tag name.

9
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.510
We are telling the browser to render any paragraph elements on our Web page the color blue.

10
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.680
Let's go to the web browser and write our code

11
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.270
as you can see our text is blue as a result of the code we just wrote.

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.890
Let's jump back to the editor when we reference an element by using the name of the tag like this.

13
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.230
We're using the elements selector to get access to the HVM element the selectors the thing outside of

14
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.710
the curly braces that tells us which HVM out element to modify.

15
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.900
In this case the P is considered the element selector.

16
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.450
We can also reference an element by ID to reference an HMO element by its ID.

17
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.680
We need to put a hash tag or pound symbol followed by the ID value.

18
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.410
Let's give our paragraph element an idea of tax and then use this idea to color our text blue.

19
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.700
We will use the pound symbol followed by the idea of the element.

20
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.520
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our text is now the color blue.

21
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.300
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

22
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.990
In this case the hash tag text is called an ID selector.

23
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.700
Remember that each ID that you use should only be used once and can never be reused by another element

24
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.310
in your HVM code.

25
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.210
The third way that we can reference each tremelo elements using CSSA is by class.

26
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.000
Let's change the ID attribute to the class attribute.

27
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.980
We will also change the pound symbol to a period before the class moon when we run our code in a web

28
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.550
browser.

29
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.910
We can see that it is blue.

30
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.380
Let's jump back to the other.

31
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.340
In this case dot text is called The Class selector.

32
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.580
Remember that we put a period in front of the name of the class we want to reference.

33
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.680
Note that if we have more than one element we want to apply the exact same style to.

34
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.990
We can use multiple selectors and separate them by commas.

35
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.530
Let's change the code so that we have two paragraph elements with the example text inside of them.

36
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.490
We will give the first element an idea of text and the second element an idea of text 2 to stylize both

37
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.770
of these elements we will first use the pound symbol followed by the idea of the first element which

38
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.530
is text.

39
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.230
Then we will add a comma and do the same for the idea of the second element.

40
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.140
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as we can see both of the text elements are displayed in

41
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.510
blue.

42
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.980
Let's jump back to the editor after the selector and see SS There is an opening and closing curly brace

43
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.470
as you can see within the curly braces.

44
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.900
We have what we call declarations when a property is assigned a value or style it is called a declaration.

45
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.000
And this example our declaration is specifying that the color property should have a value of blue color

46
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.430
is the property followed by a colon followed by the value which is blue in this case.

47
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.170
And the declaration is ended with the semi-colon all together.

48
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.500
That statement is one declaration.

49
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.440
We can also add multiple declarations inside of the curly braces.

50
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.500
For example if we wanted to write a line the text we could add a declaration to assign the value right

51
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.650
to the property tax the line.

52
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.830
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

53
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.290
as you can see not only is our text the color blue but it is now right aligned on our Web page.

54
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.670
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example

55
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.530
CSSA also supports comments.

56
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.250
Remember comments are code that isn't executed but is used by the developer to make notes to themselves

57
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.510
or other developers or during testing to figure out what line might be throwing an hour to write a comment

58
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.900
and CSX used forward slash asterisk followed by the text of the comment.

59
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.570
Once you have finished typing the text for the comment code the comment with an asterisk followed by

60
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.770
a forward slash.

61
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.020
Usually programming languages have different syntax for specifying single line and multi-line comments

62
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.560
however comments in CSSA have the same syntax whether they are single line or multi line in the next

63
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.220
lecture we will learn about what cascading order is in C Ss.
