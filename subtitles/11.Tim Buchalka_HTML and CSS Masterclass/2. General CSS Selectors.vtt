00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.940
In this lecture we will learn about some of the general selectors that CSSA gives us access to selectors

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.180
allow us to select which elements to apply styles to so far and this course we looked at the selectors

3
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.620
for an element ID and class recall that to apply a style to all elements of a certain type.

4
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.520
We use the element name to apply a style to an element with a certain ID.

5
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.280
We use the hash tag symbol followed by the ID if we want to apply a style to elements that belong to

6
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.750
a certain class we can use a period followed by the name of the class.

7
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.820
In this lecture we are going to expand our knowledge of selectors and explore some of the other selectors

8
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.350
that CSSA gives us access to for these examples.

9
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.610
First let's create three paragraph elements that we can apply styles to using the asterisk selector

10
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.000
we can apply a style to all elements on our Web page.

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.100
For example if we wanted to change the color of each element on our Web page to blue we could use the

12
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.290
following code.

13
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.950
First we had the opening and closing style tags.

14
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.000
Then we use the asterisk selector and type the style that we want to apply to all the elements on our

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.860
Web page.

16
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.190
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the style was applied to all three paragraph

17
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.990
elements.

18
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.130
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

19
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.530
If we want to apply the same style to elements of different types we can separate the element types

20
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.840
by commas.

21
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.280
Let's change one of our paragraphs elements to a development.

22
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.950
Now we can change our style for our selector we will add a P followed by a comma and then div.

23
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.990
This tells CSSA to apply our style to all paragraph elements and all of our development.

24
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.360
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

25
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.970
As you can see the blue color was applied to both the div and the paragraph elements on our webpage.

26
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.600
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

27
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.720
If we put two element names next to each other without a comma it means to select any of the second

28
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.190
element that are inside of the first element.

29
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.820
For this example let's remove the comma between the P and div elements selectors and then put the div

30
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.970
selector before the p selector then we will modify our HVM to have our paragraph element inside of our

31
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.050
development.

32
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.880
When we run our code in the browser you will see that the style only applies to the paragraph element

33
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.250
inside of the development.

34
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.470
So example text 2 is rendered in blue on our Web page.

35
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.610
Let's jump back to the editor.

36
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.820
We can also select elements to apply styles to based on the attributes that they have to do so we can

37
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.560
use square brackets and add the attribute name inside of them.

38
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.670
Let's take Argive out of the paragraph tag and change our code so that we have three paragraph tags

39
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.870
the way we did at the start of the video.

40
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.580
Next we will lead the title attribute to the first paragraph tag that has the content example text 1.

41
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.350
Next we will change the selector to be title Inside of square brackets when we run our code in the browser.

42
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.810
You can see that this Starla is only applied to our first paragraph tag the one that has the title attribute

43
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.340
in it.

44
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.850
Let's go back to the editor.

45
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.880
We can also select elements based on their attribute value.

46
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.520
For this example we will add the title attribute to all three of our paragraph tags.

47
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.970
Then we will change our style so that it only applies to an element that has a title value of x 2.

48
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.520
When we run our code in the browser you can see that the color of the second element changed to blue

49
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.190
and the next lecture we will learn about the pseudo classes that CSSA gives us that work with user input.
