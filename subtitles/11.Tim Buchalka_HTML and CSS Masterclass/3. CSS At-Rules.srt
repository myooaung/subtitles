00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,200
In this lecture we will learn about some CSSA rules.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,780
What they do and how to use them.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,930
We have already seen that keyframes rule in action when we created animations in previous sections using

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,310
SS that character that rule is used to define the character set used for that particular style sheet.

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,920
Usually you will be using the UTF 8 character set.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,730
There are a few peculiarities that you should be aware of when using this rule.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,920
It has to be the first element at the very top of your style sheet and can't have any characters before

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,510
it.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,020
It also must have double quotes around its value.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,110
Only one space between the rule and the value and have a semi-colon right after the last double quote.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,150
This rule also has to be directly on a CSSA style sheet and not embedded inside of the style tags and

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,910
in HVM file.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,870
Here's an example of a valid care said declaration or rather at rule that we can use in CSSA is import.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,900
This rule is used to import styles from another style sheet for use in this style sheet just like we

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,360
can link CSSA files to HGL files.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,390
So yes as files can also be linked to other CSSA files using the import app rule one peculiarity to

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,740
be careful of the ordering of these rules.

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,100
If your stylesheet uses both the carer set an important rule the carousel rule comes first and then

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,920
the import rule comes next.

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,450
If your stylesheet just uses an import rule but no Chrisette rule the import rule needs to come before

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,800
any other styles that you specify.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,330
Another usual CSSA rule is the font face out rule which allows us to import fonts to use in our stylesheet.

23
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,220
This rule saves us from depending on only font files that users have on their computers.

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,200
This rule gives us the ability to import fonts from online and also from our local machine.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,590
The font family lets us specify a name for our font.

26
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,610
The source property lets us specify that you are l where the font is located.

27
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,780
Note that these are just some of the rules that CSSA gives us.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,030
However many of the other rules have very specific use cases in the next lecture.

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,560
We will look at a recap of what we learned in this section.
