00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,020
In this section we've got hands on practice using the CSSA concepts that we learned in the second half

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,790
of the course first.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,860
We stylize the header bar and added some color to it.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,060
We used the link selector to modify the color of the links when they are uncloaked on our Web page.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,490
We also used the visited select to change the color of the visited links on our Web page.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,880
The hover selector was used to change the color of our links when the user hovers over them.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,300
We also used to be active selector to change the color of our links when the user clicks on them.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,490
Then we like the home page.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,950
We use the keyframes rule to create animations we animated the pizza guy and used the transform property

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,410
to modifier elements or rotation.

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,340
Next we animated the just open sign to make the border become rounded and unrounded.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,520
After that we stylize the About page.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,940
We modified the list style and also added an animation to our text description at the bottom of the

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:06,820
About section which animated the color of the text to cycle through the colors of the rainbow.

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,150
Then we added style to the menu page.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:15,130
We added a border to our menu items and a button pulse animation to the featured menu item.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,770
Next we used CSSA stylize the contact page we added rounded corners to our input fields added a dark

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,230
border to whichever field the user is currently typing into added color to the input field when the

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,240
user hovers over it and centered and Starlog no button at the bottom of the form.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Finally we separated out our H T M L C Ss and javascript code for a web page into three separate files.

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,920
This helps us to keep our code clean organized and easier to manage in the next section.

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,110
We will learn about debugging CSSA code.
