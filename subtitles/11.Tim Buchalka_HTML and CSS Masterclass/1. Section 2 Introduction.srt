1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,170
In this section we will set up the idea that we will use for the rest of this course.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,310
It goes without saying that this is one of the central sections of the course you will need an itto

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,840
write your code that you will run in the web browser first.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,810
We will look at how we can download and install Visual Studio code onto our computer.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,840
This lecture will take you through the process of navigating to the download page online all the way

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,870
to installing and running the software on your computer.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,380
Next we will learn how to customize the ideas to meet our needs.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,070
This will include modifying the color scheme the hot to use text size the auto save feature and the

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,230
cursor style.

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,250
We will learn the process of modifying user settings and preferences for Visual Studio code in order

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,780
to tap into its ability to customize our editor to fit our needs and preferences.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,460
Finally we will learn how to run our code in the web browser running code in the web browser is how

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,700
we will see the result of the code we typed in the ID.

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,570
This lecture will teach you the ins and outs of making sure you can efficiently test the code that you

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,670
write in the web browser of your choice.

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,350
By learning these simple techniques in this lecture it will allow us to progress faster later on as

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,120
we write and test code in the majority of the lectures and this course in the next lecture we will go

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,370
through the steps of downloading and installing Visual Studio code.

19
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,250
The interactive development environment we will use in the rest of this course.
