00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,500
In this lecture we will learn how to embed web pages into other web pages using HVM L to embed web pages

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,610
into other web pages.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,950
We use the I-frame tag first roulade an opening and closing I-frame tag.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,690
Next we need to specify that you are Ellas the source using the source attribute of the I-frame tag

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,900
we can use the width and height attributes to define a width and height for our I-frame just like audio

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,810
and video tags frames can also have Fulbeck text that is displayed if something goes wrong while loading

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,950
the I-frame.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,590
Be sure to put the full back text in a paragraph element between the opening and closing I-frame tigs

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,020
the frame border attribute specifies whether or not the I-frame border should be displayed.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,000
If we assign the frame border attribute a value of 0 it will remove the frame border that is added to

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
the I-frame by default.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:00,830
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the web page we specified was embedded into

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,200
a web page without the frame border.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,030
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,290
If we assign the frame border attribute value of one the frame border will be displayed.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,700
Let's change the value of the frame border attribute to one and then run our code in the browser.

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,610
As you can see there is now a frame border around the embedded web page in the next lecture we will

18
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,470
learn about the HVM Moul canvas.
