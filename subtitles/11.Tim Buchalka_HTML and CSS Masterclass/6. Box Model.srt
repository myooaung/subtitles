00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,140
In this lecture we will learn about the CSSA box model the box model is not an actual piece of code

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:17,000
but rather a model that helps us to think about each DML elements and CSSA styles when we are programming.

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,750
You can think of each female element text images etc. as having a box around them that defines their

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,440
bounds.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,740
There are four main parts to the box model.

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,470
The content is the main center area where the actual element appears.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,730
The content would be the text image video etc. that the developer embeds into the web page.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,550
Padding is an area between the content and its border padding directly affects the spacing of the element

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,300
itself.

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,870
The border is the outer bound of the element.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,470
It is outside of the content and padding margins are outside of the border of the element.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,130
One concept that may be unclear is the difference between margins and padding margins are external to

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,070
the element they are outside of the elements border.

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,790
On the other hand padding is inside of the elements border.

15
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,990
If we add padding to the element it will directly push against the content.

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,790
If we add a margin to the element it will push against the border of the element but not directly against

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,570
the elements content in the next lecture.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,250
We will learn about padding and margins and see SS.
