1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,050
In this section we will learn about layouts and web pages and HMO.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,960
First we will learn about how we can responsively size elements on a web page.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,250
This is important because we want to make sure the elements on our Web page scale appropriately based

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,020
on the size of the browser.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,770
Next we will learn about how we can create a menu or head or bar 400 web page Hetter bars and menus

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,570
are a common form of navigation for an HMO web page.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,280
After that we will learn about bootstrap.

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,920
Bootstrap is a popular web development framework that can make responsively sizing our HVM elements

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,750
and laying out a web page a lot easier.

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,530
We will look at how we can use bootstrap to position elements on our Web page layout menus and UI elements

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,450
modify images work with text and add detail to the layout of our Web page.

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,630
By the end of this section you will have a strong understanding of how you can write each DML code that

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,670
scales responsively to the web browser and how you can use the bootstrap framework to lay out your HVM

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,940
content.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,090
This will result in you being able to create scalable solutions and speeding up your development time

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,610
by using the latest development strategies and frameworks and the next lecture we will learn about making

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,490
the images and text on our Web page responsive using HVM old code.
