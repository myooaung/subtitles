00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,980
In this lecture we will learn about how we can use CSSA to change the style of our button in different

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,910
states.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,070
Common states have a button in digital applications or the idle state the hover state and the pressed

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:23,090
state in CSX we can specify what happens when the user hovers over a button with the mouse cursor using

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,450
the hover selector.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,370
First let's say add a button to our webpage.

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,200
We will add an opening and closing button tag and give it some text content that will be the text displayed

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,260
on our button.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,330
Next we will add an opening and closing style tag to our code.

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,070
We will use the hover selector to give our button a yellow background when the user hovers over the

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,320
button with their mouse.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,170
When using selectors and SS We first specify the element name followed by a colon followed by the name

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,300
of the selector.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,390
Let's go to the web browser and write our code

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,920
when we hover over the button with our cursor.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,160
You will notice that its color changes to yellow.

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,010
Let's jump back to the editor and build on this example.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,990
We can use the transition duration property to specify how long the transition between the idle and

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,330
hover stage should be.

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,520
Let's say the transition duration property to our button styles and give it a value of 1 second then

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,070
we will go to the web browser and run our code.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,380
This time when we move our cursor over the button you will notice that the transition to the yellow

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,980
background color takes a duration of one second as opposed to being an immediate transition.

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,770
Let's jump back to the editor the active state can be used to modify the style of the button when the

25
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,160
user actually clicks on it.

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,860
Let's use the active selector and specify that our button background become orange when the button is

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,470
clicked.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,130
We will also specify a transition duration of zero seconds as we want the transition to take effect

29
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,570
immediately when the user clicks on the button.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,070
Let's go to the web browser and run our code when we hover over our button.

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,940
It turns yellow.

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,950
Based on the code that we wrote before when we click on the button you will notice that it turns the

33
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,730
color orange in the next lecture.

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,340
We were lynched at Advanced button styling techniques we can do in C Ss.
