00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,180
In this lecture we will write the CSSA code to start the contact page of our website.

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,830
Let's make the input fields on our form more even on our webpage.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,150
We will go to our style code and specify that our elements with an idea form input field should have

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,390
a width of 100 percent and a clear value of both.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,610
Let's say I add rounded edges to the three input fields in our form we'll specify a border radius of

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,260
five pixels to round off the corners of our input fields.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,430
When we run our code in the browser and click on the Contact link we will see our input fields now have

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,570
round corners.

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,780
Let's jump back to the editor.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,620
Next we're going to add a dark outline around our input fields when the user has that input field selected

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,610
to do this we will use the focus selector we will specify a solid border of 4 pixels with an -- B

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,390
color thirty four thirty four thirty four.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,750
Running this code in the browser and cooking inside of one of our three input fields on the form will

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,220
show our dark border with the input field comes into focus.

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,400
Let's say add a light overlay to the input fields when the user hovers over them.

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:15,010
To do this we are going to use the hover selector on our email subject and body element we will specify

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,630
a color of light gray for the background color when the user hovers over these elements.

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,540
After that let's run our code and hover over these input fields as you can see when we hover over the

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,950
input fields on the form.

20
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,920
The background color changes to light gray as a result of the code we just wrote.

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,910
Let's jump back to the editor our form button is looking pretty plain on our page.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,900
Let's add some code to stylize our button.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,300
We can reference our button using its ID submit button to center our button horizontally on the web

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,020
page will give it a with of 20 percent and the margin left and margin right of 40 percent then we will

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:05,260
give our button rounded corners we will use the border radius property and give it a value of 5 pixels.

26
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,080
When we run our code and go to the contact section of our Web page we will see that the button is now

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,770
centered horizontally on the web page and has rounded corners.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,260
After that let's say at hover and active States to our button to change the color of it when the user

29
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,680
hovers over it and clicks on it to change hover state we will reference Exidy of Submit button and use

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,090
the hover selector.

31
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,290
We will give our button a background color of dark gray when the user hovers over it.

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,540
Next we will add code to stylize our button when the user clicks on it to do so we will use the active

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,940
selector and change the background color of our button of gray when we run our code and hover over the

34
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,480
button.

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,430
You will see the color change.

36
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,750
Then when we click the button you will notice that the color again changes based on the code that we

37
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,760
wrote in the next lecture.

38
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,750
We will do a final cleanup of our files for our Web site and retractor our code.
