In this section we learned about the global attributes that can be applied to NEHTA male element.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,830
First we looked at the global attributes added in prior versions of HVM all the access key attribute

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,980
lets us assign a key on the keyboard to activate or focus an element the class attribute allows us to

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,850
specify a class that are each element belongs to we use the DIR attribute to specify a direction for

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,560
the contents of our element.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,360
The Lang attribute lets us specify what language the content of the element is in the style attribute

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:45,050

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,970
the title attribute lets us provide additional information about an element displayed when the user

9
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,100
mouse is over an element.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,300
After that we learned about global attributes that were added as of HVM L5 the content editable attribute

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,420
allows us to specify our element is editable or not that context menu attribute allows us to create

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,300
a context menu that will appear when we right click on an element we can embed custom data into our

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,110
HMO elements using the data attribute the draggle attribute allows us to specify whether or not an element

14
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,160

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,340

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,910
