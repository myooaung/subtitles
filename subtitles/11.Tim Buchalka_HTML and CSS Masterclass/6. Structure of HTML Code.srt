00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,200
HVM code follows a specific structure.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,930
We have already looked at tags and the content that is placed between opening and closing tags tags

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,140
that don't have a closing tag recalled empty tags as a whole.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,190
The tags in their content are referred to as an element to an HMO inside of the opening tag.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,330
We can put attributes which provide additional information about an element.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,640
Usually these attributes have the following structure attribute name equals attribute value boolean

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,430
attributes or a special type of attribute that have only one value.

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,910
If you're familiar with the traditional concept of a boolean and other programming languages your prior

9
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:52,420
knowledge may be misleading in this case a boolean attribute an HMO is put inside of a tag and doesn't

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,670
have an equal sign or value given to it.

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,300
Selected and disabled are two examples of boolean attributes an HMO the selected attribute allows us

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,330
to show a pre-selected option when the web page loads the disabled attribute allows an input element

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,540
to be greyed out and unable to be quick when specifying values to attributes these values are surrounded

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,850
by quote.

15
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,540
You can use either single quotes or double quotes.

16
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,710
It is all a matter of preference.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,740
However be sure not to perish single quote with a double quote or vice versa.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,860
Elements in HVM l can also be nested if we want to italic size a word inside of some text.

19
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,830
We could use the IDE tag we would put the text instead of opening and closing paragraph tags and then

20
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,170
surround the word we want to emphasize that opening and closing our italicised tag.

21
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,690
Commonly you will hear elements in Chimay be referred to as other block elements or inline elements

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,590
block elements automatically have a newline inserted above and below them inline elements are usually

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,400
used instead of block elements and affect the content inside of the block element in the italicize example.

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,910
We looked at above the content with the paragraph tags is considered a block element and the italicized

25
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,520
tag is considered to be an inline element.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,250
The italicized head does not define a new block of content but modifies the content inside of the meeting.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,810
There are some key points to be aware of when dealing with block elements an inline element block elements

28
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,590
can only appear within the body tag of the HVM page.

29
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,200
Recall that the main content over a web page is contained between the opening and closing body tags.

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,210
This is where we put all of the block elements for our web page examples of block level elements are

31
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,980
div..

32
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:50,000
The div tag allows us to specify a page division footer the footer tag allows us to define content for

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,180
the bottom of our Web page.

34
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,370
H-1 through H 6 heading tags these heading tags allow us to display text that stands out as a heading

35
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,160
header.

36
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,040
The header tag allows us to define content that will be shown above all of the other content ally.

37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,400
The ally tag allows us to define a list item for our list all while the old tag allows us to create

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,770
an ordered or numbered list.

39
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:23,990
P The p tag allows us to insert text into a web page and is known as the paragraph tag UL the UL tag

40
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,740
allows us to create an unordered list and the list goes on.

41
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:34,030
These are just some examples of the block elements we have access to when using HVM L in the next lecture.

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,520
We will learn about each symbol titles and headings and how we can use them when developing web pages.
