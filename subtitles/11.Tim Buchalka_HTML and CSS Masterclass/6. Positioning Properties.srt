00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,040
In this lecture we reload about some properties that we can use to position elements on our Web page.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,750
The Position property allows us to specify how an element will be positioned on a webpage by assigning

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,580
this property value of absolute we can position our element anywhere on the web page by assigning an

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,990
absolute position.

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,790
Let's give our element a position of absolute.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,290
We can then use the left right top and bottom properties or any combination of them to position the

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,980
element on our webpage.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,820
We will give our element the left value of 50 pixels and the top value of 50 pixels.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,320
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our image has moved down and right 50 pixels.

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:52,820
Let's jump back to the editor will also be aware that giving the top property of value moves it down

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,900
on the web page the specified amount of pixels from the top ascending the bottom property of value moves

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,230
are element up a specified amount of pixels from the bottom of our web page to see this difference.

13
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,160
Let's change the top property to bottom and run our code.

14
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,280
You will notice that our element was pushed up on the web page.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,640
Let's jump back to the editor

16
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,260
the float property allows us to specify if an image should be displayed to the left or right of text

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,040
to see the effect of the next few examples.

18
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,040
We need to add more content to our paragraph element to make it longer.

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,050
Let's add some more content to our paragraph element assigning the float property value of last will

20
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,210
position the element to the left of the text.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's first they add an image element to our Web page.

22
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:43,270
We will give it a source of our star PLG image then we will use the float property and give it a value

23
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,260
of less.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,750
We will also give our image a width and height of 50 pixels.

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,580
Let's run our code in the browser

26
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,300
as you can see our images displayed on the left of our text.

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:04,210
Let's jump back to the editor assigning the float property value of right will position the element

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,580
on the right of our text.

29
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,290
Let's change the float value to right and then run our code in the browser.

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,550
As you can see the images displayed on the right of the text.

31
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:22,110
Then we will go back to the editor the clear property lets us specify the sides to not allow an image

32
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,900
on for example assigning a clear value of less to our text means that we cannot add images to the left

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,830
of our text.

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,550
Let's give a paragraph element to clear value of the left in our image element of float value of left.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,770
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see.

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,850
Even though we specified that our image should float to the left of our text the clear value of left

37
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,370
that we gave to our paragraph element made the image in text be placed on separate lines the clear value

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,280
of less tells the browser not to allow an image to go on the left side of our text.

39
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,040
Let's jump back to the editor we can also give the clear property value of right to prevent an image

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,500
from being positioned to the right of our techs.

41
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,210
Let's give our paragraph element a clear value of right and our image or float value of right.

42
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,140
Then we will run our code in the browser to see the result.

43
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,630
As you can see the image is on the right side of the web page but not the right side of the text.

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,910
The text was forced onto a separate line than the image since we give the text a clear value of right.

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,200
Let's jump back to the editor.

46
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,950
We can also assign the clear property value of both to not allow images on either side of the text.

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,330
Let's change the clear property to have a value of both and then run our code as you can see the image

48
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,400
is not allowed on the left or right side of the text and is therefore kept on a separate line in the

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,510
text.

50
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,660
Let's jump back to the editor assigning a value of None to the clear property allows images to be positioned

51
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,640
on both sides of the text.

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,470
Let's give our text the clear value of None and then run our code since our image still has a float

53
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,590
value right.

54
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,720
It will float to the right of our text.

55
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,610
We will run our code in the web browser to see the result.

56
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,960
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

57
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,860
The z index property allows us to specify which elements will appear on top of and below other elements.

58
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,770
In other words the order that elements at the same position are stacked on top of one another.

59
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,350
The higher the value of the z index the closer to the top the element will be positioned elements with

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,230
a higher z index will be rendered on top of elements with the lower z index.

61
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,260
Let's have two paragraph elements on our Web page.

62
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,670
One with red text and one with blue text.

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,730
First we will add the two paragraph elements to our webpage page then we will give our first element

64
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,920
an idea of green text and our second element to an idea of red text.

65
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,690
Next we will add some style of code to our elements.

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,760
We will make the element with an idea of green text the color green and the element with an idea of

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,770
red text the color red.

68
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,440
Let's give both elements an absolute position or green text we will give a left and top value of 0 pixels

69
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,100
to for our red text.

70
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,700
Let's give it a top value of 4 pixels in our left value of 4 pixels to offset it from green text.

71
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,290
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

72
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,710
As you can see all red text is rendered on top of all green text since that came after all green text

73
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,380
in the code.

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,190
Let's jump back to the editor.

75
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,640
Let's look at how we can use the z index property to control the rendering order of these elements.

76
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,120
Let's give our green text as the index of two.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,340
And our red text is the index of one since we are giving our green text a higher z index than our red

78
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,120
text.

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,690
It will be displayed on top.

80
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,810
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our green text is rendered on top of our

81
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,390
red text in the next lecture.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,470
We will learn about clipping and masking and see.

83
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:50,970
SS.
