00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,060
In this lecture we learn about the properties that CSSA gives us to modifying elements border the border

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,730
style property allows us to specify a style for a border assigning the property value of solid gives

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,430
our elements a solid border.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,170
First let's say a paragraph element to our Web page and give it some example text content.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,680
Then we relate an opening and closing style tag to our code.

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,980
We will use the paragraph element selector and give a paragraph element to border style of solid.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,430
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,770
as you can see our element has a solid border around it.

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,340
Let's jump back to the editor assigning the border style property a value of dotted gives our elements

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,700
a dotted border.

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,830
We will change the border style the dotted and then run our code.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,290
As you can see our element now has a dotted border around it.

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,060
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,550
We can give this property a value of double to give our elements a double border.

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,180
Let's change our border style to double.

16
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,690
Then we will run our code in the web browser.

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,270
You will notice that our text now has a double border around it.

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,880
Let's go back to the editor giving this property a value of Dasht will give our elements a dashed border.

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,900
Let's give our elements a border style of Dasht and then run our code as you can see our element now

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,450
has a dasht border.

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,160
Let's go back to the editor in addition to giving all four sides of the elemental border.

22
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:44,360
You can specify which sides of the border to assign a style to using the border top style border right

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,460
style border bottom style and border left style properties.

24
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,550
The border top style property allows us to assign a style to the top of our border.

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,530
We will use the border top style property and give it a value of Dasht.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,490
Then we will run our code in the browser as you can see our element now has a dash top border.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,220
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

28
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,680
The border right style property allows us to assign a style to the right side of our border.

29
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,480
We will use the border right style property and give it a value of solid.

30
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,310
Then we will run our code as you can see the right border of our element is now solid.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,660
Let's jump back to the other the border bottom style property allows us to assign a style to the bottom

32
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,970
of our border.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,270
Let's give our element of border bottom style of double and then run our code in the browser as you

34
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,550
can see our element now has a double bottom border.

35
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,150
Then we will go back to the editor the border lovechild property allows us to assign a style to the

36
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,420
left of our border.

37
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,410
We will give our element of border left style of dotted and run our code.

38
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,680
You will notice that the left border of our element is dotted.

39
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,440
Then we will go back to the editor.

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,510
There are several 3D styles that CSSA gives us to apply to our borders.

41
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:13,260
They are groove Ridge inset and outset a the border style property value of groove gives our element

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,800
of grooved border.

43
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,060
Let's give our paragraph element to border style of groove in order to see the effects of these border

44
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,950
styles.

45
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,990
We need to assign a color to a border using the border color property.

46
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,160
We were led the border color property to our style code and assign it a value of Orange.

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,500
We will also use the border with property and give our border a with of 10 pixels.

48
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:41,850
Then we will run our code in the browser as you can see our text now as a group border around it.

49
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,840
Let's go back to the editor assigning the border style property value of Ridge gives our aliment a ridge

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,950
border.

51
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:56,540
We will change the border style to ridge and then run our code as you can see our element now has a

52
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,970
ridged border around it.

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,890
Let's jump back to the editor a signing or Borders style property value of inset gives our element and

54
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,980
inset border.

55
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,160
Let's change the border style to inset and then run our code as you can see the border around our element

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,300
is inset.

57
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,480
Then we will go back to the editor of value of outset that will give our element a border style of the

58
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,180
outset.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,310
We will change the border style the outset and then run our code as you can see the border around our

60
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,640
elementis outset.

61
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,580
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,170
The border with property allows you to specify a wished for a border rule change the border style the

63
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,450
solid in order to see the result of the next examples aside from a pixel value we can assign a border

64
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,460
with a thin medium or thick preset with assigning the border with property value.

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,190
Then we'll give our elements a thin border.

66
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,540
Let's give our elements a thin border and then run our code as you can see our element now has a thin

67
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,410
border.

68
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,150
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

69
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,990
Assigning a border with property values medium will give our element a median border will give our element

70
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:17,900
a border with a medium and then run our code as you can see there is a medium with border around our

71
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,570
element.

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,730
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

73
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,930
Assigning the border with property values thick will give our elements a thick border.

74
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:34,310
Let's give our elements a border with a thick and then write our code our element now has a thick border

75
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,110
around it.

76
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,030
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

77
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,670
We can also assign a with to an individual side of our border using the border top with border right

78
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:51,120
with border bottom width and border left with properties the border top with property allows us to add

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,520
a whit to the top of an element's border.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,210
Let's give our element of border top with him then and then run our code as you can see the top border

81
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,080
on our elementis.

82
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,610
Then let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

83
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,670
The border right with property allows us to add a with to the right of an element border.

84
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:16,820
Let's change that property we are using the border right with and then run our code in the browser as

85
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,470
you can see the width of the right border is now.

86
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,100
Then let's go back to the editor.

87
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,530
The border bottom with property allows us to add a way to the bottom of and element's border.

88
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:34,460
We will use the border bottom with property and assign it a value within and then run our code as you

89
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,680
can see the bottom border of our element has a whistle.

90
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:44,300
And let's jump back to the editor the border left with property allows us to add with to the left of

91
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,660
an elements border.

92
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,670
We will change the property we are using the border left with and then run our code in the web browser

93
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,790
as you can see the width of our left border is then.

94
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:02,120
Then we will go back to the editor CSSA gives us the border style property which is a shorthand property

95
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,020
that allows us to assign a with style and color to a border all at once.

96
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,140
We will use the border property and specify a border to be thick solid and red then we will go to the

97
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:20,050
web browser and run our code as you can see our element has a solid thick red border around it.

98
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,190
Let's jump back to the editor the border radious property allows us to make the corners of our border

99
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,470
rounded to the radius that we specify We will use the border radius property and give it a value of

100
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,720
three pixels.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,460
Then we will run our code in the browser as you can see our border now has round corners.

102
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,890
Let's go back to the editor.

103
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,750
Also we can specify a radius for each corner separately if we choose.

104
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:54,640
In that case each value separated by a space and the order is top left top right bottom right and bottom

105
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,620
left.

106
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:04,950
We will give our border radius the following values to pixels for pixels 8 pixels and 16 pixels as you

107
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,560
can see from the top left going clockwise the corners of our element get progressively rounder.

108
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Let's go back to the editor the border image source property allows us to specify a custom image for

109
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,090
a border.

110
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,490
We will use the border image source property and give it a source of our example border PAGG image.

111
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,060
We will also give our element a border with of 10 pixels and a border style of solid.

112
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,790
Then we will run our code in the browser

113
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,410
as you can see our border now has a custom image as its source.

114
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:44,400
Let's go back to the editor the border image slice property enables us to specify how the source image

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,070
is sliced and displayed.

116
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,040
We will use the border image slice property and give it a value of 30 then we will run our code in the

117
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,690
browser.

118
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,490
You will notice how our image was sliced according to the value that we gave the border image sliced

119
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,600
property.

120
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,280
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

121
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,920
Border image with allows us to give our border image with.

122
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,530
Let's give our border image a with of 20 pixels.

123
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,570
We will use the border image with property and give it a value of 20 pixels.

124
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:21,030
Then we will run our code in the browser as you can see our border image has a wealth of 20 pixels.

125
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:27,360
Let's go back to the editor the border image outset property allows us to specify an amount for the

126
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,050
border image to extend outside of the bounds of an element border.

127
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:37,510
We will give our border image and outset of 10 pixels and run our code in the browser as you can see

128
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,830
our border images now outset by 10 pixels.

129
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

130
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,910
The border image repeat property lets us specify how the image will fill the space the border image

131
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:58,020
repeat property can have a value of Strach repeat round or space assigning the bore image repeat property

132
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,990
of value of Strach will make the image stretch to fill the area.

133
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,760
We will use the border image repeat property and give it a value of stretch and then we will run our

134
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,430
code in the web browser as you can see our border image is now stretched.

135
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,900
Let's go back to the editor giving the border image Ropeik property a value of repeat will make the

136
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,200
image tile to fill the border area.

137
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,130
Let's change the value of the border image repeat property to repeat then we will go to the web browser

138
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:31,000
and run our code as you can see the border image is never repeated.

139
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:37,560
Let's go back to the editor of value of roundel rescale the border image so that it fills the border

140
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,500
area.

141
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:45,350
We will give our element of border image repeat value of around and then run our code as you can see

142
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,060
our border image now fills the border area.

143
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:55,750
Let's jump back to the editor Ossining the border image repeat property value of space will add space

144
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,990
to abort border image so that it fills the full space of the border.

145
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,470
Let's change the border image repeat property to space and then run our code to see the result.

146
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:11,470
