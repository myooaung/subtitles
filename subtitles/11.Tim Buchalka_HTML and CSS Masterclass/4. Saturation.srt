00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,670
In this lecture we will learn about saturation and how we can use the SS code to specify levels of saturation

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,480
for our images.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,430
Saturation refers to the intensity or amount of pigment in a color highly saturated colors are brighter

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,490
than less saturated colors.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,650
The CSA has saturate function allows us to modify the saturation of an image by supplying this function

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,940
a high value.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:35,090
We can make the colors in the image more intent increasing its saturation by calling misfunction with

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,890
a low value we can make the image colors less intense or less saturated.

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,490
To assign a saturation to our image we use the CSSA filter property and assign a value of the saturate

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,480
function.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,700
Let's add an image element to our Web page and give it a source of our icon PMG image.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,560
Then we will get an opening and closing style tag to our code.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,910
We will assign our image the filter property and use the saturate function to make the saturation of

14
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,100
our image 100 percent.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,440
Note that 100 percent is the default value and that this is how the image normally looks without any

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,150
modification.

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,210
Let's go to the web browser and run our code to see the result.

18
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,320
Then we will jump back to the editor

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,010
if we specify a saturation less than 100 percent our image will become less saturated.

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,420
Let's change the saturation of our image to 50 percent then we will go to the web browser and run our

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,970
code.

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,420
As you can see our image is less saturated than before.

23
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:52,030
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

24
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,710
Let's change the saturation of our image to 200 percent.

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,370
Doing so will greatly increase the saturation of our image.

26
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,550
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,790
as you can see the image is much more saturated.

28
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,990
Note that the tan color of our characters face and hands is now a very intense yellow.

29
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,930
Then we will go back to the editor.

30
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,110
We can supply the saturation as an integer value of float or decimal value or a percent.

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,100
If we want to supply an integer value for the saturation one is the default value of 100 percent saturation.

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,690
Let's change our code to pass in the integer value 1 to the saturate function and then run our code

33
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,510
in the web browser to see the result.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,570
As you can see our image is at 100 percent saturation.

35
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,840
Let's go back to the editor

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,900
passing in a value less than one.

37
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,950
For example a value of zero will decrease the saturation of our image.

38
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,470
Let's give our image a saturation of 0 and then run our code in the browser to see the result.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,660
As you can see our image now has no saturation.

40
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,970
Let's jump back to the editor

41
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,360
if we passed desaturate function an integer value greater than 1.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,800
It will increase the saturation of our image.

43
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,130
Let's change our code to make the saturation of our image 3 and then go to the web browser and run our

44
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,660
code.

45
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,830
As you can see the saturation of our image has been dramatically increased.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,520
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

47
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,820
We can pass a decimal value to the saturate function as well.

48
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,490
Let's change the value in our code to point zero and then run our code in the web browser.

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,050
As you can see our image is back to full saturation passing in a value of 1 point zero is the same as

50
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,550
passing in a value of 100 percent or an integer value of 1.

51
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,180
Let's go back to the editor.

52
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,340
If we pass desaturate function a decimal value less than 1.0 it will decrease the saturation of our

53
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,380
image.

54
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,930
Let's change the saturation of our image to 0.3.

55
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,200
Then we will go to the web browser and run the code to see the result of this change.

56
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,400
Observe that the image is a lot less saturated than before.

57
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:26,210
Let's jump back to the editor passing a float value greater than one point zero will increase the saturation

58
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,460
of our image.

59
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:35,760
Let's give our image of saturation value of 1.6 and then run our code into the web browser as you can

60
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,960
see the image is now over 100 percent saturation.

61
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,090
Using the filter property and saturate function allows us to have control over the saturation of the

62
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,770
images on our Web page in the next lecture.

63
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,440
We were learn about opacity and how we can control in images opacity using CSSA code.
