00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,750
In this lecture we will learn about pseudo classes that apply to an element based on what child it is

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,630
and its parent the first child pseudo class selects every element of the specified type that is the

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,410
first child of its parent to see an example of this.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,620
Let's add some example code we will have three parent does that each has two child paragraph elements

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,410
inside of them.

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,090
Then we will write the style code for this example we will add an opening and closing style tag and

7
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,050
we will use the first child pseudo class to turn the first child paragraph element screen.

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,490
When we run the code in the browser you will notice that each of the first children of each of the parent

9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,070
divs is now green.

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,990
Let's jump back to the editor.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,670
The last child pseudo class allows us to select the last child of a specified type if we change our

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,040
code for this example to use the last child pseudo class and run our code in the web browser.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,560
You will notice that the second child and each of the parent lives turns green.

14
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,830
This is because they are each the last child and their respective parent div..

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,340
Let's go back to the editor the end child pseudo class allows us to select the nth child based on the

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,840
number that we specify.

17
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,430
We will change our code to use this pseudo class and we'll pass in an end value of 1 for this example.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,850
When we do this and run the code in the web browser you will notice that each first child paragraph

19
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,370
element is turned green.

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,400
Let's go back to the editor.

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,250
The end The last child pseudo class selects the specified elements starting with the last element.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,780
So if we change the code from the last example we looked at to use the last child selector and keep

23
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,890
it in an end value of 1 each of the second children will be selected.

24
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,070
This is because these elements are the last children or elements of their respective divs.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,980
And the last child pseudo class starts counting from the last child.

26
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,960
When we run this code in the web browser you will see that each of the second children of the divs are

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,550
changed to the color green.

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,610
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,040
The only child pseudo class will select every element of the specified type.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
That is the only child of its parent.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,260
If we change our example code to use the only child pseudo class and run our code in the browser you

32
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,320
will note that none of the paragraph elements are green.

33
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,610
This is because each div has two children so none of these elements are the only child of their parents

34
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,710
live in the next lecture.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,770
We will learn about the pseudo classes that CSSA gives us that apply to anchor elements on a web page.
