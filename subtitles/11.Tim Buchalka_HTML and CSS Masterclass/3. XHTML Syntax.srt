The first step in writing and SH team all document is to add the doc type as the first line of the page

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,030
inside of the opening HTL tagging the HDMI layout and the x M L and S attribute the XM L and S attribute

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,310
also change all attribute and element names to lowercase.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,320
Use the id attribute instead of the name attribute.

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,430
Finally make sure all attribute values have quotes around them.

00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,550
quotes.
