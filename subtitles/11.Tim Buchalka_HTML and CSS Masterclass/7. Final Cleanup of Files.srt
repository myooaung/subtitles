00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,290
In this lecture we're going to move our CSSA and javascript code to separate files so that we have three

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,040
files that are linked together.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,010
One for each Yamal one for our CSSA and one for our javascript.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,020
It is generally considered a best practice in web development to separate our code into separate files

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,160
like this.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,580
When we modify our code to clean it up and make it conform to best practices This is known as refactoring.

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,020
The first thing we are going to do is move our CSSA style code into its own file.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,350
First we will create a new file in Visual Studio code by going to file new file.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,730
Next we will save our file and name it.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,560
Pizza Dotsie SS Just type pizza as the file name and then use the dropdown menu provided to select the

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,380
file type of SS.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,810
Then we will go to our HVM owl and cut and paste the code between our style tags into a new file.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,100
Then we can get rid of the style tags and our each team I'll code the final step to link the CSSA code

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,750
to our HGL code is to add a link element at the top of our HVM l code underneath the bootstrap imports.

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,670
Now we are going to separate our javascript code into a separate file and then link it to our HMO.

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,530
First you will create a new file name it pizza and choose the file type of javascript.

17
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,060
Now we will go to our Chmela code and cut and paste the lines between the script tags which hold all

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,930
of our Javascript functions.

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,350
Then we can get rid of the opening and closing script tags in our HVM file since we don't need them

20
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:40,970
anymore.

21
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,350
The last step we need in order to link our javascript to our h t m l is to add a script element that

22
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,910
points to our javascript file at the top of our HVM in the head section.

23
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,200
Now let's run our code in the web browser to make sure nothing broke when we moved our code to separate

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,220
files.

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:05,440
As you can see we now have three separate files for each TMLC access and javascript code in the next

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,120
lecture.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,820
We will recap what we did in this section of the course.
