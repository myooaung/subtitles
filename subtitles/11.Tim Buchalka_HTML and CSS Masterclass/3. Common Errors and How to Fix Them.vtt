00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.760
In this lecture we will look at several common areas in each team and how we can fix them.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.400
One common error in each team is using an unsupported tag tag that H L does not define or support.

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.180
This can happen for example if we write the wrong name for a tag.

4
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.450
The error in this example is that the paragraph tag is just a p inside of angular brackets not the word

5
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.270
para.

6
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.810
We can fix this by putting the proper tag name inside of the angular brackets for opening and closing

7
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.660
tag.

8
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.010
Another common H-2 him out error is missing quotes for attribute values.

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.130
For example if we were to add the id attribute to our paragraphed tag but not enclose the attribute

10
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.570
value in quotes.

11
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.160
To fix this error we just need to put the attribute value in this case.

12
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.470
The word paragraph inside of quotation marks in HVM L.

13
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.440
Another error you may run into is missing a closing tag for an element.

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.310
Don't forget some elements like input and break element.

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.170
Don't use closing tags.

16
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.540
However the majority of each Chmela element do.

17
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.100
And if we forget a closing tag on an element that needs one that can be problematic.

18
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.230
To illustrate an example of this let's remove the closing tag from the example paragraph element.

19
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.120
We have been using then we will add an opening be tagged to make the text bold but we won't add a closing

20
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.290
B.Tech.

21
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.030
Finally we will make a new paragraph element with contents.

22
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.900
Example text to when we run this code.

23
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.300
You will notice that even though we intended to make the first paragraph element bold both paragraph

24
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.570
elements are bolded.

25
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.460
Since we didn't close our first paragraph tag or our first tag in HVM out when we don't properly close

26
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.450
tags the effect is applied to one element could actually spread to another element unintentionally to

27
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.800
fix this issue.

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.760
We need to add a closing B tag followed by a closing tag

29
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.720
another common issue in HVM is improper nesting of HVM element.

30
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.630
For this example let's make the following changes to our code.

31
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.980
We will add an Italic opening tag after the bold tag on our first element and then a closing or italic

32
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.470
tag outside of the closing bold tag.

33
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.610
The problem with this code is that there is improper nesting of the B and I tigs since the opening tags

34
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.460
inside of the opening be tag the closing tag should be inside of the closing the tag.

35
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.450
To fix this let's move the closing tag inside of the closing tag.

36
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.360
The error is that we learned about it in this video.

37
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.850
Or just some of the errors that you will run into in writing.

38
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.350
H t m l code.

39
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.670
However this gives you a good starting point of things to look out for when you are programming in the

40
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.510
next lecture.

41
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.860
We will learn about using an h t m l validator a that we can use to help us debug our h hemol code.
