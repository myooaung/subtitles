00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.410
In this lecture we will learn how we can animate elements heightened with using CSSA.

2
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.290
First let's say at a div that we can stylize an anime then we will get an opening and closing style

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.970
tag so that we can embed some CSSA code into our webpage.

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.810
We will add the div selector and give our give a width and height of 100 pixels then we will give our

5
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.810
div a background color of black.

6
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.720
After that we will add the animation to our div.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.670
The name of the animation we will create is size and the duration will be one second and we will make

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.870
our animation loop by using the infinite keyword.

9
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.300
Next we will write the code for animation.

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.100
We will first add that keyframes rule followed by the name of our animation which in this case is size

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.560
and we are going to animate the height and width to make the object grow and shrink on the webpage at

12
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.280
keyframes 0 percent and 100 percent we will give our div a width and height of 100 pixels at keyframes

13
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.940
30 percent 50 percent and 70 percent we will give our div a height and width of 200 pixels.

14
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.480
Finally let's run our code and see the animation in action.

15
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.270
In the next lecture we will learn about the fun properties that CSSA allows us to animate.
