00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,850
In this lecture we will learn about the format of an HMO document each time and document follows a specific

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,250
structure that communicates to the browser how to render the content to the web page in its most basic

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,090
form.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,460
Here's what an HMO document looks like.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,430
This is a skeleton or rough outline which you will then fill in with all of the content you need for

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,670
your web page although the content will be different each time you create an aged female document.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,500
The overall structure will be the same for each of the examples we do in these lectures.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,450
We will have this skeleton already in our code so that we can easily write and test code that we can

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,690
run in the web browser.

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:52,110
I suggest that you type the skeleton code once save it and we use it as you follow along with the examples

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,540
in each lecture.

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,680
I will save this code as example.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,330
Each female and I will use this example file for the rest of the videos.

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:07,930
The only exceptions are the HVM owl and CSSA hands on sections where we will be creating new files at

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,080
the top of the document is the doc type tag.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,470
This tag was added to each Chimo in the latest version of each team l each team 5 and this tag allows

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:24,670
the browser to differentiate between the late stage female version and legacy or past each female versions.

18
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,270
Next comes the HVM melted this tag comes right after the duct tape tag on an HMO document and wraps

19
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,240
all of the HMO content on that document.

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:41,020
The head tag wraps the meta data of the web page metadata is describing data about our Web page.

21
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,120
You have to include a title in the head tag which will display at the top of your web browser in the

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,880
tab.

23
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:54,160
The body tag surrounds the content like text images etc. that will be visible on the web page.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,290
When we are typing out tags and testing to see what they will display onto our Web page we will add

25
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,230
or code here let's expand this skeleton HMO document to show some more features that we have access

26
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,020
to.

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,140
A header is at the top of the document body meaning that it comes immediately after the opening body

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,820
tag.

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,690
It defines the content that will be displayed at the top of the page above all of the other visible

30
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,690
content.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,470
Similarly we can add a footer to a web page which comes right before the closing body tag.

32
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,420
It defines the content which will be displayed at the very bottom of our Web page underneath all of

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,540
our other content.

34
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,600
In the next lecture we will learn about the structure of each team of code and learn the terminology

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,260
that we will use when describing each team out code throughout the rest of the course.
