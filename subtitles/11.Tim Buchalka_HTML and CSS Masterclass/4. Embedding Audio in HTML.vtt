00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.590
In this lecture we will learn how to use HVM how to embed audio into our web page to embed audio into

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.650
your web page.

3
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.130
You can use the audio tag to start.

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.480
We will add an opening and closing audio tag to our code.

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.140
The source element specifies the audio file source.

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.420
Let's use the source element and give it a source attribute of our cookoo MP 3 audio file.

7
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.060
We also need to specify the type of audio file using the type attribute.

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.950
There are three types of audio files supported in each team out.

9
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.340
MP 3 Oh G.G. and wave.

10
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.330
Similar to the video element.

11
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:51.580
The attributes that audio elements have or controls auto play loop muted and pre-load the controls attribute

12
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.650
gives that user audio controls.

13
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.660
Let's say that the controls attribute to the opening audio tag then we will run our code in the browser

14
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.840
as you can see our audio controls are now displayed on the web page.

15
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.620
Let's jump back to the editor to auto play attribute signifies that the audio should start playing as

16
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.750
soon as the web page is loaded.

17
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.370
We will let the auto play attribute to our opening audio tag.

18
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.490
One note here.

19
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.970
In my experience it seems that this attribute works in Firefox but not in Chrome.

20
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.300
So run this code in the Firefox web browser if you can we will go to the web browser and run our code

21
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.270
or Oriol should play when our Web page loads.

22
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.210
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

23
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.170
The loop attribute signifies that the audio should play on loop over and over again each time it is

24
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.080
finished.

25
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.500
Let's say the loop attribute inside of the opening audiotape egg then we will run our code in the web

26
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.000
browser

27
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.580
after the audio finishes playing.

28
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.320
It plays again over and over.

29
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.840
Thanks to the loop attribute.

30
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.980
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

31
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.490
The muted attribute signifies that the audio should be muted to pre-load attributes specifies how the

32
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.760
audio should be preloaded when the web page loads just like videos or audio can have a preload value

33
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.140
of auto metadata or none of preload value of auto means that the browser should load the entire audio

34
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.720
file when the web page load a preload value of metadata means that the browser should only load the

35
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.270
metadata when the web page loads a preload value of non-means that the browser should not pre-load the

36
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.020
audio.

37
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.900
The audio should only be loaded when the user clicks the play button to play the audio audio elements

38
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.570
also have a fallback text that will display if there is a problem loading the audio.

39
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.460
We will put the full back text inside of the opening and closing audio tags in the next lecture.

40
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.600
We will learn about how to embed web pages into other web pages using HMO.
