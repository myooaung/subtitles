00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.220
In this lecture we will learn what sh t m l is.

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.180
Recall that H T M L stands for HyperText Markup Language Exige TMLC answer extensible HyperText Markup

3
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.050
Language.

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.660
Sh t m l is a combination of h t m l and maximal.

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.980
The reason that x h t m l is used is because it forces the programmer to use exact and flawless syntax

6
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.180
in order for the code to be run.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.160
HDMI is a very lenient language and that code that has some mistakes will still work a lot of the time.

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.440
However there are situations where some devices such as smaller mobile devices may not have the computing

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.300
power to still run with these issues present in the code.

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.510
If you want to have quality code that is both backwards and forwards compatible with each DML Exige

11
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.370
TMI was a solid choice that allows you to take advantage of X-amount features like being able to be

12
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.560
rendered by Will SML enabled browsers the ability to utilize tools and applications that rely on the

13
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.370
SML document object model and the quality standards associated with SML in the next lecture.

14
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.650
We will learn about SH TMLC syntax.
