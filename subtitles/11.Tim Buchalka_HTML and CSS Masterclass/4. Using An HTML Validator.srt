00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,130
In this lecture we will learn about what each team validator is and how we can use it to help us find

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,920
and fix errors in our HMO code validator is a program that we can run our files through to see if there

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,570
are any syntax errors.

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,170
This helps us to save time and energy when debugging.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,940
Since H.E. e-mail code for an entire web site can be hundreds or even thousands of lines long depending

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:32,510
on the complexity of the Web site W3 see or World Wide Web Consortium is the main organization that

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,180
sets and maintains the standards for web development.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,870
The W3 C has an online validator that we can run our code through to check it for syntax errors.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,080
Let's open a web browser and go to HSDPA us colon slash slash validator dot W3 dot org.

10
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,440
You will notice that there are three options that we have for inputting or HVM all code.

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,530
If we have an online Web site that we want to check for hours we can enter that you R-AL into the address

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,580
input field.

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,620
If we click on the second tab validate file by upload you will notice that we can upload a file from

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,080
our computer that the validator will check for syntax errors.

15
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,450
We actually do have a file that we can run through the HTL validated to check for errors.

16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,820
A slight variation to the hands on each G-mail web page we wrote a few seconds back I intentionally

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,590
added a few errors that we could debug for this example.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,790
Let's hit the Choose file button find and select the file from our computer and then hit open then we

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,050
will hit the check button.

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,150
If we don't have any errors in our code Chimo validator will tell us that no errors were found.

21
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,770
If there are any warnings or errors for the file we input the validator will point out the error as

22
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,920
well as the line number.

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,650
As you can see there were some errors found in our HCM file.

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,380
Let's go through and solve these errors one by one.

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,010
The first error is that the head element is missing a required instance of the child element.

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,760
Title.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,680
What this means is that we need to add a title element inside of our head element in each case team

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,100
l file there must be a title element inside of the head element.

29
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,410
To fix this hour let's add a title to a webpage.

30
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,210
The next error says that our ending link tag violates nesting rules.

31
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,830
The validator is telling us that this issue is occurring on line 52 of our code.

32
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,670
This may not be the exact line number but it is a good place to start.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,310
Let's scroll down to line 52 in our code.

34
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,870
We are running into an issue with the closing length tag on that line.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,220
Closer inspection reveals that on the line above it there is an opening span tag but no closing spand

36
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,000
tag.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,830
We will add the closing span tag to fix this error.

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,250
Looking back at our validator the next error tells us that around inline 81 there is an ending age for

39
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,940
tag but there were open elements.

40
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,520
There is a secondary that is similar as well.

41
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,580
Let's go to Visual Studio and scroll to line 81 to see if we can make sense of this hour online 81.

42
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,780
We have an opening each to tag but a closing H for tag.

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,470
Then on the next line we have an opening H for tag and the closing H-2 tag.

44
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,830
Swapping these tags into their respective places should fix the last two hours and or validator.

45
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,040
Now we will save our file in Visual Studio and then upload the file to the HVM validator.

46
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,660
We should see that all of the errors were fixed and the code is now error free.

47
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,720
The third option we have for validating are each team old code is validating it by direct input.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,690
As you can see when we click the third tab there is a text area where we can directly input him out

49
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,710
code to check it.

50
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,490
We can copy and paste code that we have written and run it through the validator.

51
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,030
Here are a few tips on copying and pasting code.

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,200
Be careful copying and pasting from software like Microsoft Word and other similar programs because

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,520
they may use curly quotes instead of straight quotes which some IDS may not recognize.

54
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,530
If you want to copy a line of code you can double click the line to easily select the whole line.

55
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,680
You can hold shift and hit the up and down arrows after highlighting a line to highlight the line immediately

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,220
above or below the line you highlighted prior to highlight all of the code in a file.

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,810
You can hit Control A.

58
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,810
These keyboard shortcuts make it easier to copy and paste your code into the validator.

59
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,210
Essentially the W3 see online H.T. mail validator is an excellent resource that we can use to automate

60
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,540
the checking of our code for hours as a web developer.

61
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,890
You should definitely understand how to work with this tool and use it frequently to double check your

62
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,760
code in the next lecture we will recap what we learned in this section.
