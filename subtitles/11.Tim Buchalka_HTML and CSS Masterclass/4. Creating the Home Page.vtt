00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.530
In this lecture we will create the home page for our website the home page will feature an image carousel

2
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.550
that will cycle through images.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.590
Let's go inside of our home div and start to create this content.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.680
First we will create a div that will be the container for our carousel.

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.400
We will give it to a class attribute with a value of position relative a bootstrap class that will give

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.650
all carrousel relative positioning on our Web page.

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.190
We will also give our divus style with the top value set to ninety pixels inside of this div.

8
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.290
Let's create another div we will assign our different idea of carrousel ID a class of carousel slide

9
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.070
and a data write attribute with a value of carrousel or carrousel will be broken up into two sections.

10
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.320
The actual images and the arrows that the user can use to toggle those images first we will add the

11
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.730
images themselves.

12
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.310
We will give our give a class value of carrousel item and a second class of active.

13
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.520
Then inside of our div we will add one of the images.

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.070
It will have a source of slide dot PLG a width of 100 percent a height of 500 and an all value of 1.

15
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.040
Since this is the first image in our carrousel we will have a total of three images in our Carrousel.

16
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.100
So let's make two more divs with class values of Carrousel.

17
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.050
Item an image elements inside of these div tags.

18
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.910
Next we will create the controls that the user can use to toggle between the images and all Carrousel.

19
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.060
Let's create the left arrow control for our carousel.

20
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.410
It will be an anchor tag with a class value of carrousel control Prevx on Tref of hash tag carrousel

21
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.370
ID and the data slide attribute with a value of Prevx inside of the anchor tag we will add a span element

22
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.560
with a class of carrousel control Prevx icon.

23
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.720
Let's create the right arrow control for our Carrousel.

24
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.360
It will be an anchor tag with a class value of carrousel control next on Tref of hash tag carrousel

25
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.020
ID and the data slide attribute with a value of next inside of the anchor tag we will add a span element

26
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.530
with a class of carrousel control next icon.

27
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.000
Let's run this code in the browser and see the result.

28
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.020
We should see that we now have an image carousel that cycles through the three images we added.

29
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.180
We can click on the left and right arrow controls on the carousel to go to the previous or next image

30
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.900
in the Carousel in the next lecture.

31
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.220
We will create the about page for a Web site.
