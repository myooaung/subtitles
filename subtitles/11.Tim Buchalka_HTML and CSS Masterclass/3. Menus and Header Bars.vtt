00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.880
In this lecture we will learn how to create a better bar using h t m l.

2
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.450
Let's take a look at how we can create a menu that is fixed to the top of our Web page regardless of

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.620
the scroll position.

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.630
First we will add a div to our Web page that will be a container for all of the links that will go into

5
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.350
our menu.

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.600
We will give our different idea of menu.

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.980
Next we will add an anchor element for each menu option.

8
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.360
These elements will be linked to other elements with the IDs specified after the pound symbol in the

9
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.240
value of the ATF property we will label the items option 1 through Option 5 and add a closing anchor

10
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.610
tag for each element.

11
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.720
Next we need to add the style property to our DIV tag and specify a few things.

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.910
We will give our menu a fixed position.

13
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.180
Specify it to be at the top of our Web page by adding a top value of 0 and give our manual with 100

14
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.050
percent.

15
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.700
Then we need to create some content and give it a margin top to leave space for our menu.

16
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.760
We will start by creating a development and giving it an idea of content and style with a margin top

17
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.240
of 100 pixels.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.890
Then we will add 5 paragraph elements with IDS 1 through 5 and some example content.

19
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.990
Finally we will close the development with the closing DIV tag the way that our code is now all five

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.680
paragraph elements with content 1 through 5 will be shown at once before we click any of the menu options.

21
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.180
This is because aliments and h t m l are visible by default.

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.240
Let's use the style attribute and give our elements of visibility of Hedden.

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.190
Now we need to write some code to control the display of the content when we click on the menu options.

24
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.640
To do this we will write a small block of javascript code.

25
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100
We will start off with an opening script tag.

26
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.300
Then we will use the function keyword and name or function show content section.

27
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.880
Our function will take in an ID parameter.

28
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.800
We will create a list of IDS which will be the IDs of our paragraph elements that have the content we

29
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.350
want to display on click of the menu options.

30
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.520
Our for loop will cycle through the list of IDs.

31
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.060
It will start at zero.

32
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.520
Gowalla is less than the length of our list of IDs and increment I after each iteration of the for loop.

33
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.760
If the idea we are on in the list is equal to the idea that we pass them as an argument to the function

34
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.380
we will set its visibility to visible.

35
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.830
Else we will set its visibility to hidden.

36
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.730
Finally we need to add the on click attribute to each of our anchor elements and call our function passing

37
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.880
in the idea of the content to be shown when the user clicks on the option.

38
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.770
Once we have finished typing all of that code we can run our code in the web browser and click on the

39
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.670
header menu links to see the content with that associated menu option displayed in the next lecture.

40
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.300
We will look at an intro to bootstrap.
