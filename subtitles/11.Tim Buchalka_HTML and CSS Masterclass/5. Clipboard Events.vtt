00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.730
In this lecture we will learn about each female's clipboard events the H.M. clipboard events or on copy

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.720
on paste and on cut on copy event is fired when the user copies an element we will add a paragraph element

3
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.790
and give it the on copy event which we'll call a function when the user copies the text and our paragraph

4
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.460
tag then we will create the function we will display an alert that tells the user that they copied the

5
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.120
text.

6
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.540
Let's jump to the web browser and run the code.

7
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.080
As you can see if we try to copy the text on our Web page the alert will display telling us that we

8
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.200
copied the text.

9
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.080
Let's go back to the editor on paste event fires when a user pastes content into an element.

10
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.730
We will change the event in a paragraph element to on paste.

11
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.510
Let's also change the text in order to say that we pasted text so that the message makes sense in this

12
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.060
example use case then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

13
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.450
Now if you try to paste.

14
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.620
You will see the alert pop up showing you that the on paste event was fired.

15
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.220
Let's jump back to the editor.

16
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.340
The on Card event is fired when the user cuts the contents of an element we will use the on Card event

17
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.940
to fire the function that we wrote and change the alert to say that the user cut text.

18
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.000
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code when we cut the text on our Web page.

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.770
You will see the Ilich displayed the G-mail clipboard events are useful when you want to fire an event

20
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.920
when the user copies pastes or clutch the contents of an element in the next lecture.

21
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.950
We will recap what we learned in this section.
