00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.800
In this lecture we will learn about how we can format text using HCM So there are many ways that we

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.460
can control the display and format of text and age to you now.

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.670
In this lecture we will look at how we can align text to be left aligned right aligned and centered

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.110
on our Web page then we will look at how we can add new lines cross out highlights and underline text

5
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.500
to our web pages first.

6
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.790
We will add the following line of text to our Web page.

7
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.110
We can add a style tag that uses the text align style attribute to specify if the text should be left

8
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.910
aligned centered or right aligned.

9
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.670
Here the text value will be left aligned.

10
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.450
Since we are setting the text align attribute to a value of left let's run this code in the web browser

11
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.750
to see what it looks like.

12
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.540
We will go back to the editor and look at another example.

13
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.520
We can also set the text align attribute to a value of center to center the text on the web page to

14
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.960
see this change.

15
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.480
Let's go back to the web browser and run the code.

16
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.920
Let's jump back to the editor.

17
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:33.640
We can set the text align attribute to a value of right to write a line the text on our Web page.

18
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.840
We will then run this code in the browser.

19
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.470
Let's go back to the editor.

20
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.190
As you know the B.R. tag is what allows us to specify where we want our new lines in each DML.

21
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.820
We can also add multiple back to back breaks and our textarea extra new lines when we go back to the

22
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.770
browser and run this code.

23
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.210
We will see that there are two blank lines between each of our lines of text.

24
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.200
Let's go back to the editor to add a cross out to a line of text.

25
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.450
We can use the Del tag.

26
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.670
Let's jump over to the web browser and see the result of the code we just typed.

27
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.590
This will show the $20 text crossed out.

28
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.510
Now we can go back to the editor.

29
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.840
We can also highlight text on a web page by using the mark tag we will surround the $20 text in an opening

30
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.270
and closing Mark tag to highlight it.

31
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.380
When we jump to the web browser and run our code you will see the change.

32
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500
You will notice that the $20 is now highlighted.

33
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.470
Since we surrounded it in an opening and closing marked Hegg Let's go back to the editor and look at

34
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.900
another example to add underlined text in a past version of HVM.

35
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.640
Other than HTL 5 you could use the tag.

36
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:05.690
However since we are using HVM L5 you can use the INS tag ins stands for inserted text which most browsers

37
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.020
treat is underlined.

38
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.870
So if we want to underline a portion of our text we could do it like this.

39
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.410
We will surround the $20 text with an opening.

40
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.490
I N.S. tag and a closing ins tag we can go back to the web browser and run our code to see the result.

41
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.800
And there we have it.

42
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.290
More ways to format text in each email in the next lecture.

43
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.640
We will learn how we can add hyperlinks to our Web page and each to your mail using the anchor tag.
