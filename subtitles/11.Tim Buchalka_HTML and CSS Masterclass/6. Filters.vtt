00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.030
In this lecture we will learn about how we can apply image filters using C Ss CSSA gives us the filter

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.210
property to apply filter effects to our image element to blur filter allows us to blur our image a specified

3
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.760
amount to see these examples.

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.340
First we will add an image element to our Web page and give it a source of slide that PMG then we will

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.420
add an opening and closing style tag to our code.

6
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.070
We will use the filter property and give our image a three pixel blur then we will go to the web browser

7
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.600
and run our code as you can see the blur that we specified was applied to our image.

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.120
Let's jump back to the editor the brightness filter allows us to modify the brightness of our image

9
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.410
a specified amount.

10
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.330
The higher the value the brighter we make the image and vice versa.

11
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.940
Let's give our image of brightness value of 150 percent.

12
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.570
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our image is brighter than before.

13
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.020
Let's jump back to the editor.

14
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.230
The contrast filter allows us to modify the contrast of our image.

15
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.570
The higher the value the higher the contrast than vice versa.

16
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.370
Let's assign our image a contrast of 150 percent and then run our code in the web browser as you can

17
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.010
see our image has high contrast.

18
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.350
Let's jump back to the editor

19
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.260
the drop shadow filter allows us to add a drop shadow to our image.

20
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.370
Let's use the drop shadow filter in our style code.

21
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.120
We will give our drop shadow a horizontal offset of 20 pixels of vertical offset of 15 pixels a blur

22
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.630
radius of 8 pixels and the color of gray.

23
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.000
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

24
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.640
You will notice that the drop shadow is displayed behind our image.

25
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.190
Let's jump back to the editor the grayscale filter allows us to modify the greyscale of our image of

26
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.720
value of 0 percent will leave the image unchanged and a value of 100 percent is completely gray of value

27
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.260
in between will result in a mix of the two.

28
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.530
Let's use the grayscale filter and give it a value of 50 percent.

29
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.740
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our image is partially grayed out.

30
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.940
Let's jump back to the editor the Heugh rotate FELTER allows us to rotate the hue of our image.

31
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.120
We supply a value of 0 degrees to 360 degrees.

32
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.360
Let's use the Heugh rotate filter and pass it a value of 270 degrees then we will run our code in the

33
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.350
web browser as you can see the hue of our image has been rotated.

34
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.700
Let's jump back to the editor to invert filter allows us to invert the color samples in our image.

35
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.060
We can supply the percent value from 0 percent to 100 percent.

36
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.560
So let's use the invert filter and pass it a value of 100 percent then we will go to the web browser

37
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.240
and run our code as you can see the colors in our image have been inverted.

38
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.400
Let's go back to the editor the Sebbie filter allows us to convert the image to SFP tone.

39
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.480
We can supply 2 percent value from 0 percent to 100 percent.

40
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.420
We will use the set be a filter and pass in a value of 80 percent.

41
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.140
When we run our code in the browser you will notice the effect of the sappy filter on our image.

42
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.600
Let's jump back to the editor the opacity filter allows us to modify the opacity of our image.

43
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.050
We can supply the present value from 0 percent to 100 percent zero being completely transparent and

44
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.680
100 percent being completely opaque.

45
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.340
Let's use the opacity filter and pass it a value of 70 percent.

46
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.680
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our image is 70 percent opaque.

47
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.100
Let's jump back to the other.

48
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.140
We can assign multiple filter values to the filter property by separating each with the space and putting

49
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.440
a semi-colon after the last one.

50
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.870
For this example we will give our image a saturation of 50 percent a blur of two pixels and an invert

51
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.970
value of 100 percent.

52
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.120
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see all three filters were applied to

53
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.170
our image.

54
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.850
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

55
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.800
A filter value of None will set our image back to the original image with no filter values applied.

56
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.490
Let's give our filter property a value of None and then run our code in the browser as you can see our

57
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.750
images back to its original state in the next lecture.

58
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.840
We will recap what we learned in this section.
