00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,060
In this lecture we will learn about the concepts of padding and margins.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,670
We touched on these ideas when we looked at the CSSA box model padding a space inside of the content

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,960
borders margins or spaces outside of the borders of an element.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,400
Let's take a look at padding first CSSA allows us to add padding to the top right bottom and left of

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,450
an element.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,340
There are five properties that we can use to specify the padding on each of the sides of an element

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:40,830
padding top padding right padding bottom padding left and padding to add padding to the top of an element

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,650
we can use the padding top property.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,500
First let's add a paragraph element with some example text to our Web page then we will add an opening

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,930
and closing style tag and give a paragraph element to padding top value of 20 pixels.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,140
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,910
notice that our text has a top padding of 20 pixels.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,740
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,500
We can instead use the padding left property to add padding to the left of our text.

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,020
We will switch the property to padding left and then go to the web browser.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,810
When we run the code you will notice that the 20 pixels of padding was added to the left of our element.

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:32,100
Let's jump back to the editor and of course the same applies for both the padding of bottom and padding

18
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,630
right properties.

19
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,140
Note that we can also specify the padding as a percentage instead of a pixel value.

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,290
If we change our padding left value to 10 percent and then run our code you will see the change take

21
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,320
effect.

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:51,570
Let's go back to the editor we can specify a value of inherit to make the padding be inherited from

23
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,040
the parent element.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,230
Let's wrap our paragraph element in a parent DIV tag.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,100
We will change the padding left property of paragraph element to inherit and assign our div padding

26
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,040
left property with a value of 20 pixels.

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,690
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our text now has 20 pixels of padding

28
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,830
on the left since it inherits this value from the parent development.

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,980
Let's go back to the editor when we have one or more elements nested inside of each other the inner

30
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,090
element is the child element and the outer element is the parent element.

31
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,720
We can also use the padding property to apply several possible combinations of padding.

32
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:40,090
If we give the padding one value it will apply that value to the top right bottom and left by default.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,830
Let's remove the div and give our paragraph element the padding of 25 pixels.

34
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,530
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our text now is a top right bottom

35
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,340
and left padding of 25 pixels.

36
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,470
Let's jump back to the editor.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,710
Alternatively we could specify for value separated by spaces to the padding property which the browser

38
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,980
will automatically recognize as the top right bottom and left padding respectively.

39
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:17,190
We will use the padding property and specify a top padding of 25 pixels or right padding of 20 pixels

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,440
of bottom padding of 15 pixels and the left padding of 10 pixels.

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,600
Let's go to the web browser and run our code to see the result.

42
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:34,380
In this example the top padding has a value of 25 pixels the right padding has a value of 20 pixels.

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,740
The bottom padding has a value of 15 pixels and the less padding has a value of 10 pixels.

44
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,540
Let's jump back to the editor.

45
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,310
Let's take a look at margins now.

46
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,270
There are five properties that we can use to specify the margins on each of the sides of an element.

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:58,160
These properties are margin top margin right margin bottom margin left and margin the margin properties

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,040
can have values of four types.

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,050
Auto length percent and inherit with a value of auto.

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,500
The browser will automatically calculate the margin the value can also be a specified size such as a

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,130
pixel value the value can be a percentage from 0 to 100 percent or the value can be set to inherit so

52
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,160
that the margin is inherited from its parent element to add a margin to the top of an element.

53
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,270
We can use the margin top property.

54
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,210
Let's assign our paragraph element the margin top of 20 pixels.

55
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,600
Then we will go to the web browser and see the effect.

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,170
Let's jump back to the editor.

57
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,720
We can use the margin write property to add a margin on the right of our element.

58
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,180
Let's change the property to margin right and then run our code in the browser.

59
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,410
Our element now has a right margin of 20 pixels.

60
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,450
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

61
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,420
The margin bottom property lets us had a margin to the bottom of an element.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,580
We will change our property for example to margin bottom and then run our code in the browser.

63
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,470
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example we can use the margin less property to add

64
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,510
a left margin to our element.

65
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:18,640
Let's change the property to margin last and then run our code as you can see there is a left margin

66
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,460
of 20 pixels on our element.

67
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,110
Let's jump back to the editor using the shorthand margin property we can add a margin of a specified

68
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,210
size to the left top right and bottom of our element all at once.

69
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,800
Let's use the margin property and give it a value of 20 pixels.

70
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,130
Then we will run our code in the browser.

71
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,850
Now R-TX has a 20 pixel margin on each side in the next lecture.

72
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,940
We will recap what we learned in this section.
