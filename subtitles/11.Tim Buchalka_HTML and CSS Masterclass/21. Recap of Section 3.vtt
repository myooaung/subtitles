00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.640
In this lecture we will summarize and recap what we learned in this section of the course.

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.010
I know we went over a lot of information.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.380
So let's take a look at a summary of the key facts we learned in this section of the course.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:23.450
First we looked at what HVM is HVM L stands for hypertext markup language.

5
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.490
The first version of chainmail was released in 1991 and the latest version aged UML 5 was released in

6
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370
2014.

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.350
The main value of each team is that it allows us to define content to display on our web pages.

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.870
Next we looked at tags in each DML tags are the building blocks of each T.M. code a tag uses angular

9
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.620
brackets and most HVM elements have an opening and closing tag.

10
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:59.720
Some examples of usefully [REMOVED] tags include the paragraph image menu menu item title body heading

11
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.310
and video tags.

12
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.250
Then we look at the format of NHT UML document each page Jamail document follows a certain structure

13
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.350
that communicates to the web browser its content.

14
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.580
Here's the basic outline of an aged female document and each team L5 it is a skeleton that we can type

15
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.090
our code into.

16
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.230
Remember remember the code that we type that defines the content of an aged female web page goes between

17
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.370
the opening and closing body tags.

18
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.340
After that we looked at the structure of each female code.

19
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.000
We learned some of the key terms for HTL syntax.

20
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.350
Content is anything that goes between the opening and closing tags.

21
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.390
An element is the L code from the opening to the closing tag including the content between the tags.

22
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.370
An attribute is called we add to the opening tag that gives the tag additional information.

23
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.130
Then we looked at giving a web page or title and headings the title tag is not used to display a title

24
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.070
on the page but rather it is used as metadata that describes the page and is visible on the top tab

25
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.390
of the web page.

26
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.850
The bookmarks window and in the search engine results.

27
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.440
We used the heading tags each one through 8:06 to display titles that are visible on the web page.

28
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.210
The text that we put inside of these heading tags is very important as search engines use this information

29
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.130
when deciding what keywords are in search results.

30
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:31.910
Next we looked at paragraphs and text in HVM l the p tag or paragraph tag allows us to put text into

31
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.520
our web page.

32
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.460
The B.Tech allows us to display the text in Bold and the tag allows us to display the text in italics.

33
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.420
The B.R. tag allows us to insert a new line into our text.

34
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.170
The price tag allows us to display text to the web browser exactly as it was typed.

35
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.290
After that we looked at the style tag and HMO the style tag allows us to sterilize our elements and

36
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.650
control how they are displayed in the browser.

37
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.860
We can control what elements the style is applied to in three ways using the tag name using the ID of

38
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.560
the element or the class that the element belongs to.

39
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.620
To use the tag name we just specify the tag name itself to use the ID.

40
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.890
We use a hash tag or pound symbol followed by the ID to use the class we use a period followed by the

41
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.910
class name.

42
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.110
Then we looked at formatting text in HMO.

43
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.140
We can align text using the text align style to align our text to left align we give the text a line

44
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.950
style value of left to align our text to write a line.

45
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.840
We give the text a line style of value of right to align our text to center align we give the text the

46
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.040
line style a value of center the mark tag allows us to highlight text the Del tag allows us to cross

47
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.320
out text.

48
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.400
Then we looked at hyperlinks in each GMO.

49
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.350
The anchor tag allows us to add hyperlinks to our code.

50
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.220
The rough attribute can be assigned to your l value where the hyperlink should take us to the content

51
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.970
of the anchor tag is the actual length displayed in the web browser and can be text or an image using

52
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.100
the link style allows us to specify a color for our hyperlink other than the default color of blue.

53
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.090
Adding the title attribute to our anchor tag allows us to specify a tooltip that will display when the

54
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.590
user hovers over a hyperlink.

55
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.440
Then we learn some more about images and HVM l images can be added to a web page using the image tag

56
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.760
we specify the source of an image using the source attribute.

57
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.170
We can specify a width and height for our image by using the width and height attributes within the

58
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.120
opening image.

59
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:59.650
Ted if we want to make only part or parts of an image clickable we can use an image map.

60
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.440
After that we learned about buttons and HVM the button tag is used to create a button an HMO the on

61
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.330
click attribute allows us to specify the behavior of a button when we click it.

62
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.270
Finally we looked at comments and HMO comments are useful because they allow developers to type notes

63
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.500
that aren't treated as code.

64
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.900
Comments can also be used to debug code line by line and HVM all comments are created using the comment

65
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.900
tag which has the following syntax.

66
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.660
Now you have an understanding of the fundamental building blocks of HVM all in the next section.

67
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:45.820
We will learn how to display data using HDMI out including creating lists tables layout and forms.
