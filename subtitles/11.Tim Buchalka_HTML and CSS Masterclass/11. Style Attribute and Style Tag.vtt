00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.050
In this lecture we will learn how we can stylize each team out elements by using the style attribute

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.830
and style tag in each team Moul the style tag allows us to specify how elements should be displayed

3
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.550
in the browser a style element starting with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag the contents

4
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.370
of a style element define the different style rules for how elements should be rendered to the screen.

5
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.900
HTL documents can have more than one style tag.

6
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.640
In fact you can use as many as you want within your HGL document.

7
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.530
When using a style tag you can specify an element by tag type ID or class ID.

8
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.680
Let's take a look at an example of each of these.

9
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.250
Say we have a paragraph element and its content is the text that we want to apply the style to.

10
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.100
We can then use the style tag to specify a style for all the elements within the tags.

11
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.990
For example let's take a closer look at the syntax here.

12
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.850
First we put an opening style tag to store all four style element.

13
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.290
Next we put the tag name that we want to stylize.

14
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.760
In this case we specify P meaning that any content on our Web page within the paragraph tags will be

15
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.790
affected by the style we type here.

16
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.100
An opening curly brace is used to start the body of our style for this element.

17
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.720
Then we specify the style attribute we want to modify.

18
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.600
In this case we want to change the color of the text.

19
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.290
We then put a colon and then the value of the attribute.

20
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.520
In this case we want the text to be changed to the color green.

21
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.850
A semi-colon signifies the end of this statement and then we close all four style with the closing curly

22
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.350
brace and closing style tag.

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.920
We will go to the web browser and drag our team out file over to see the result of the code we just

24
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.370
typed

25
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.250
Let's go back to the Visual Studio code editor and build on this example.

26
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.630
Notice that if we add another text element within a paragraph tag it is also affected by our changes.

27
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.390
For example adding the following line and then running the code in the web browser results in this line

28
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.190
also being displayed with a color of green.

29
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.280
If we wanted this change to affect only one of the elements on our Web page we could specify that the

30
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.340
style only be applied to an element with a certain ID value.

31
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.600
Let's make the following changes to our code.

32
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.800
First add an id attribute to the opening tag for a first element and assign the id attribute value of.

33
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.520
I am g 1 next.

34
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.970
Let's give our second element an idea of I am G-2 by doing the same thing adding an id attribute with

35
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.630
a value of.

36
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.540
I am G-2 to our second element.

37
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.970
Finally we want to change our style elements so that it only affects the first line of text.

38
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.990
So instead of using P to specify what to apply the style to we will use a hash tag or pound symbol followed

39
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.110
by the ID of the element which is one in this case the pound symbol tells our style code to look for

40
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.740
an element with that ID and apply the style to it.

41
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.750
We can go back to the browser and run the code we just typed to see the result.

42
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.580
Let's go back to the editor and learn about classes the third way that we can group elements to assign

43
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.940
styles to their Mysti use classes and H.T. M-L we can use the class attribute to group elements together

44
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.320
logically.

45
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.340
Let's take a look at an example.

46
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.160
Say we have four elements each of which is enclosed in a paragraph tag.

47
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.840
Now let's say we wanted to change elements one in three to red and Elements 2 and 4 to blue.

48
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.120
We could assign each an ID and then specify a style for each individual element.

49
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.610
But what if we wanted to make sure that any styles added to Element 1 were also added TELLEMENT 3 hard

50
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.820
coding ideas would not be the most elegant solution in this case.

51
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.920
As a result we would want to group elements 1 in 3 into their own class and then assign elements to

52
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.810
and for their own class.

53
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.510
We could do so by doing the following.

54
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.320
Then we would define a style for each class.

55
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.290
We would first put an opening style tag and then put in our style logic to reference the name of a class.

56
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.430
Put a period or dot before the class name.

57
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.490
This tells HVM that you're using a class to identify your elements as opposed to a tag name or ID.

58
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.200
Notice that we can specify styles for more than one class within the same style element.

59
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.310
We don't need to have opening and closing style tags all over our code.

60
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.550
Rather we can keep our code clean and readable by using one style tag and then putting in all of the

61
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.770
information to style each of our classes or elements and there we can go back to the browser and run

62
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.270
the code to see the result.

63
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.560
Aside from just changing the color of our text there are several other style attributes we can use to

64
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.870
modify the display of our HVM all elements.

65
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.010
For example we can use the font size attribute to change the font size of.

66
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.670
In this example.

67
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.130
We will give Class 1 a font size of 50.

68
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.180
This will make any text that belongs to class 1 have a font size of 50 pixels.

69
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.350
Let's see the result of this code by going back to the web browser and running the code.

70
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.960
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

71
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.640
We could also use the background color property to specify a background color for a web page for example

72
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.610
if we want to change the background color to black.

73
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.300
We could do the following.

74
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.370
This will give any elements within the body tag of our each team document a background color of black

75
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.060
to see this effect.

76
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.300
We will go to the browser and drag in our HVM will file the style tag is very useful and HVM now as

77
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:14.050
we can specify how the elements in each Chmela are rendered to the screen the color font size and background

78
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.610
color attributes that we looked at.

79
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.340
Here are just a few examples of the Starla attributes that you can use to control the look and display

80
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.910
of your HVM old web pages in the next lecture.

81
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.210
We will learn about how we can format text using HMO.
