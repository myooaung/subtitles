00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.420
In this lecture we will learn some additional ways that CSSA gives us the stylized buttons.

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.510
These examples will direct build off of the code we wrote in The Last Lecture.

3
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.530
The border radius property allows us to specify how round the corners of our button should be.

4
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.170
Let's give our button a border radius of five pixels.

5
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.410
Note that this block of CSSA code is outside of the hover an active select is that we specified We want

6
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.440
this style to apply to the button element regardless of its state.

7
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.210
So we will use the button element selector then we will go to the web browser and run our code

8
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.330
as you can see the corners of our button are now rounded.

9
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.830
Let's jump back to the editor.

10
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.280
The larger the value of the border radius the rounder or button will be less increased the value of

11
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.520
the border radius property to 20 pixels to see the effect it will have on the corners of our button.

12
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.130
We will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the corners of our button are much more

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.940
round to the increase in border race that we added.

14
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.990
Let's go back to the editor the box Shatto property allows us to add a shadow behind button.

15
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.310
We will specify the box Shatto property inside of our style code and give our button a box chÃ¢teaux

16
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.560
with the horizontal position of two pixels a vertical position of two pixels and the color of gray.

17
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.560
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see there is now a shadow behind our

18
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.200
button.

19
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.820
Let's jump back to the editor if we want to add a custom image to our button we could add an image element

20
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.190
between the opening and closing button tags.

21
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.750
To illustrate this example let's add an image element between the opening and closing button tags in

22
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.520
our code and give the image element the source of our checkerboard jpeg image.

23
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.670
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

24
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.620
as you can see the image on our button is a checkerboard image.

25
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.300
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

26
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.800
We can also add a background image to a button using CSSA style code.

27
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.780
First we will add a button element to our code and specify a type attribute with a value of button.

28
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.700
We will Starla button and give it a background of our checkerboard JPEG image a height of 200 pixels

29
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.650
in a with 400 pixels.

30
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.540
Then we will run our code in the web browser as you can see our checkerboard images displayed on the

31
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.160
button.

32
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.550
Let's jump back to the other.

33
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.560
It is also possible to swap the background image on a button when the button is clicked to do this we

34
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.680
leave the active selector and change the background image property.

35
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.080
In this case we will change our background image to start PMG if the user clicks on the button.

36
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.000
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the buttons background is changed from the

37
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.840
checkerboard image to the star image when the button is being clicked in the next lecture.

38
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.010
We will learn about adding animation to our button using s.c.s.
