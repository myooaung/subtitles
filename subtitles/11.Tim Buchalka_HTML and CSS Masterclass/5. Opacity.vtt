00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.940
In this lecture we will learn about opacity and how we can specify image opacity using CSSA code opacity

2
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.180
refers to the level of transparency an image has the moral Paikin images the less transparent it is

3
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.420
and vice versa.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.080
As we looked at in a previous lecture the transparent keyword allows us to specify a fully transparent

5
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.430
color CSSA also gives us the opacity property which we can specify as a float the higher reset the opacity

6
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.240
the more opaque it is when specifying opacity is a float value of value of zero is fully transparent

7
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.530
and a value of 1 is fully opaque.

8
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.260
For these examples let's create an image element and give it a source of ushe start PMG image.

9
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.240
Then we will add an opening and closing style tag where we will specify our style code.

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.340
We will use the opacity property and give our image an opacity of 1.0 or full opacity.

11
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.110
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our images displayed in full opacity on

12
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.460
our Web page.

13
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.740
Let's jump back to the other

14
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420
to make our image fully transparent.

15
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.580
We can assign an opacity of zero point zero.

16
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.410
Let's make this change in the code.

17
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.790
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code to see the result.

18
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.790
As you can see we can no longer see the images it is completely transparent.

19
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.130
Let's jump back to the other.

20
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.280
If we give our image opacity a float value between zero point zero and one point zero our image will

21
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.060
become partially transparent assigning our image in opacity of 0.5 will make our image display at 50

22
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.620
percent opacity.

23
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.230
Let's give our image an opacity value of 0.5 and then run our code in the web browser as you can see

24
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.850
our images displayed at half of its opacity in the next lecture we will learn about filters and see

25
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.410
assess.
