00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.390
In this lecture we will learn about the padding properties that CSSA allows us to animi the padding

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.100
properties we can animate using CSSA or padding padding bottom padding left padding right and padding

3
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.960
top.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.770
In this example we will animate the padding left property to animate the text moving from left to right

5
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.800
on the web page.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.790
First we will create the text that we will animate next lets say it our opening and closing style tags

7
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.300
we will stylize our text and give it an animation of padding Annam a duration of one second and make

8
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.180
it loop using the infinite keyword lets write the code for our animation we will name the animation

9
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.090
padding and will specify that the padding left property will go from a value of zero pixels to a value

10
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.290
of 120 pixels.

11
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.330
When we run our code in the web browser you should see the animation in the next lecture.

12
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.990
We will learn how we can animate the words spacing and the letter spacing properties using C Ss.
