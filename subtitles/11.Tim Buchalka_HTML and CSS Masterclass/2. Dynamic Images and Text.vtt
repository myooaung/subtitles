00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.070
In this lecture we learn how we can size images and text responsively.

2
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.400
This topic is important because if we are used to assigning text an image size is using pixel values

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.860
they will always have the same size regardless of the size of the browser window.

4
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.180
This could be problematic as we could have big images in a very small browser window or small images

5
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.930
in a very large browser window.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.170
A smarter solution would be to size the elements on a web page responsively meaning that their size

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.750
would be proportional to the size of the browser.

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.000
First we would look at how we can responsibly sized images on our Web page we could assign a percent

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.810
value to the height and width of our image as opposed to pixel values.

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.500
For this example we will add an image element to our Web page and give it a source of start PLG an all

11
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.540
star a waste of 50 percent and a height of 50 percent.

12
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.620
Then we will go to the web browser and let our code as we resize the browser.

13
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.270
You will notice that the image rescale is dynamically

14
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.400
then we will go back to the editor.

15
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.690
It is also possible to responsively size text Ameche XML instead of giving a font size in pixels.

16
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.110
We can give our text a font size and VW or viewport with unit.

17
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.200
This means that the text size will be based on the size of the browser window.

18
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.700
For this example we will add a paragraph element and give it a font size of 10 VW.

19
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.680
We will give our elements some example text content then we will go to the web browser and what our

20
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.330
code when we resize the browser we will notice that our text dynamically rescaled if we want to prevent

21
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.370
an element from scaling past a certain height or with we could use the max with max height properties

22
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.710
and the next lecture we will learn how to create menus and hetter bars for a web pages use an HMO.
