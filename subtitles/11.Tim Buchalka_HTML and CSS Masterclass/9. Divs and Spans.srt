1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,250
In this lecture we will learn about divs and spans nht.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,110
Now when developing using H T.M. you will inevitably find yourself in a situation where you want to

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,200
group elements together for logical or styling purposes but these elements may not fall under specific

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,680
element categories like Articles section or side that we looked at in the last lecture when we need

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,360
a generic container that we can use to logically group HVM elements.

6
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:39,200
We use the DIV tag the DIV tag is essentially a container used to group other HDMI elements.

7
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,460
This is very convenient for when we want to group elements with different tags.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,560
For example if we wanted to group A H to heading a paragraph and an image together we could just Arap

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,190
these elements in their own DIV tag.

10
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,990
For this example we will start with an opening DIV tag.

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,400
Then we will add an H to heading element to a web page.

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,790
After that we will add a paragraph element with some example text then we will have an image element

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,150
that references or Star start PLG image.

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,350
Finally we will add a closing DIV tag each of the three elements we just added to our Web page.

15
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,280
The H-2 element paragraph element an image element or all children or elements of the div.

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,100
Since there are within its opening and closing tag let's run this code in the browser.

17
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,780
Then we will go back to the editor

18
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,110
we can add an ID to our development to give it its own unique identifier that separates it from all

19
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,040
of our other HVM elements on our Web page.

20
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:51,160
Let's keep the example code we have and add an ID for our div and this demonstration our ID will be

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:58,620
Group 1 all HMO elements support the ID attribute meaning that we can give any HDMI element its own

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,030
unique identifier.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,810
We can also give each element that is grouped inside of our development their own unique identifiers.

24
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:13,170
Let's give our H-2 element an idea of heading or paragraph element an idea of text and our image element

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,160
and idea of image recall that block elements automatically have a newline inserted above and below them

26
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,400
inline elements are usually used inside of block elements and affect the content inside of the block

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,780
element the DIV tag is used to group block elements.

28
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,790
If we want to group inline elements we can use a span tag for example if we have a H-2 heading element

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,760
and we want to group a few words inside of it we can use the spam tag.

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,140
This will make the words we regroup their own span element which can have its own separate style and

31
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,080
other properties added to it.

32
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,340
Let's look at an example of this.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,270
We will start out with an opening h to tag and then some example text midway through our text we will

34
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:07,350
add an opening span tag and give it an idea of spanne one then we will add some more text content which

35
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,010
will be the content of the span element.

36
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:17,880
Finally we will add a closing span tag and a closing H-2 tag adding an ID to our span element is useful

37
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,220
because now we can apply a style to this spand element specifically let's build on the code we just

38
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,120
wrote to demonstrate this.

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,560
We will start with an opening style tag then a pound symbol that specifies the idea of spanne one that

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,580
we gave to our Spanta element and give it a font style of italic then we will add a closing style tag.

41
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,000
Finally we will go to our browser and run this code.

42
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,510
As you can see the text content that we added to our span is displayed in italics in the next lecture.

43
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,660
We will learn about forms and HMO.
