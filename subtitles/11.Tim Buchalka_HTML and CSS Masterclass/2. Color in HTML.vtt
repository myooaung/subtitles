00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.410
In this lecture we will learn about color and h t m l color is a crucial aspect of a web page.

2
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.670
Each team gives us several options for specifying color.

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.560
We can specify colors by their names.

4
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.930
HVM l supports a total of 140 color names.

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.280
Color can also be specified by using or G-B color values or G-B stands for red green blue.

6
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.160
And each parameter defines how much of the color is in the mix from 0 to 255.

7
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.250
Naturally numbers closer to zero mean that a lesser amount of the color is used and numbers closer to

8
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.360
255 mean that a significant amount of the color is used.

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.650
A color value of white is created by setting all three parameters or G and B to A value of 255 a color

10
00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.840
value of black is created by setting all three parameters are G and B to A value of zero.

11
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.320
If you put the same number for our GNB you will create a shade of gray.

12
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.830
You can also specify an arguably a color value where the H stands for Alpha.

13
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.530
So value is specified by a number from zero point zero to 1 point zero representing the percentage of

14
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.770
opacity.

15
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.100
The closer to zero point zero this number is the more transparent the color is the closer to 1 one point

16
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.510
zero.

17
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.480
This number is the more opaque.

18
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.490
The color is.

19
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.560
If this number is exactly zero point zero then the color will be fully transparent and not shown at

20
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.370
all.

21
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.610
If the number is 1 point zero then the color will be fully opaque and not have any transparency hexadecimal

22
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.620
color is specified using a hash tag or pound symbol followed by either 6 or 8 integers.

23
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.640
The first two integers represent the read value.

24
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.600
The second two integers represent the green color value.

25
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.000
The third pair of integers represent the blue color value.

26
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.950
The fourth pair of integers if present specify the alphabet for the next color.

27
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.230
H S L stands for hue saturation lightness and HSLDA stands for hue saturation lightness Alpha and both

28
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.920
are another way that we can specify color in HVM l the h in H S L stands for Q and specifies the color

29
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.870
value essentially of value from 0 to 360 can be provided representing a degree on the color wheel.

30
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.730
The SNH S L stands for saturation and specifies the intensity of the color 0 is gray and 100 is the

31
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.660
full color.

32
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.980
Anything in between is a mix of gray and the color specified by the hue.

33
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.550
The zero to 100 stands for a percent of what percent intensity the hue should be displayed at the LNH

34
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.690
s.l Santror lightness and represents how light or dark the color should be displayed.

35
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.210
The closer this value is to zero the darker the color the closer this value is to one hundred.

36
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.050
The lighter the color.

37
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.720
If this value is zero the color is displayed as black.

38
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.370
If this value is 100 the color is white.

39
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.000
The A in HSLDA stands for Alpha which specifies the color opacity the same as the a in our.

40
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.630
The alpha values specified by a number from zero point zero to one point zero representing the percentage

41
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.870
of opacity.

42
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.430
The closer to zero point zero this number is the more transparent the color is the closer to 1 point

43
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.600
zero the number is the moral PAIK The color is.

44
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.070
If this number is exactly zero point zero then the color will be fully transparent and not shown at

45
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.010
all.

46
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.320
If this number is 1 point zero then the color will be fully opaque and not have any transparency.

47
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.310
Any of these methods of specifying color can be used in each Chimo.

48
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.600
It is just a matter of preference and your needs and the next lecture.

49
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.240
We will learn about coloring elements in HCM all.
