00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,350
In this lecture we will summarize and recap what we learned in this section.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,900
First we learned how to create an external CSSA style sheet and link it to an HMO file using HVM Elle's

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:23,080
linked tag CSSA files have a file extension of Dotsie SS and HVM all files have a file extension of

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,930
either dot each email or dot each.

5
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,780
We learned about three different attributes of each Trimble's the linked tag the Rella attribute specifies

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:38,260
the relationship between the h t m l file and the firelit is being linked to the type attribute specifies

7
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,130
the media type of the file you are linking to the HVM file.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,620
The third attribute of the link tag is the HSF attribute which specifies the file that we want to link.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:55,600
After that we compared and contrasted when to use an external CSSA style sheet or embed style code directly

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,060
into HVM using the style tag.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,270
When we link an external CSSA file to an HCM file it is called external styling.

12
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:10,880
When we use the style tag to add style information to the team document it is known as internal styling.

13
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,150
If we use the style attribute directly inside of an aliments opening tag to Starlee element we are using

14
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,890
inline styling.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,360
When you are defining styles that will be used across the entire web site.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,970
It is best to use external styling defining your styles in an external CSSA file when you are defining

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,170
styles that will affect one web page.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,530
You should embed the style into the page using the style tag.

19
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,680
If you are defining a style that you don't intend to reuse you can use a style attribute directly inside

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,540
of an elements opening tag.

21
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,100
Then we looked at some terms common when referring to CSSA syntax.

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,670
We learned that a selector is how we tell CSSA code what HDMI element to apply the style to.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:58,510
There are three types of selectors element selectors ID selectors and class selectors element selectors

24
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:04,090
or when we directly reference in Elements tagged in the style we specify as applied to all elements

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,280
of that same type.

26
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,860
Id selectors are when we use the pound symbol followed by a unique idea signed only to a single H.T.

27
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,860
M-L element.

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:18,040
The style we specify is only applied to the single element that has that Id class selectors or when

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,840
we use a period followed by a class name.

30
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,570
The style that we specify is applied to all elements that belong to that class.

31
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,740
Declarations are when we assign a value to a property.

32
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,050
A property is on the left hand side followed by a colon and then a value for that property ended with

33
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,430
a semi-colon.

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:43,240
We learned that comments have the syntax of forward slash asterisk comment text and then asterisk forward

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,230
slash.

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,420
This applies to both single line and multi-line comment.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,780
After that we learned about CSSA is cascading order which specifies which type of styling takes precedence

38
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,050
if there is a conflict inline styles have the highest precedence followed by internal styles and then

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,260
external styles.

40
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,880
And finally browser defaults then we look at the CSA box model a conceptual model used by developers

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,850
to understand how each team l elements are laid out and stylize.

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,420
Essentially we can think of each h team element as being contained in a box and that box having four

43
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,680
distinct areas content padding border and margins.

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,350
The content is the actual element.

45
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,300
For example the image or text padding is inside of the outer bounds of the element and directly affects

46
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,040
the display of the content.

47
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,950
A border defines the outer bounds of an element.

48
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,790
Margins affect the element as a whole but don't directly push against the content of the element.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,720
Finally we looked at padding and margins and CSSA padding a space inside of the contents borders CSSA

50
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:52,960
gives us 5 properties had padding to an element padding padding top padding right padding bottom and

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,140
padding left margins or spaces outside of the borders of an element.

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:05,200
CSSA gives just 5 properties to add margins to an element margin margin top margin right margin bottom

53
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,230
and margin left in the next section.

54
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,020
We will learn about modifying text using C Ss.
