00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.890
In this lecture we will recap what we have learned in this section of the course in this section.

2
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.260
We learned how we can use CSSA to stylize and animate our button first.

3
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.000
We learned how to use CSSA selectors to specify the behavior of our button in certain states.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.670
The hover selector specifies what will happen when the user hovers over the button with their mouse.

5
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.520
The active selector specifies what happens when the user clicks the button.

6
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.570
After that we learned about some more properties that we can use to stylize our buttons to border radious

7
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.200
property allows us to round out the corners of our button.

8
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.180
The larger the value of the border radius property the rounder the button will be.

9
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.820
The box Shatto property allows us to add a shadow behind button to add a custom image to our button.

10
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.820
We can assign a button a background image using the background image property or add in an image element

11
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.830
between our opening and closing button tags.

12
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.160
We can swap the buttons background image on click by using the active selector and using the background

13
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.960
image property.

14
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.200
Finally we learned how to animate our buttons using CSSA we created a button pulse animation for the

15
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.000
buttons idle state to do this.

16
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.560
We animated the transformed properties scale.

17
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.740
Then we looked at how to create a button pressed animation.

18
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.990
We did this using the box Shatto property and also by modifying the transform property translating it

19
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.980
in the y direction to simulate the downward movement of the button click in the next section.

20
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.330
We will learn about CSSA pseudo classes and selectors and the role that they play in stabilising elements

21
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.440
using SS.
