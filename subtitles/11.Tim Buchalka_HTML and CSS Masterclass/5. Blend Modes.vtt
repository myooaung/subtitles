00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.690
In this lecture we will learn about blend modes and see SS CSSA gives us access to the background blend

2
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.090
mode property that we can use to blend two or more images together in different ways to see examples

3
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.670
of using these blend modes.

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.310
Let's first add a div to our webpage.

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.010
Next we will add an opening style tag and start writing our style code.

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.320
We will add a selector that will Star-Lord div and give it a height and width of 500 pixels.

7
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.790
We will then add the background image property and give it a value of the paths to the image that we

8
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.090
want to blend.

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.970
Let's specify our star PNB image then put a comma and then specify our blue JPEG image by default.

10
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.070
Any images that we specify will have a background repeat value of repeat.

11
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.270
If we don't want our images to repeat we can add a value of no repeat for the background repeat property

12
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.120
then we will add the background blend mode property in order to specify the blend mode that our two

13
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.700
images will be blended together with the multiply blend mode multiplies one image with another image

14
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.680
resulting in a darker image.

15
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.360
Let's use the background blend mode properly and give it a value of multiply.

16
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.740
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

17
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.850
as you can see the two images were blended into a darker image.

18
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.770
Let's jump back to the editor.

19
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.350
The screen blend mode is the opposite of the multiply blend mode and results in a brighter image.

20
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.000
Let's change the blend mode to screen and then run our code in the browser.

21
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.330
As you can see the two images were blended together into a lighter image.

22
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.040
Let's jump back to the editor.

23
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.230
The overlay blend mode combines the previous two blend modes multiply in screen resulting in an image

24
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.530
that is lighter in some places and darker in other places.

25
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.760
We will change the blend mode to overlay and then go to the web browser and run our code as you can

26
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.410
see some parts of the image are darker and others are lighter.

27
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.310
Let's jump back to the editor Dorkin compares the two images and selects the darker pixel in each case

28
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.730
resulting in a darkened image.

29
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.540
Let's use the Darkon blend mode.

30
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.430
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our two images were combined together

31
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.730
into a darker image.

32
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.240
Let's jump back to the editor

33
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.280
liten does the opposite and for each pixel selects the lighter of the pixels in the images being blended.

34
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.950
Let's change the blend mode to lighten and then go to the web browser and run our code as you can see

35
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.690
the two images were combined into a lighter image.

36
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.790
Let's jump back to the editor color dodge decreases the contrast between the base color and blend color.

37
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.620
Making the base color brighter.

38
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.650
Let's change the code to use the color dodge blend mode and then go to the web browser and run our code

39
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.470
as you can see the result is an image with a brighter base color.

40
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:10.060
Let's jump back to the editor color burn on the other hand increases the contrast between the base color

41
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.340
and blend color to darken the base color.

42
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.700
We use the color burned blend mode and run our code in the web browser.

43
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.330
As you can see the base color has darkened.

44
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.090
In fact our star image seems nearly blended completely into the blue image.

45
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.990
But if you look very closely you can see the star inside of the image.

46
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.830
Let's jump back to the editor hard light is a blend mode that helps to add shadows to an image.

47
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.640
Let's change the blend mode the hard light and then run our code to see the result.

48
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.660
Then we will go back to the editor soft light is useful for adding diffuse light to an image.

49
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.120
We really use a soft light blend mode and then run our code see the result.

50
00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.100
Then we will jump back to the editor and look at another example different takes the difference in brightness

51
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.360
between the base color and blonde color.

52
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.790
Let's use the difference blend mode and then run our code in the browser then we will jump back to the

53
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.280
editor exclusionist similar to different but lower in contrast let's use the exclusion blend mode and

54
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:25.340
then run our code in the browser then we will jump back to the editor who takes the Blen colors hue

55
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.930
and combines that with the saturation of the base color we will use the hue blend mode and then run

56
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.930
our code in the browser as you can see the store in the middle has turned a brownish color as a result

57
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.790
of the blending.

58
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.370
Let's jump back to the editor

59
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.700
saturation combines the hue of the base color with the saturation of the blonde color.

60
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.200
We will use the saturation blend mode and then go to the web browser and run our code.

61
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.790
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

62
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.120
The color blend mode is useful for color and monochromatic images.

63
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.250
Let's use the color blends mode and run our code to see the result.

64
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.520
Then we will go back to the editor luminously creates an effect opposite of the color blend mode.

65
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.350
We will change the blend mode we are using the luminously and then run our code to see the result.

66
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.480
Then we will jump back to the editor a blend mode of normal resets the blend mode.

67
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.890
Let's change the blend mode to normal and then run our code in the browser.

68
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.190
The result is the two images blended together without any blending of fact.

69
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.800
Visually it looks like one image was placed directly on top of the other and the next lecture we will

70
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.720
look at a recap of what we learned in this section of the course.
