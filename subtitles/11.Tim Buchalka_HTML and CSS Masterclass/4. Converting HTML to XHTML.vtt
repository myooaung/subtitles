In this lecture we will get some hands on experience converting H.T. Imelda sh t m l.

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.410
Let's start with the following HVM l code and then we will go step by step through the process of converting

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.730
it to ex-secret you know the first step is to replace the current h team L5 doc type with the X each

4
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.710
time l doc type

5
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.520
after that we need to add an X Allen attribute to the opening h g m l tags on our Web page.

6
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.000
In this case since we are only working with one page of HMO we only have one HDMI element then we need

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.840
to make sure that all attribute and element names are lowercase.

8
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.420
This is an important difference between h t m l n sh t m l.

9
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.470
In the case of this example this means changing the value of the name attribute in our H-1 tag to heading

10
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.970
with a lowercase h since all x h t l attributes need to have a lowercase value.

11
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.250
It also means changing the type attribute in our input element to have a lower case t since sh t about

12
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350
attributes have lowercase names.

13
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.490
We need to make sure that we surround the attribute values in our code with quotes.

14
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.140
Notice that currently the type attribute in our input field has a value of text that isn't quoted.

15
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.440
We need to add quotes around the word text to fix this.

16
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.160
While we are looking at the input element for this example there is another change that we need to make.

17
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.070
Sh t m l does not support attribute minimisation.

18
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.470
This means that we need to change any boolean attributes to also have an equal sign and a value the

19
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.250
disabled attribute in our input field will be changed to disabled equals disabled with the attribute

20
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.860
value in quotes for our input element.

21
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.300
There is one last change that we need to make one of the rules of each team that we need to close all

22
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.440
empty elements.

23
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.740
Finally we need to get rid of all the name attributes on our element.

24
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.900
We can instead convert them to ID attributes.

25
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.390
Remember if there are any errors in our code our sh t m l won't run.

26
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.780
Let's run this code in a web browser and make sure that it works.

27
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.970
And there you have it.

28
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.840
That's how you convert HVM to Exige him out.

29
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.570
And the next lecture we will recap what we learned in this section of the course.
