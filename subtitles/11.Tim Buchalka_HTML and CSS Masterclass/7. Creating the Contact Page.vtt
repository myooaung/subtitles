00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.890
In this lecture we will create the contact page for our website.

2
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.750
Most of the code we write in this lecture will go into our contact.

3
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.230
First let's say that the style attribute to our div we will assign the div a visibility of Hedden a

4
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:27.840
top value of 400 pixels a less value of 25 percent and a position value of absolute.

5
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.980
Then we will add an H1 heading element that will display the word contact at the top of this section

6
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.760
so that users know that they are on the Contact section of our Web site.

7
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.550
We will give our Each one element a star a latch a beaut with a with value of 100 percent text a line

8
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.490
value of center and a color of white.

9
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.810
Next we will add a div that will be the container for form.

10
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.800
We will give it a star lache U-Boot with a with value of eight hundred pixels and a clear value of both

11
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.620
inside of this div we will put the code for a form.

12
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.680
We will add an opening and closing form tag and give our form the action and method attributes for the

13
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.400
action.

14
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.830
We will give it a value of a javascript function that we will write call display alert and for the method

15
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.200
attribute we will add a value of post inside of the form we will add an unworded list.

16
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.050
Let's say I add an opening and closing UL tag we will add the style attribute to the opening UL tag

17
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.040
and give it the list style type attribute with a value of None.

18
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.160
We will let our first item using the ally tag inside of the opening ally tag.

19
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.690
We will add the style attribute with a color value of white then between the opening and closing ally

20
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.920
tags will put the label for our input field which will be email followed by an input element for input

21
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.950
tag we will give it a type attribute with a value of text an ID attribute with a value of email and

22
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.950
a class attribute with a value of form input field as the next list item.

23
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.260
We will add a space.

24
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.990
We can do so using the character combination of ampersand and S P which stands for non-breaking space.

25
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.930
Essentially a blank line underneath our content.

26
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.500
Don't forget the semi-colon at the end of the character combination.

27
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.690
Next up is the subject input field.

28
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.780
We will add another list item with an input element inside of it.

29
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.180
The label for this input field will be subject and we will give the idea of value of subject.

30
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.460
Then we will add another space as a list item as the third list item.

31
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.320
We will add a text area where the user can type the body of their email.

32
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.350
The text area will have a rose value for a column value of 50 and an ID of body.

33
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.360
Then we will add a space after that we will add a submit button to our form.

34
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.450
It will be an input element with a type value if submit a name of submit and a value of submit.

35
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.470
Note that the value is the label that will be displayed on the button.

36
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.120
Next we need to write the javascript function we referenced earlier which we call display alert.

37
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.370
We will go to our script element and add dysfunction below the other code we have there.

38
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.090
We will use the function keyword and call our function display alert.

39
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.700
We will create three variables one to store the email address input one to store the subject line input

40
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.400
and one to store the message body and put our first variable we will name email address and we will

41
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.410
use the document get element by ID function to get the value of the email address the user types and

42
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.110
our second variable be called subject line and will get the value of the subject that the user types

43
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.020
in our third variable will be called message body and will get the value of the message body that the

44
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.200
user typed into the text area for the body of the message.

45
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.820
Then we will create an alert message variable that will store all of the information to display to the

46
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.840
user.

47
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:56.200
We will do our string concatenation and formatting during this step.

48
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.900
Then we will call javascript alert function and pass in the Alert message variable we created.

49
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.560
Finally we can run our code

50
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.830
after entering values in each of the fields and hitting the submit button.

51
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.430
We should see an alert pop up at the top of our web page with the information we typed in in the next

52
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.050
lecture.

53
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.970
We will recap what we learned in this section of the course.
