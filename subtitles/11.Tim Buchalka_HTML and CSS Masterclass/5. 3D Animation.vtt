00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.720
In this lecture we will learn how we can animate HDMI elements in 3D using CCS.

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.810
The main difference between 2D and 3D animation is that 3D animation includes the Z-axis.

3
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.650
In addition to the x and y axes we will start out with the code that we wrote in The Last Lecture and

4
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.920
we use it for the examples we will look at in this lecture.

5
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.110
We can use the rotate function or rotate or devourer on the x axis creating a 3D rotation effect.

6
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.760
We will specify that our started an extra rotation of 0 degrees and end at an extra rotation of 360

7
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.140
degrees then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our square is now rotating

8
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.410
around the x axis and looks like it is flipping over vertically.

9
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.970
Let's go back to the editor rotating the div around the y axis will also create a 3-D rotation effect.

10
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.200
We will specify that our div started a y rotation of 0 degrees and ended a y rotation of 360 degrees.

11
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.900
Then we will go to the web browser and wrote our code as you can see our square is now rotating around

12
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.200
the y axis and looks like it is spinning horizontally.

13
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.640
Let's go back to the editor.

14
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.720
We can also control the back phase visibility of our HVM element by using the back face visibility property

15
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.480
if we specify a black face visibility of hidden the back of the element will not be visible when the

16
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.760
object is rotated 180 degrees away from the camera to see the effect of this change.

17
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.470
Let's go to the web browser and run our code noticed that when the square spacing opposite the camera

18
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.640
it is not shown.

19
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.410
Let's jump back to the editor assigning this property a value of visible will make the back of the element

20
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.530
visible when it isn't facing the front of our Web page.

21
00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.270
Let's go to the web browser and read our code as you can see the back of the element is visible when

22
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.360
the object rotates away from the camera.

23
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.900
Note that a black face visibility visible is the default value for this property in the next lecture.

24
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.740
We will look at a recap of what we have learned in this section.
