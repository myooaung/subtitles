00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.500
Welcome to the HVM Alan CSSA master class this class will teach you web programming from the ground

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.890
up using HTL Maol and CSSA you don't need any prior experience in these languages to follow along with

3
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.840
this course.

4
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.410
In fact I designed this course specifically with the absolute beginner in mind.

5
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.020
If you have some experience using HVM Ellen CSSA You can also gain great benefit from this course because

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.010
it will fill in any gaps you may have in your knowledge.

7
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.690
During the first half of the course you will learn HVM owl a language used to define web content.

8
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.500
The second half of the Course will teach you ss a language that is used to style and customize the display

9
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.210
of web content.

10
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.660
First we will look at downloading and installing an ID or interactive development environment.

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.300
The editor with which we will write our code I will be demonstrating this course using Visual Studio

12
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.840
code.

13
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.710
But you can use whatever idea you prefer.

14
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.490
Once we are up and running in our ID we will jump into the fundamentals of HVM L..

15
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.040
We will learn what each T.M. is and some of the basic functionality that it provides us.

16
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.330
After that we will learn how to display data in ancient M-L data in HVM Eliz displayed in many forms

17
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.000
including lists tables layouts divs and forms.

18
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.310
We will cover each of these in detail.

19
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.770
Then we will look at colors and HGL color is an important aspect of web development and we will learn

20
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.910
the various ways that each female gives us to render color to a webpage.

21
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.580
Next we will learn about how to embed media and graphics and HVM.

22
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.780
This will include how to embed video or audio other web pages and shapes into our web page.

23
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.630
After that we will take a deep dive into HVM tags.

24
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.720
We will learn about formatting tags metadata tags and tags new to HVM L5 the HVM our global attributes

25
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.300
section will teach the different attributes that apply to all HVM elements.

26
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.450
We will also learn some of the new global attributes as of HVM L5.

27
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.620
After that we will learn about events and HMO events allow us to trigger a response based on a user

28
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.770
action and are therefore an important part of programming interactive and responsive web pages.

29
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.050
We will start to combine all of these skills when we look at layouts and web pages and HVM now and how

30
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.420
we can build full web pages out of the skills that we learned.

31
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.500
Then we will gain hands on HVM experience practicing the skills taught thus far this section of the

32
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.360
course will be particularly useful as it shows how techniques taught in different sections of the course

33
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.790
come together to create a website.

34
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.240
After that we will learn about SH T.M. Exige Chmela is a version of H-2 him out with stricter syntax

35
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.570
rules and we will explore what it is.

36
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.580
Its syntax.

37
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.350
The benefits of using X HVM mail and how to convert code from HVM male to female to wrap up our study

38
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.420
of each each.

39
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.030
We will look at how we can debug and solve errors in our code.

40
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.640
We will run through some common Urooj and steps that we can take to fix them.

41
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.330
We will also look at tools that we can use to make detecting and fixing errors in our code easier.

42
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.690
The second half of this course will cover CSSA.

43
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.930
First we will look at the fundamental concepts of CSSA and how we can begin to Starla web content that

44
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.150
we create NHT email.

45
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.380
After that we will learn about how to use CSSA to modify text.

46
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.830
We will look at how we can apply fonts and effects to our text elements CSSA gives us many options for

47
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.490
specifying and customizing the color of our elements and we will go over the options it provides.

48
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.960
Then we will look at CSSA properties so that you can gain a full understanding of the power that CSSA

49
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.350
will give you over stylize in your HVM elements.

50
00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.040
We will then learn how we can use CSSA to customize and tables including how we can modify table alignment

51
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.390
and cool effects we can add to tables to make them stand out.

52
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.470
After that we will look at how we can stylize lists using CSSA including modifying lists type's properties

53
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.330
and colors.

54
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.750
Then we will learn about animations and CCS including the fundamentals of animating elements using C

55
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.070
Ss and both 2D and 3D animation.

56
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.070
The animation properties section will cover several of the properties that we can animate using CSSA

57
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.630
and have many hands on examples that allow us to get a feel for working with animation.

58
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.850
Buttons are an important part of any webpage.

59
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.740
And CSSA gives us several options for styling our buttons and this section of the course we will learn

60
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.170
how to add hover and click states to her buttons and how to apply animation to our buttons.

61
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.160
Then we will learn about pseudo classes and selectors.

62
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.250
To put it simply pseudo classes and selectors are how we can control what styles apply to what web content

63
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.130
CSSA at.

64
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.560
Rules allow us to specify how our style sheets behave.

65
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.160
We will learn how we can use these rules to our advantage in this section of the course.

66
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.170
After that we will cover some advanced CSSA techniques we will learn how to add gradients chateaus and

67
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.850
other special effects to our Web elements.

68
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.830
We will put together the knowledge that we learned in the previous sections as we use CSSA style entire

69
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.320
web pages.

70
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.800
You will get hands on CSSA practice as we apply these concepts.

71
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:34.690
Hands on then we will look at how we can debug and fix erroneous CSSA code to wrap up our study of CSX.

72
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:41.780
We will look at some useful CSSA specifics such as CSSA entities and CSSA units by the end of this course

73
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.740
you will understand how to use HVM to create content for web pages and CSSA to stylize that content.

74
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.150
After learning the concepts taught this course and following along with the hands on practice sections

75
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.900
you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of web development.
