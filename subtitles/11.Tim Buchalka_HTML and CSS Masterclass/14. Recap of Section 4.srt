00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,880
In this section we learned about various ways that HVM allows us to display data on our web pages.

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:19,620
HDMI lets us display data in the form of lists tables layout divs and forms various types of lists exist

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,010
that explain data in unique ways unordered lists serve bullet pointed lists ordered lists or labeled

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,700
with numbers and letters to organize how their elements are displayed.

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,760
Description lists associate a term element with the description element similar to how a dictionary

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,310
or flash card Associates a term to its definition.

7
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,190
The lists can also be nested regardless of their type.

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,960
So we could have any type of list nested within any other type of list.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,620
Tables are made up of rows and columns and HVM l provides just a variety of ways to customize rows and

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,680
columns in our table using styles we can also customize the display of our table including adding style

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,460
to the table header body and footer.

12
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,160
We also have the option to specify styles for each individual cell in our table layouts and each team

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,160
will provide us with several elements with specific purposes lay out elements include sections articles

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,120
and asides and are useful to support multi-column displays and web pages divs and spans are used to

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,210
group elements in a customized developer defined manner divs or block elements that we can wrap related

16
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,940
content in to style the related content in a uniform manner.

17
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,780
Spans are inline elements that we can use to group other in line elements.

18
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,800
They provide similar customisation to divs except that they work on inline elements not block elements

19
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,240
forms and age Chimay will allow us to obtain user input.

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,450
There are several options we can give the user to get their input including text input fields checkboxes

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,740
color picker's and multi-line text areas.

22
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,870
Having forms that are clear to users and provide them an easy to use interface to obtain their input

23
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,950
is a crucial element of web design.

24
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,330
In the next section we will learn about color and HMO.
