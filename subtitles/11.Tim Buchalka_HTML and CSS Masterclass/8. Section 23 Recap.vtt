00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.640
In this section of the course we learned about pseudo classes and see SS pseudo classes allow us to

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.900
specify styles that will be applied to our elements in special States.

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.050
First we looked at pseudo classes that work with user input.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:30.500
These are checked disabled enabled focus in range invalid optional out-of-range read only read write

5
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.090
required and valid the check to whole class selects every checked input element disabled selects every

6
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.760
input element on the web page that is disabled on the other hand enabled selects every input element

7
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.020
that is enabled.

8
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.740
Focus allows us to select whatever input element has focus in range select each element that has a value

9
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.590
within the specified range.

10
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.140
The invalid pseudo class intellectual input elements that have an invalid value.

11
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.660
The optional pseudo class selects all input elements that don't have the required attribute.

12
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.070
The required pseudo class selects all input elements with the required attribute specified out-of-range

13
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.270
selects all input elements with values outside of a specified range.

14
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.600
Read only select all input elements that have a read only attribute read write on the other hand select

15
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.190
all input elements that don't have the read only attribute specified.

16
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.300
The valid pseudo class selects all input elements that have a valid value.

17
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.420
Then we learned about some of the general pseudo classes that apply to elements.

18
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.780
These are empty.

19
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:44.750
First child first of type langue last child last of type not and the child and the last child and last

20
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.050
of type only of type and only child.

21
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.190
The empty pseudo class selects every element of the specified type that doesn't have any children.

22
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.200
First child selects every element that is the first child of its parent.

23
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.880
The first of type pseudo class selects every element that is the first child of another element of the

24
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.020
same type.

25
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.320
The langue pseudo class selects every paragraph's element with a lang attribute of the specified language.

26
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.300
Last child selects every element that is the last child of its parent.

27
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.650
The last of type pseudo class selects every element that is the last child of another element of the

28
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.570
same type.

29
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.610
The only of type pseudo class selects every element that is the only element of that type in its parent

30
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.220
is the only child pseudo class selects every element that is the only child of its parent.

31
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.490
After that we learned about pseudo classes that apply to link elements.

32
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.250
These are link visited hover and active to link pseudo class allows us to add style to all unvisited

33
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.690
links on our Web page.

34
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.750
The visited pseudo class allows us to add style to visited links on our Web page the Hulver pseudo class

35
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.120
allows us to add style that will apply to a link element when we hover over it.

36
00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.070
The active pseudo class allows us to add style that will apply to a link element as it is clicked or

37
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.950
selected.

38
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.420
Finally we learned about pseudo elements in CSSA the five pseudo elements in CSSA are after both for

39
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.180
first letter first line and selection.

40
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.080
The after pseudo element allows us to insert content after every element of the type specified before

41
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.150
the selector.

42
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.070
The before pseudo element allows us to insert content before every element of the specified type before

43
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.740
the selector first letter is a pseudo element that selects the first letter of every text element of

44
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.370
the specified type before the selector.

45
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.870
Similarly the first line pseudo element selects the first line of every text element of the specified

46
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.640
type.

47
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.750
The selections to all elements selects the portion of an element that is selected by the user in the

48
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.780
next section.

49
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.800
We will learn about CSSA at rules and the role that they play in our style sheets.
