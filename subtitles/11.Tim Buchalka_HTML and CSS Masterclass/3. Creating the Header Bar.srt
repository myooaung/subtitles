00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,510
In this lecture we will create the hetter bar for a web page.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,740
We will have a roll of images across the top of the page and a row of links underneath the images that

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,150
the user can click to jump to different sections on our Web page.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,860
First let's create the role of images across the top of the page.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,410
We will add our images inside of our div.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,430
Let's put the image tag for our first image.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's say the source attribute to our image tag and assign it a value of icon that PAGG another mandatory

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,580
attribute of the image tag is the all too attribute.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,660
Before we run our code in the browser to see our image displayed let's add some styles to it.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,960
We will add the style attribute to our image tag and give our image a right margin of 10 percent left

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,670
margin of 5 percent a height of 300 pixels and a width of 300 pixels.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,590
OK so now we can run our code in the browser and check the result of the code we have so far.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,370
If all goes well we should see our image in the top left corner of our webpage.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,710
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,900
Let's make the background of our Web page black by adding the style attribute to the opening body tag

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,430
and giving it a background color of black.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,160
Time to add our second image.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,800
We will add another image tagged to our webpage.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,920
This image will be the logo of our pizza parlor and will be displayed in the top middle of our webpage.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,000
The source of this image will be the logo.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,190
PFG file the all the attributes for this image will have a value of Logo.

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,940
Finally we will add the style attribute to this image.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:41,710
We will give the image your right margin of 10 percent a width of 300 pixels and a height of 300 pixels.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,060
Let's run the code in the browser and see our image

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,350
then we will jump back to the editor.

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,170
The third image that we will add to our Web page will be a just open sign.

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,950
We will add an image tag and give it a source attribute with a value of our just open to TNG image the

28
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,190
all the attribute for this image will have a value of just opened for the style.

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,610
We will give our image a height of 200 pixels in a width of five hundred pixels.

30
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:18,690
Let's run our code in the web browser and see our third image appear on our Web page.

31
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,910
Then we will jump back to the editor OK.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
Now we have our three images across the top of our webpage.

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,040
The next step is to create the navigation menu that the user can use to navigate to the different parts

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
of our web page or web site.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,590
We'll have a total of four links home about us menu and contact.

36
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,590
Let's create a map that we can use as a container for our menu.

37
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,890
Recall that a nav element is used to create a navigation menu of links on an HDMI web page.

38
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,940
We will add in for length tags one for each section on our website.

39
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,440
We will add an 8 track attribute to each of our linked tags.

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,110
The value will be hash tag forward slash and then the name of the section the name of the section will

41
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,810
be the idea that we give to the div that contains the material for that section of the page.

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,500
The hash tag forward slash will keep the page from jumping when it transitions from one section to another.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,840
Each of our links will have a class value of menu items which we can use to easily reference them and

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,600
stylize them later on.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,460
We will give our NAV element an idea of Hetter.

46
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,070
Finally we will add the style attribute to our header.

47
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,540
We will give our NAV options of font size of two VW.

48
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:33,250
A position of relative a top value of 25 percent a width of 100 percent and aleft value of 20 percent.

49
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,640
Finally let's say at a div is a container for each section of our Web page.

50
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,300
We will also add a style element to our code.

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,030
It will specify that each element in the menu items class will have a right margin of 10 percent.

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,180
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code as you can see the four links now appear on our Web page

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,520
in the next lecture we will create a home page for our Web site.
