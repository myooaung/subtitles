00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.690
In this lecture we will learn about the text properties that CSSA allows us to animate these properties

2
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.610
or text decoration text indent and text shadow.

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.720
Let's create the text that we will use in our animation.

4
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.870
We will animate the text decoration property to alternate between an underline an over line for our

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.830
text then we will add an opening and closing style tag.

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.030
We will specify the animation property for a paragraph tag the name of our animation will be text and

7
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.080
the duration will be two seconds and we will set our animation to loop.

8
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.270
After that we will write the code for the animation itself.

9
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:51.370
We will add keyframes at 0 percent 25 percent 50 percent 75 percent and 100 percent at keyframes 0 percent

10
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.020
50 percent and 100 percent the text decoration property will be set to a value of underline at keyframes

11
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.910
25 percent and 75 percent the text declaration property will be set to a value of over long.

12
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.050
When we run our code in the web browser you can see that the text toggles between being underlined an

13
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.390
overlay and thanks to our animation

14
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.340
in the next lecture we will learn about the column properties that CSSA allows us to animate.
