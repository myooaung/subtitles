00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.870
In this lecture we will learn about how we can create gradients using CSSA code gradients or when we

2
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.210
fade two or more colors together.

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.470
CSSA supports two types of gradient linear gradients and radial gradient a gradient uses color stops

4
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.380
to define the colors to use for the gradient color shop is a color we want to smoothly transition into

5
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.970
another color the CSSA linear gradient function allows us to create a linear gradient.

6
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.390
We will pass into a more Kulish stops his arguments when we call the function to see this function in

7
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.190
action.

8
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.310
We will first create a development that we can add our linear gradient to.

9
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.790
Next we will give our div a height and the width.

10
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.780
We will also add a linear gradient to the background of our div any color stops that we pass in or separated

11
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.020
by commas.

12
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.040
In this case we are creating a linear gradient that starts out red and gradually fades to blue.

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.610
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see.

14
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.850
We have a linear gradient that goes from red to blue.

15
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.240
Let's jump back to the editor.

16
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.700
We also have the option of adding a direction to a gradient before the color stops we can specify that

17
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.390
the gradient goes to top to right to left or to bottom.

18
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.220
A value of two top will make our gradients start the first color at the bottom and fade into the second

19
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830
color at the top.

20
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.650
Let's specify that are greedy and should start at Red or on the bottom and fade to blue to the top.

21
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.270
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code from the bottom to top or gradient fades from red

22
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.100
to blue.

23
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.780
Let's jump back to the editor of value of to bottom we'll make our gradient start as the first color

24
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.040
at the top and feed into the second color at the bottom.

25
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.230
Let's specify that our gradient go to bottom and run our code in the web browser.

26
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.250
As you can see our gradient starts out red at the top and fades to blue as it progresses towards the

27
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.000
bottom.

28
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.990
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

29
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.920
Specifying a value of 2 right will make our gradients start out with the first color on the left and

30
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.080
fade into the second color on the right.

31
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.160
We will pass the value of to right into our linear gradient function.

32
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.780
Then we will run our code in the web browser as you can see our gradient goes from red on the left to

33
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.390
blue on the right.

34
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.150
Let's go back to the editor of value of two left means that our gradient will start with the first color

35
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.570
on the right and fade into the second color on the left.

36
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.790
We will pass the value of two left into our linear gradient function and run our code in the web browser.

37
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.910
As you can see our gradient starts out red on the right and fades to blue on the left.

38
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.740
Let's jump back to the editor.

39
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.090
It is also possible for us to make a gradient diagonal by specifying a horizontal and vertical position.

40
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.390
For example a value of top right will make our first color start out on the bottom left and then transition

41
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.700
to the second color on the top right.

42
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.890
Let's pass a value of true top right into our linear gradient function and then run our code in the

43
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.700
browser as you can see the gradient starts out red on the bottom left and progresses to blue on the

44
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.990
top right.

45
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.670
Let's go back to the editor.

46
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.890
It is also possible to specify an angle at which to rotate the gradient.

47
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.810
For this example let's pass the linear gradient function a value of 45 degrees.

48
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.880
Then we will run our code in the web browser.

49
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.040
As you can see our gradient is rotated 45 degrees.

50
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.300
Let's go back to the editor.

51
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.430
We can also add more than two color stops to our gradient by specifying extra colors as arguments to

52
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.650
the linear gradient function.

53
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.040
Let's say I add a third color stop to a color gradient and give it a value of black.

54
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.880
Then we will run our code in the web browser

55
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.070
now.

56
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.350
Our gradient goes from red to blue to black.

57
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.770
Let's go back to the editor radial gradings are circular gradients that start at the center and emit

58
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.910
outward.

59
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.590
We can create radial gradients using the radial grading function to see this function in action.

60
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.130
We will change our linear gradient to a radio gradient by changing the function name.

61
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.570
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

62
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.760
as you can see.

63
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.920
We now have a radial gradient on a web page that transitions from red to blue to black in the next lecture.

64
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.050
We will learn how to create shadows and effects using CSSA.
