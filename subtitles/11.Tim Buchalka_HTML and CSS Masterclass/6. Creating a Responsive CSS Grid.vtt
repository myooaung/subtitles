00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.730
In this lecture we will learn about how we can use grids and positioning and CSSA with regards to responsive

2
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.880
web design.

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.910
One common task when designing a web page is to divide the content up into columns.

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.800
The first step when writing responsive web code is to add the following META element to the head of

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.460
our HVM code.

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.490
In this line the content defines that the width of the web page should be controlled by the width of

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.640
the device.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.140
The initial scale defines the default zoom value that the page didn't start at.

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.970
In this case a value of 1.0 tells the browser to started Izumo of 100 percent to build a responsive

10
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.280
CSSA grid.

11
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.660
The first step is to use the asterisk selector to apply the box sizing property to all elements on the

12
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
web page and give it a value of border box.

13
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.610
Then we can define column classes that will define the width of an element based on percentage.

14
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.850
Let's say we want to divide all web page up into five columns the full width of the web pages 100 percent.

15
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.510
So if we divide 100 by 5 This means that our columns will increment by a value of 20 each of all column

16
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.150
classes will follow the naming convention Col hyphen and then the column number.

17
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.830
We will also give each of these columns a float value of less than a padding of 10 pixels.

18
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.260
The last step would be to wrap NEHTA HVM elements we wanted to group together in a column in a div and

19
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.630
then assign that div a class value of one of the columns F the width of the columns adds up to 100 percent

20
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.390
or less sequential elements in our code with column classes applied to them will appear side by side

21
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.010
on a webpage if they add up to over 100 percent.

22
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.360
The first element will appear above the other elements on our webpage for this example let's create

23
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.300
two divs.

24
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.880
Our first div we will give a class of call 1 and a background color of blue.

25
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.220
Our second div we will give a class of color for in a background color of orange based on the color

26
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.780
classes we defined.

27
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.100
Kala one gives or give with 20 percent and call for gives our DiVall with of 80 percent.

28
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.200
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our blue div takes up one fifth of our Web

29
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.240
page and our orange juice takes up four fifths of our web page in the next lecture we will learn about

30
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.770
blend modes and see SS.
