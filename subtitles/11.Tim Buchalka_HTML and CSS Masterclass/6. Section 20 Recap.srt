00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,890
In this lecture we will recap what we learned in this section of the course.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,840
First we learned about using the background properties that CSSA allows us to animate using CSSA we

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,720
can animate elements background background color background position and background size.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,830
We looked at it an example of how we could animate the background color property to cycle through the

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,190
colors of the rainbow.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,000
Next we looked at how we could animate and elements border using C Ss we saw an example of how we can

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,410
animate and elements border radius property to turn a square into a circle.

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,630
After that we learned about the column properties that CSSA allows us to animate the column properties

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:48,980
that we can animate using CSSA or column count column gap column rule column rule color column rule

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,510
with column width and columns.

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,740
We looked at it an example of how we can animate the column count property to divide text into columns

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,450
on the web page.

13
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,210
Then we learned about the font properties that CSSA allows us to animi we can animate the font font

14
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:11,210
size font size adjust font stretch and font weight properties.

15
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,430
The example in this lecture was how we could animate the font size property to scale text on our Web

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,240
page.

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,110
Next we looked at the margin properties that CSSA allows us to animi CSSA allows us to animate the margin

18
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,510
margin bottom margin left margin right and margin top properties.

19
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,920
We looked at an example of how we could animate the margin top property to move an element down on a

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,860
webpage.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,160
After that we learned how to animate elements heightened with using CCS.

22
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,280
We looked at an example of how we could animate a diverse height and width to scale it up and down on

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,260
a webpage.

24
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,120
Then we learned about the text properties that CSSA allows us to animate these properties are text decoration

25
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,240
text indent and text Chatto.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,250
We looked at it an example of how we could animate the text decoration property to animate a line going

27
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,140
over and under our text.

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,050
After that we learned about the padding properties that can be animated using C Ss the padding properties

29
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:13,940
we can animate using CSSA or padding padding bottom padding left padding right and padding top.

30
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,320
We looked at an example of how we could animate the padding left property to move text from left to

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,940
right on our Web page.

32
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,310
Finally we learned about how we can animate the words spacing and letter spacing properties using C

33
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,250
Ss.

34
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,400
We looked at examples for how to animate both of these properties to animate the space between words

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,160
and letters in the text on a web page in the next section.

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,390
We will learn about how we can stylize buttons and see SS.
