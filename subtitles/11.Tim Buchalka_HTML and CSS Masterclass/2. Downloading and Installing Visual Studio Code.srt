00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,930
In this lecture we will download and install Visual Studio code which we will use to write HVM and CSSA

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,640
code during this course.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,980
You can use any idea that allows you to write HTL and CSSA code but I am choosing Visual Studio code

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,150
because it is free and cross-platform.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,160
You can use this editor regardless of whether you are running Mac Windows or Linux.

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:32,750
ID is an acronym for interactive development environment when writing code an idea provides many useful

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,420
features that make the task a little easier.

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,670
Many IDs have features like syntax highlighting and intellisense.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,750
Another great feature of Visual Studio code is that it provides programmers vast customisation options

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,740
as we will learn about in the next lecture to get started.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,750
Let's go to the following You are a

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,910
HTP.

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:10,500
Ask colon slash slash code dot Visual Studio dot com forward slash download.

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,920
We will click on the download icon for whatever operating system we were running and follow the prompts

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,510
to download and install the software.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,940
I will speed up the video of this process.

17
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,360
OK now that we have downloaded and installed Visual Studio code we can open it up if you left the prompt

18
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,470
open the editor after installing your software.

19
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,870
It should open up automatically.

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,610
Let's go to a file new file and take a look around the editor

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,950
the left hand side will show us the folders and files in the project you're an

22
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,090
to the right of that is the file you're currently editing at the top is the action bar where we can

23
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:10,570
access several menu options the File menu bar option gives us access to common features like creating

24
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,090
opening and saving files.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,700
You will also notice further down the menu that we can access the preferences from this menu hovering

26
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,680
over preferences will reveal the preferences sub menu where we can do things like change the color theme

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,810
set up keyboard shortcuts and modify the user settings.

28
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,470
All of these things we will learn about in the next lecture the end sub menu gives us access to features

29
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:45,430
like copy paste cut and the ability to toggle line and block comments in our code a line comment comments

30
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:52,450
out one line of code a block comment uses a single line comment to comment out multiple lines of code

31
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,450
one Hartke to make note of here is that we can highlight a line of code and then use the Control forward

32
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,170
slash keyboard shortcut to comment out that line.

33
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,710
We can also highlight several lines at once and use the same key combination to comment out all of those

34
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,820
lines at once.

35
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,030
The selection of menu gives us options to modify our selections the positions of the lines in our code

36
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,190
and the position of our cursor in the editor depending on your coding style.

37
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,500
Some of the hot keys you see next to these options might be of use to you to view sub menu gives us

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,030
access to modify the display of the windows in our editor.

39
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,380
One particularly useful menu option here is the command palette menu where we can browse through the

40
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,680
default hotkeys that the editor gives us access to.

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,870
We can also search for a command to see the corresponding key combination that we will use as a hot

42
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,600
key to trigger that command.

43
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,460
We can also control where the sidebar is displayed.

44
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,000
We can toggle the sidebar to the left or the right.

45
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,370
Speaking of the side bar this bar that is on the left hand side of the editor is referred to as the

46
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,390
sidebar.

47
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,610
The first option gives us the ability to toggle the file explorer on the left hand side of the editor

48
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,530
which shows us the files and folders that we currently have open in the editor.

49
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,170
The magnifying glass icon on the sidebar gives us access to common functionality such as searching and

50
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,730
replacing text in our files.

51
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,750
The third icon on the sidebar allows us to link Visual Studio code to source control programs like get

52
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,220
Haub or bitbucket.

53
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,620
The fourth sidebar option will toggle the debug window where a developer can step through and debug

54
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,790
our code.

55
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,340
The fifth icon on the sidebar lets us configure extensions on the editor the gear icon at the bottom

56
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,050
of the sidebar gives us access to common settings and alerts us if there are updates available for our

57
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,980
editor.

58
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,330
It is a good idea to update your editor to the latest version when new versions are released.

59
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,430
Since companies frequently release new versions to add features to editors and patch bugs that they

60
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:59,180
find and fix in their editor software going back to the top nav bar and cooking on the go option gives

61
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:06,680
us the ability to go to a certain line file definition or symbol the debugging menu option gives us

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,190
access to the debugging features of our editor.

63
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,530
When working with HVM Allen CSSA as we will be working within this course these options will be of less

64
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,960
help to us when debugging our best options for debugging or to use validators and the tools built into

65
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,180
whatever web browser we are using.

66
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,640
The tasks menu gives us options for working with tasks in the editor.

67
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,620
And a programming editor a task is something that allows us to automate common processes that can save

68
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,590
us time when coding automating tasks is something that you will want to master over time as a developer

69
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,470
as it can save you a lot of time and energy and allow you to free up time to spend more focus on writing

70
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
and testing your code.

71
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,670
The final option we have access to on this top Hetter bar is the help option.

72
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:01,050
Here we have useful options such as accessing the documentation release notes a reference to keyboard

73
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:08,740
shortcuts some introductory videos a tips and tricks section and more in the next lecture.

74
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,940
We will learn how we can customize the editor to fit our preferences.
