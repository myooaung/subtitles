00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,200
In this section we learned about CSSA at rules CSSA gives us several at rules that each do something

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,360
different for style sheet.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,690
We learned that an app rule specifies how a style sheet should behave.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,460
The basic syntax of an app rule is the at symbol followed by a keyword that is the rule.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,920
There are two main types of rules.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,650
Regular rules and nested rules.

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,020
Regular rules have a syntax of an at symbol keyword and semi-colon.

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,610
Nested rules have a syntax of a symbol keyword and then an additional block of statements.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,120
After that we got hands on experience using some of the rules that CSSA provides us.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,110
We learned that the carousel at rule is used to define the character set for a particular stylesheet.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,550
The import rule is used to import a style sheet into another stylesheet.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,230
Then we looked at the font face at rule which allows us to import fonts from either online or a local

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:08,110
computer to use and our style sheets in the next section we will learn about some advanced styling techniques

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,520
we can use and in SS.
