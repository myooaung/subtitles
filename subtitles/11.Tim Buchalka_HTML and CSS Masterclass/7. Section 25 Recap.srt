00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,230
In this lecture we will look at a recap of what we learned in this section of the course in this section

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,290
we learned about how we can use CSSA to animate HVM elements.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,560
First we learned about transitions.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,310
Transitions are a way that CSSA gives us to gradually transition a property from one value to another.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,140
The transition property allows us to specify a property and duration and it will transition between

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,210
the value specified for that property over the specified duration.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,560
We also learned that we could transition multiple properties at once the transition delay property allows

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,890
us to specify a delay for our transition.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,840
The transition property allows us to specify the property we want to transition the transition timing

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,130
function property allows us to specify that each type or speed curve for our transition of value ease

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,760
means that the transition will start slow speed up and then end slow a value of linear will give our

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,400
transition a consistent speed a value of ease in will mean that the transition will have a slow start

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,880
a value of ease out means that the transition will have a slow and after that we learned about animations

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,460
and see SS We learned to write code for our animations starting with our keyframes rule and specifying

15
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,310
a to and from keyframe for animation the animation Name property allows us to link the animation by

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,550
adding the name that we gave with the code we wrote for the animation.

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,330
The animation duration property allows us to specify a duration for animation the animation delay property

18
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:39,390
allows us to add a delay to our animation the animation iteration count allows us to specify the number

19
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,050
of times that we want the animation to play.

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,340
We can also specify this property value of infinite to make the animation repeat endlessly on our Web

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,220
page to control the direction that our animation plays and we can use the animation direction property

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,430
of value of normal will specify that the animation placed forward to play the animation backwards.

23
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,620
We can give the animation direction property of value of reverse if the animation direction property

24
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,040
has a value of alternate.

25
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,250
The animation will play forwards and then backwards a value of alternate reverse will make the animation

26
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,280
play backwards and then forwards the animation timing function property allows us to specify that each

27
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,100
type or speed curve of the animation similar to the transition timing functions.

28
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:30,450
We looked at earlier we could give this property of value with ease linear ease in or ease out and animations

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,110
fill mode is how the animation effects an element before and after the animation is played a value of

30
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,570
forward's means that the animation will keep the styles set by the last keyframe of the animation of

31
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,090
value of backwords means that the animation will keep the style set by the first frame of the animation.

32
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,710
During the delay period before the animation is played an animation film mode of both means that for

33
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,110
the delay period before the animation the style specified on the first frame will be applied to the

34
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,570
object and also the styles of the last frame of the animation will be applied to the object after the

35
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,170
animation is finished playing we can use the animation place state property to specify whether the animation

36
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,460
is paused or running the shorthands animation property can be used to specify several animation properties.

37
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:24,900
These properties are animation name animation duration animation timing function animation delay animation

38
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,210
iteration count animation direction animation film mode and animation place.

39
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,880
After that we learned about 2D animation the transform property allows us to move rotate scale and skew

40
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,820
elements by animating this property on our HVM elements.

41
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,840
We can make our elements move on to our Web page the rotate function lets us rotate our element.

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,860
It takes a value of degrees to rotate an element the translate function lets us move our element.

43
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,630
It takes a length value like pixels which is the amount to move the element the scale function lets

44
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,220
a scalar element.

45
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:09,300
We specify the amount to scale the element as a decimal value from 0 to 1 0 being 0 percent and 1 being

46
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,540
100 percent.

47
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,500
The skew function lets us skew our element the skew function takes a value of degrees at which to skew

48
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,660
the element.

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,220
Then we learned about 3D animation.

50
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,150
The main difference between 2D and 3D animation is that 3-D animation includes the Z-axis we can use

51
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,590
the rotate function to rotate our div around the x or y axis creating a 3D rotation effect.

52
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,330
We can also control the back face visibility of our HDMI element by using the back face visibility property

53
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,100
assigning this property of value visible.

54
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,100
Will make the back of the element visible when it isn't facing the front of our webpage in the next

55
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,970
section.

56
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,850
We will learn about animation properties and see SS.
