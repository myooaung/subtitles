In this lecture we will cover comments and HVM L if you have used any other languages you're probably

2
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.540
familiar with the term Commons comments or lines of code not executed by the computer they serve as

3
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.780
a means for developers to communicate make notes or test out pieces of code without deleting existing

4
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.850
code.

5
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.880
H.M.S. provides the comment tag to add comments to our H.T. email documents NHT mail comment tag is

6
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.770
written in this format and angular bracket starts and ends the tag as it does with other tags before

7
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.040
the comment text comes an exclamation mark and two hyphens and after the comment text comes two hyphens.

8
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.370
Here are some examples of comments.

9
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.570
Notice the syntax highlighting feature of our idea turns the comment a different color.

10
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.130
This can be visually helpful while we are typing or code.

11
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.830
Also note that we can have a comment that spans more than one line.

12
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.130
If you're running into errors in your code you can comment out lines one by one to see which line is

13
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.310
causing the issue.

14
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.680
Let's also go over another way that we can add comments to our code.

15
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.560
The Visual Studio code editor allows us to highlight a line of code and use the hot key control forward

16
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.530
slash to comment out that line of code.

17
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.600
For example let's add a paragraph tag with some text content to our code.

18
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.480
Then we will highlight the line of code we just typed by clicking and dragging over it with our mouse.

19
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.990
We will hit the keyboard shortcut control forward slash and see that a comment was just added that comments

20
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.150
out this line of code.

21
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.030
Note that I'm recording this video on a Windows machine.

22
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.480
If you are using a different type of computer and this key combination doesn't work for you you can

23
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:58.280
go to view command pallete and type in the word comment out of the options that come up.

24
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.380
Look for the target line comment option.

25
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.480
This is the option I am using and the key combination that the editor will show you in this menu will

26
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.300
be equivalent to the control forward Shlash key combo.

27
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.840
I am using we can also comment out several lines of code at once using the same key combination in the

28
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.920
next lecture.

29
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.720
We will look at a recap of what we learned in this section.
