00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,820
In this lecture we will create an about us page for our website.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,590
The code we are about to write will go into our About Us div to start.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,820
Let's give our About Us div a style attribute with a font size of two VW of visibility of hidden top

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,120
value of 400 pixels and a position of absolute to signal to users that they are on the About Us section

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,140
of our Web page.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,030
Let's add an H1 element to our Web page and give our page a heading of about us.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:39,030
We will also give our H-1 heading aliment style attribute with a value of left 80 percent a position

8
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,390
of relative and the color of white underneath our heading.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,140
We want to create a row of content including text in an image.

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,530
Let's say it a div element with a class value of.

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,360
We will then add another development that will store our text content.

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,850
Let's give our diverse style attribute with the top value of 50 pixels aleft value of 40 percent a position

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,540
of relative and the color of white.

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,910
Next we will add an image that will float to the right of our text.

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:15,500
Our image will have a source of about image on all value of about and a style attribute the styles to

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,250
apply to this element will be a float value of right a top value of fifty pixels left value of one hundred

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,300
pixels.

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:29,810
A position of relative a height of 300 pixels and a width of 300 pixels.

19
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,300
We will put the text why should you come here in a paragraph tag and then create an ordered list using

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,850
the UL tag.

21
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,980
We will add items to our list using the ally tag.

22
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,480
Finally let's add a paragraph tag with some more text content.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,120
We will give the text the style attribute with a top value of 80 pixels a left value of one hundred

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,680
pixels a position of relative or color of white and a clear value of both the clear value of both will

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,750
force our text onto a new line underneath our image.

26
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,390
We will add the text we are a pizzeria that serves great food at an excellent price.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,790
Between the opening and closing Peter eggs in order to be able to see are about us page we are going

28
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:17,000
to need to specify some behavior for our About Us nav menu item on click below the closing style tag

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,530
toward the bottom of our code.

30
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,630
Let's add an opening and closing script tag between which we can add some Javascript code.

31
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,420
We will write a short function that we will use to display a section of our webpage.

32
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,750
When one of our NAV menu items is clicked the function will be called show page section and it will

33
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,800
take as a parameter.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,200
The idea of one of the sections of our web page will create a variable called list of ideas that will

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,660
be a list of the IDs for our menu options.

36
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,790
One benefit of this solution is that we can easily add more options to our menu if we want and then

37
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,180
we would just have to add its ID to this list to scale up our code.

38
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:58,100
Our list of IDS will be for strings home about us menu and contact.

39
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,710
After that let's write a for loop that will go through each ID and compare it to the ID passed into

40
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,220
this function as a parameter.

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,790
If the idea that we are currently on in the list matches the id pass then we will set it to visible.

42
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,630
Else we will set its visibility to head.

43
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,870
There is one last step we need to do before we can see our code in action in the web browser.

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,090
We need to go back up to her about us menu option and give it an on click value of show page section

45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,630
with an ID value of about us past into it.

46
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,070
Now we can run our code in the browser and click the About Us option.

47
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,800
If we typed everything incorrectly we should see about Section display on the web page.

48
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,100
For good measure let's say an on click attribute to the other three menu items that point to the IDs

49
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,720
that they showed

50
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,480
in the next lecture.

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,630
We will create the menu page for all web site.
