00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.570
In this lecture we will learn about images and HMO.

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.470
Let's take a closer look at how we can display images and HMO the image tags used to display images

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.300
inside of the image tag we will use the source attribute to specify the source of the image.

4
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.860
We can also specify the width and height of an image in a female using the width and height attributes.

5
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.010
For example if we wanted to set the width and height of an image to 200 pixels we could do the following.

6
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.860
We will add an image tag to our code and specify the source attribute with a value of star PAGG.

7
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.870
One of the example images that comes with this course we will also use the width and height attributes

8
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.690
set to a value of 200.

9
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.760
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

10
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.560
if we typed everything correctly and have the image in the proper location on our computer the same

11
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.910
directory as our e-mail file.

12
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.360
Then we should see the store image display on our webpage.

13
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.750
If you have images in a subfolder in your file directory you have to provide the full file path in the

14
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.930
source attribute.

15
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.140
Let's go back to the editor and change your code to the following.

16
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.260
Now when we go back to the browser and run our code you will see this new image displayed in the browser.

17
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.540
Let's take a second to look at the folder structure for this example.

18
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.980
If we go to our file explorer and navigate to the folder that has our female code in it you will see

19
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.820
that I have a folder within that folder called image inside of this folders the checkerboard JPEG image

20
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.740
that I used in this example.

21
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.880
When we say subfolder we are just referring to a folder within another folder in order for the code

22
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.490
in this example to work the subfolder has to be in the same folder as your HDMI file.

23
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.910
You can also specify the relevant image on the web as the source attribute within an image tag to use

24
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.240
that image in your web page to see an example of this.

25
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.880
Let's jump back to the Visual Studio code editor.

26
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.500
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

27
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.590
Let's jump back to the editor as we saw in the lecture on hyperlinks from before we can make images

28
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.500
clickable.

29
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.970
It is also possible to make only parts of an image clickable by using an image map.

30
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.050
Let's take a look at an example of how we can create and use an image map on our webpage.

31
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.200
First we need an image.

32
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.410
Let's use this image

33
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.980
next.

34
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.620
The use map attribute to the image tag.

35
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.420
Then we will use the map tag to give our map a name.

36
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.410
They should be whatever value we give the use map attribute of our image

37
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.050
the area that we use has three important attributes seen here the shape attribute allows us to define

38
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.810
the shape of the clickable area on our image the coordinates attribute specifies the coordinates of

39
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.540
the four corners of our rectangle.

40
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.430
The A-Trak attribute is the same attribute we have used in the past with hyperlinks.

41
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.760
It allows us to specify you are able to link to.

42
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.170
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

43
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.510
Let's jump back to the editor.

44
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.280
You can specify as many clickable areas as you want within your image for example adding another area

45
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.980
element adds another clickable area to our map.

46
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.930
Images are an important part of web pages and it is important that you know the different ways you can

47
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.150
use images to provide the best user experience to users in the next lecture.

48
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.570
We will learn about the basics of creating a button in each T.M..
