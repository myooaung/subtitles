00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.860
In this lecture we really use CSSA to stylized the home page.

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.370
We will animate the character on the top left of our Web page.

3
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.820
And the border of the just open sign at the top right of our web page to draw attention to it to start.

4
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.850
We are going to give ideas to our three HCM elements on the top of our Web page.

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.070
We will call the first album Inside the guy as it is the character at the top left of our Web page.

6
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.180
The pizza guy or middle elements IDB will call logo since it has the logo of the pizza parlor.

7
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.410
The third element we will assign an idea of sign to since it is the just open sign on the top right

8
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.860
of our Web page now that we can identify these elements by their IDs.

9
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.640
We will start by animating the guy at the top left of our Web page.

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.280
We are going to create a simple animation that rotates our character on the web page and 3D.

11
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.630
Let's start by writing the code for animation and the style section of our code.

12
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.860
We will use the at keyframes rule and Neymar animation guy and I'm inside the curly braces for the body

13
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.950
of the animation.

14
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.460
We're going to specify the Y rotation at certain keyframes the property we are going to animate during

15
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.670
our animation is the transform property at a keyframe of 0 percent.

16
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.530
We will specify that the Y rotation will be 0 degrees at keyframe 40 percent.

17
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.170
We will also specify the Y rotation will be zero degrees.

18
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.650
The reason we are specifying two zeros back to back 1 0 0 percent and 1 to 40 percent is because during

19
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.900
that time in the animation we want the rotation of our element to stay at zero degrees if we only had

20
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.820
one of these keyframes and then specified a value there would be tweeting between the keyframes which

21
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.220
would cause the element to gradually transition between these values instead of staying at zero at a

22
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.970
keyframe of 50 percent.

23
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.600
We will give our element a y rotation of 40 degrees at 60 percent of the way through the animation the

24
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.080
Y rotation will be 0 degrees at keyframe 100 percent.

25
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.090
We will specify that our element has a y rotation of 0 degrees.

26
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.500
Now that we have the code for our animation we are going to link it to our element using the elements

27
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.580
ID we will use the ID that we gave the element before guy in this case to specify that this is the element

28
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.970
we want to style.

29
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.670
We will use the animation property and specify the animation name guy and the duration 3 seconds and

30
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.000
the looping of our animation using the infinite keyword.

31
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:36.740
When we run our code you should see the pizza guy at the top left of our Web page animating.

32
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.380
Next up we are going to animate the border of the just open sign.

33
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.710
We will take a similar approach as we did with the pizza guy.

34
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.180
First we will write the code for animation.

35
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.260
We will name our animation sign animation.

36
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.410
All of the styles we specify are going to be added keyframe of 50 percent halfway through the animation.

37
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.340
We want the border top right radius border top left radius border bottom right radius and border bottom

38
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.290
left radius to have a value of 120 pixels 50 percent through the animation.

39
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.920
Now that we have the code for animation lets you link it to our element earlier in this lecture we gave

40
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.680
our element an idea of sine we will use the animation property and specify the animation name of sign

41
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.830
and a duration of three seconds and make our animation loop by using the infinite key word.

42
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.410
Now when we run our code you will see that the border of our just open sign has an animated border that

43
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.110
becomes rounded and then pops back to angular

44
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.140
in the next lecture.

45
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.680
We will stylized the about us page of our website.
