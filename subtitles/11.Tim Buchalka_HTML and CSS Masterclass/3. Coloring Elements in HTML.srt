00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,150
In this lecture we will learn about coloring elements and HMO.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,680
Now that we know the different ways we can specify color and HMO.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,330
Let's take a look at how we can apply this knowledge to color elements in each GMO.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,520
First let's create a paragraph element which will be the text that we use for these examples.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,880
Next let's add an opening and closing style tag to our Web page inside of our style tags.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,750
We will apply a style to a paragraph tag setting the color to blue

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,860
then we will go to the web browser and run our code

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,560
as you can see the text is displayed blue.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,400
Let's go back to the editor.

10
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,710
This is just one example of how we can identify colors by name as we looked at in the last video.

11
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,450
If we change the color name from blue to red.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,010
You will see that the text is then displayed the color red and the web browser.

13
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,230
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,740
noticed that the text color change to red.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,970
Now let's go back to the editor next.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,660
Let's look at how we would color our text using an R G B value.

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,450
Recall that our GBI stands for red green blue and that we can assign each of these parameters a value

18
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:36,810
from 0 to 255 to specify a color as our G-B we first type letters R.G. be followed by opening and closing

19
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,990
parentheses inside of the parentheses.

20
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,060
We put the RGV values separated by commas.

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,240
In this example we have given the green parameter a value of 255 and the red and blue parameters a value

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,030
of zero.

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,050
So our text will display the color green.

24
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,230
We will go to the web browser and run our code

25
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,670
noticed that the text is the color green based on the org B value that we specify.

26
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,110
Let's go back to the editor.

27
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:17,260
Let's add to this example by using Orji be a first Add the letter A to the R G B function name making

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,080
the name or G-B A.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,930
Next we will specify an alpha value from zero point zero to 1 point zero.

30
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,490
Let's make our text 50 percent transparent by assigning this parameter a value of 0.5.

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,850
Finally we will go to the web browser and run our code to see these changes

32
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,400
as you can see the text is displayed at 50 percent opacity.

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,960
Let's go back to the editor.

34
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:54,500
Recall that we can also specify color using hex values to do so we first need to put a hash tag or a

35
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,000
pound symbol.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,480
Next we are going to put an R R G G B B value.

37
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,850
Each color is specified as a number from 0 0 to f f to make our text magenta.

38
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,650
Let's give it blue and red parameters a value of f f and it's green parameter a value of zero zero.

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,520
Let's go to the web browser and run this code as you can see the text is displayed the color magenta

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,120
then we will jump back to the editor.

41
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:31,520
We can also add an alpha value from 0 0 to F-F the value halfway between the two is 8 0 which will give

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,810
our text and opacity of 50 percent.

43
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,480
We add this 80 to the end of our hex color value.

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,310
Let's go to the browser and run our code

45
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,360
as you can see the text is displayed at 50 percent opacity.

46
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,160
Then we will jump back to the editor.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,100
Let's now look at an example of using HSLDA specify a color for artex.

48
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:02,470
Recall that HSF stands for hue saturation lightness the hue is the color value.

49
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,990
The saturation is the color intensity and the lightness is the amount of light or dark in the color.

50
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,850
In this example we will make our text a dark red color.

51
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:19,380
First we need to type a call to the H S L function with opening and closing parentheses.

52
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,240
Then we will add the h s n l parameters.

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,670
Let's make the hue of value of 0 to set the color to red.

54
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,100
Then we will make desaturation 100 percent to make the color as intense as possible.

55
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,430
Finally we will add a lightness value of 30 percent which will make the Red Dark remember the larger

56
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:46,190
the lightness percentage be assigned here the lighter the color is we will go to the web browser and

57
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,940
run this code

58
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,390
as you can see the text is displayed a saturated dark red color.

59
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,090
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

60
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,840
We can also add an alpha of value to specify an HSA L.A. color.

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,010
In other words hue saturation lightness alpha this alpha value will be supplied as a value from zero

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,890
point zero to one point zero.

63
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,850
For this example we will give our text an alpha value of 0.4 or 40 percent opaque.

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,970
Once you make these changes we will run our code in the web browser.

65
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,410
As you can see our text is now only partially opaque due to the Alpha value we added.

66
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,060
Note that these Kulish specifications can apply to any color attribute not just text color.

67
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:49,820
We can supply an R G B R-Ga. h s l h SLA hex color or color name tach beach like background color border

68
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,390
color etc..

69
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,010
In the next lecture we will recap what we learned in this section.
