00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.770
In this lecture we will learn how we can customize the idea.

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.590
First let's learn how to change the color theme of the editor different programmers prefer different

3
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.980
color themes in their ID to change the color theme in Visual Studio code.

4
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.140
We can go to File preferences color film.

5
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.180
Here is a run through of the different color schemes available to us the light visual studio theme provide

6
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.730
just a white background with dark colors for the ladder's the light default theme is similar to the

7
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.970
first style but the coloring of the letters is lighter and more colorful.

8
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.820
The Quiet Light theme is a mainly purple theme that also uses some colorful lettering solo arised light

9
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.200
is a color theme that uses a light brownish background with lighter colors for the letters of best is

10
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.070
a color theme that relies heavily on blues and purples.

11
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.000
It has a dark blue background with lighter colored letters the dark visual studio theme gives us a gray

12
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.720
background with light colored letters the dark plus default dark color theme has a similar background

13
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.350
to the prior theme with lighter more colorful letters that Quimby dark color theme is a greenish brown

14
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.240
background with light colored letters the color theme has a gray background and the light neon colored

15
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.570
letters.

16
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.300
The moniker dimmed color theme as a bluish gray background with mid-tone letter colors red is a color

17
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.190
theme that has a vibrant red background with light warm colors for the letters.

18
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.420
The soul arrives dark colors theme as a blue background with light cool colors for letters the tomorrow

19
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.780
night blue theme has a bright blue background with light colors for the letters the high contrast color

20
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.100
theme has a black background with a very bright neon colors for the lettering.

21
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.050
We can also change keyboard shortcut settings.

22
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.190
Go to file preferences keyboard shortcuts.

23
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.860
If you double click on one of these lines you can enter a key combination that will be the key code

24
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.740
for that command.

25
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.700
You can also scroll through the list and see the default keyboard shortcuts.

26
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.370
Some important ones that will help you when coding or copy which is Control-C and paste which is control

27
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.350
P.

28
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.940
Also to toggle a line comment you can highlight a line of code and press control forward slash to commented

29
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.400
out.

30
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.460
If we go to a file preferences settings we can change things like if and when the program will autosave

31
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.650
the font and font size used in the editor.

32
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.480
And how many spaces are in a tab any changes we want to make.

33
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.490
We will put on the right hand side which will override the default values.

34
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.740
We can also specify the font size that we want the text in our editor to be displayed at.

35
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.790
We will copy the editor font size line from the left hand side of the editor and then paste it into

36
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.670
the right hand side of the editor.

37
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.660
We can then change the font size number from 14 to anything that we deem appropriate.

38
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.360
I want to make sure that the code I type is clearly visible to all users of this tutorial even those

39
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.730
using mobile devices.

40
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.740
So I will specify a font of 18.

41
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.320
Let's configure the autosave function to automatically save our code.

42
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.600
We will copy and paste the files auto save line from the left to the right hand side of the editor and

43
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.340
change the value of it from off to after delay.

44
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.990
Be sure to put a comment and then paste the line that we just copied there.

45
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.630
Remember you can use those Control C and control keyboard shortcuts mentioned earlier.

46
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.960
Then we will change the auto save value from off to after delay.

47
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.440
Finally we are going need to specify the amount of time for the delay that passes before each order

48
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.710
of save we will add a comma after the file autosave value we added and then add an opening quote to

49
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.130
and begin to type files.

50
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.910
Autosaves delay as we are typing this the options should appear in the Intellisense and we will select

51
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.470
it.

52
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.820
You will notice that the default value of 1000 is given.

53
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.350
Which stands for 1000 milliseconds or 1 second.

54
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.050
Then we can hit control as to save these changes to apply the user settings.

55
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.420
If the auto save feature was configured properly we should see autosave checked when we click on our

56
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.030
file menu.

57
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.580
We also have the ability to customize the display of the cursor within the editor.

58
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.590
If we scroll down a bit in the user settings you will notice the line of code that specifies the editor

59
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.660
cursor style.

60
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.230
We have six options when it comes to how our cursor is displayed.

61
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:13.710
We can specify an editor cursor a block block outline line line then underline and underline.

62
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.490
Then let's copy and paste the line of code specifying the editor cursor style from the left hand side

63
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.910
of the editor to the right hand side.

64
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.760
We will grab everything except for the comma at the end of the line.

65
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.110
Hit Control C and then paste the line underneath the other lines that we added on the right hand side.

66
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.510
Don't forget to add a comma after the autosaves line the line of code just above the line we just pasted

67
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.900
in by default.

68
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.770
The editor cursor style is set to line.

69
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.850
Let's change it to block and see the result as you will notice the cursor is now a blinking white block

70
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.270
with the width of one character.

71
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.520
Let's see the result of changing the editor cursor style to a value of block outline and see the result

72
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.370
in our editor.

73
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.630
In the editor you will see that now a rectangular outline with the width of one character is shown and

74
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.810
blinking changing this value to line thin will produce a cursor back to the line style that it was by

75
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.700
default.

76
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.430
With the exception that the width is about half as if we want to set our cursor back to the exact default

77
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.260
we could change this value to line giving our cursor an editor cursor style of.

78
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.290
Underline.

79
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.930
We'll turn our cursor into an underline with the width of one character the underline thin editor cursor

80
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.490
style is similar but changes are cursor to an underline with about half the thickness.

81
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.280
Changing the editor cursor style is purely a matter of personal preference.

82
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.670
I will change the style back to line as that is the style I prefer But feel free to change to style

83
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.380
to whatever you like or are accustomed to using one program and next I'm going to make some changes

84
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.950
that will control how the editor behaves when we type in code.

85
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.380
Note that none of these changes are mandatory and you can leave in the defaults if you want but if you

86
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.270
want your editor behave exactly as mine does when following along with these videos then I suggest you

87
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.250
make the same edits.

88
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.830
If we scroll down to the default settings we can see the language specific settings that visual studio

89
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.070
code gives us access to.

90
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.970
Let's go to the H TMLC section and click on the arrow on the left hand side to see our options for the

91
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.130
settings.

92
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.230
We will change indent inner HVM to true which will automatically indent the head and body sections of

93
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.050
r h t m l code in the next lecture.

94
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.940
We will learn the process to run cold in the web browser.
