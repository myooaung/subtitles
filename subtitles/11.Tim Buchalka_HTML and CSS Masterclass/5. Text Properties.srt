00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,840
In this lecture we will look at some other useful text properties that CSSA provides us the word speccing

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,420
property specifies the space between each word in our text.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,140
First let's add a paragraph element to a web page with some example text then we will add an opening

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,520
and closing style tag to our webpage.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,590
We will add the word speccing property and give it a value of 20 pixels.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,360
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,010
As you can see there is now a 20 pixel space between the word example and the word text.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,340
Let's go back to the editor

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,910
the line height property and see SS allows us to specify the height of the lines in our text element.

10
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,230
When you change the line height you will notice that the space between your lines changes.

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,740
We are going to add a brake element to our text to force it to be two lines and then add some more example

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,520
text after the break element.

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,600
Then we will add the line height property and give it a value of 20 pixels.

14
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,970
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code as you can see.

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,380
There is a 20 pixel space between the first and second lines of text on our webpage.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,280
Let's go back to the Editor Note that we can also assign a small value to decrease the spacing between

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,880
lines.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,470
For example let's give our text a line height of three pixels and then run our code to see the result.

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,760
The line height between our lines was reduced.

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's go back to the editor the whitespace property allows us to customize how whitespace works with

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,660
our text if we assign the whitespace property of value of prae the whitespace will appear exactly as

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,600
it was typed in the HVM element.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,850
Let's change our paragraph element back to having some example text content.

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,000
We will use the Enter key to put our second word a few lines below our first word then we will give

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,030
our text the whitespace property with a value of PRI.

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,220
When we run our code in the web browser you will notice that it is displayed exactly as we specified

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,680
the key to note here is that we don't have to add break characters to put words in our text on new lines

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,110
when working with a whitespace value of prie.

29
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,610
Let's go back to the editor if we set the whitespace property to a value of no wrap multiple spaces

30
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,310
will be condensed to a single space the text will continue on the same line unless the code has a break

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,330
tag in it to see this effect.

32
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,690
Let's keep our text exactly how we have it and give it a whitespace value of no wrap then we will go

33
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:38,220
to the web browser and run our code as you can see the text is continued on the same line despite the

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,050
fact that we had text on multiple lines in the element due to the no rap style.

35
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:49,960
Let's go back to the editor the word Arap property allows us to tell the browser to split a long word

36
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,020
onto two lines to make our spacing of our text more uniform.

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,460
Let's change the content of our paragraph element to have a very long word inside of it.

38
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,190
Then we will give our elemental width of 120 pixels using the with property.

39
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,470
First note that if our text has a very long word inside of it and we specify a wished for it to fit

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,090
inside of the breaks in our text look odd.

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,520
Tell us straight this.

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,240
Let's run the code in the web browser as is and see that the text breaks look odd.

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,730
Then we will go back to the editor.

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,850
Now see the result of us having a word wrap property with a value of Greek word.

45
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,420
Let's run our code to see this change take effect.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,170
Our long word now is partially on one line and partially on another line in the next lecture.

47
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,450
We will recap what we learned in this section.
