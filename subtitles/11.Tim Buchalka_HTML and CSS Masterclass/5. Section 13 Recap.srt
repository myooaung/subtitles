00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,290
In this lecture we will look at a recap of what we learned in this section in this section.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,180
We learned how to debug our HVM code.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,600
Debugging is important because the quicker we can fix errors in our code the quicker we will be able

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,900
to produce effective quality code.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,260
First we learned what debugging is in short debugging is finding and fixing errors in your code.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,960
We learned that there are two main types of errors in each DML syntax errors and logic errors a syntax

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,510
error means that you typed something wrong.

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,300
As a result the code may not work properly or may not work at all.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,970
A logic error means that the code runs fine and no error is thrown but that the code doesn't work the

10
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,670
way that you intended.

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,650
Then we looked at several common HVM errors and how to fix them.

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,640
We learned about errors like using an unsupported tag missing quotes or attribute values missing a closing

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,390
tag for an element and improper nesting of elements.

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:14,260
Finally we learned how to use the W3 c h t m l validator to automate detecting errors in our code.

15
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,520
The validator allows us to input your Olave a live web site a file from our computer or directly type

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,940
in HVM our code.

17
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,970
It will tell us any warnings or errors that it runs into as well as the line number that is causing

18
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,380
the issue.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:36,440
Using a validator like the W3 c h t m l validator is a great way to save time checking HVM l code for

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,310
errors.

21
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,440
Debugging is an important skill for any web developer to have in the next lecture.

22
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,800
We will learn about the basics of C Ss.
