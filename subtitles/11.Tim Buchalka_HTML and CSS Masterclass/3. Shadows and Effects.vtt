00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.820
In this lecture we will take a closer look at shadows and other cool effects that we can add to HVM

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.020
element.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.500
The two main types of shadows and CSSA are text shadows and box shadows texture shadows are created

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.200
using the text Chatto property box shadows are created using the black shadow property.

5
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.010
These two properties have a lot of values in common.

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.570
Both support a horizontal offset vertical offset blur radius and color.

7
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.840
In addition to these values we can also give a box shadow a spread radius.

8
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.230
Let's take a look at how we can combine these different values for these properties to create some cool

9
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.810
shadow effect.

10
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.390
First we will add a paragraph element to our Web page and give it some example Tex.

11
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.990
Then we will add an opening and closing style tag to our code.

12
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.310
We will use the text Chatto property and give our text Chatto a horizontal offset of 3 pixels of vertical

13
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.900
offset of 3 pixels a blur radius of three pixels and a color of gray.

14
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.310
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

15
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.140
as you can see our text now is the text Chatto that we specified behind it.

16
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.460
Let's go back to the editor if we increase the blur radius to 10 pixels you will notice that the shadow

17
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.560
becomes smoother and more subtle.

18
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.470
Let's make this change and then run our code in the web browser.

19
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.140
As you can see the shadow is more blurred.

20
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.510
Let's jump back to the Editor want to add a cool gradual shadow that fades out to the bottom left of

21
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.600
your text element start at negative 1 for the horizontal offset and subtract one for each subsequent

22
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.030
value for the vertical offset.

23
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.680
Make it the absolute value of two times the horizontal shadow.

24
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.570
We will give each a blur radius of one pixel.

25
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.190
Finally choose grey colors that gradually progressed from dark to light.

26
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.370
The result is a smooth shadow that fades out to the bottom left of text.

27
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.220
We are going to add 15 lines of style code to create this effect.

28
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.230
Our first Chatto will have a horizontal offset of negative 1 pixels of vertical offset of 2 pixels a

29
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.310
blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of 7 6 7 6 7 6.

30
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.190
Our second shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 2 pixels of vertical offset of 4 pixels

31
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.790
of Blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of 7 6 7 4 7 4.

32
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.290
Our third shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 3 pixels of vertical offset of 6 pixels of

33
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.780
Blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of 7 B-7 a 7.

34
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.380
Our fourth shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 4 pixels of vertical offset of 8 pixels

35
00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.990
a blur radius of one pixel and the hex color of 8 2 8 1 8 1 or fifth shadow will have a horizontal offset

36
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.660
of negative 5 pixels of vertical offset of 10 pixels a blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of 8

37
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.910
b 8 8 8 9 are 6.

38
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.890
Shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 6 pixels of vertical offset of 12 pixels a blur radius

39
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.440
of one pixel and a hex color of 9 4 9 3 9 2 or 7.

40
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.920
The shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 7 pixels of vertical offset of 14 pixels a blur

41
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.360
radius of one pixel and a hex color of ninety nine C 9 C R our shadow will have a horizontal offset

42
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:50.160
of negative 8 pixels of vertical offset of 16 pixels a blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of a

43
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.410
8 a 6 a 6 or 9.

44
00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.600
Shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 9 pixels of vertical offset of 18 pixels a blur radius

45
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.520
of one pixel and a hex color be to be 1 be zero.

46
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.640
Our tenth shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 10 pixels of vertical offset of 20 pixels

47
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.160
a blur radius of one pixel and a hex color.

48
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.310
B C B B B A R eleventh shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 11 pixels of vertical offset

49
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.500
of 22 pixels a blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of C6 C-4.

50
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.940
See for our twelfth shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 12 pixels of vertical offset of

51
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:45.120
24 pixels a blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of C-A CD CD or thirteenth shadow will have a horizontal

52
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.860
offset of negative 13 pixels of vertical offset of 26 pixels a blur radius of one pixel and a hex color

53
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.500
of da D6 D5 or.

54
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.390
Shadow will have a horizontal offset of negative 14 pixels of vertical offset of 28 pixels a blur radius

55
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:10.740
of one pixel and a hex color of D.S. DD DC or fifteenth châteaux will have a horizontal offset of negative

56
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:19.030
15 pixels of vertical offset of 30 pixels a blur radius of one pixel and a hex color of E for each 3

57
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.310
E-2.

58
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.150
Once we finish typing all of that code we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see

59
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.100
we now have a gradual text Chatto that fades to the bottom left.

60
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.820
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

61
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:42.600
Bach shadows are the other main type of shadow and CSSA to create a simple box shadow let's say a development

62
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.100
to a webpage.

63
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.600
Let's add some stylization to our div..

64
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.020
We will give our DiVall width and height then we will use the box Shatto property to add a box shadow

65
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.220
to our div.

66
00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:00.910
We will give our box châteaux a horizontal offset vertical offset blur radius scragged radius and color.

67
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:08.160
Let's give our box châteaux a horizontal offset of 0 pixels of vertical offset of 0 pixels a blur radius

68
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.530
of 50 pixels a spread radius of 20 pixels and a color of black.

69
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.670
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

70
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.000
You can see the back shadow that we added behind Argive.

71
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.610
Let's go back to the editor to make the shadow applied to the inside of our div as opposed to the outside

72
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.150
of it.

73
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.050
We can use the inset keyword.

74
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.920
Let's say the inset keyword is then run our code again in the web browser as you can see the shadow

75
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.000
is now inset inside of our div.

76
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.570
Let's jump back to the editor.

77
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.970
We can modify these properties to position the shadow under a side of our div.

78
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.920
Let's remove the inset key word that we added for the last example so that the shadow is outside of

79
00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.640
our div then we will give our box shadow a horizontal offset of 30 pixels of vertical offset of 20 pixels

80
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.600
a blur radius of 60 pixels a spread radius of negative 7 pixels and the color of black.

81
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.650
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

82
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.120
You will notice that the shadow is now offset underneath the side of our div in the next lecture.

83
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.230
We will learn about how we can position elements using CSSA.
