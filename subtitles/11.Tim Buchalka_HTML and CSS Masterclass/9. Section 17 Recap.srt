00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,010
In this lecture we will recap what we learned in this section in this section we learned about several

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,380
properties that CSSA gives us to stylize our elements.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,740
First we learned about properties we can use to modify and element's background the background color

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,140
property allows us to assign a color to an elements background the background image property allows

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,170
us to assign an image as an element background CSSA gives us the background repeat property to control

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,630
how the background repeats the background attachment property specifies if the image scrolls on the

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:41,360
web page scrolls the background position property allows us to position our background relative to our

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,350
element.

9
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,530
Next we learned about border properties the border style property allows us to specify a style for our

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,600
border.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,710
In addition to giving all four sides of the elements a border you can specify which sides of the border

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:02,390
to assign a style to using the border top style border right style border bottom style and border style

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,900
properties assigning the border with property a value of Vic will give our element a thick border.

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,780
We can also assign a wish to an individual side of our border using the border top with border right

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,930
with border bottom width and border left with properties we can add a custom images a border by using

16
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,450
the border image property.

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,220
The border image source property allows us to specify a custom image for a border the border image slice

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,130
property enables us to specify how the source image is sliced and displayed border image with allows

19
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,320
us to give our border image with the border image outset property allows us to specify an amount for

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,090
the border image to extend outside the bounds of an elements border the border image repeat property

21
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,910
lets us specify how the image will fill the space.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,560
After that we look at box properties that CSX provides us to allow us to modify the elements box.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,560
The combination of its content padding border and margins the box sizing property allows us to specify

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
whether or not padding and borders should effect and elements width and height we can use the min with

25
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,480
Max with min height and max height properties to specify the minimum or maximum height and width for

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,520
elements.

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,540
The men with property specifies a minimum with for an element the max with property.

28
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,210
Let's specify the maximum with for an element the min height property specifies the minimum height for

29
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,150
an element the max height property lets us specify the maximum height for an element.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,290
The box Shatto property lets us he had a box shadow tour element.

31
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,640
Then we learned about properties that allow us to stylize are elements outlines an outline is completely

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,130
outside of an element and doesn't contribute to an elements overall with or height the outline style

33
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,890
property specifies the style of our outline outline with property specifies a thickness for the outline

34
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,650
we can use the outline offset property to add space between the edges of the element and the outline

35
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,740
CSSA also gives us the outline property which is one property that we can use to specify the outline

36
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,260
style outline color and outline with.

37
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,770
After that we learned about properties that allow us to position elements on the webpage the position

38
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,110
property allows us to specify how an element will be positioned on a webpage.

39
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:21,020
We can also use the top right bottom and left properties to position our elements the float property

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,450
allows us to specify if an image should be displayed to the left or right of text the clear property

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,240
lets us specify the sides to not allow an image on the z index property allows us to specify which elements

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,090
will appear on top of and below other elements.

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,760
Then we learned about the properties CSL gives us for clipping and masking CSSA gives us the clip path

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,720
property to define a clip path for image CSSA gives us the mask property to add a mask to our image.

45
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,750
Finally we learned about other useful properties that CSSA gives us access to the CSSA cursor property

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,010
allows us to change the appearance of the mouse cursor when we mouse over an element.

47
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,900
You can use the user select property to control whether or not the user can select and elements text

48
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,840
in the next section.

49
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,910
We will learn about how we can style tables and see SS.
