00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.800
In this lecture we will learn about formatting tags in HCM So we're going to learn about several tags

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.040
in this video that we haven't yet covered in this course we can use the H.R. tag to add a horizontal

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.870
rule to our Web page to illustrate using this tag we will add a paragraph element the H.R. tag and then

4
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.390
another paragraph element then we will go to the web browser

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.120
when we run our code.

6
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.010
You will notice the horizontal line between our two paragraph elements.

7
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.890
The usual use of the H.R. tag is to define a change in sematic content.

8
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.480
Let's jump back to the editor

9
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.030
the ADR tag is used to define an abbreviation or acronym.

10
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.980
The reason that we use this tag is because it helps our abbreviation to be recognized as an abbreviation

11
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.530
by browsers and search engines.

12
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.380
You can also add the title element to spell out the full meaning when the user hovers their mouse over

13
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:11.010
the abbreviation for this example we will add the abbreviation tag inside of a paragraph element and

14
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.340
give it a title attribute with a value of buy one get one free.

15
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.710
Then we will give our abreviation element to content BOGO and then add a closing abreviation tag to

16
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.190
finish off our sentence.

17
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.350
We will add the words sale on pretzels before the closing paragraph tag so that the sentence reads BOGO

18
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.750
sale on pretzels.

19
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.180
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

20
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.140
when we hover over the word Bo-Bo.

21
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.510
You will see the phrase buy one get one free appear telling the user what the acronym Bogost stands

22
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.350
for.

23
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.710
Let's jump back to the editor

24
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.900
the address tag is where the web site owner or article author includes their contact information.

25
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.920
If this tag is within the body element of the webpage it means that it has the information about the

26
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.350
owner of the Web site.

27
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.600
If the address information is inside of an article element on a web page it means that the information

28
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.740
is about the article author.

29
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.210
For this example we will add our address element within the body of our webpage.

30
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.600
We will add some example contact info between the opening and closing address tags we added to our code.

31
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.890
Then we will go to the web browser and run the code.

32
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.620
Let's jump back to the editor the BDO tag is used to override the current text direction.

33
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.680
BDO stands for bidirectional override.

34
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.440
For this example let's say a two paragraph elements.

35
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.990
The first will have example text content that goes from left to right.

36
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.640
The second paragraph element will have a nested BDO element that specifies the direction of right to

37
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.620
left or RTL.

38
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.300
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

39
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.010
as you can see the first paragraph element goes from left to right and the second paragraph element

40
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.870
goes from right to left.

41
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.050
Let's go back to the editor and learn about another tag the Del tag shows text that has been deleted.

42
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.230
It displays the deleted text with a line through it.

43
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.130
Let's take a look at an example with the content example text where the word text has been deleted.

44
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.400
We will nest the Del tag inside of the element and put the opening and closing Del tags around the word

45
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.320
text.

46
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.830
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

47
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.050
Since we surrounded the word tax in an opening and closing bell tag it is displayed with a line through

48
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.800
it.

49
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:54.110
Let's jump back to the editor the INS tag shows text that has been inserted the INS tag is the opposite

50
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.390
of the Del tag inserted text is shown as underlined in the web browser.

51
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.490
Let's change the Del tag from the example we just looked at into INS tags.

52
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.180
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

53
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.360
as you can see the word text that we surrounded in an opening and closing ins tag is now underlined.

54
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.740
Let's jump back to the editor

55
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.930
the DSN tag allows us to define the meaning of a word on our Web page.

56
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.900
We use this element inside of a p element and the text immediately outside of the closing DFS tag is

57
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.340
the definition.

58
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.510
For example we will add a paragraph element then we will add a define element inside of the opening

59
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.130
and closing define tags.

60
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.370
We will type the word web development.

61
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:51.160
Then after the closing define tag put before the closing paragraph tag we will add the definition of

62
00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:01.290
web development writing code to create web pages then we will go to the web browser and run the code.

63
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.050
Let's jump back to the editor and learn about another tag

64
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.160
the KBG tag is used to display keyboard input in programming documentation.

65
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.370
This is used to show the commands that a user can use in a different font than the surrounding text

66
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.770
for example.

67
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.570
We will add a paragraph element with some text inside of the paragraph element we will add an opening

68
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:33.040
and closing keyboard tag with the key combination control plus C as the content of the element.

69
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.600
Let's go to the web browser and run our code when we run this code in the browser.

70
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.290
You will see the text control see rendered in a different style than the surrounding text.

71
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:53.490
Then we will go back to the editor the essay MP tag is used to display sample output from a computer

72
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.680
program similar to the Kaybee detail eg.

73
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.850
This tag shows the text that surrounds in a particular style and font for this example we will add a

74
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.240
paragraph element with some text then inside of the paragraph element we will add a sample element with

75
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.090
the content.

76
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.060
Result equals 5.

77
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.980
Once we finish typing that we will go to the web browser and run our code

78
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.530
then we will go back to the editor

79
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.220
the tag is used to indicate to the user that the text is no longer correct or accurate.

80
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.100
Our example here we'll start out with a paragraph element with some text.

81
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.780
There will be an element with the content text HVM L we will go to the web browser and write our code

82
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.730
then we will jump back to the editor to cue tag is used to define a short quotation.

83
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.030
It surrounds the text inside of its opening and closing tag in double quotes.

84
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.060
We will add an opening and closing queue tag with the content.

85
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:11.980
This text is a short quote then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

86
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.660
That wraps up our deep dive into formatting tags and HMO.

87
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.490
In the next lecture we will learn about HMO metadata tags.
