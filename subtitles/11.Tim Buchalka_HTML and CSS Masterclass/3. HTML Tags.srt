00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,980
In this lecture we learn about what HTL tags are in a variety of tags that we have access to an HMO

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,250
h female Tadg are the most fundamental concept of HVM L and they are used in all aspects of the language.

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,460
Tags are the building blocks that each female uses to define the content to be shown on the web page

4
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,600
a text starts with an opening angular bracket followed by the tag name and finally a closing on Guler

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,420
bracket.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,200
Each team has a finite number of tags that can be used which are predefined by the language.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,390
The more of these tags you know in use the more you will be able to do with HVM L..

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,900
In most cases tags come in pairs where the first tag is called the Start Tag or opening tag and the

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,780
second tag is called the end tag or closing tag ending tags include a forward slash before the tag name.

10
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,770
In between the opening tag and closing tag is the content of the tag.

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,390
Let's take a look at some of the most basic and important tags that Mail gives us access to allowing

12
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,160
us to define web content.

13
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:16,720
The paragraph tag is used to display text and the tag uses the letter P inside of angular brackets to

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,370
use the paragraph tag.

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:24,550
We put an opening P-TECH the text content we want to be displayed on our Web page and then a closing

16
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,020
tag.

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,100
If we go to a web browser and click and drag in each tremelo file that we just typed.

18
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,960
You should see the text that you added using the paragraph tag displayed on the web page.

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,210
Let's go back to the editor and learn about the image tag the image tag is used to display an image

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,590
and the tag uses the letters.

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,310
I MGE inside of angular brackets.

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,890
For example if we have to start PLG image in the same directory as our h him out file we are typing

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,420
in these examples.

24
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,970
We can specify the name of the source file.

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:02,560
In this case to be start PLG note that the image tags specifies the source inside and the tag itself

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,110
and does not use a closing tag.

27
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,820
We will go back to a web browser and dragging our each team out file to see the image displayed on our

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,310
Web page.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,410
Let's jump over to the editor and learn about the input tag the input tag allows the user to input text

30
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,000
to our Web page.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,570
It consists of the word input inside of angular brackets and has no end tag inside of the tag we specify

32
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,350
the type of input which in most cases will be text.

33
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,210
We can go back to our browser and run this code to see our text input field appear on the web page

34
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,230
we can click into the input field and type text using the keyboard that we will see displayed inside

35
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,670
of the input field as we type it.

36
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,970
Let's go back to the editor and look at HVM else.

37
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:58,260
Title tag the title tag defines the title for the document which is displayed in the toolbar of the

38
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,130
browser.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,140
The title won't be shown on the page itself.

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,270
Just up on the tab at the top of the browser the title tag also has a closing tag.

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,040
We will go to the browser and drag the HTL file over.

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,620
Now we should see the title at the top of the browser or on the tab.

43
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's go back to the editor and look at the next example.

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,780
The body text specifies the main content of the HVM l document.

45
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,840
It includes a closing tag to define where the body of the document ends.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,680
The video tag is used to embed video clips or streams into the web page.

47
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:41,340
It includes an ending tag the source tag allows us to specify a movie file source and type to be used

48
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,220
as the content of the video tags the source tag does not use a closing tag.

49
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:54,060
We will start our source tag and give it a source attribute with a value of movie clip that MP for the

50
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,730
way that we can use the video and movie tags together is to first have the video tags and then put in

51
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,720
the source tag in between the opening and closing video tags as the content in our own course resource

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,550
files.

53
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,920
We have an MP for a file called movie clip that MP for

54
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,770
then we will give our source taga type attribute with a value of video.

55
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,470
Forward slash MP for to run this example.

56
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,510
Make sure that you have the movie clip that MP for file in the same directory as your HVM code.

57
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,810
Let's jump to the web browser and drag each team file to see the result.

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,760
We will go back to Visual Studio code and learn about the DIV tag the DIV tag is one of the most diverse

59
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,700
and important tags in HMO.

60
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,430
It allows us to define our own sections of each team all documents making it very useful and flexible.

61
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:07,750
The div tag includes a closing tag later in the course you will see or div tags can become especially

62
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,860
useful to us when we start styling our elements using CSX HQ Mail gives us access to 6 heading tags

63
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,850
numbered 1 3 6 that allow us to create heading text for our web pages each heading take has an opening

64
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,680
and closing tag.

65
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,470
Each of these heading tags has a default size defined by each DML with the H-1 tag being the biggest

66
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,800
and the each six tag being the smallest.

67
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,640
We will go back to our web browser and drag over the HMS file to run the code.

68
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,550
You can see the six different sizes that these headings are by default.

69
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,470
These are just some of the tags that HQ Mail gives us access to during this course.

70
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,520
You will be exposed to a massive amount of tags that the language provides to display various content

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,190
and how we can combine these tags to create interesting dynamic and responsive web content.

72
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,120
In the next lecture we will learn about the format of an HMO document.
