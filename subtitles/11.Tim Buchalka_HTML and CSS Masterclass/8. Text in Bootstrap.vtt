00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.110
In this lecture we will learn about how to work with text and bootstrap.

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.960
When we put our text inside of our container div it automatically takes on certain properties by default

3
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.460
our text has a font size of 16 pixels and a font of hell Vatican new.

4
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.340
Let's start by adding a div with a class value of container to our Web page.

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.330
Bootstrap allows us to use the display heading class to sign and display heading of 1 to 4.

6
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.150
That makes our headings stand out more than HVM else.

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.410
Normal H-1 heading display 1 is the largest display heading that bootstrap gives us.

8
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.880
We will add an H1 heading element and give it a class value of display 1.

9
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.040
Don't forget to add some text content between the opening and closing H-1 tags so that you can see the

10
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.220
effect.

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.500
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the result of the code we type.

12
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.860
Does a large dark heading that stands out on our Web page.

13
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.480
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example display for the smallest heading that

14
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.260
bootstrap gives us to see the difference in the effect that this class has on heading text.

15
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.080
Let's change the 1 to 4 in the class value but leave everything else the same for each one element and

16
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.290
then go back to the web browser and run our code as you can see the size of our heading is smaller and

17
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.310
the color of our heading is lighter.

18
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.200
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

19
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.790
Bootstrap gives us several styles that we could easily apply to our text including bold lightweight

20
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.330
italic and normal by giving the text a class value of fun to wait bulled we can make bootstrap text

21
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.170
bold.

22
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.180
For this example we will create a paragraph element with some example text content and astonied a class

23
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.290
value of font weight.

24
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.070
Bold.

25
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.510
Let's go to the web browser and write our code.

26
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.310
We can see that our text is bold on the web page.

27
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.420
Let's jump back to the editor.

28
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.930
By using the bootstrap class font weight light it will make our text extra thin.

29
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.310
Let's change the word bold to the word light in our class value and then jump back to the web browser

30
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.160
when we run the code.

31
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.490
You will notice that the text is now very thin.

32
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.530
As a result of having a class value of fun wait light.

33
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.330
Let's jump back to the editor.

34
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.920
The font italic class and bootstrap allows us to easily transform our text into italic text.

35
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.830
Let's change the class value of our paragraph element to font italic.

36
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.420
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

37
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.910
As we can see the result is that the text is Italic on a web page.

38
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.790
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

39
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.040
The font weight normal class lets us ensure that the font weight is normal weight and not bold or lightweight

40
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.990
programmatically.

41
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.810
This class allows us to reset the text to its default wait if we change the class value of our paragraph

42
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.560
element to fun weight normal and then what our code in the web browser you will see the result.

43
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.290
The text has been reset to its normal default font weight.

44
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.970
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

45
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.020
Bootstrap also gives us classes to easily modify the capitalization of text on a webpage.

46
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.730
We can change our text to all capital letters or lower case letters or the first letter of each word

47
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.030
to capital and the rest to lowercase.

48
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.370
If we want to make all the letters in our text uppercase we can assign text to class value of text uppercase.

49
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.110
Let's change the class value of our text to text uppercase and then go to the web browser to run our

50
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.640
code as you can see the text has now been converted to uppercase.

51
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.130
Let's go back to the editor.

52
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.620
The text lowercase class lets us change the text to all lower case letters.

53
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.910
We will change the class value to text lowercase and then when our code in the web browser as you can

54
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.250
see all of the letters in the text have been changed to lowercase then we will go back to the editor

55
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.550
if we assign our elemental of value of text capitalize the first letter of each word will be capital

56
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.550
and the rest will be lowercase.

57
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.810
Let's change the class value of our text to text capitalized and then run the code as you can see the

58
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.140
first letter in each word of our text is capitalized and the next lecture.

59
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.860
We will learn about some of the other useful features of bootstrap.
