00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,140
In this section we will put the HVM l skills that we have learned to use as we build a website.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,210
For example we will create a website for a new pizza parlor.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,280
Here is what the website will look like when it is finished.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:27,670
As you can see it will have four sections home about us menu and contact.

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,880
First we will create the header bar for our web page.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,940
We will add images to the top and links to each section.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,010
After that we will create the home page for our website.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,260
This page will have an image carousel that cycles through a series of images.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,320
Then we will create the about us section which will include adding text and image content to a web page.

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,370
After that we will look at creating a basic menu.

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,060
We will do this using cards and Bootstrap which allow us to easily group an image or the title description

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,010
and button.

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,760
When one of the buttons on the web page is clicked it will display the name of the item and the price

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,270
is an alert at the top of the browser.

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,870
Finally we will create the contact section for our web page.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,620
We will create an HMO form that can be used to compose an email since we would need server side code

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,170
to actually send the email.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,530
We will just display the email information as an alert to the user using basic client code.

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,890
By the end of this section you will have practical experience combining the skills you learned so far

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,730
in this course to create a functioning Web site in the next lecture.

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,610
We will start to build our Web page that we will add to in this section of the course.
