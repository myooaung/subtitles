00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,180
In this lecture we will learn about some of the other useful bootstrap elements and classes that we

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,430
can use when we lay out our webpage to add color to an element background we can assign it.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:23,700
One of the following bootstrap classes B.G. primary B.G. success B.G. info B.G. warning B.G. danger

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,230
B.G. secondary B.G. dark and D-G light.

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,440
Let's look at an example of using one of these classes to color and element's background.

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,060
First we will add a div to our Web page and give it a height and A with.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,110
Next let's assign our div one of these classes.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,660
I will choose to give it a value of B.G. primary which will give our give a blue background color to

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,730
see the result of the code we just typed.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:55,610
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code as you can see there is now a 100 pixel by 100 pixel

11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,860
blue square on our Web page.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,410
Let's jump back to the editor.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,620
Another important feature that bootstrap gives us access to is the ability to easily create and stylized

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,910
buttons.

15
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,680
First let's create a simple button that we can assign a bootstrap class to.

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,090
We will add a button element to our Web page if we add the BT end class to our button.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,570
You will notice that the corners become rounded.

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:27,630
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code as you can see the corners of our button are now rounded.

19
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,550
Let's jump back to the Editor.

20
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,010
However our button is still just a simple gray button if we want to add some color to it.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,990
We can use some of the other button classes that bootstrap gives us access to.

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,910
For example we can assign a button a class of BICI and primary.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,380
In addition to the original BTX class that we assigned it to give our button a blue color similar to

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,190
the background we gave our div and the last example.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,610
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,990
We now have a blue button on our Web page.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,030
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,980
Another important bootstrap class is the Jumbotron class which is a large grey box of content to our

29
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,270
Web page.

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,320
This is useful for when we want to call attention to something on our Web page and make it stand out

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,300
to the user.

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,510
Let's look at an example of how we can use this class.

33
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:25,390
First we will create a div element we will assign our div a class of Jumbotron then we can add a heading

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,400
to our Jumbotron using the H 1 through H 6 heading tags.

35
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,930
I will use the H-1 heading tag for this example.

36
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,490
We can also add text to a Jumbotron using the tag.

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,720
Let's say a two paragraph elements some example text for this demonstration.

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,820
Once we type all of that code we can go to the web browser and write our code.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,540
As you can see there is a large gray block on our screen with the heading and text inside of it.

40
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,170
This is our Jumbotron.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,850
Let's jump back to the editor in Bootstrap.

42
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,390
A card is a box element that we can easily add content to.

43
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,740
It is useful for associating content with other content.

44
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,770
For example if we want to add a title image description and button that is all related to each other

45
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,120
and displayed inside of the same container.

46
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,440
The court is essentially a box container with a border.

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,780
Let's look at a basic example of this.

48
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,410
First we relate a development which will be the container for the contents of our card.

49
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:32,090
We will assign this div a class value of card and a style with a width of 300 pixels inside of this

50
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,360
div.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,950
We will create a second div and assign it a class value of card body.

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,920
We can use the card title class to add a title to our card for this example we will use the H 3 element

53
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,740
and give it a class value of card title.

54
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,660
The card text class is used for text content on the card.

55
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,570
We will add text to our card using the paragraph tag and assign it a class value of card text.

56
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,580
Then we will add a button to the bottom of our card.

57
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,710
We will use the button tag and give our button a class value of PTEN and BT and primary.

58
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,400
When we run the code in the browser We will see that our card is displayed and groups all of the content

59
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,480
we added to the card body in the next lecture.

60
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,920
We will recap what we learned in this section of the course.
