00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.330
In this lecture we will learn about how we can work with images and bootstrap bootstrap gives us some

2
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.100
useful cases that we can use to quickly work with images on our Web page.

3
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.080
We can use the float left and float right classes to align our image to the left or right of our Web

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.680
page content.

5
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.580
For this example we will create an image element and give it a source of our star dot P AND HE image

6
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.230
we will give our image a height and width of 200 pixels.

7
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.990
Finally we will give our image a class value of float.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.190
Left.

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.140
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our store image is aligned to the

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.840
left side of our Web page.

11
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.120
Let's jump back to the editor the float right class that bootstrap gives us allows us to align images

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.940
to the right of our webpage.

13
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.840
We will switch our elements class value to float right and then run our code in the web browser.

14
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.730
As you can see our image is now aligned to the right of our Web page.

15
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.140
Let's jump back to the editor bootstrap also gives us a few ways to change the shape of our image border.

16
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.420
We can use the rounded rounded circle an image thumbnail classes to do so giving our image a class value

17
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.450
of round it allows us to round the corners of our image.

18
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.660
Let's add an image element to a web page and give it a source of our blue jpeg image.

19
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.770
We will give it a height and width of 200 in a class value of rounded.

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.040
We will then go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our image has rounded corners.

21
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.190
Let's jump back to the editor using the rounded circle class value allows us to display our image with

22
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.030
a border and a circular shape.

23
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.390
Let's change the class value of our image element to rounded circle and then go to the web browser and

24
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.080
what our code

25
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.000
as you can see our image now has a circular border.

26
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.890
Let's jump back to the editor the image thumbnail class it's a border around our image.

27
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.960
We will change the class value of our image to image thumbnail then we will go to the web browser and

28
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.120
run our code as you can see there is now a border around our image.

29
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.630
Let's jump back to the editor one really cool use of bootstrap is to create an image carousel that allows

30
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.130
users to flip through the images on our webpage.

31
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.890
Bootstrap provides provide some useful tools to easily and intuitively create an image carousel for

32
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.240
our web page.

33
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.180
First we need to create the container div for carousel.

34
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.970
We will give it an idea of carrousel ID a class value of carrousel and the class value of slide and

35
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.270
the data arrived value of Carrousel.

36
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.570
Then we will add the items to our carousel.

37
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.430
Each item will be wrapped in a development with a class value of carrousel item or image element for

38
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.740
each carousel slide we'll go between these opening and closing div tags.

39
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.340
We will give each of our divs a class value of carrousel item.

40
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.420
The first day we will also give a second class value of active to make this item the starting active

41
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.060
item in the Carousel.

42
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.520
Our first image will have a source of star P and G.

43
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.340
Our second image will have a source of our blue dot jpeg image.

44
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.230
Our third image will have a source of our checkerboard jpeg image.

45
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.890
Each of our images will have a with of 1000 and a height of 500.

46
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.770
Finally let's add some controls to our carrousel controls of the forward and backward arrows that allow

47
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.230
the user to manually scroll through carrousel images on our Web page.

48
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.830
The first control we will create is the previous arrow for our carrousel we will add an anchor element

49
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.630
with a class value of carrousel control Prevx an A-Trak value of hash tag carrousel ID and a data slide

50
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.010
value of preve.

51
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.370
Then we will add a child span element with a class value of carrousel control previa icon.

52
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.070
This span will be the actual arrow icon that the user will see the second control we will create is

53
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.670
the next arrow for our carrousel we will add an anchor element with a class value of carrousel control

54
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.150
next an H rest value of hash tag carrousel ID and the data slide value of next.

55
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.130
Then we will add a child span element with a class value of carrousel control next icon.

56
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.720
One last thing.

57
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.310
The default arrows for the carousel are white so they are hard to see against the default browser background

58
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.950
of white.

59
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.000
Let's make the background of our Web page black so that we can easily see them when we run our code.

60
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.350
Now that we have the code for the image carrousel and its controls we will go to the web browser and

61
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:42.010
run our code as you can see the carousel cycles through our image and we can also make use of the controls

62
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.650
to move to the previous and next the images in the carousel

63
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.580
and the next lecture.

64
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.930
We will learn how to work with text and bootstrap.
