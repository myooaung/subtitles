00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,910
In this section we learned about debugging CSSA code in order to ensure that the elements on our page

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,770
are stylized properly.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,290
We need to make sure that we write valid error free CSSA code.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,690
First we learned about common CSSA errors and how to fix them.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,450
The common CSSA errors that we looked at are missing semi-colon invalid declaration and invalid selector

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:36,110
a missing semi-colon between declarations in our CSSA can be problematic an invalid declaration will

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,380
cause the property to have no effect on the specified element.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,750
If there is an invalid selector in our code the entire block of styles which is supposed to apply to

9
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,610
one or more elements will be invalid and will not be used to stylize any elements on our webpage.

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,710
We looked at examples of each of these errors and how we can fix them.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,180
After that we learned how to check our CSSA code for errors by using a CSSA validator.

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,140
The Worldwide Web Consortium has a CSSA validator that we can use to check our code for syntax errors

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,920
just like the HVM validator the CSSA validator is an important tool that you should use frequently when

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,820
developing web pages in the next section.

15
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,830
We will look at some advanced and useful CSSA features.
