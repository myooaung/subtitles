00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,700
In this lecture we will learn how we can animate the words spacing and letter spacing properties using

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,170
CCS.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,660
Let's look at an example of how we can animate the words spacing property to stretch the text on a webpage.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,010
First we will create a text that will be animated on our Web page.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,810
Next we need our opening and closing style tags to our paragraphed tag we will add an animation of text

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,770
and a duration of three seconds and make our animation loop using the infinite keyword.

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,050
Then we will create our animation we will name our animation tech Stanham and specify that it will animate

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,110
the words spacing property from a value of five pixels to a value of 100 pixels.

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,210
When we run this code on the web page we should see the spacing between the words and our text increase

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,070
as the animation plays.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,040
Let's jump back to the editor.

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,220
We will also look at an example of how we can animate the letter spacing property.

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,600
We don't need to create a new animation we just have to make a few modifications to our existing one.

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,710
For starters let's change the word spacing property to letter space and also let's change the value

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,330
at the end of our animation from 100 pixels to 20 pixels.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:21,060
When we run this code in our browser we should see our letter spacing animation play in the next lecture.

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,980
We will recap what we have learned in this section of the course.
