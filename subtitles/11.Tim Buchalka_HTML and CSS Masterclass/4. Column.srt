00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,710
In this lecture we will learn about the column properties that CSSA allows us to animi the column properties

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:19,020
we can animate using CSSA or column count column gap column rule column rule color column rule with

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,200
column with and columns for this example we are going to animate the column count property.

4
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,940
We will create an animation that breaks a large block of text up into several columns across our webpage.

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,320
Next let's say at a block of text in a div that we can animi the key point here is that we will add

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,350
enough text so that the web browser is able to split it into columns.

7
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,280
After that we will add an opening and closing style tag.

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,950
We will stylize our development giving it a column count of 1 and an animation of column and with a

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,600
duration of two seconds and make it loop using the infinite keyword.

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,750
After that let's write the code for our animation we will cool our animation column and we will specify

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,380
that the column count go from 1 to 5.

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,650
When we run the animation you will notice that the text divides itself into columns.

13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,990
If it divides itself into less than five columns that means that there is enough text in the div to

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,900
be subdivided and you need to add more text for the animation to have the desired effect.

15
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,960
In the next lecture we will learn about the margin properties that CSSA allows us to animate.
