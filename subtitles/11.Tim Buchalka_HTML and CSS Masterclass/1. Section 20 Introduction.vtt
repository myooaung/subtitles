00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.810
In this section we will learn about how to animate HVM elements using CSX.

2
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.620
First we will look at transitions transitions allow us to smoothly change your properties value over

3
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.480
a specified duration of time using these properties.

4
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.810
We can make changes between values more gradual and visually appealing.

5
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.760
CSSA gives us properties to control things like the speed duration and ease type of transitions between

6
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.930
properties.

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.790
Then we will learn about animations.

8
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.660
Animations are based on keyframes and we can animate as many of n elements properties as we want as

9
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.190
many times as we want CSSA gives us control over things like speed duration ease type and repeatability

10
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.750
of animations.

11
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.010
After that we will look at 2D animation.

12
00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.940
We will cover how to animate the position scale rotation and skew of chainmail elements and 2d.

13
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:08.530
Finally we will learn about 3D animation 3D animation deals with the x y z coordinate plane as opposed

14
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.810
to the 2d x y coordinate plane CSSA allows us to use the z axis to add depth to our animations by the

15
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.900
end of this section.

16
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.930
You will have a strong understanding of how to animate elements using C Ss you will be able to make

17
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.570
your web pages more exciting and aesthetically appealing by animating their content and the next lecture

18
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.180
we will learn about transitions and see SS.
