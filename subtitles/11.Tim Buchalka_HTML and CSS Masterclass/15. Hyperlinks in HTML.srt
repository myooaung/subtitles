00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,880
In this lecture we will learn how we can hyperlinks to our Web page.

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:15,070
One important feature in each team is the ability to add hyperlinks to our web pages hyperlinks or links

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,650
that the user can click on that take them to another web page.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:26,080
HVM provides the anchor tag to allow us to create a hyperlink the A-Trak property allows us to specify

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,910
the URL to take the user to when they click on the hyperlink.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:38,670
For example we can type the following.

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,980
Let's go to the web browser and drag over our HQ mail file to run the code.

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,600
Notice that the content of this element is the actual text to be displayed as the hyperlink that the

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,960
user can click on.

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,420
We can also use other types of content like images as links to see an example of this.

11
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,140
Let's jump back to the editor.

12
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,900
Let's change our current code to the following.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:26,110
To run this code we will jump back to the web browser and Draeger HDMI file into the browser.

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,540
Now if we click on the image notice that it will take us to the link we specify using the ATRA attribute.

15
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,580
Notice that when we move our mouse over something clickable on our G-mail web page the cursor turns

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,680
into a handy icon.

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,120
The default behavior of a text hyperlink an aged humoral is as follows.

18
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,360
If the user hasn't clicked on the link it is displayed in blue.

19
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:54,740
If the user has previously clicked on a link it is displayed in purple we can use a style attribute

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,610
to change these default behaviors.

21
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:04,310
For example we can change an uncooked hyperlinked color from blue to another color by using a style

22
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,290
tag and specifying the linked state of the anchor tag.

23
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,600
Let's go back to the editor and look at an example of this.

24
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,510
We will add an opening and closing style tag and between the two we will add the anchor selector which

25
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,560
is the letter A followed by a colon and the word length.

26
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,800
We will then add an opening curly brace.

27
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,590
The word color or colon the word pink and a closing curly brace.

28
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,410
If we put back the hyperlink code we had before go to the web browser and when our code.

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:47,500
You will notice that the link is now displayed as pink instead of blue.

30
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,090
We can also add a tooltip that will display when the user hovers over the hyperlink by using the title

31
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,050
attribute to see an example of this.

32
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,680
Let's go back to the editor.

33
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,910
We will add the title attribute to our anchor element and give it a value in quotes to use attribute

34
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,460
take effect.

35
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,500
We will go back to the web browser and run the code.

36
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,200
Now when we hover over our link you will notice that the additional information that we added using

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,180
the title tag is displayed as a tool tip in the next lecture.

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,010
We will take a closer look at images and HVM L and techniques we can use to add images to our webpage.
