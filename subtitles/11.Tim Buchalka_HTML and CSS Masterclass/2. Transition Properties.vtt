00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.750
In this lecture we will learn about transitions and see SS transitions allow us to smoothly change a

2
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.330
property value over a specified duration of time.

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.520
There are two requirements in order for us to create a CSSA transition.

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.620
One is that we need to specify the property we want to apply the transition to.

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.180
The other is that we need to specify the duration of the transition or the time it will take the property

6
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.220
to change from one value to another.

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.140
If we don't specify a duration the transition will not work.

8
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.340
The transition property allows us to specify the property to transition and the amount of time it will

9
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.140
take to make the transition.

10
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.790
Let's look at an example.

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.540
First we will specify a development that will have a height width and background color.

12
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.530
Next we will use the hover selector to change the divs style when we hover over it lets increase the

13
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.450
height of the div when we hover over it with our cursor.

14
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.070
Then we will go to the web browser and write our code.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.820
If you hover over the green square with your mouse you will notice that the height instantly changes

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.590
from 200 pixels to 400 pixels.

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.770
But what if we wanted to change the height gradually we could use the transition property.

18
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.730
Let's jump back to the editor and see how we would implement this property by giving the transition

19
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.580
property values of height and 3 seconds we are telling it to transition any change to the height property

20
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.860
over a duration of three seconds.

21
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.930
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code.

22
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.520
Now if we hover over the Green Square there will be a smooth transition from a height of 200 pixels

23
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.800
to a height of 400 pixels.

24
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.210
Then we will go back to the editor.

25
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.220
We can also transition an object's color safe for instance we wanted to change the background color

26
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.200
of our object from green to red.

27
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.290
We could add a transition to the background color property.

28
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.650
Now we can add a new background color of red when the user hovers over the div..

29
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.770
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the background color transitions from green

30
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.710
to red over the specified period of three seconds.

31
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.230
Let's go back to the editor.

32
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.980
We can also transition multiple properties at once.

33
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.180
For example if we want to change the background color and height of our div when the user hovers over

34
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.010
it we need to putting the new height for when the user hovers over the square.

35
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.230
We also need to add this transition to the transition property to see the result of these changes.

36
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.580
Let's run our code in the browser as you can see the heightened background color gradually transitioned

37
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.430
over a period of three seconds when we hover over this square with our mouse.

38
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.090
Let's go back to the editor.

39
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.000
We can also specify a delay for our transition.

40
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.050
The delay is the amount of time that will pass before the transition is started.

41
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.820
We can add a delay to our transition using the transition delay property adding a transition delay of

42
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.950
1 second will delay our transition from starting until 1 second after we hover over our object.

43
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.540
Let's run our code as you can see there is a 1 second delay before the transition takes effect when

44
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.910
we hover over the element with our mouse.

45
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.170
Let's jump back to the editor

46
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.740
aside from the shorthand transition property there are also the transition property and transition duration

47
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.150
properties that we can use to specify the property and duration of the transition.

48
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.730
For example instead of specifying a transition of background color three seconds using the transition

49
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.220
property we can specify a transition property of background color and its transition duration of three

50
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.570
seconds the transition timing function property allows us to specify that each type or speed curve for

51
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.000
the transition a speed curves how the speed has changed as the animation plays.

52
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.610
Animations can start slow and then get faster move at a constant speed the whole time etc..

53
00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.440
The default value for this property is a value of ease where the transition will start slow speed up

54
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.700
and then end slow.

55
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.000
Let's run our code and see the transition timing function in action.

56
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.050
As you can see the transition starts slow speeds up and then ends swell.

57
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.590
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

58
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.560
If we want to have the transition maintain a constant speed the whole time we can assign this property

59
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.700
a value of linear.

60
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.540
Let's change the value of our transmission timing function property to linear and then run our code

61
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.290
when we mouseover the square.

62
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.450
You will notice that the transition maintains a constant speed.

63
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.070
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example of value of ease in means that the transition

64
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.630
will have a slow start.

65
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.040
Let's give our transition a timing function of ease in and then run our code in the browser as you can

66
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.400
see our transition starts out slow and then speeds up.

67
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.730
Thanks to our ease and timing function.

68
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.490
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

69
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.260
A value of ease out means that the transition will have a slow and let's give our transition timing

70
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.370
function property value of ease out and then run our code in the browser as you can see our transition

71
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.200
starts out fast and then slows down.

72
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.540
Thanks to our ease out timing function in the next lecture we were learn about the animation properties

73
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.270
that CSSA gives us access to.
