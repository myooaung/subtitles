00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,260
In this lecture we will learn about lists and HMO lists are an important way of displaying data.

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:17,920
There are three types of lists and HMO ordered lists unordered lists and description lists

3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,530
this tag is also paired with a closing tag in HVM mail list items are created using the ally tag.

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,790
Let's look at a basic example of using an ordered list.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,820
Say we want to create a grocery list and we wanted to buy apples oranges and pineapples to start our

6
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,260
list.

7
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,730
We would type an opening or well tag.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,760
Next we would create a list item element for apples like this we would follow suit for the next two

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,930
items on our list.

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,190
Oranges and pineapples.

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,490
Finally we would end the list by using a closing ordered list tag.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,020
Let's jump to the web browser and run this code

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,980
as you can see when rendered to the browser to the elements in our list are numbered by default.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,020
Let's go back to the editor.

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,000
There are several other options besides this default.

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,180
We can have ordered lists with letters both uppercase and lowercase and we can have lists with Roman

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,000
numerals both uppercase and lowercase.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,100
There is a type attribute associated with the ordered list tag that specifies which type of ordered

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,270
list we want to use.

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,950
If there is no type specified or the type is 1 then the list will be numbered with numbers 1 2 3 etc.

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:42,060
If we want to label our list with uppercase letters we would assign the type to a value of capital A.

22
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,960
Let's add the type attribute to our ordered list tag and set the value to capital A.

23
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,100
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

24
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,490
Now we can see our ordered list labeled with capital letters.

25
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:05,190
Now we will go back to the editor if we change the capital a to a lowercase say.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,590
And then when our code you can see that the list is now numbered with lower case letters.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,720
Let's jump back to the editor.

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,850
We can also label the items in our list with uppercase and lowercase Roman numerals.

29
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:24,000
If we change the type to a value of capital I and then run our code we will see our list labeled with

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
upper case roman numerals.

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,800
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

32
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,970
If we change the capitalized to a lowercase XY and run the code we will see our list labeled with lowercase

33
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,430
Roman numerals.

34
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,460
Now we will go back to the editor.

35
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,880
Another type of list and HDMI was an unordered list.

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,170
Each list element has a bullet point next to it.

37
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,050
Instead of a number or letter to create an unordered list you can use the UL tag.

38
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,030
Let's switch our list from an ordered list to an unordered list for an ordered list the type attribute

39
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:08,880
can have one of four values desk circle square and none the desk type displays the traditional fill

40
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,180
in bullet point that we are used to.

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,910
This is the default option if no type is specified the circle type is a hollow circle that isn't filled

42
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,000
in.

43
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,300
Let's set the type of unordered list to be circle.

44
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,430
Then we will go to the browser and run our code.

45
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,460
The square type sets the bullet point to a square shape.

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,940
Let's go back to the editor and change the type of unordered list to square.

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,620
Then we can go back to the browser and run the code to see the result of what we just did.

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,040
If we don't want any bullet marker next to the items in our list we can specify the type none.

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,820
Let's go back to the editor and change the type value to none for a list.

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,640
Then we will run the code in a web browser and see that there are no bullet markers next to the items

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,390
in our list.

52
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's jump back to the editor.

53
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,810
The third type of list that each team supports is a description list.

54
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:11,080
The best way to think of a description list is that it matches a term with a description or description

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,260
list is created using the DL tag.

56
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:22,320
Then we can use the DTD tag to add a term to our list underneath a term we can have one or more definitions.

57
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,950
These definitions can be specified using the DD tag.

58
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,800
Let's run our code in the browser to see the result of the HVM L we have written so far we can add as

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,280
many definitions as we want.

60
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,510
Underneath that term going back to the editor.

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,840
Let's add a second DD element to our term when we run the code in the editor.

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,900
We will see the second description added underneath our term.

63
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,160
Let's go back to the editor.

64
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,340
It is also possible for us to nest lists.

65
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,130
This gives us all kinds of combinations.

66
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,110
In summary each team will provide several options to create and customize lists including ordered lists

67
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:10,040
unordered lists description lists and the ability to nest lists within other lists regardless of their

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,640
type.

69
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,330
And the next lecture we will learn about tables in HMO.
