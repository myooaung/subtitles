00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.220
In this lecture we will learn about several properties that CSF gives us to modify the style and display

2
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.310
of our table.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.700
First we need to create an H-G M-L table that we can apply these styles to in order to see their effect.

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.420
We will start by adding opening and closing table tags to define our HVM table.

5
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.060
Next we will add in an opening and closing table row tag to add a row to our table.

6
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.440
Since this is the first row in our table we will use the table heading tag to add table headings for

7
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.380
the columns in our table.

8
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.800
We can then add another row to our table.

9
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.980
We will use the TDA tag to add cells to our table and we'll name our cells cell one cell 2 and cell

10
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.460
3 respectively.

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:56.160
We will add a third row to our table and add three more cells cell 4 cell 5 and cell 6 to see our table.

12
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.230
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

13
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.310
as you can see our three table rows are displayed on the web page.

14
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.660
Let's jump back to the editor.

15
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.080
Now that we have a table we can use some style properties to stylize it using the border property we

16
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.440
can add a border of a specified style with and color around each cell in our table and around the table

17
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.310
itself.

18
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.330
We will apply this style to the table so that there is a border around our table.

19
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.340
We will also apply this style to our table heading elements so that it is applied to each table heading.

20
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.540
Additionally we will apply this style to our table cells using the tag

21
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.800
then we will go to the web browser and run our code

22
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.800
noticed that currently the table has its border separate from the cell borders.

23
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.570
Let's jump back to the editor as we noted the table had its own border separate from the cell borders.

24
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.440
If this is not desirable we can use the border collapse property and give it a value of collapse.

25
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.510
We will assign this property to the table element.

26
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.820
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

27
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.290
Now you will notice that the table and cell borders are collapsed into one border.

28
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.990
Let's jump back to the editor.

29
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.120
We can give our table a width and height as pixel values or as percentages using the width and height

30
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.320
properties.

31
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.950
Let's give our table a width and height of 100 percent.

32
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.270
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

33
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.610
Let's jump back to the editor.

34
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.930
We can add a caption to our table using the caption tag.

35
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.710
Let's add an opening and closing caption tag and give our table a caption to see the caption we just

36
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.750
add it to the table.

37
00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.830
Let's go to the web browser and write our code as you can see the caption is displayed above the table.

38
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.450
Let's jump back to the editor.

39
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.260
CSSA gives us the caption side property which allows us to specify where to place the table caption

40
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.420
of value of top we'll put the caption at the top of the table.

41
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.910
Let's go to our style code and give our caption a caption side property with a value of top.

42
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.220
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

43
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.940
as you can see the captions at the top of our table.

44
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.720
The caption hasn't moved since the last example since Top is the default value of the caption side property.

45
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.750
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

46
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.270
Assigning the caption side property a value of bottom will put the caption at the bottom of our table.

47
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.480
Let's change the value of the caption side property to bottom.

48
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.000
Then we will run our code in the web browser to see the change take effect as you can see the caption

49
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.370
is now at the bottom of the table in the next lecture.

50
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.940
We will learn about table alignment and see SS.
