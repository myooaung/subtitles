1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,180
In this section we got hands on experience using the HVM skills we learned up to this point in the course.

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,680
The end result is this example Web site that we built we made a navigation menu that allows the user

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,470
to jump to the different parts of our website on the home page we created an image carousel that cycled

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,710
through the images using bootstraps code library on the About Us page we added image and text content

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,860
including using the paragraph tag image tag and the UL and ally tags to display a list of information.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,570
Then we created a menu for a Web site we used bootstrap cart elements to easily associate an Image title

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,200
text and button for each item on our menu.

8
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,810
We also added on click functionality to these buttons using the H team L on click attribute.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,650
Finally we created an H female form where the user could type in their email subject line and message

10
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,730
body.

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,650
Since making this form actually send an e-mail would require server side code using a language like

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,570
Ajax or ph P which is outside of the scope of this course.

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,860
We just made a simple javascript alert display with the information that the user typed in on submission

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,010
of the form.

15
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,920
Make sure that you save the code you wrote in this section you will need it later in the course when

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,980
we get hands on practice applying CSSA styles to our Web page to add cool features like aesthetics and

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,300
animation to it and the next section we will learn about X HMO.
