00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,450
In this lecture we will learn some cool ways that we can stylize our table if you want to highlight

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,220
a row in the table when you use your mouse over the row.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,110
You can use the hover selector.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,170
We will use the hover selector on our table rows and specify the background color to be yellow if the

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,810
mouse cursor is hovering over a row in our table to see this effect.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,980
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,070
when we hover over the rows in our table.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,710
You will notice that they turn yellow.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,430
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,340
We can also make our table striped by alternating the background color of the table rows using the end

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,780
trialed selector.

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,820
We can use that even and odd keywords with the nth child selector to specify that a style be applied

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,520
to each table row with an even or odd number.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,930
Let's take a look at how we could change the background color to blue of each odd row in the table.

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,490
First we specify t r to tell CSSA that we want this style to apply to our table row element.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,790
Then we specify the selector and pass in a value to the parentheses.

17
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,910
In this case we will specify the odd keyword.

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,930
Finally we will specify that we want to add a background color of blue to any table row that meets these

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,830
qualifications to complete our zebra striped defect.

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,260
We will add a color of aqua to all that even table rows.

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,520
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,430
You will notice that the odd rows in our table have a background color of blue and they even rows in

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,620
our table have a background color of Aqua.

24
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,740
Let's go back to the editor.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,830
We can also specify a role of a particular number using the nth child selector instead of passing in

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,490
the even or odd keywords.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,040
You can pass in a number of the role that you want to apply the style to if we want to stylize the first

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,280
row.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,130
For instance we could pass in the number one.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,140
We will put the number one inside of the parentheses and specify that the background color of the first

31
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,290
table roll be set to red.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,800
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

33
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,010
As you can see the background color of the first row in our table is red in the next lecture.

34
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,490
We will look at a recap of what we learned in this section.
