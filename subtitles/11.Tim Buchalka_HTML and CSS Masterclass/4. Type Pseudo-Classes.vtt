00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.650
In this lecture we will learn about pseudo classes based on an element type the pseudo classes we will

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.530
look at are first of type last of type and so tight and the last of type and only of type.

3
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.940
The first of type pseudo class will select the first element of a certain type.

4
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.410
For example let's add three paragraph elements to our Web page and add some example text to each of

5
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.080
them.

6
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.380
Then we will add an opening and closing style tag and use the first type pseudo class on the element

7
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.260
specifying that the first paragraph element should have the color of blue.

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.920
When we run the code we just wrote in the browser.

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.620
You will notice that the first paragraph element on our page example text 1 is displayed in blue.

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.580
This is because we used the first type pseudo class which found the first element on our Web page of

11
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.110
type paragraph and applied the specified style to it.

12
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.070
In this case changing its color to blue.

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.240
Let's jump back to the editor.

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.430
The last of type pseudo class selects the last element of the specified type to apply this style to

15
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.210
if we change our code to use the last of type pseudo class and run our code in the browser.

16
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.340
You will notice that the last paragraph element on our Web page example text 3 has the specified style

17
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.440
applied to it.

18
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.460
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example

19
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.050
the nth of type pseudo class allows us to specify which child to apply a style to.

20
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.860
For example if we change our example code to use and of type and specify an end value of 2 then the

21
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.720
second paragraph element on our Web page will have the style applied to it.

22
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.410
Let's run our code in the web browser.

23
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.240
Now you will notice that the second paragraph element on our Web page is blue.

24
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.900
Let's jump back to the editor

25
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.420
the last of type pseudo class is very similar to the end of type pseudo class and that it selects the

26
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.610
element based on the number.

27
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.810
And we provide.

28
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.670
Except that it starts counting at the last element.

29
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.330
So if we were to specify the last of type 1 for example the third element would be selected since it

30
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.440
is the last paragraph element on our Web page when we run the code in the web browser.

31
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.680
You will notice that the third element example text 3 is displayed in blue.

32
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.310
Then we will go back to the editor

33
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.800
the only type pseudo class selects any elements of the provided type that are the only child elements

34
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800
of that type within their parent.

35
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.690
If there are more than one of that type of child in the parent those elements will not be selected.

36
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.300
In our example if we change our code to use the only type pseudo class and run our code in the browser

37
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.500
we will notice that none of the paragraph elements have the blue color applied to them.

38
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.240
This is because they are all children of the same element.

39
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.820
So none of them is the only child and the paragraph type in the next lecture we will learn about the

40
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.850
pseudo classes CSSA gives us that apply to an element based on what child it is and its parent.
