00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,050
In this lecture we will learn about the background properties that CSSA allows us to animate.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,910
We can animate and element's background background color background position and background size.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,090
Let's look at an example of how we can animate the background color property we will create a development

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,790
that we will apply our styles and animation to then we will add or opening and closing style tags that

5
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,410
we will add our style code between lets add some style to our div.

6
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,010
We will add a width and height of 500 pixels to our div.

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,700
We will also give our div a background color of red to start out for animation property we will specify

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:49,000
our animation to be rainbow and in an animation that we will create the delay for animation will be

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,580
set to five seconds and we will also add the infinite keyword to make the animation run on a loop.

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,750
We will also add an animation delay of point seven five seconds.

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,030
Now we will write the code for our animation we will add that keyframes rule and add an animation name

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,490
of rainbow and we will create an animation that will cycle through the colors of the rainbow.

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:19,030
We will set the background colors red orange yellow green blue indigo violet and purple at keyframes

14
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:30,990
of 0 percent 15 percent 30 percent 45 percent 60 percent 75 percent 90 percent and 100 percent respectively.

15
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,590
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our divs background color cycles

16
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,840
through the colors of the rainbow.

17
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,200
Let's jump back to the editor

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,860
Next let's look at an example of how we can animate the background position property.

19
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,600
First we will add a development to our Web page then we will add our opening and closing style tags

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,390
so that we can write our style code for this animation.

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,780
We will assign some styles to our div.

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,370
We will give our div a width of 500 pixels and a height of 500 pixels.

23
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,420
Then we will assign our give a background image of our star PLG image.

24
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:17,150
The initial background position of our div will be top left in our animation code we write in a second.

25
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,990
We will make our background position change from top left to bottom right.

26
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,170
To move our image from one position to another we really add an animation property and specify our animation

27
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:34,330
name as move B.G. give it a duration of three seconds and specify a loop behavior of infinite.

28
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,990
Next we will use the CSSA at keyframes rule and write the code for animation.

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,110
We will specify that at keyframe 100 percent.

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,730
The last keyframe the background position of our div will be bottom right.

31
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,820
It is also important to note that the animation name needs to be moved Biji the same name as we specified

32
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,760
as the animation for div in the above style code.

33
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,320
When we run our code in the browser you will see that the images background position animation from

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,500
top left to bottom right.

35
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,270
Let's jump back to the editor.

36
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,970
We will alter the code from the previous example so that we can see how to animate the background size

37
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,230
property in order to do this.

38
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,280
We just need to make a few changes to our current code.

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,060
First we will change the background position property to be background size.

40
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,780
For this example we will give our div a background size of 30 pixels by 30 pixels.

41
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,310
Then we will go to our animation code and change our code to animate the background Size property to

42
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,740
60 pixels by 60 pixels.

43
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,070
When we run our code you will see that the background size animation 30 pixels by 30 pixels to 60 pixels

44
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,780
by 60 pixels.

45
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,510
Those are examples of how we can animate and elements background properties and see SS.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,590
Don't forget that we can also add to meet the shorthand and background property which lets us specify

47
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,280
the color position and size of our background.

48
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,150
All in one in the next lecture we will learn how we can animate the height and width properties.
