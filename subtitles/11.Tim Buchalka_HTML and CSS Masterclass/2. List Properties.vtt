00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.200
In this lecture we will learn about CSSA properties that allow us to modify the style or type of an

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.960
HDMI.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.480
Let's first let's create an team a list that we will use to see these example list styles applied to.

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
We will create an unworded list with three list elements then we will jump to the web browser and run

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.530
our code.

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
We should see an unordered list displayed with three list items.

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.450
Let's jump back to the editor the list style type.

8
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.880
Property allows us to specify the type of marker used for the items in our list an unordered list can

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.950
have a list style type of disc circle square or none of value of disk for the list style type property

10
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.540
is the default and results in the list items having filled in bullet points next to them.

11
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's say at an opening and closing style tag to our code specify the style to apply to the unordered

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.230
list elements and give our list a list style type value of deaths.

13
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.240
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

14
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.500
then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

15
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.040
If we give our unordered list a list style type of circle it will make the bullet points hollow circles.

16
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.180
Let's change this property's value to a circle and go to the web browser to run our code as you can

17
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.970
see there are hollow circles next to our list elements.

18
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.250
Now let's jump back to the editor.

19
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.160
If we give our an ordered list the list style type of square it will make the bullet point Square we

20
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.270
will change the list style type property to a value of square and then when our code in the web browser

21
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.270
as you can see the list items are now marked by squares next to each of them.

22
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.620
Let's go back to the editor of value of None will make there be no bullet points next to the items in

23
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.270
our list.

24
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.740
Let's change the list style type of our list to none and then jumped to the web browser.

25
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.370
When we run our code you will notice that our list items don't have markers next to them.

26
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.210
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

27
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.410
Let's change the UL tags in our example list to all tags to change the unordered list to an ordered

28
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.930
list.

29
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.720
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our list items are now numbered since

30
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.060
we changed our list from an unwanted list to an ordered list.

31
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.840
Then we will go back to the editor.

32
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.980
There are several list style types that we can specify for ordered lists assigning the list style type

33
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.140
property value of decimal number of the items in the list.

34
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.420
When we go to the web browser and run the code you will notice that the items are numbered the same

35
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.890
way they were when we didn't specify a value of decimal for the list style type.

36
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.700
Decimal is the default value for the list style type property.

37
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.410
If you are working with an ordered list then we will go back to the editor and look at another example

38
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.200
assigning the list style type property value of decimal leading 0 will number the items in the list

39
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.560
with an additional zero in front of the number.

40
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.940
Let's change the list style type value of our list to decimal leading zero and go to the web browser

41
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.990
to run our code.

42
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.340
Then we will jump back to the editor giving a value of lower alpha to the list style type property will

43
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.000
add lower case letters next to each item in the list.

44
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.370
Let's give our list style type property a value of lower alpha and then go to the web browser to run

45
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.020
our code then we will jump back to the editor giving a value of upper alpha to the list style type property

46
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.830
we'll add uppercase letters next to each item in our list.

47
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.880
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see there are now uppercase letters next to

48
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.880
each item in our list.

49
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.410
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example giving a value of lower Rollman to the

50
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.210
list style type property will add lowercase Roman numerals next to each item in our list.

51
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.130
We will change the value of the list style type property to lower Rollman and then run our code in the

52
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.750
web browser

53
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.730
then we will go back to the editor a value of upper Rollman for the list style type property will add

54
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.550
upper case roman numerals next to each item in our list.

55
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.990
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our list items now of upper case roman numerals

56
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.620
as item markers next to them.

57
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.230
Let's jump back to the editor.

58
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.480
Let's change our example list back to an unordered list.

59
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.600
Another property supported by unworded lists is the list style image property.

60
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.280
This property lets us use an image next to our items as opposed to bullet points.

61
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.870
For this example we will add the storm PMG image as the list style image of our left.

62
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.150
Then we will go to the web browser and when our code

63
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.540
but then we will jump back to the editor the list style position property allows us to specify whether

64
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.610
we want the bullet point to be inside or outside of the list item assigning the list style position

65
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.860
property value of inside we'll put the bullet points inside of the list items then we will run our code

66
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.390
in a web browser.

67
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.570
Let's jump back to the editor of value of outside will put the bullet points outside the list elements

68
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.430
we will change the list style position of our list to outside and then go to the web browser to run

69
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.940
our code

70
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.180
then we will jump back to the editor.

71
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.070
Additionally CSSA gives us the list style property which we can use to specify the list style type list

72
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.560
style position and list style image all in one.

73
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.720
Let's say had this property to our list and then go back to the web browser to run our code

74
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.240
in the next lecture we will learn about how we can use CSSA to color our list.
