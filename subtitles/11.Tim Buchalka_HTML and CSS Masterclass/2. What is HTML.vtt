00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.970
In this lecture we learn about what each team is the history behind it and its relevance to web development.

2
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.970
Each team has an acronym that stands for hypertext markup language.

3
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.560
It defines the content of web pages H.T. Melas built in symbol's elements and attributes that allow

4
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.270
us to write code that communicates with the web browser.

5
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.410
Regarding the content and structure of web pages there are several versions of HVM L..

6
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:40.080
The latest version is HVM L5 which was released in 2004 in the HDMI language dates back to 1991 when

7
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.860
the first version of HVM L was released in the software industry.

8
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.270
HDMI is used mainly in web design and development web browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox read

9
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
HVM documents and then display them to the user.

10
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.120
Here is a look at the example Web site.

11
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.610
We will build using HMO later in the course and the code that is allowing the content to be rendered

12
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.030
in the web browser.

13
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.700
One exciting aspect of each team is that it gives us several building blocks to communicate with web

14
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.660
browsers and build interactive web pages and web apps.

15
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:20.880
Some things HVM allows us to do or display images create responsive buttons display text and data and

16
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.220
embed media into web pages.

17
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.130
Languages like HVM l require that you follow a specific syntax or grammatical structure and rules of

18
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.560
a language.

19
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.760
This section will take you through the structure of H.T. most fundamental concepts step by step and

20
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.440
assumes no prior knowledge of HMO.

21
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.880
By learning H-G male syntax and the variety of programming constructs it gives us access to you can

22
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.000
unlock the true potential of HVM L and build great web content in the next lecture we will learn about

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.310
tags and HMO.
