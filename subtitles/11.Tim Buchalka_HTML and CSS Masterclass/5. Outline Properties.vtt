00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.780
In this lecture we will learn about several properties that CSSA gives us to style outlines.

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.230
An outline is completely outside of an element and doesn't contribute to the elements with or height

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.520
the outline style properties specified the style of our outline.

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.400
To see these examples First we will add a paragraph element to our Web page with some example text then

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.610
we will get an opening and closing style tag to our code.

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.410
Assigning this property a value of solid gives our element a solid outline.

7
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.690
Let's say the outline style property to our element and give it a value of solid.

8
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.310
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our paragraph element now is a solid

9
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.590
outline around it.

10
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.350
Let's jump back to the editor of value of double will give our elements a double outline around it.

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.470
Let's change the outline style to double and then run our code in the browser to see the effect of this

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.640
change as you can see our element now is a double outline around it.

13
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.710
Let's go back to the editor of value of Dasht will make the outline dasht.

14
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.130
Let's give our elements an outline style of Dasht and then run our code as you can see the outline around

15
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.680
our element is now dashed.

16
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.060
Let's go back to the editor.

17
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.030
We can also assign the outline style property value of dotted to add a dotted outline around our element.

18
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.830
We will change the outline style to dot it and then run our code in the browser.

19
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.190
You will notice that the outline around our paragraph element is now dotted.

20
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.080
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

21
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.480
There are also several three-D styles that we can add to our outline such as groove Ridge inset and

22
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.170
outset in order to display these effects.

23
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.920
We also need to give our outline a color using the outline color property lets use the outline color

24
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.450
property and give our outline a color blue.

25
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.660
We will also use the outline with property and give our outline with the 5 pixels to make the 3D effects

26
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.970
easier to see.

27
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.070
A value of group gives our element a grooved outline.

28
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.210
We will give our outline style a value of groove and then run our code in the web browser.

29
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.230
As you can see there is now a 3D groove effect on our outline.

30
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.170
Let's go back to the editor assigning the outline style property value of Ridge gives our element a

31
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.490
rigid outline.

32
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.450
Let's change the outline Starla ridge and then run our code in the browser.

33
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.850
Then we will jump back to the editor of value of inset gives our element in inset outline we will give

34
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.170
our outline style property of value of inset and then run our code in the browser.

35
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.140
As you can see the outline is now set.

36
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.390
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example of value of outset gives our element in outset

37
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.190
outline.

38
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.850
Let's change the value of the outline style property to outset and then run our code in the web browser.

39
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.440
As you can see the outline is now outset.

40
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.630
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

41
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.300
The outline with property specifies a thickness for the outline as we have seen.

42
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.270
Aside from a custom pixel value we can assign the outline with property of value a thin medium or thick

43
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.430
for the following examples we will get rid of the current style code and give our outline style a value

44
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.680
of solid an outline with value.

45
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.990
Then we'll make our outline then let's give our outline an outline with value then and then run our

46
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.420
code in the browser as you can see the outline around our elementis.

47
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.140
Then let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

48
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.390
An outline with value of medium will make our outline medium thickness.

49
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.260
Let's give our outline an outline with value of medium and then run our code in the browser as you can

50
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.860
see the outline around our element is medium thickness.

51
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.740
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

52
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.500
An outline with thick will make our outline thick.

53
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.070
Let's give our outline an outline with values and then run our code in the browser as you can see the

54
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.750
outline around our element is thick.

55
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.720
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

56
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.810
We can use the outline offset property to add space between the edges of the element and the outline.

57
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.520
Let's build all of our current code and give our outline an outline offset of 7 pixels.

58
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.710
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see there is 7 pixels of space between

59
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.830
our element content and the outline.

60
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.050
Let's jump back to the editor CSSA also gives us the outline property which is one property which we

61
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.760
can use to specify the outline style outline color and outline width.

62
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.260
Let's get rid of the other style code we have and then use the outline property to give our outline

63
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.940
with the 5 pixels a style of solid and a color of red.

64
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.680
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see.

65
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.110
There is now a 5 pixel solid red outline around our element in the next lecture.

66
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.500
We will learn about the positioning properties that CSSA gives us access to.
