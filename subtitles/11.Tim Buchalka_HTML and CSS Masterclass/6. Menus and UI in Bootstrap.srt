00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,940
In this lecture we will learn about creating a dropdown menu and nav bar using bootstrap.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,400
Let's look at how we can create a dropdown menu using bootstrap.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,830
First we will have the customary bootstrap container to a web page by adding a div and assigning it

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,400
a class value of container to create a dropdown menu.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,110
First we add a development to our Web page and use the bootstrap dropdown class as its class value.

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,550
Then we add a button that will be used to open the dropdown menu.

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,500
We will give it classes of Button button primary and dropdown toggle.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,870
We will also assign the type attribute with a value of button and the data toggle attribute with a value

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,900
of dropdown or label for the menu will be options.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,530
We will then add a span with a class value of.

11
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,690
This related downward pointing arrow next to the title of our menu.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,760
Then we will build the actual dropdown menu.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,280
We will do this using bootstraps dropdown menu class which we will apply to our dropdown item list.

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,760
Our list will be an unordered list.

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,660
Each of the links will have a placeholder value of the pound symbol we will label the options of the

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,680
dropdown menu option 1 through Option 4.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,680
There is one more thing we need to do in order to see the effect of this example.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,190
We need to change our bootstrap imports to Version 3 3.7.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,900
Let's change the bootstrap CSSA and Javascript imports from Version 4 dot 1.0 to Version 3 dot 3.7.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,050
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

21
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,280
Now if we click the dropdown button you will notice that the dropdown menu opens and shows the options

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,190
that we specified in the code.

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,220
Then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

24
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,160
Next we will create a nav bar for our web page.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,210
We will start by adding a nav element to our Web page and assigning it class values of nav bar and nav

26
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,250
bar default.

27
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,710
After that we will add a div with a class value of container fluid.

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,640
Then we will create an unworded list with class values of NAV and nav bar nav.

29
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,600
We will add three less items each of which will have a class value of NAV item.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,810
Each of these list item elements will have a child anchor element the anchor elements will have a class

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,300
value of NAV link and a placeholder Atra value of the pound symbol.

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,240
The links will be labeled link one link to and link 3 respectively.

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,960
Then let's go to the web browser and run our code to see the result of the code that we typed as you

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,750
can see our NAV bar with our links is displayed on the web page.

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,790
In the next lecture we will learn how we can work with images and bootstrap.
