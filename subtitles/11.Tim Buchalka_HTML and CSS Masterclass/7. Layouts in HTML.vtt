00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.870
In this lecture we will learn about layouts an HMO m HDMI has a group of elements known as lay out elements

2
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.900
that are used for displaying multiple columns of content in a web browser similar to what we looked

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.940
at in our tables lecture with headers and footers.

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.930
We can also give a web page layout a header and footer the header tag allows us to give a header to

5
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.930
our layout.

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.400
We will start with an opening header tag.

7
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.770
Then we will specify the H one heading tag.

8
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.970
Then the text for the header followed by a closing H-1 tag and finally a closing header tag.

9
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.900
Let's go to the web browser and run this code to see the header We just added to the web page

10
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.130
then we will go back to the editor the footer tag allows us to give a footer to our layout.

11
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.260
We will add an opening footer tag the text for our footer and then a closing footer tag.

12
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.550
Let's go back to the web browser and drag our team else file over to run our code.

13
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.120
Now we will go back to the editor and look at another example we can group our links using nav tag which

14
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.200
serves as a container for our navigation links.

15
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.630
We will start out with an opening nav tag followed by anchor elements and then a closing tag.

16
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.680
In this case I will add three anchor elements one that links to Google one that links to Yahoo and one

17
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680
that links to ask dot com.

18
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.930
We separate these anchor tags with the oar symbol which is the vertical line character.

19
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.150
Once we have typed all the code for this example we all go to the browser and run our HMO.

20
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:57.910
We can click on the links and they will point to the Web sites that we specified.

21
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.750
Let's jump back to the editor.

22
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.030
This tag is best to use in our lay out around a large block of links.

23
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.770
We don't need to put all of our links inside of our NAV element.

24
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.450
We can use the section tag to add a section to our lay out this tag is convenient for grouping sections

25
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.750
of content on our Web page for this example.

26
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.470
We will add an opening section tag followed by an H2 element a paragraph element and then a closing

27
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.880
section tag.

28
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.430
Once we have typed this code we will go to the browser and we're on it we can see our heading and content

29
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.960
that we grouped together using the section tag displayed on our Web page.

30
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.260
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

31
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.160
The article tag is used for standalone content in our layout to know when to use the article tag.

32
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.130
Think about online articles.

33
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.830
If your content is a news snippet comment or blog post you will want to use this tag to surround your

34
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.730
content.

35
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.390
Use this tag when you have content that relates to your layouts main content but that you want to be

36
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.910
in its own container relative to the rest of your layout.

37
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.280
We will start with an opening article tag then and each 3 element followed by a paragraph element and

38
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.750
finally a closing article tag.

39
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.400
Then we will go to the web browser and run the code to see the result of what we just typed.

40
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.420
After that let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

41
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.170
Deicide tag allows us to add some content.

42
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.250
Aside from the main content of our layout you can use this to add a sidebar of related content to your

43
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.990
main content.

44
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.240
For this example we will start with an opening a side tag followed by an H for heading element.

45
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.370
Then a paragraph element for our side content and finally a closing aside tag.

46
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.860
Now we will go to the browser and write our code.

47
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.510
Let's go back to the editor.

48
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.640
The details tag allows us to specify additional details for our HDMI layout when used in addition to

49
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.990
the summary tag.

50
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.370
We can add the ability to show or hide the detail by clicking on a specified element.

51
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.310
Let's look at an example.

52
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.300
First we will put opening and closing details tags in our HDMI layout.

53
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.760
Next we will add an opening and closing summary tag any content we put inside of our summary element

54
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.000
will be the content that we can click on to show or hide the details.

55
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.780
Let's add a paragraph element with some text in it as our details to show and hide then we will go to

56
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.700
the web browser and run our code.

57
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.920
As you can see the result is that we can click on the summary element to show or hide the details.

58
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.090
We added to our layout

59
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.170
then we will jump back over to the editor.

60
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.470
Of course each of the layout elements that we cover in this lecture can be stylized independently using

61
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.640
the style tag and specifying the name of the layout element we want to apply certain styles to.

62
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.940
Let's take a look at an example to stylize the summary element we just added to our code a moment ago.

63
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.930
We can do the following.

64
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.910
We will add an opening style tag and then specify the summary element.

65
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.250
Then we will add an opening curly brace.

66
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.470
Specify the color property as green and then add a closing curly brace.

67
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.540
Finally we will add a closing style tag.

68
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.450
Then we will go to the web browser and drag the HVM file over to run our code.

69
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.760
In the next lecture we will learn about divs and spans in each team.
