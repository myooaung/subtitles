00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,810
In this lecture we will learn about the font properties that CSSA allows us to animate.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:18,030
We can animate the font font size font size it just font stretch and font weight properties first lets

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,870
add some text to weaken animi.

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,230
We also need to add an opening and closing style tag to our page so that we can embed the CSSA needed

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,380
for the style and animation to be applied to our text.

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,900
Next we will specify styles that will be applied to the text in our paragraph tag the font size will

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,340
be three VW.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,820
We will also specify the animation with the name of scale text a duration of 10 seconds and use the

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,490
infinite keyword to make the animation loop.

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,460
Next we will write the code for our animation we will give our animation a name of scale tax rules specify

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,800
that the text will go from a font size of 1 VW to a font size of 5 VW.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,810
When we run our code we will see our text scale from 1 VW to 5 VW

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,780
in the next lecture we will learn about the border properties that CSSA allows us to animi.
