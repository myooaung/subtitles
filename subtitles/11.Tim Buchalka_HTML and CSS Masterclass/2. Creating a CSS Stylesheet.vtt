00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.550
In this lecture we will learn about creating a CSSA style sheet.

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:15.230
CSSA stands for cascading style sheets and controls how each team out elements are styled CSSA is used

3
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.010
alongside HVM Lwin doing web programming.

4
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.620
You have already been exposed to CSSA styling.

5
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.870
When we use the style tag in each team.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.240
However using the style tag and adding all of your style code may not scale up well as your web program

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.580
grows in size and complexity.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.620
It is generally considered best practice to create a CSSA style sheet as a separate file for me.

9
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.250
H t m l code that you then link up to your G-mail code.

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.840
Let's say we have the following.

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.350
HVM I'll document the file extension for an HDMI file as Dot.

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.510
Each Chmela dot HVM if we want to create a CSSA file it will have the dot CSSA file extension.

13
00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.820
Let's create a new CSSA file and add some code to Starla or to text element.

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.820
Note that we use the IDs of the elements to identify which elements to apply the styles to.

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.620
However since R H T M L and C Ss files are separate we need a way to link them.

16
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.490
We can go to our HQ mail file and add the link element in the head section of our each team document

17
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.610
to link the two together.

18
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.840
Though Rella attributes specifies the relationship between this HVM file and the file it is being linked

19
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.120
to when we are linking an HP mail file to a CSL style sheet.

20
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.830
We assign the Rella attribute a value of style sheet the type attribute specifies the media type of

21
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.230
the file you are linking to the HVM file when linking a CSSA style sheet to our each team file.

22
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.880
We assign this attribute a value of text forward slash SS The ATF attribute specifies the file that

23
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.220
we want to link.

24
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.140
It involves the local file path of a clickable the name of our CSSA file and the DOT CSSA file extension.

25
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.290
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the color of the first text element is blue

26
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.220
and the color of the second text element is green and the next lecture.

27
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.710
We will compare and contrast.

28
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.370
Importing a CSSA style sheet vs using this style tag.
