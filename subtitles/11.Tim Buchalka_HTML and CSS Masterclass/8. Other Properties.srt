1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,800
In this lecture we will look at other cool properties that each female gives us access to.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,010
First let's look at the CSA as cursor property which allows us to change the appearance of the mouse

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,830
cursor when we mouse over an element assigning the cursor property of value of pointer turns the cursor

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,870
into a hand.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,990
First let's create a paragraph element and give it some text.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,900
Then we will add an opening and closing style tag to our code.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,280
We will use the cursor property and give it a value of pointer.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,450
This will change the mouse cursor into a hand when the user mouse is over the paragraph element.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,810
Let's go to the web browser and write our code

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,340
when we mouse over the text on our Web page.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,860
You will notice that the cursor turns into a hand.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:56,430
Let's jump back to the editor assigning the cursor property of value of cross-hair turns the cursor

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,520
into a cross-hair when the user mouse is over an element.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,450
Let's give our cursor property a value of crosshair and then go to the web browser and run our code

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,130
when we mouseover our text.

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,710
You will notice that the cursor turns into a crosshair.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,180
Let's go back to the editor of value of zoomin will turn the cursor into his zoomin icon a magnifying

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,760
glass with a plus sign.

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,370
Let's give the Kershner property a value of zoom in and then run our code in the browser as you can

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,550
see when we mouseover our element.

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,150
The cursor turns into the zoomin icon.

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,740
Let's jump back to the editor.

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,770
A value of zoom out will turn the cursor into a zoom out icon a magnifying glass with a minus sign.

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,780
Let's change our code to use the zoom out value for the cursor property and run our code as you can

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,340
see when we mouseover text the cursor turns into the zoom out icon.

26
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:58,110
Let's jump back to the editor assigning the cursor property of value of GRABBE will turn the cursor

27
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,670
into the way it looks and you mouseover text on most web pages a vertical bar in the middle of the icon

28
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,620
and a short horizontal bar at the top and bottom.

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,100
Let's change the cursor value to grab.

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,360
Then we will run our code in the web browser.

31
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,970
As you can see our cursor turns into the grab icon when you mouse over the text on our Web page.

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,940
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

33
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,140
A value of help will display a question mark next to our cursor.

34
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's change the cursor value to help and run our code as you can see when we mouseover the text the

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,630
question mark appears next to the cursor.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,410
Let's jump back to the editor assigning the cursor property value of wait we'll turn the cursor into

37
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,060
a wait icon usually in the form of a spinning wheel.

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,930
Let's change the cursor value to a wait and then run our code in the browser as you can see when we

39
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,060
mouse over the text cursor turns into a spinning progress wheel we'll then we will go back to the editor

40
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,890
and look at another example.

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,780
A value of not allowed we'll turn our cursor into a cross-out symbol we will change the cursor value

42
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,580
to not allowed and then run our code.

43
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,250
When we mouseover the text or cursor changes into a cross-out symbol.

44
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,380
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

45
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,570
A value of auto will allow the browser to decide what type of cursor to display based on what element

46
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,740
you are hovering over.

47
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,360
We will change our cursor value to auto and then run our code as you can see when we mouse over our

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,130
text.

49
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,980
It turns into the grab icon then we will jump back to the editor.

50
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,440
We can also assign our cursor an image by passing in the file name as a value.

51
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,730
If you use a custom image you also need to specify a fallback cursor to be displayed in case the image

52
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,260
doesn't load.

53
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,230
Let's give the cursor property value of our cursor P and G image which is a red dot.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,360
We will also specify the Fulbeck cursor to be auto.

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,260
We will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see when we mouseover our text the cursor

56
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,530
turns into our custom image.

57
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,810
There may be a time when you want to control what portion of text the user can select to copy and paste.

58
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,490
You can use the user select property to control whether or not the user can select and elements text

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,160
assigning this property of value of text allows the user to select the text.

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,600
Let's use the user select property and give it a value of text.

61
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,070
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see we can select and copy the text.

62
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,610
Let's jump back to the editor assigning this property of value of None prevents the user from selecting

63
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,510
the text.

64
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,920
Let's change the user select value to none and then run our code in the browser.

65
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,540
As you can see we cannot select and copy the text in the next lecture we will look at a recap of what

66
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,400
we learned in this section of the course.
