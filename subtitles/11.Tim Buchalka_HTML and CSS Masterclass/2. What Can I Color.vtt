00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.520
In this lecture we will learn about the different elements that we can apply color to using CSX as we

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.980
have seen in other lectures we can apply a color to our text elements to change the color of text we

3
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.200
use the color property let's say in a paragraph element to our Web page and give it some example text

4
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.010
then we will get an opening and closing style tag to our Web page.

5
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.130
We will add the color property to our style code and give it a value of red.

6
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.030
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the example text is read on our Web page.

7
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.730
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

8
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.710
Each element also has a background in the shape of a box that we can apply a color to to apply color

9
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.200
to an element background.

10
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.700
We use the background color property we will build off of the last example and give our text a background

11
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.750
color of black.

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.050
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code to see the result.

13
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.990
We now have red text on a black background.

14
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.550
Let's jump back to the editor.

15
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.340
You can add a border around every HVM element.

16
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.290
The border color property lets us control the color of an element border.

17
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.170
Let's use the border property and give our paragraph element the 10 pixel solid border.

18
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.840
We will then use the border color property and give our border a color of blue then we will go to the

19
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.270
web browser and run our code

20
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.000
as you can see there is a 10 pixel blue border around our paragraph element.

21
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.620
Let's go back to the editor.

22
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.470
We can also specify only specific sides of the border to apply the color to using the border top color

23
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.520
border right color border bottom color and border left color properties using the border top color property

24
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.440
allows us to specify a color to add to the top edge of our border.

25
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.780
We will change the border property to the border Top property.

26
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.970
Let's get rid of the border color property we added for the last example and give the element a border

27
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.710
top color property with a value of red.

28
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.590
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see there is a 10 pixel red border at

29
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.870
the top of our element.

30
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.370
Let's go back to the editor using the border right color property allows us to specify a color to add

31
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.910
to the right edge of our border.

32
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.550
We will change the border Top property to the border right property.

33
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.510
Let's then use the border right color property to give our element the right border of green.

34
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.180
We will run our code into web browser to see the result.

35
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.060
There is now a green border on the right of our element.

36
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.710
Let's go back to the editor using the border bottom color property allows us to specify a color to add

37
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.620
to the bottom edge of our border.

38
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.800
Let's change the border.

39
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.120
Right.

40
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.400
Property to the border bottom property.

41
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.000
We will give our element the bottom border color of blue and then run our code in the browser

42
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.810
as you can see there is a blue border on the bottom of our element.

43
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.010
Let's go back to the editor

44
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.140
using the border left color property allows us to specify a color to add to the left edge of our border.

45
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.630
Let's change the border bottom property to the border left property.

46
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.880
We will assign our element the left border color of orange then we will run our code in the web browser

47
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.240
as you can see there is now an orange border on the left side of our element.

48
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.750
Let's jump back to the editor we can also add color to columns using the column rule color property.

49
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.260
For this example let's add a paragraph element to our webpage.

50
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.300
We need to make sure that we had enough text between the opening and closing paragraph tags so that

51
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.150
we can see this change take effect.

52
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.290
After that we will get an opening and closing style tag to our code.

53
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.930
We will use the paragraph element selector and give our text to column count of two to split it into

54
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.960
two columns a column rule style of solid and a column rule color of red.

55
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.360
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code to see the result.

56
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.270
There is now a read column rule between the two columns of text.

57
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:26.390
Let's go back to the editor the carrot of an input field can also be assigned a custom color to do so.

58
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.390
We can use the CSSA carat color property.

59
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.400
Let's create an input element.

60
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.050
Then we will go to the style code and specify that our input elements should have a carrot color of

61
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.720
red using the carrot color property.

62
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.020
Let's go to the web browser and run our code

63
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.950
as you can see when we click into the input field.

64
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.110
The carrot is the color red and there you have it as a sync.

65
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.910
Look at some of the elements we can color using see SS in the next lecture we will learn about specifying

66
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.350
colors using C Ss.
