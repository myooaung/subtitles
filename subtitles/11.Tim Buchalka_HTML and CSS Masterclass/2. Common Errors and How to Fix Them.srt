00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,910
In this lecture we will look at common CSSA areas and how to fix them.

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,250
One common CSSA error is missing a semi-colon between declarations.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,110
It is important that we had a semi-colon between each declaration in order to ensure that our CSSA code

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,280
works properly.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,730
To fix this error we can find where the semi-colon is missing and added another common CSSA error is

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,160
having an invalid declaration in the code.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,500
It is important that the properties and values we use in our declaration are valid CSSA properties and

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,630
values.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,640
If you have a property name or value is invalid or not recognized by CSX it will have no effect on the

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,690
element to fix an invalid declaration.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,440
Find which part of the declaration is invalid and change it to make the declaration valid.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,730
Another error you may encounter in CSX is an invalid selector since selectors control what element certain

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,320
styles are applied to.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,550
It is very important that we make sure the selectors we are using in our code are valid.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,650
If a selector is invalid none of the elements it is supposed to apply this style tool have the styles

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,790
applied to them.

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,380
Essentially the whole block of styles for this selector will not be applied to the HDMI element.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,610
To fix an invalid selector error find the Selected of an invalid and change it to a valid selector.

19
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,630
The areas that we learned about in this video are just some of the errors that you will run into when

20
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,320
writing CSSA code.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,590
However this gives you a good starting point of things to look out for when you are programming in the

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,930
next lecture we will learn about using a CSSA validator to debug or CSSA code.
