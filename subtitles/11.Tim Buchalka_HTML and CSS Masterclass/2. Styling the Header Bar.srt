00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,610
In this lecture we will stylize the hetter bar of our website.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,220
First we relate a background color and border to our nav bar.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,410
We will wrap our NAV element in a div that we will add these styles to.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,920
We will then add a white background color to our div then we will add a solid border of three pixels

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,850
with a color of all our G-B 190 0 0.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,780
Now that our links are on a white background we can make our links black.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,230
We will use the link selector and specify that the unclick links on our page will be displayed black.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,280
Next we will use the visited select and specify that any visited links on our web page should be displayed

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,140
to our G-B color 16 27 27.

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,320
We will then use the hover selected a change the color of a link when we hover over it.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,870
We will specify the color to be R.G. be 170 0 0 0.

12
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:00,170
Finally let's change the color of a link when it is active or currently being clicked on by the user.

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:07,970
To do this we will use the active selector and give our linker color value of R G B 2 or 7 to 2 when

14
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,770
we run our code in the web browser.

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,580
You will see that the color of our links change when we hover over and click on the links

16
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,930
in the next lecture.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,030
We will Starlight's the home page of our website.
