00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,890
In this lecture we learn about some basic text effects that we can apply to text elements using see

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:16,910
SS CSSA provides us the text chattel property which allows us to add shadow behind our text for this

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,220
example we will add a paragraph element with some example text then we will add an opening and closing

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,920
style tag when using the text Chatto property.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,360
There are two values that are required.

6
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,440
The first is the horizontal position of the shadow.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,180
The second is the vertical position of the shadow.

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,320
Let's give our Chatto a horizontal position and vertical position of two pixels.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,590
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,160
If we use a positive value for the horizontal position our shadow will be placed to the right of the

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,980
text.

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,950
As you can see there is now a text Chatto behind our text.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,200
Let's go back to the editor.

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,660
If we use a negative value for the horizontal position our shadow will be positioned to the left of

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,850
our text.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,870
Let's change the horizontal position of our text chattered in negative to and then run our code in the

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,630
web browser.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,580
Note that the shadow is now behind our text to the left.

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,930
Let's jump back to the editor.

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,970
If we use a value of 0 for the horizontal position the shadow will align horizontally exactly with our

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,810
text.

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:33,220
Let's change the horizontal position of our text chatter to 0 pixels and then run our code as you can

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,600
see the shadow is now exactly vertically aligned with our text.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,720
Then we will go back to the editor if we use a negative value for the vertical position the shadow will

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,680
move up relative to the tax.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,150
Let's give our text a vertical position of negative 2 and then go to the web browser and run our code

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,120
as you can see our text Chatto is now vertically positioned above and behind our text.

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:06,750
Let's jump back to the editor if we use a positive value for the vertical position the shadow will be

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,610
positioned below the text.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,180
We will give our text Chatto a vertical position of 4 pixels and then run our code to see the effect

31
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,090
as you can see our shadow now appears below the text.

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,790
Then we will go back to the editor if we use a value of zero for the vertical position the shadow will

33
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,300
vertically align exactly with our text.

34
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,620
We will change the vertical position of our text Chatto property to 0 pixels.

35
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,760
When we run our code in the web browser you will notice that the shadow is perfectly aligned behind

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,140
our text and not offset in any way.

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,360
Let's jump back to the editor.

38
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,440
We will change the horizontal and vertical positions of our text chateaus to two pixels each so that

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,390
we can see the effect of the following examples.

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,300
There are some optional values that we can assign to this property that can add some cool effects to

41
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,270
our text.

42
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,840
We can assign a color value to change the color of our shadow.

43
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,630
Let's give our text Chatto a color of green.

44
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,410
Then we will jump to the web browser and run the code

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,980
as you can see the text Chatto is green as a result of the code we typed.

46
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:26,960
Let's go back to the editor another optional value that we can specify as the blur radius which will

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,300
blur the shadow behind our text by default.

48
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,400
If not specified this value is equal to zero meaning that there is no blurred or artex the blur radius

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,380
is the third value that we can assign to our text Chatto property and it comes before the caller is

50
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,700
specified.

51
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,460
We will give our text Chatto a blur radius of three pixels and then run our code in the web browser

52
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,510
as you can see the shadow behind our text is now blurred.

53
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,090
Let's jump back to the editor if we want to apply multiple dropped shadows to the text.

54
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,740
We could do so by separating each group of values using.

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,080
For this example we will add three text chateaus to.

56
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,160
The first text shadow will have a horizontal position or three pixels of vertical position of two pixels

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,570
a blur radius of one pixel and a color of red.

58
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,390
Then we will add a comma to separate the first text chÃ¢teaux we just added from the second text Chatto

59
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,830
that we are about to add.

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,890
Our second text Chatto will have a horizontal position of four pixels of vertical position of three

61
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,260
pixels a blur radius of two pixels and a color of orange.

62
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,690
Then we will add a comma.

63
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,150
Finally we will add a third text Chatto with a horizontal position of six pixels of vertical position

64
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,670
of four pixels a blur radius of three pixels and the color of yellow.

65
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,680
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see.

66
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,810
We now have a text Chatto that blends from red to orange to yellow behind text.

67
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,370
Let's go back to the editor.

68
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,360
We can offset multiple shadows by one pixel to layer the shadows and create a 3D text effect.

69
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,620
We are going to add six text channels to create this 3-D effect.

70
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:23,170
First we will add awkward text Chatto with the horizontal position of one pixel of vertical position

71
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,900
of one pixel and the color of Aqua.

72
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,270
Then we will add a comma.

73
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,270
Our second text shadow will have a horizontal position of two pixels of vertical position of two pixels

74
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:41,500
and the color of blue followed by a comma for the third text Chatto we will add a horizontal position

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:49,180
of three pixels of vertical position of three pixels and the color of Aqua followed by a comma or fourth

76
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,360
shadow will have a horizontal position of four pixels of vertical position of four pixels and the color

77
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,410
of blue.

78
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,170
Don't forget to add a comma after the color before defining the next Chatto the fifth shadow will have

79
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,900
a horizontal and vertical position of five pixels and the color of Aqua.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,940
Then we will add a comma before we add the sixth text Chatto are six then final text Chatto will have

81
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,630
a horizontal position of 6 pixels of vertical position of six pixels and the color of blue.

82
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,910
Don't forget the semi-colon at the end.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,540
Then we will go to the web browser and write our code.

84
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,470
We could see our 3D text Chatto effect now on our Web page.

85
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,300
The key to creating an effect like this is staggering the horizontal and vertical position by one pixel

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,150
each time and layering several chateaus on top of one another in the next lecture we will learn about

87
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,590
fonts and see SS.
