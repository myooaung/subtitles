00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.750
Let's recap what we learned in this section of the course first we looked at the various ways that we

2
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.920
can specify color values in HVM all color values and each team can be specified by color name or G-B

3
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:28.120
value Orji a value HSF value HSLDA value and hecks value HVM else supports 140 color names that can

4
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.380
be used to specify its own distinct color for example HVM Owl knows the color names of red green blue

5
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.480
yellow orange etc to be their color values.

6
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.390
RG B stands for red green blue H T M L gives us the RGV function to create Orji B colors and we can

7
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.490
specify a value between 0 and 255 for each of the three parameters.

8
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.800
B.A stands for red green blue Alpha h female gives us the ARG VBA function to create R.G. colors.

9
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:06.810
Now the value is specified as a floating point decimal value between 0 and 1 H.S. L stands for hue saturation

10
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.110
lightness HVM l gives us the H S L function to create h s l colors.

11
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.950
We can specify the parameter as a value between 0 and 360 representing degrees on the color wheel.

12
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.200
The S N L parameters can be specified as percentages from 0 to 100 percent.

13
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.320
H S L stands for huge saturation lightness Alpha h t m l gives us the HSLDA function to create HSLDA

14
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.590
colors the alpha value is specified as a floating point decimal value between 0 and 1 hex stands for

15
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.640
hexadecimal hex color values are specified by using a hash tag or pound symbol followed by six or eight

16
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.100
values between 0 0 and F F if six digits are specified they are recognized as r r g g b b where the

17
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.920
two R's represent the amount of red and the color.

18
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.780
The two G's represent the amount of green and the color and the two B's represent the amount of blue

19
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.690
in the color.

20
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.050
If eight digits are specified they are recognized as R R G G B B A A where the two A's at the end represent

21
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.350
the alpha value of the color in the next section.

22
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.650
We will learn about embedding media and graphics in HMO.
