00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,930
In this lecture we will learn about positioning elements using C Ss to position elements in C Ss.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,020
We can use the Position property.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:22,170
There are five main types of positioning and C Ss static relative fixed absolute and stickie by default

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,390
elements are positioned statically.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,800
The top right bottom and left properties do not affect statically positioned element statically positioned

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,450
elements do not have any special type of positioning to see these examples.

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,650
Let's add a paragraph element to a web page and give it some example text.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,620
Then we will add our style code.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,790
We will start with an opening and closing style tag and use the elements selector to apply the style

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,710
to a paragraph element.

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,350
Let's give our element the Position property with a value of static.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,500
To illustrate the effect of having a position of static we will give our elements the top property with

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,630
a value of five hundred pixels.

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:08,330
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you will notice the top value of 500 pixels has

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,740
no effect on our element.

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,250
Since we specified it's position is static.

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,660
Let's jump back to the editor.

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,810
We can also position elements using relative positioning.

19
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:26,320
We can use the top bottom left and right properties to offset the element from its normal position.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,300
Let's change the position property on our element to have a value of relative and then go to the web

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:39,600
browser and run our code as you can see the top value of 500 pixels now has an effect on our paragraph

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,280
element offsetting it 500 pixels on top from its original position.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,360
Let's jump back to the editor giving an element a position effect that makes it stay in the same place

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
on the page.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,230
We used the top bottom left and right properties to assign a position to the element.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,870
Let's give our element a fixed position and also give it a top value of 100 pixels and a left value

27
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,490
of 100 pixels.

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,720
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,280
as you can see our text now is a fixed position of 100 pixels less and 100 pixels down on the webpage.

30
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,120
Let's jump back to the editor if we give the position property value of absolute the element will be

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,320
positioned relative to its first ancestor element that is not static.

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,940
To start off this example let's say a div to our code that will function as the parent for a paragraph

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
element.

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,290
Then we will move our paragraph element between the opening and closing div tags making it a child's

35
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,240
var div.

36
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,830
Let's give our div a position of relative and the top value of 100 pixels.

37
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,230
Then we will give our paragraph element a position of absolute and the top value of 100 pixels.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,720
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,720
As you can see the example text or paragraph element was positioned 100 pixels below each parent div

40
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,910
based on the value of 100 pixels we specified.

41
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:13,730
And the fact that we gave it a position value of absolute Let's jump back to the editor a position of

42
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,590
stickie will make our elements position be controlled by the user scrolling on the page the element

43
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,650
will be relatively positioned until the user starts to scroll past it.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,590
Then the element will stick to the top of the page even as the user scrolls down.

45
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,500
Essentially stickie positioning is a combination between relative positioning and fixed positioning.

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,270
Let's say a development to our webpage then we will add several paragraph elements to our webpage so

47
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,850
that there is enough content to force the browser to give us a scroll bar to scroll through our content.

48
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,740
We can do this by copying and pasting the paragraph element several times.

49
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,360
Then let's say the style code for this example we will give our development a position of stickie and

50
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,220
a top value of 0 pixels.

51
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,910
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

52
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,930
When you scroll down on the web page you will notice that the div content sticks to the top of the page

53
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,170
and displays over the other text on the webpage.

54
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,740
Let's jump back to the editor to specify which elements render on top of other elements we can use the

55
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,300
z index property for this example we will add two divs to our webpage.

56
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,660
We will give our first different idea of blue div and our second give an idea of green div.

57
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,230
Then we will add code to style or two divs.

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,650
Let's start with an opening and closing style tag between which we will write our style code.

59
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,610
Let's write the style code for our blue div.

60
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,230
We will give our blue DiVall with 150 pixels and a height of 150 pixels.

61
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,940
Then we will give our blue div a blue background.

62
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,190
We will also give it a position of absolute and Aleft value of 0 pixels.

63
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,220
Next That's right the style code for our green div we will give our DiVall width and height of 150 pixels.

64
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,200
Then we will assign a background color of green.

65
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,820
We will also give it a position of absolute last value of 20 pixels this 20 pixel less value is to offset

66
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,280
our Green did from our blue div since our green there was a find in our code after a blue div.

67
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,150
It will be displayed on top of the blue div to confirm this.

68
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:21,860
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our green div is on top of our blue div.

69
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,400
Then we will go back to the editor if we want to control which element displays on top.

70
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,380
We could use the z index property.

71
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,740
Let's give our blue divisi index of 1.

72
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,360
And our green div is the index of 0.

73
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,640
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

74
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,370
As you can see our blue div is now on top of our green div.

75
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,430
This is because we gave it a higher z index in the next lecture.

76
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,360
We will learn about grids and positioning and CSSA for Responsive Web design.
