00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.550
In this lecture we will learn how to run the code we write in the web browser.

2
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.810
There are a few key points that are important to make sure that we are able to efficiently progress

3
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.380
through the course when working in Visual Studio code.

4
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:31.560
We will see what each team will file with each team our file extension.

5
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.490
Then we can go to the filing our file explorer and click and drag it into all web browser if done correctly.

6
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.260
You will see the browser display the web page based on the HMO code you wrote.

7
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.380
This is how you run HMO code in the web browser.

8
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.090
The Web site that you see here in the browser is actually the example Web site we will build in the

9
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.110
hands on sections of this course.

10
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.510
Another important concept when running the code rewrite is the location of the images and other associated

11
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.160
files to the HVM Melk code.

12
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.520
Any images that we reference in our each T.M. code has to be either in the same directory as the each

13
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.730
tremelo file or a subdirectory of that directory.

14
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.090
Put simply this means that whatever images we want to use in our HVM will need to be in the same folder

15
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.940
as that file or in another folder that is inside of that folder.

16
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.950
Here are the images that you see in our example Web site.

17
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.840
All of them need to be either in the same folder as very [REMOVED] file or in a subfolder meaning a folder

18
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.850
inside of this folder.

19
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.360
Finally it is important that you save your code after making changes.

20
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.250
Otherwise when you run your code you won't see the changes that you made.

21
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.860
One exception to this rule is if you were to enable auto saving which will automatically save the file

22
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.830
after you make any changes without any other action on your part having your I.D. auto save your files

23
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.490
is a very useful feature.

24
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.600
In the last lecture where we learned about customizing the ID we learned how to enable the auto save

25
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.850
feature in Visual Studio code in case you missed it.

26
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.530
Here is the process of enabling the auto save feature again navigate to file preferences settings and

27
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.130
add the following code to the right hand side of the Visual Studio code editor.

28
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.730
It is important that you add the code exactly as you see me typing it here so that the editor understands

29
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.140
the code and properly autosaves your files.

30
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.070
This includes adding a comma first and then the two additional lines of code as you see here.

31
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.560
Remember this code will save your file once per second.

32
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.900
If you ever want to manually save your file you can use the control as keyboard shortcut on Windows

33
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.040
or the command desk keyboard shortcut on Mac in the next lecture.

34
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.220
We will recap what we learned in this section.
