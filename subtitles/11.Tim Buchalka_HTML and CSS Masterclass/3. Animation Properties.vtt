00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.500
In this lecture we will learn how to animate HVM elements using C S S S S allows us to animate the different

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.730
CSSA properties on an element similar to how we looked at CSSA transitions animations are based on keyframes

3
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.600
and we can animate as many elements properties as we want as many times as we want.

4
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.950
First let's say at an opening and closing style tag to our code to create an animation we first write

5
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.970
at keyframes followed by a name for our animation.

6
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.790
Next comes an opening and closing curly brace and side of these curly braces goes the code for the animation

7
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.820
the from end to key words specify the first and last frames of the animation.

8
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.000
For this example we will specify that the animation will go from a background color of green to a background

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.230
color of blue.

10
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.080
Let's say I add an h m l development to our Web page so that we have an object to animate the next step

11
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.270
after we have the code for the animation is to specify this animation on an element using the animation

12
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.160
Name property.

13
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.650
The last thing that we need to do is specify duration for animation using the animation duration property

14
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.380
just like transition's an animation without a duration will not play since the default value for the

15
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.770
animation duration property is zero.

16
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.090
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our animation plays for the specified duration

17
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.740
of three seconds.

18
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.110
Let's jump back to the editor we can add a delay to the animation using the animation delay property.

19
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.720
Let's give our animation a delay of one second and then go to the web browser and run our code as you

20
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.230
can see there is a 1 second delay before animation starts playing.

21
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.430
Let's go back to the editor.

22
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.440
We can also specify the number of times that an animation should run to do this.

23
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.580
We use the animation iteration count property.

24
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.380
Let's use the animation iteration count property and specify that our animation should be run three

25
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.510
times.

26
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:20.120
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our animation plays three times.

27
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.810
Then we will go back to the editor.

28
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.510
Let's change the animation iteration count back to 1 for the next few examples.

29
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.180
The animation direction property allows us to specify whether we want the animation to be played forwards

30
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.410
or backwards a value of normal will specify the animation place forwards.

31
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.090
This is the default to play the animation backwards.

32
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.860
We can give the animation direction property of value of reverse.

33
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.190
Let's use the animation direction property to make our animation play backwards.

34
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.060
Then we will go to the web browser and write our code as you can see our animation plays backwards since

35
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.640
we specified an animation direction of reverse.

36
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.110
Let's go back to the editor if the animation direction property is a value of alternate the animation

37
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.240
will play forwards and then backwards.

38
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.820
We need to give the animation iteration property a value of two or more to make the animation play multiple

39
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.770
times.

40
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.310
We will give this property a value of two.

41
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.130
Let's change the animation direction to alternate and then run our code in the browser as you can see

42
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.710
our animation placed forwards and then backwards.

43
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.130
Let's go back to the editor of value of alternate reverse rule make the animation play backwards and

44
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.140
then forwards.

45
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.280
Let's give our animation and animation direction of alternate reverse and then run our code as you can

46
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.490
see our animation plays backwards and then forwards

47
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.870
then we will go back to the editor.

48
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.770
We can also specify the each type or speed curve of our animation by using the animation timing function

49
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.880
property of value of eases is the default and we'll make the animation start slow speed up in the middle

50
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.000
and then and slow a value of Lennier will give the animation a constant speed.

51
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.780
Let's use the animation timing function property and specify a value of linear then we will go to the

52
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.650
web browser and write our code as you can see our animation plays at a constant speed.

53
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.590
Let's go back to the editor a value of ease and we'll make the animation start out slowly we will give

54
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.590
our animation a timing function of ease in and then run our code in the browser.

55
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.590
As you can see the animation starts out slowly and then picks up speed.

56
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.310
Let's jump back to the editor of value of ease out to make the animation.

57
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.470
And slowly we will change our animation timing function that ease out and then run our code in the web

58
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.130
browser.

59
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.560
As you can see the animation goes slower at the end.

60
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.980
Let's go back to the editor an animation film showed us how the animation affects an element before

61
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.740
and after the animation is played by the fool before and after an object is animated it will go back

62
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.200
to its original state the animation film mode property lets us specify if an object could be affected

63
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.660
by the from or to states of the animation of value of forward's means that the animation will keep the

64
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.070
styles set by the last key frame of the animation.

65
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.950
Lets specify an animation film motor forwards and run our code.

66
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.540
As you can see our elementis colored blue after the animation based on the color.

67
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.690
The last key frame of the animation.

68
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.030
Let's jump back to the editor of value of backwards means that the animation will keep the style set

69
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.530
by the first key frame of the animation during the delay period before the animation is played.

70
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.760
We will give our give an animation film motiv backwards.

71
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.390
In this case our div will become the color green.

72
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.400
Since that is the color we used in the first keyframe of our animation to confirm this.

73
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.620
Let's go to the web browser and wrote our code as you can see our give is green on our Web page before

74
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.480
the animation starts.

75
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.060
Let's go back to the editor.

76
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.450
An animation film of both means that for the delay period before the animation the style specified in

77
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.430
the first frame will be applied to the object and also the stars of the last frame of the animation

78
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.320
will be applied to the object after the animation is finished playing.

79
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.600
Let's give our given animation film more of both and then run our code in the web browser as you can

80
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.110
see Argive is green before the animation starts and blue after the animation and then we will go back

81
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.890
to the editor we can specify whether the animation is running or pause using the animation place state

82
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.370
property giving this property value of pause will pause the animation.

83
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.450
Let's give our divin animation place state of pause.

84
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:04.470
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our animation is not playing because

85
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.460
we specified that it is pause.

86
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.610
Let's go back to the editor of value of running means that the animation is running.

87
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:19.210
Let's change the pause value to running and then go to the web browser and run our code as you can see

88
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.480
our animation is now running due to the animation place.

89
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:29.530
We gave it let's jump back to the editor the animation properties a shorthand property which we can

90
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.800
use to specify 8 animation properties at once.

91
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.740
The animation properties that you can specify using the animation property or animation name animation

92
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:47.740
duration animation timing function animation delay animation iteration count animation direction animation

93
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.260
film mode and animation place.

94
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.990
Let's condense our current animation by using the shorthand property animation to specify all of these

95
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.230
values at once.

96
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.520
To make sure we didn't break anything by changing the code.

97
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:09.420
Let's run it in the web browser as you can see the animation plays perfectly in the next letter.

98
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.080
We will learn about 2-D animation and see SS.
