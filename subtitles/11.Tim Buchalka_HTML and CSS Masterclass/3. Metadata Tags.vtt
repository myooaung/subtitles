00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.270
In this lecture we will learn about meta tags tags that allow us to specify meta data about an HCM M-L

2
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.360
web page.

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:21.270
The three metadata tags are metor head and base metadata is self-describe information about an HMO document

4
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.900
specifying information like the author and a list of keywords on the HVM l page are examples of meta

5
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.580
data.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.730
The HVM l met a tag allows us to provide this information the metal tag is an empty tag so it doesn't

7
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.910
have a closing tag but it does have several attributes that we can use to store information about the

8
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.000
H.T. M-L document meditate do not alter the appearance of your webpage.

9
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.270
They just add internal content that can be parsed by web browsers and search engines et cetera.

10
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.800
The metal tag goes in between the opening and closing head tags in your HVM document.

11
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.310
Let's add a metal tag between the opening and closing head tags on our Web page.

12
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.130
The metadata tag is different from other HTL elements we have learned because it provides us with attributes

13
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.470
that we supply with custom content.

14
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.080
In other words we are giving custom information to the attributes of this tag that can be read by search

15
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.450
engines and the web browser.

16
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.340
This will make more sense as we get further into this example.

17
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.180
There are four such attributes that we can add inside of the metal tag.

18
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.720
They are name content scheme and H TTP equiv.

19
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.660
The name attributes specifies the name for the property the content attribute specifies the properties

20
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.710
value.

21
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.940
The scheme specifies a scheme to interpret what we specified in the content attribute the HTP equiv

22
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.020
attribute can be used to refresh the page set a cookie and do other things related to HTP response message

23
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.850
headers.

24
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.630
Let's use the name attribute to specify a name for the property.

25
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.590
We will give the name attribute a value of author.

26
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.730
Then we can use the content attribute to specify the name of the author together the name and content

27
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.080
attributes create a key value pair that can be interpreted by the browser.

28
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.790
Note that we can also have multiple meditate eggs that each defines their own custom attribute name

29
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.990
and content.

30
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.060
To illustrate this example let's add another method tag that lists the keywords on our Web page.

31
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.050
We can use the HDP equiv attribute to redirect or web page to another Web page after a specified delay

32
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.800
to do so.

33
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.510
We need three things.

34
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.200
First we need to add another meditate a tag tour HVM Al code and give it an HTP equiv attribute with

35
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.570
the value of refresh to do so we need three things.

36
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.100
First we need to add another Medhat tag tour HVM l code and give it an H GGP equiv attribute with a

37
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.310
value of refresh.

38
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.950
Next we need to specify the content attribute and give it a value of the number of seconds for the delay.

39
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.990
I will add a content with a value of 3 specifying that the web page should redirect to another you are.

40
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.010
After 3 seconds.

41
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.180
Note that we also add a semi-colon after the number.

42
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.130
The third and last thing that we need to specify is that you are able to redirect to.

43
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.580
This will also be appended to the content value and will come after the semi-colon.

44
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.340
The format is the word you are Arel then an equal sign and then the web address that we want the user

45
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.600
to be redirected to.

46
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.230
Let's go to the web browser.

47
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.960
When we run this code in the web browser We will see that a web page redirects to the specified you

48
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.400
URL.

49
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.490
After a delay of 3 seconds then we will jump back to the editor and look at another example.

50
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.820
The head tag is considered another tag that allows us to add metadata to a web page and HVM all this

51
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.350
element functions as a container that holds several important HVM l elements inside of the head element.

52
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.860
We are always required to specify a title for each tremelo document using the title element the style

53
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:23.790
and script elements that we use to add CSSA and javascript code directly inside of our HVM page can

54
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.940
go here as well as we learned in this lecture.

55
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.760
Mehta elements are also added to the head element of an HMO web page.

56
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.500
The link element is used to link external files to our HMO.

57
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.370
As we have learned in previous lectures the no script tag is a tag that we can use to define alternate

58
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.480
content.

59
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.520
If the user has a browser that doesn't support scripts or if users have javascript disabled in their

60
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.310
browser this element can be used inside the body element of HVM document.

61
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.490
For this example let's add a script element that sends an alert to our webpage.

62
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.570
Then we will add a no script element that fires if Javascript is disabled in the browser running the

63
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.380
code.

64
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.320
Let's go to the web browser and run this code.

65
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.920
You will notice that the alert is displayed.

66
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.890
Let's temporarily disable Javascript in our browser so that we can see the effect of using the no script

67
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.300
tag.

68
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.030
We will go to the top right corner of the browser and click on the chrome settings menu.

69
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.480
Then we will go to settings search for the word privacy and then click on the content settings

70
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.650
we will click the toggle to disable Javascript in our browser

71
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.740
then we will drag over our HVM file again to run our code

72
00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:01.040
and we should see the text that we added in the no script element up here instead of the alert to re-enable

73
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.080
javascript.

74
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.450
We can click the icon that has appeared at the top of the page go to manage and re-enable javascript

75
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.550
for our browser then we will jump back to the editor.

76
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.010
The third H.T. email metadata tag we have access to is the base tag which also goes inside of the head

77
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.250
element in an HMO document.

78
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.990
This tag lets us specify a default URL for a web page.

79
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.610
Then all of our relative you are allies will be based off of the you or as specified here.

80
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.420
We can also specify a default target for all of the links on our Web page for example our target value

81
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.540
of underscore blank will make all of the links open in a new tab on the browser.

82
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.790
Another neat thing about using the base element to specify this information is that any relative image

83
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.390
sources on our Web page will be searched for in the base Tref.

84
00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:02.720
In other words if we have the relative source logo hyphen Curole dot SVGA in our HVM our code it will

85
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.070
be treated as though it were appended to the base.

86
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:15.730
In other words the full u r l would be a colon slash slash www.youtube.com slash static ax slash you

87
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.020
to me Slash images slash V-6.

88
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.980
And then finally slash logo hyphen quarrell that SVGA.

89
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.730
Let's go to the web browser and run our code assuming we typed everything correctly we should see the

90
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.500
image displayed on our Web page as a web developer.

91
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:39.690
It is important that you understand how to use the meta head and base tags to add meta data to your

92
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.780
web page and the next lecture we will learn about tags nuda HVM L5.
