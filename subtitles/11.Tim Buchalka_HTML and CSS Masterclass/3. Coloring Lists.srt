1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,910
In this lecture we will learn about how we can add colors to our lists using C Ss we can add the background

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,910
color to the whole list by specifying the UL or all elements depending on whether we are using an unwanted

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,530
list or an ordered less.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,440
Next we will go to the web browser and run our code then we will go back to the editor and look at another

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,400
example.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,860
We can also add a background color to only the list elements by specifying that the background color

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,800
be applied to the elements using the ally tag.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,270
Let's go to the web browser and run our code.

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:47,300
Let's jump back to the editor if they were ordered and unordered lists on your web page you can specify

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,680
which styles apply to the list items of one versus the other.

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,990
You do so by first specifying if the list is ordered to ordered and then specifying that the style should

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,570
be applied to the list items of that type.

13
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,020
Next we will go to the web browser and run our code

14
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,340
in the next lecture.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,950
We will look at a recap of what we learned in this section.
