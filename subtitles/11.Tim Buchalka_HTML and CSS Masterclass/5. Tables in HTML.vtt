00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.390
In this lecture we will learn about tables and HMO HVM allows us to create tables in order to display

2
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.290
data.

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.350
We can do so by using the table tag let's say at an opening and closing table tag to create our table

4
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.440
to create a row for our table.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.230
We use the TR tag.

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.620
Let's add an opening and closing TR tag to our table.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.940
We can add cells to our table by using the tag the content between the opening and closing tags is the

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090
data that populates the cell.

9
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.880
Let's add a cell of data to our newly created table row.

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.960
We can add multiple cells next to one another by adding more 2D elements inside of the same TR element.

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.850
At this point let's jump to the web browser and run our code to see our table so far

12
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.510
as you can see our table currently has one row with three cells.

13
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.480
Let's jump back to the editor and build on this example.

14
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.600
We can also add another row underneath the first row that will have its own cells underneath the cells

15
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.040
we just created.

16
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.960
Once we have added this new row to our table in the code we will go back to the browser and run our

17
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.450
team file to see our updated table

18
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.380
as you can see our table now has a second row.

19
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.760
Now we will go back to the editor the th tag allows us to add a heading to a cell in our table.

20
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.070
Let's create another row at the top of our table and add 3 th elements.

21
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.470
One table header for each column in our table.

22
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.170
Recall that rows are horizontal in a table and columns are vertical.

23
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.090
Once we have done this we will run our code in the browser and should see the headings added to our

24
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.650
table by default the table header elements are displayed in bold and centered in the cell layer.

25
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.310
And let's jump back to the editor.

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.240
HDMI also allows us to add captions to our table in the case of NHT mail table a caption is displayed

27
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.640
at the top right above the table.

28
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.660
We can add a caption to our table by using the caption tag to see the caption added to our table.

29
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.370
Let's go back to the web browser and run our code.

30
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.970
Let's go back to the editor.

31
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.120
Sometimes we want to sell on our table to take up multiple columns or rows.

32
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.180
We can use the Colosseum attribute to make data in our cell take up more than one column.

33
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.880
We can use the rows and attribute to make data in our cell take up more than one row the number of rows

34
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.310
or columns that the data will take up depends on the number value that we assign the attribute.

35
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.650
If we specify a row span of two the data will take up two rows.

36
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.690
If we specify a row span of three the data will take up three rows etc..

37
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.210
Let's go to the web browser and run the code

38
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.540
next.

39
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.820
Let's go back to the editor remove the rose and beat that we just added and instead add a column span

40
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.490
attribute.

41
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.520
Let's run this code in the browser.

42
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.180
Let's go back to the editor

43
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.960
optionally we can use the t had t body and t foot tags to wrap the table header table body and table

44
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.230
footer respectively using these tags as a few benefits.

45
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.420
First it makes it easier to have a style applied to the header.

46
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.310
All of the body elements and footer second browsers will treat these tags in a special way.

47
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.160
If any of the content needs to be scrollable due to its size the browser will allow each of these areas

48
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.870
to be scrolled independently.

49
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.440
In other words users will be able to scroll the header and footer independently of the table body.

50
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.700
Let's see an example of using these tags on our table example from before.

51
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.120
First remove that colspan attribute that we added in the last example.

52
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:13.730
Then let's say that the head opening tag before a row of table headings and then a closing tee had tag.

53
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.780
Now if we use a style tag and specify a style of our table header for example a background color of

54
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:27.130
grey you will notice that the style applies to all of the elements we surrounded with the t had tag.

55
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.940
Let's jump to the web browser and see the result of the code we just typed

56
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.210
then we will go back to the editor next.

57
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.340
Let's wrap our table body in a t body tag.

58
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.940
We will put an opening to the body tag after the closing had tag and we will put a closing Tebbutt e-tag

59
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.290
after our last closing TR tag.

60
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:05.010
Now we can go to our style element and specify a style to apply to the table body for example a text

61
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.640
color of blue.

62
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.440
We will go back to the browser and run this code to see the result.

63
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.850
Let's go back to the editor.

64
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:24.090
Let's add another row of information in our table to be the FOTR.

65
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.290
Finally we will wrap this content in a t foot opening and closing tag we can add a style to the T foot

66
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.670
element as well.

67
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.670
For example if we want to make our footer text italic now we will go to the web browser and write our

68
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:46.740
code as you can see our table now has the footer we specified and it is displayed in italics in the

69
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.740
next lecture.

70
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.950
We will learn about layouts and HMO.
