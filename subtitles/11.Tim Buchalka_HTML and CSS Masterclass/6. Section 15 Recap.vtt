00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.560
In this section we learn how we can modify text using C Ss first we looked at some properties that allow

2
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.080
us to style text.

3
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.090
We learned that the text transform property is used to modify the capitalization of text.

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.990
Then we learned about the text decoration property which enables us to underline over a line and cross

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.810
out text.

6
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.730
We can further customize these properties to achieve some cool effects.

7
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.950
The text decoration color property allows us to assign a color to our text decoration for example assigning

8
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.750
a color to an underline over line or cross out the text decoration style property allows us to control

9
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.490
the style of our underline overlying or cross out the text indent.

10
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.940
Property allows us to indent the first line of a paragraph of text CSSA provides us the letter spacing

11
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.780
property to specify the spacing between each letter of our text.

12
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.900
A positive value will add space between our text and a negative value will remove space between our

13
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.720
text.

14
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.170
After that we learn some basic facts that we can add the text elements using CSSA the text Chatto property

15
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.680
allows us to add a shadow behind our text.

16
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.860
We can modify the x and y position to affect the placing of our shadow behind R-Tex.

17
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.590
Additionally we can change the text Chatto color as well.

18
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.630
A blur can be specified to blur or shadow a specified amount.

19
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.140
We can stack text shadows to make our text look 3D.

20
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.230
Then we looked at the concept of font families groups of font that are used in case of browser doesn't

21
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.930
support one or more font font families give the browser alternative font options to fall back on.

22
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.640
We can assign a font family to our text using the font family property each font that we specify is

23
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.220
separated from each other by commas.

24
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.280
There are two types of font families of font family refers to specific type fonts such as Times New

25
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.270
Roman a generic font family refers to a group of font families that look similar.

26
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.310
CSSA gives us the font style property that allows us to stylize our text.

27
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.360
We can assign this property a value of italic to a Tallas size R-TX the font size property allows us

28
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.230
to control the font size of text using the font weight property we can control how thin or thick our

29
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.060
text appears in the browser.

30
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.090
We then looked at several other useful text properties the word spacing property allows us to control

31
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.790
the space between words in our text element the line height property allows us to control the spacing

32
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.540
between lines in our text element the whitespace property gives us further control over whitespace in

33
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.970
our text element and can condense multiple consecutive spaces into one space.

34
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.800
Tell our text not to wrap and force or text whitespace to display exactly as we specified in our element

35
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.590
the word wrap property allows us to break a long word that would look awkward in a web browser on two

36
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.970
separate lines for a more consistent display in the next section.

37
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.110
We will learn about colors and see SS.
