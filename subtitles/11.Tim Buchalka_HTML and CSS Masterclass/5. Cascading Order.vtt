00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.860
In this lecture we will learn about the concept of cascading order and how it applies to CSX what happens

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.250
when some combination of inline internal and external styles reference the same element and they conflict.

3
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.640
For example what has been external style tells our text to be the color red and an internal style tells

4
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.250
our text to be the color green CSSA has a cascading order that specifies which type of styling takes

5
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.350
precedence if there is a conflict the highest priority is if the element has an inline style.

6
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.250
If an inline style is provided then the element will use that style.

7
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.410
The next highest precedence goes to if the element has an internal style.

8
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.780
If no inline style is provided but an internal style is provided the element will use that style.

9
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.580
After that the external style takes precedence if there is one.

10
00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.330
If there is no inline style and no internal style provided but there is an external style that style

11
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.060
will be applied to the element.

12
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.910
Finally if there are no inline styles no internal styles and no external styles then the browser default

13
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.530
style values are used.

14
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.640
Each browser has a sheet of built in default values that vary slightly from browser to browser essentially.

15
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.420
Here is a summary of the order of precedence.

16
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.620
The lower the number the higher the priority inline styles internal styles external styles and browser

17
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.660
default.

18
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.800
Let's take a look at an example of cascading order.

19
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.520
Here we have given our text element an inline style to be the color red but an internal style to be

20
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.780
the color green.

21
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.890
Let's run our code in the web browser as you can see the text displays red.

22
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.460
This is because inline styles take precedence over internal styles in the next lecture.

23
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.590
We will learn about the CSSA box model.
