00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.170
In this lecture we will look at a summary of what we learned.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.450
Let's recap what we learned in this section.

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.790
First we took a closer look at HVM images.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.490
We learned that we could add a fallback text to an image that will display if the browser has a problem

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.300
displaying the image.

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.030
We also learned how to add a tool tip to our image that will display when the user hovers over the image

7
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.410
with their cursor.

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.450
We looked at how we can position elements to the left or right of text using the float style property

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.700
Eddy or image to the body of a figure.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.870
Element allows us to add a caption using the FIG caption tag.

11
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.730
We then saw that the image element also supports animated images.

12
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.220
Finally we looked at the picture aliment which allows us to add several images that can potentially

13
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.590
be displayed and then allows the browser to choose which image to display based on a specified minimum

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.690
worth.

15
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.330
Next we looked at videos and HVM all we learned about the video tag how we could edge sources of types

16
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.430
simply for web am and old G.G. and we looked at several attributes that we can use to customize the

17
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.980
way that the user can interact with the video embedded into our web page.

18
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.600
The controls attribute allows the user controls to the video such as playing pausing and enlarging the

19
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.630
video.

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.190
The auto play attribute plays the video automatically as soon as the web page loads the loop batch of

21
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.970
beaute loops to video so that it starts playing as soon as it finishes.

22
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.880
The muted attribute mutes the video the poster attribute allows us to display an image thumbnail that

23
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.570
will fill the video window until the user heads play.

24
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.500
The preload attribute allows us to specify how if at all the web page should pre-load the video once

25
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.240
the web page loads.

26
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.390
We also looked at how we can embed YouTube videos into our Web page YouTube videos support for attributes

27
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.280
auto play controls loop and play list.

28
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.380
In contrast to regular videos YouTube videos take these attributes as Querrey string parameters appended

29
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.610
to the end of their source your URL.

30
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.130
Next we learn that we can use the audio tag to embed audio into our HDMI web page HVM supports 3 types

31
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.360
of audio files.

32
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.480
MP 3 old G.G. and wave audio elements support attributes.

33
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.970
Auto play controls loop muted and preload and these attributes behave very similarly to those used with

34
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.320
the video tag.

35
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.950
Then we took a closer look at HVM else I-frame element which we can use to embed other web pages into

36
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.970
our webpage.

37
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.500
If we want to remove the frame border that is displayed around the time frame by default we can use

38
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.540
the frame border attribute and give it a value of zero.

39
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.260
After that we looked at the canvas element in HCM all the canvas is very useful for building interactive

40
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.960
media content like games and animations.

41
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.540
We learn that canvases have a context which is the drawing surface of the canvas when we call methods

42
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.950
that draw on the canvas.

43
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.930
We actually call them on the Cambyses context.

44
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.120
We learn how to render images text shapes and gradients onto the canvas.

45
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.960
Finally we looked at how we can render scalable vector graphics or SVGA an HMO.

46
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.920
We learned that vector graphics can scale up or down indefinitely without losing any image quality.

47
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.670
We learned how we can render rectangles circles and even text to the web page using SVGA.

48
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.250
We then compared and contrasted HVM l canvas versus SPG and concluded that the canvas is best used when

49
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.250
creating complex animations or interactive games and the SVGA is best used when you want to display

50
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.460
static text or shapes on the webpage in the next section.

51
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.030
We will learn about several more H.M.S. tags we can make use of when creating web page content.
