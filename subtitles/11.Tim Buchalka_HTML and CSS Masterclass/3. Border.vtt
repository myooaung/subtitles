00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.630
In this lecture we will learn about the border properties that CSSA allows us to animi the full list

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.730
of these properties is border border bottom border bottom color border bottom left radius border bottom

3
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:27.790
right radius border bottom with border color border last border left collar border left with border

4
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:37.360
right border right color border right with border spacing border top border top color border top left

5
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.300
radius border top right radius and border top with in the example for this lecture.

6
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.360
We're going to learn how we can take a dive in the shape of a square and animate it into a circle by

7
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.500
modifying its border properties.

8
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.260
First let's create a div that we will animate in this example.

9
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.660
Next let's add the opening and closing style tags that we will need so that we can write our style and

10
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.180
animation code.

11
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.460
After that we will write the style code for our div..

12
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.000
We'll give our div a width and height of 100 pixels.

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.860
We will also give it a solid border of three pixels and make the border black.

14
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.240
The animation we will write will be called Border radius and have a duration of two seconds and loop.

15
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.150
Let's write the animation code to be applied to Argive.

16
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.690
We will specify a keyframe of 50 percent for all four of our properties that we will animi border top

17
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.410
right radius border top left radius border bottom right radius and border bottom left radius.

18
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.080
All of these properties we will set to a value of 150 pixels at keyframe 50 percent.

19
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.310
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code as you can see the square and unmakes into a circle and

20
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.520
the animation loops over and over in the next lecture we will learn about the text properties that CSSA

21
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.540
allows us to animate.
