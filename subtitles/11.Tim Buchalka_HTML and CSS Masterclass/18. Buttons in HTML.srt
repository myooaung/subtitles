00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,370
In this lecture we will learn about the basics.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,130
Each female provides us with two create buttons to create a button you can use the button tag we will

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:22,050
start with an opening button tag the text that will appear on our button and then a closing button tag.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:36,340
Once we have typed that we will go to the web browser and drag the HDMI file over to run our code.

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,380
We can also specify the type of button using the type attribute.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,990
In this case we want specify the type to be button the text between the opening and closing tag is the

7
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,780
text that appears on the button.

8
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,610
Let's jump back to the web browser

9
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,500
noticed that we can click on the button in the browser.

10
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,170
However nothing happens when we click the button.

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,530
This is because we haven't specified the on click behavior for a button we can specify what happens

12
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,710
on click of our button by using the on click attribute to see an example of this.

13
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,810
We will go back to Visual Studio code and add the on click attribute to our opening button tab.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,700
We will specify that an alert button was clicked should be displayed in the browser when the button

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,000
is clicked in this case we were making an alert that the button was clicked using the alert function.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,330
We will go to the browser and drag the HMO file over to run our code.

17
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,580
Now if you click the button you will notice that the alert we specified is shown.

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,190
Let's go back to the editor and learn about the autofocus attribute the autofocus attribute puts the

19
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,120
button in focus.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,990
Once the web page loads being in focus means having a blue outline around it as though it is currently

21
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,430
selected by hitting the enter key while our button is in focus.

22
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,730
You will notice that a button click is performed.

23
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,370
We will add the autofocus attribute to the opening button tag.

24
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,640
Then we will go back to our browser and run the code.

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,610
If you hit enter you should see the specified on click behavior.

26
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:30,230
Let's go back to the editor the disabled attribute allows us to disable a button and the disabled button

27
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,020
on our Web page will be greyed out and not clickable we will remove the autofocus attribute that we

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,260
added for the last example and instead add the disabled attribute then we will go back to the browser

29
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,110
and run our code

30
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,020
as you can see the button is greyed out and not clickable.

31
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,900
Now we will go back to the editor.

32
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,860
Let's take a closer look at age mail buttons and the on click attribute.

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,930
Aside from showing an alert we can perform other actions when our button is clicked.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,980
We can change the color of our button when it is clicked to do so we will specify the on click attribute

35
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:22,720
to change the background color style of our button.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,550
Let's go to the web browser and run the code.

37
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,000
Now when we click the button you will notice that it changes color.

38
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,550
Let's jump back to the editor.

39
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,400
Note that the on click attribute is a global attribute meaning that it applies to all HDMI elements

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,000
not just buttons text on our web page can be clickable to illustrate this.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,240
First we will add an opening paragraph tag and specify the unclick attribute to set the color to red.

42
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Then we will add some example text content.

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,040
Finally our element will be closed with the closing paragraph tag.

44
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,590
Let's go to the web browser and run this code.

45
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,310
Then we will click on the text and we should see the text turn red.

46
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,070
Now we will go back to the editor.

47
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,980
An image can also be made clickable using the on click attribute.

48
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,900
For example we will start out with an opening image tag and then assign it a source of star dot PFG

49
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,150
then we will give it the on click attribute and pass it the click function.

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,370
This is a custom function that we are going to write the value of the unclick attribute is the name

51
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,150
of a javascript function to make an working example in this case.

52
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,590
We will add a few lines of javascript code to our file.

53
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,300
Let's first add an opening and closing script tag.

54
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,070
Then we will add the following function code which will simply display an alert on the web page when

55
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,040
our image is clicked.

56
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,940
Don't worry if you don't fully understand this part we will go over the script tag and writing BASIC

57
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,510
code to interact with our HVM l code later on.

58
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,820
Let's go back to the browser

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,270
when we run this code in the web browser and click on the image.

60
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,820
You will notice that this alert is displayed in the next lecture.

61
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,930
We will learn about comments and each team will.
