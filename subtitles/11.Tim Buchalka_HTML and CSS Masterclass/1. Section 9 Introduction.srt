1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,200
In this section we will learn about each team event.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,390
Events can be added to HTL element to call a function when the user performs a certain action.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,070
We will learn about four main types of HVM l events in this section keyboard events mouse events drag

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,630
events and clipboard events.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,220
First we will learn about keyboard events if we want to fire an event when the user presses a certain

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:30,690
key.

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:37,840
We can use keyboard events like Auntie down Auntie press and Auntie up to program the functionality

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,980
we need.

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,250
Next we will look at mouse events and HVM all mouse events allow us to call certain functions when the

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:52,090
user performs certain actions like clicking double clicking and scrolling over elements.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,720
After that we will learn about drag events HVM l drag events allow us to fire code when the user drags

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,730
or drops an element we will use these events to create a simple drag and drop program in each team.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,840
Finally we will learn about clipboard events and M-L clipboard events are useful for when you want to

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,650
fire code when the user copies pastes or cuts in element by the end of this section.

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,610
You will know how to use h t m l events to your advantage to call functions when the user performs certain

16
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,580
actions.

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,330
You will be able to write code that responds to presses mouse events dragging and dropping elements

18
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,480
and clipboard events in the next lecture.

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,830
We will look at keyboard events in HD M-L.
