1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,100
In this section we set up Visual Studio code.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,030
The idea that we will use in the rest of this course.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,190
First we went step by step through the process of downloading installing and running the program and

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,570
learned about it you I lay out after that we looked at how we can customize the ideas to fit our needs.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,770
We ran through the different color schemes that we can set for syntax highlighting.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,990
We also learned how to create keyboard shortcut and set other preferences like autosave and text size.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,340
We took a close look at how we can customize the editor to the fullest and learned how to enable and

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,400
disable options like indenting in our HQ male.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,380
We also ran through the different menu options that the editor gives us and what several useful options

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,870
do to make our life easier when coding.

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,710
Finally we learned how to run our code and the web browser.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,510
Additionally we took a look at how to set up the folder hierarchy to be able to use images on our local

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,640
machine and our Each team will remember if you already have some web development experience and prefer

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,880
to use another ID.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,200
You can you are free to use any ID you like as long as it supports HVM and CSSA code as those are the

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,980
two languages we will be using in this course.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,450
Now that we have Visual Studio code set up on our computer we are ready to jump right into the fundamentals

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,580
of each team in the next section.
