00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:11,160
In this lecture we will learn about webpage titles and headings and the various tags humoral gives us

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,740
regarding adding a title and headings to our Web page.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,610
We can supply a title for a web page by using the title tag this tag goes between the opening and closing

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,790
had tag of an HTML document.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,490
However this title will not be shown on our Web page.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,780
It will only be used in the browser and search engine will be displayed in the browser toolbar Favorites

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,090
tab and search engine results.

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,410
For example to add a title to a web page we would add an opening and closing title tag to our code in

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,380
the head section and then type whatever the title is in between the opening and closing title tags.

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,880
Let's jump to the web browser when we run this code in a browser.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,860
You will notice that the title we provided is displayed in the tab at the top of the web browser.

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,170
Note that the title element is a required element for a webpage meaning that in order for our code to

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,970
run we must give it a title element to display a heading on our Web page.

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,360
Each G-mail gives us the 6 heading tags.

15
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,940
Each one each to each.

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,040
3 4 5 and each 6.

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,700
These tags are meant to rank the content in order of importance.

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,610
For example the H-1 tag is the largest heading out of the six and would come at the top of the page

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,420
as an example.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,230
Let's add an H1 heading element to our Web page by adding an opening and closing each one tag to our

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,000
code.

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,950
We will then give it text content based on the text that we want displayed as the heading.

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,290
When we run our code you will see our h one element heading be displayed on the webpage.

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,030
The size and style you see applied to the text here are the built in defaults for each one heading element

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,610
h to tag is the second largest heading and we would use it when we wanted a smaller heading than H one

26
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,100
but larger than the other heading tags.

27
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:06,180
Let's keep our Each one element in our code but add another element h to that we can use to compare

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,840
the size of the H-1 tag versus the H-2 tag.

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,200
To do this we will add an opening and closing H-2 tag to our code and give it some text content.

30
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,610
When we run our code in the browser you will see the latest element we added to our Web page or H-2

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,370
heading element

32
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,750
as you can see the H 2 element is smaller and stands out less than the one heading.

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,610
One reason that the content you put inside of the heading tags is important is that this is the text

34
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,670
search engine pull and use from your webpage.

35
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,230
This means that you should pay careful attention to make sure that you put in the proper key words that

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,910
are descriptive of the content of your web page so that it has a good chance of standing out in the

37
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,010
search engine.

38
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,290
If users search similar keywords when browsing the web.

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,890
Although each heading has a default size you can specify a custom font size using this style tag.

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,860
We will take a closer look at using the style tag in a later letter in the section in the next lecture.

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,870
We will learn how we can add paragraph elements and text content to a web page using HMO.
