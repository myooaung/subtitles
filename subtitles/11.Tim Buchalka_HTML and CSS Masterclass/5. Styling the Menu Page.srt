00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,300
In this lecture we will stylize the menu page of our website.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,560
First let's add some space between the description and button for each menu item.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,200
We will do so by adding to break elements between those elements.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Next let's add a border around each of the menu items we will use the card classes our selector and

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,360
add a to pixel solid white border around each card.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,200
We're going to add a button pulse to the new menu item or BBQ slice to make it stand out.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,330
Let's create our animation and name it button pulse.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:46,200
We will add keyframes at 0 percent 30 percent 40 percent 50 percent 60 percent 70 percent and 80 percent.

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,420
All of these will ever transform with a scale of one with the exception of the keyframe at 50 percent

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,110
which will have a scale of 1.1.

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,130
Then we will reference our button using its ID BBQ price and attach our animation to it.

12
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,420
We will specify the animation name of button pulse duration of one second and we will make it loop by

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,080
using the infinite keyword.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,870
When we run our code in the web browser and click on the menu link you will see the result of the code

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,190
we just typed in the next lecture.

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,830
We will stylize the contact page for our Web site.
