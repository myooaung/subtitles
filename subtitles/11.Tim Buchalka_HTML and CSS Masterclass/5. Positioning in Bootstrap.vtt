00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.870
In this lecture we will learn how we can position elements with bootstrap bootstrap uses a grid system

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.050
that allows us to easily divide our web page into columns of equal size.

3
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.910
Essentially the bootstrap grid has containers rows and columns.

4
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.700
A container holds a group of rows to create a container.

5
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.230
We assign our female div a class of container fluid the container fluid class is useful because it gives

6
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.100
us a full width container that spans the entire width of the web browser viewport inside of the container

7
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.530
we put rows which we will use to contain horizontal groups of columns to add a row to our Web page.

8
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.590
We will use the development and assign it a class of row.

9
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.430
We will add a div inside of our container and give it a class of row inside of a row we can add columns.

10
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.540
Bootstrap has five grid classes that allow us to define our columns.

11
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.580
The Col class is used to define columns for extra small devices.

12
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.370
These are devices with a screen with less than 576 pixels.

13
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.740
The Col S.M. class is used to define columns for small devices.

14
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.920
These are devices with the screen with greater than or equal to 576 pixels.

15
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.840
The cow M.D class is used to define columns for medium devices.

16
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.870
These are devices with screen with greater than or equal to 768 pixels.

17
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.680
The cow Elgie class is used to define columns for large devices.

18
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.370
These are devices with screen with greater than or equal to 992 pixels.

19
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.390
The Kolle Excel class is used to define columns for extra large devices.

20
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.840
These are devices with screen with greater than or equal to 1200 pixels.

21
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.060
Let's add some columns to our row.

22
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.440
We will add three developments that will be the columns for a row.

23
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.670
The first will have a class value of college for and a background color of light blue.

24
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:04.050
Assigning the class value of college for means that this element will take up one third of the webpage.

25
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.730
Our second div will also have a class value of college for we will give it a background color of orange

26
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.110
to make it stand out from our first div our third div will have a class value of college for and a background

27
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.500
color of light blue.

28
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.480
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see each of the three divs takes up for

29
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.740
twelfths or one third of the web browser with.

30
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.650
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example.

31
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.360
It is possible for us to have up to 12 columns across one row and bootstrap.

32
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.370
We can use a number from 1 to 12 to define the width of our column for example adding two columns with

33
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.660
the width of six will make two equal sized columns on our Web page.

34
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.190
Our first div will have a class value of Col large 6 and a background color of light green.

35
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.540
Our second day will have a class value of college large 6 and a background color of light gray.

36
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.050
Then we will go to the web browser and write our code as you can see.

37
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.130
Each of the divs takes up 6 twelfths or half of the web browser with.

38
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.900
Let's jump back to the editor.

39
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.680
We can also make our columns have unequal widths.

40
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.350
For example we can give one column A with of seven and another column with the 5.

41
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.640
Our second div will have a class value of Col large 5 and a background color of light Corle.

42
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.860
Then we will run our code in the web browser to see the result.

43
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.240
Our first div takes up 7 twelfths of the web browser with the second div takes up 5 twelfths of the

44
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.230
web browser with.

45
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.500
Hopefully these examples we have looked at.

46
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.610
Give you a clearer understanding of how we can use bootstrap in the college classes it provides to position

47
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.220
our elements and specify how much of the web browser with they fill in the next lecture.

48
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.100
We will learn how we can use bootstrap to create menus and UI for our web pages.
