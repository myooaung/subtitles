00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,310
In this lecture we will learn about working with text in HCM and how we can add paragraph elements and

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:17,120
text to our webpage text of course is a very important part of any webpage.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,150
The paragraph tag allows us to add text to our Web page.

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:28,810
We will start with an opening Peter egg followed by the text we want to display and then a closing tag.

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,920
Let's go back to our browser find the file

6
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,140
and drag it into the browser to run our code.

7
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,630
We should see the text that we just added appear.

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,770
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example we can use the B tag to display text in bold

9
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:31,450
going back to the browser and dragging in our file will now show us that our text has been bolded.

10
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,150
Let's jump back to the editor and see how we can display our italicised text.

11
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:45,860
We can use the tag to display the text in italics.

12
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,400
Let's run this code in our browser to see the italicized text.

13
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,990
We will go back to the idea or write some more code.

14
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,860
To insert a newline into our text we will use the B.R. Teg B.R. stands for break and create a single

15
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,210
line break.

16
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,040
Note that this tag is an empty tag meaning that it doesn't have a closing Ted.

17
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,950
Once we add this tag in the middle of our text we will run our code in the browser to see the effect

18
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,130
of what we just typed.

19
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,580
Let's jump back to Visual Studio code

20
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,710
the pretend or pre-formatted text tag can be very useful for forcing text to be displayed exactly as

21
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,800
it is typed if you want to preserve spaces and line breaks in text.

22
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:21,060
You can wrap the text in an opening and closing price tag know the difference of the tag and the pre

23
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,060
tag the tag will display any text that you type on a single line unless you specify line breaks using

24
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,360
the B.R. tag.

25
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,800
Even if you manually use the Enter key to put text on multiple lines the p tag will reformat it to one

26
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,740
line.

27
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,530
In contrast the pre tag will store the information exactly as you type it.

28
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,740
So there is no need to use B.R. tags within the pretense.

29
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,310
We will change the tag around our text to be an opening and closing price tag and also add some new

30
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,340
lines manually to our text by using the enter key on our keyboard.

31
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,810
Once we have done that we will jump over to the web browser and drag in our H.M.S. file to see the code

32
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:15,520
take effect.

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,460
Let's go back to the Ed. H2 hymnal gives us access to the block quote tag to define a quotation the

34
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,500
site attribute of the block quote tag will refer to the you are L-A of the web page where you got the

35
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,340
quote.

36
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,020
The site attribute allows us to provide to you or else where we got the quote from.

37
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,630
For this example we will start with an opening blockquote tag and then use the site attribute to point

38
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,380
to w w w dot Google dot com

39
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,230
as content for this element.

40
00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:04,100
We will have some example text.

41
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,140
Finally we can end our blockquote element with a closing blockquote tag when we run this code in the

42
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,100
browser.

43
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:21,160
We will see the resulting blockquote element that appears on our Web page.

44
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,460
Let's jump back to the editor.

45
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,120
We can use the Q tag to add an inline quotation.

46
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,560
A short quotation that doesn't need its own block of content but can be inline with other text.

47
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,340
We also use the site attribute to link to our source when using the Q tag.

48
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,670
Let's reuse the code from the last example but change the opening and closing tags to queue tag when

49
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,810
we run the code in the browser by dragging over our HMO file you will see the result.

50
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,460
Time to go back to the editor and look at another example.

51
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,040
We can add superscripts and subscripts and HMO.

52
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,030
Remember those xponent for math class to properly display an exponent value.

53
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,960
We can use the superscript tag in this example.

54
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,360
We want to render the text to to the second power equals four.

55
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,830
To achieve this effect we surround the text that we want to be used as the exponent in an opening and

56
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,020
closing superscript tag.

57
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,740
We will start with an opening p tag followed by the number 2 then we will put an opening superscript

58
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,660
tag followed by another two and then a closing superscript tag.

59
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,390
Finally we will add an equal sign.

60
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,870
The number four and a closing paragraph tag.

61
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:59,310
When we go back to our browser and drag in our HVM file to run the code we should see our equation displayed

62
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:06,700
in the browser.

63
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,790
Let's go back to the ID.

64
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,430
We can also use the subscript tag to add subscripts to our webpage if we want to display the chemical

65
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,660
compound h to all.

66
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,820
For instance we would surround the two in an opening and closing subscript tag.

67
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:30,300
For this example we will start off with an opening paragraph tag then a capital H followed by an opening

68
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,580
subscript tag.

69
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,620
Then we will add a to a closing subscript tag a 0 and a closing paragraph tag.

70
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,670
We will go back to our browser and run this code to see the result of what we just typed

71
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,430
in the next lecture.

72
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,890
We will learn about the style attribute and style tag which allow us to start Lizer each DML element.
