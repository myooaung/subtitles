00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,860
In this lecture we will look at the properties that CSSA gives us to modify the background of our each

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,060
team out element.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,470
To illustrate these examples let's add a paragraph element with some example text to a web page the

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,700
background color property allows us to color and elements background.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,040
We will get an opening and closing style tag to our code then we will use the background color property

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,820
and give our elements a background color of orange.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,350
Let's jump to the web browser and run our code

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,940
as you can see the background of our text is orange.

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,350
Let's jump back to the editor.

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,080
The background image property allows us to get an image as an element background let's remove our paragraph

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,880
element and add a development to our Web page.

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,110
We will also use the development selector instead of the paragraph element selector.

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,800
Let's give our div a height of 230 pixels and a weight of 250 pixels.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,060
Let's use the background image property and give our development a background of our star PMG image.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:20,030
To see the result of this change we will go to the web browser and run our code.

16
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,900
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,190
The background repeat property controls how the background repeats if this property is set to a value

18
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,030
of repeat.

19
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,600
Which is also the default.

20
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,830
The image will repeat in both the x and y directions.

21
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,890
If we increase the height and width of our div to 500 and write our code in the browser you will notice

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,770
that our store image repeats we didn't have to explicitly use the background repeat property here since

23
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,580
the background repeats by default.

24
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,820
Let's jump back to the editor if the background repeat property is set to a value of repeat x the background

25
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,190
will only be repeated in the x direction.

26
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,140
Let's see the background repeat property to the style code for our give and give it a value of repeat

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:13,280
x then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our star graphic only repeats horizontally

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,890
and not vertically.

29
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Let's jump back to the editor and look at another example.

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,450
If the background repeat property is set to evaluate repeat y the background will only be repeated in

31
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,870
the y direction.

32
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,140
Let's give the background repeat property evaluate repeat y then we will go to the web browser and run

33
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,160
our code as you can see the star graphic is repeated vertically in the y direction on our Web page.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,490
Let's go back to the editor if the background repeat property is set to values.

35
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,550
No repeat the background image will not repeat.

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,130
Let's give our background image property a value of no repeat and then go to the web browser and run

37
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,610
our code as you can see the image does not repeat.

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,800
Let's jump back to the editor the background attachment property specifies that the image scrolls on

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,750
the web page scrolls of value scroll is the default and means that the background image will scroll

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,320
with the webpage.

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,620
Let's see the background attachment property to our code and give it a value of scroll to see the effect

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,580
of this code.

43
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,740
We need to add a paragraph element to our Web page and copy and paste it so that there is enough content

44
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,640
on our page to have to scroll.

45
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,580
We will give our first paragraph element an ID of P1 and use that ideas are selector.

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,700
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our background image scrolls with the web

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,600
page.

48
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,340
Let's jump back to the editor of value fix to make a background image not scroll when the web page scrolls

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,570
we will give the background attachment property value of text and then run our code.

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,860
As you can see our image remains fixed in this position as the web page scrolls.

51
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,500
Let's go back to the editor to see the effect of these next few examples.

52
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,460
We will remove the paragraph elements that we just added.

53
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,650
We really use that development and give it a height and width of fifteen hundred pixels the background

54
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,930
position property allows us to position our background relative to our element.

55
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,310
We can assign it a value of left to position or background at the left of our element.

56
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,630
Let's give our driver background position property with a value of left.

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,290
This will make the image be positioned on the left side of the development then we will go to the web

58
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:31,180
browser and run our code as you can see our background is now positioned at the left of our element.

59
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,170
Let's jump back to the editor we can assign the background position property values center to position

60
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,330
the background at the center of our element.

61
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,030
Let's assign a background position property value of center and then run our code in the browser.

62
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,410
As you can see the background image is now centered in the middle of our development.

63
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,750
Let's go back to the editor.

64
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,340
We can assign the background position property value of right to position the background and the right

65
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,650
of our element.

66
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,110
Let's give our element the background position of right and run our code as you can see the background

67
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,480
image displayed at the right of the element.

68
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,170
Let's go back to the editor.

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,480
We can also specify a second value to say whether the image should be positioned at the top center or

70
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,470
bottom.

71
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,600
In other words giving a background position of right top means that the background will be positioned

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
on the top right of an element.

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,080
Let's use a background position of right top and then run our code as you can see the background is

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,570
aligned to the top right of our development.

75
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:44,450
Let's jump back to the editor possible combinations for these values are left top left center left bottom

76
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:51,830
center top center center center bottom right top right center and right bottom.

77
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,220
We can also specify an x and y position in pixels.

78
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,290
Let's give our background image an exposition of 20 pixels and a wide position of 50 pixels.

79
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:07,460
Then we will run our code as you can see our background image is now positioned at 20 pixels right and

80
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,380
50 pixels down in Argive.

81
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:16,950
Then we will go back to the editor an x y position can also be specified using percentages.

82
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,380
We will give our background image an x value of 70 percent and a Y value of 20 percent.

83
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:29,230
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the position of our background image

84
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,460
was adjusted based on the code that we type in the next lecture.

85
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,850
We were learn about the border properties at CSSA gives us access to.
