1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,600
In this lecture we will create the menu page for our website.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,020
The menu will display the different items that a customer can purchase from our pizzeria.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,350
Most of our code for this lecture will go inside of our menu div that we created a few lectures back.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,380
We will add the style attribute to our menu div and give it a visibility of Hedden top value of 400

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:33,050
pixels aleft value of 15 percent a position of absolute a width of 70 percent and a height of 20 percent.

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,300
We will add an H1 heading element to display the title menu at the top of this section of our Web page.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,890
The styles we will add to this element are text align value of center a with of 100 percent and the

8
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,330
color of white.

9
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,950
We're going to add these items as cards to our Web page in one row.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,040
So first let's add another div and give it a class value overall.

11
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,070
Let's create one of the core items for a web page.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,110
We're going to add a total of five of these items but once we create the first one we will be able to

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,280
copy and paste this one and use that as a template for the others.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,420
Since the majority of the code will be the same to start we will add a div with class values of card

15
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,050
and text center inside of the div we will add an image element.

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,350
We will give the image a class of Kord image top.

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:24,300
Source attribute with a value of sliced 1 p and G and then all value of card image.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,840
Then we will add another div and give it a class value of card body between the opening and closing

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,340
div tags that we just added.

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,140
We will add a title for our card.

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,000
We will use an H-2 heading tag and give it an idea of cheese and a class of card title.

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,820
Between the opening and closing H-2 tags.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,360
We will put the name of our item which is cheese in this case.

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,870
We will then add some text to describe the item we will use the H for heading tag and assign it a class

25
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,400
value of card text between the opening and closing H for tags.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,280
We will put a description for item which in this case will be regular sliced with sauce and cheese.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,300
Finally we really an anchor element with an ID of cheese price an ATF attribute of Hash tag and the

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,410
class of button and Button primary between the opening and closing anchor tags.

29
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,100
We will put the price of $3.

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,870
We want to add functionality so that when we click the button the item we clicked in its price will

31
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,350
be displayed in an alert to the user.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,830
Let's go down to below where we wrote our last function in between the script tags and write another

33
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,700
function for this purpose.

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,540
The name of our function will be item on click and we will pass the idea of an item and the idea of

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,200
the amount we will use three variables in this function.

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,930
Our first variable we named item and we will use the document get element by ID function to find the

37
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,930
HVM element that has the idea of the item argument passed into the function.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,890
We will use the inner h t M-L to access the contents between the opening and closing tag of this element.

39
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,820
The second variable will be named amount and we will use the document get element by ID function to

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,250
get the H DML element with the idea of the amount passed into the function and get the inner h t m l

41
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,030
of it.

42
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,510
Our third variable will be named.

43
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,660
Alert message and we will concatenate the other two variables along with some other text before passing

44
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,650
this variable into javascript alert function.

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,250
Next we need to add the on click attribute to our anchor element back up in the menu section of our

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:36,280
code and call this function passing in a string value of cheese for the first argument and a value of

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,330
cheese price for the second argument.

48
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,080
Before we run the code let's go between our opening and closing style tags and add a few styles to effect

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,880
the elements of our code.

50
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,480
We will give the card class A with of 20 percent a height of 500 pixels and a background color of transparent

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,330
or Orji be 0 0 0 0 0 0.

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,270
Let's give the card image top class A with 200 pixels a height of 200 pixels a margin of zero and auto

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,890
or card title and card text classes will be given a color of white

54
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,680
or Button class will be given a width of 80 percent OK.

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,570
Now if we run this code in the browser and click the menu option in our nav menu it should display one

56
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,320
menu item.

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,210
If we click the button we should see the alert displayed at the top of our web page with the appropriate

58
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,050
values.

59
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,640
Let's jump back to the editor.

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:44,820
Let's copy the chunk of code we wrote for our card and pasted four times.

61
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,690
We will modify these four blocks of code to display or other for menu items we need to modify just a

62
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:58,400
few values in our image tag we will change the source to slice to P and G in the H to element we will

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,460
change the ID to peperoni and the content to peperoni and our H for element we will change our content

64
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,290
to pizza with pepperoni topping for anchor tag will change the idea.

65
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,520
Peperoni price and the on click arguments the pepperoni and pepperoni price the content of our link

66
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,680
Allaman will be $4 for our third card.

67
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,970
We will make similar changes in our image element we will change the source to slice 3 PMG in the H2

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,730
element.

69
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,700
We will change the idea a mushroom and the content to mushroom in our 8:04 element.

70
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,280
We will change our content to pizza with mushrooms for anchor element.

71
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,910
We will change the ID to mushroom price and the on click arguments to mushroom and mushroom price.

72
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,810
The content of our link element will be three dollars and fifty cents for a fourth card we will make

73
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,090
these changes as well.

74
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,410
In our image tag we will change the source to slice for energy in the H2 element.

75
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,110
We will change the idea of vegi and the content to vegi in our h 4 element.

76
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,000
We will change our content to pizza with veggie toppings for anchor element.

77
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,920
We will change the idea of veggie price and the unclick arguments to veggie and veggie price.

78
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,140
The content of our link element will be three dollars and 50 cent profit.

79
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,600
We will make these changes as well in our image tag.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,350
We will change the source to slice 5 PLG and the H2 element will change the idea of BBQ and the content

81
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,820
to barbecue in our H for.

82
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,770
We will change our content to pizza with chicken and barbecue sauce for our anchor element.

83
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,470
We will change the idea of BBQ price and the on click arguments to BBQ and BBQ price.

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,810
The content of our link aliment will be $4 and 50 Cent now.

85
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,180
We run our code and click the menu link.

86
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,810
We should see all five menu items we can click the button associated with any of these items to display

87
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,150
the item name and its price in the next letter.

88
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,570
We will create the contact page for our website.
