00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.800
In this lecture we will learn about the pseudo classes that CSSA gives us that apply to the anchor tag.

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.890
These are link visited hover and active.

3
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
Let's create a link that we can use in the examples for this lecture we will use the anchor tag and

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.520
give it a placeholder A-Trak value of hash tag to link pseudo class allows us to add style to all unvisited

5
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.060
links on our webpage.

6
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.550
For example if we want to make all of the unvisited links on our Web page pink We could use the link

7
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.160
pseudo class and assign our linker color value of pink.

8
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.730
Now when we run our code in the browser you will notice that the link is pink instead of the default

9
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.670
blue color.

10
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.110
Let's jump back to the editor The visited pseudo class allows us to add style to visited links on our

11
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.090
Web page.

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.380
For example if we want to make all of the visited links on our Web page read we would use the visited

13
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.670
pseudo class and assign or link or color value of red.

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.930
When we run this code in our browser and click the link you will notice that once it is visited it changes

15
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.940
to the color red instead of the default purple.

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.830
Let's go back to the editor the hover pseudo class allows us to add style that will apply to a linked

17
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.420
element when we hover over it.

18
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.370
For example if we want to make links green when the user hovers over them we could use the hover pseudo

19
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.990
class and assign or link or color of green.

20
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.620
In order for the hover pseudo class to work it has to come after both the link and visited pseudo classes

21
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.010
in our CSSA.

22
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.090
Now when we run the code in the browser and hover over the link you will notice that it turns green.

23
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.560
Then we will go back to the editor the active pseudo class allows us to add style that will apply to

24
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.290
a link element as it is clicked or selected.

25
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.180
For example if we want to make links on our Web page yellow when the user clicks on them we can use

26
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.810
the active pseudo class and assign it a link color of yellow.

27
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.190
When we run our code in the browser and click on the link you will notice that it turns yellow while

28
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.900
it is selected in the next lecture.

29
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.350
We will learn about pseudo elements in C Ss.
