00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,120
In this lecture we will start like the About Us page.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,370
First we are going stylize our list.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,100
Let's go to our about us live inside of which is our unordered list.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,640
We will give our unordered list a class of about lists then we will add the class attribute to our list

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,840
element and assign them a value of about list element.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,260
Now let's go to the style section of our code.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,670
We will add the following styles to our About list class element.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,390
We will assign our about lists class a list style type of square which will change the circular bullet

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,930
points to square.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,610
We will also assign our class a background color of dark red.

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,460
Then we will add styles to our About list element class will give the elements of our class a background

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,840
color of crimson and a margin of 8 pixels.

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,950
Next let's run our code in the browser and click the About Us link on our Web page to see the result

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,400
of the code we just typed.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,830
Then we will jump back to the editor.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,030
The other thing we are going to do to stylize or about us page is to make the text on the bottom flash

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,450
the colors of the rainbow.

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,170
To do this we will go up again to our about div and find the text element we will give our element an

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,120
idea of description text.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:21,510
Next let's write the code for animation we will call our animation description then our keyframes will

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,620
go in 15 percent increments.

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,300
Going from 0 percent to 90 percent.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:37,860
So our keyframes will be 0 percent 15 percent 30 percent 45 percent 60 percent 75 percent and 90 percent.

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,810
The colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,050
Each of which will correspond to one of these keyframes.

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,910
Finally we just need to link the animation to our text element.

27
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,720
We can use the idea of description text that we gave it as the selector specifying the animation attribute

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,480
with an animation name of description and a duration of four seconds and the infinite keyword will link

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,610
our animation to the text when we run our code in the browser and could be about us link on our Web

30
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,820
page we should see the text on the bottom of our Web page animi cycling through the colors of the rainbow.

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,300
And the next lecture.

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,750
We will stylize the menu page for our website.
