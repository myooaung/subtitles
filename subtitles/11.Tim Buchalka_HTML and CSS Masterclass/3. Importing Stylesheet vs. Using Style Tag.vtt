00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.570
In this lecture we will learn about the different ways that we can add CSSA to an HMO webpage.

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.070
In total there were three ways that we can add CSSA to an each team document inline internal and external

3
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.550
an inline style is a style that is applied to one element.

4
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.080
To use an inline style we had a style attribute to an HDMI tag and then assign it a value of the style

5
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.680
we want applied to the HDMI element an internal style is when we add a style element to our female document

6
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.440
using the style tag and put our code to Starla or HVM elements inside of the opening and closing style

7
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.190
tags on external styles when we separate r h t M L and C Ss files and then use the HDMI link tag to

8
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.550
link the two together.

9
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.240
We looked at an example of this in a previous lecture where we learned how to create an external CSSA

10
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.430
stylesheet.

11
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.970
It is recommended and usually considered best practice to keep HVM L and C S S code as two separate

12
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.240
files and then to use the HDMI link tagged to link the two together.

13
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.200
However each of these three ways to style each team out elements has their own use when you want to

14
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.230
define styles that will be used and shared throughout an entire Web site.

15
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.940
You should use external styling when you have certain styles that only apply to one web page.

16
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.540
You could use internal styling and put these styles directly into a style element in the HVM code.

17
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.110
If you have one HDMI element that you know you want to style independently from all of the other elements

18
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.820
and you never want this style to be re-used on any other elements you can use inline styling.

19
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.390
Additionally inline and internal styling can be used to quickly test how styles look on your web page

20
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.860
and then you could put them into their own file once you solidify the aesthetic of the elements on your

21
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.480
email page.

22
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.030
It is also worth noting some more advantages to external styling external styling follows the general

23
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.510
coding guidelines of separation of concerns and modular programming.

24
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.890
Also using external styling makes your code more scalable and easier to modify as it grows in size and

25
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.000
complexity.

26
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.370
When you want to change the style of an element all of the style of code is in one place and is not

27
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.030
all thrown directly into the HVM I'll file where it will make it harder to navigate the HVM l file in

28
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.120
the next lecture.

29
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.200
We were learn about CSSA syntax.
