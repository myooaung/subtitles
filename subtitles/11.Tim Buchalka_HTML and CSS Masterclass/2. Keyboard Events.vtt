00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.980
In this lecture we will learn about keyboard event.

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.000
There were three G-mail keyboard events that fire in the following order on key down on key press and

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.690
on key up the key down event is fired when the user presses a key down on the keyboard.

4
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.280
Let's add an input element to our Web page to see an example of the on key down event in action.

5
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.060
Next we will specify the input type to be text and add the on key down function.

6
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.520
We assign this event the value of a function name to be fired when the user presses down a key.

7
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.060
Next we will write the function to be called we will get an opening and closing script tag and we'll

8
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:53.120
create a function that displays an alert that says Auntie down.

9
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.300
Let's go to the web browser and write our code

10
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.560
when we hit a key we will notice that the on key down event is fired when we press the key down which

11
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.400
displays an alert in the web browser.

12
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.070
Then we will go back to the editor the on key press event is fired between the on key down and on key

13
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.100
up event.

14
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.670
If we change the event in our input field to be on key press you will notice that our alert is displayed

15
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.100
when we go to press the key to enter a letter into the input field.

16
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.790
Let's go to the web browser and vote our code as you can see the on key press event is triggered when

17
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.420
we press the key on the keyboard.

18
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.610
Let's jump back to the editor the on Chiappe event is fired when the user releases the key.

19
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.370
If we change the event in our input field to be Anchia the alert will be displayed and we release the

20
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.220
key after typing a letter into the input field.

21
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.430
Let's go to the web browser and write our code when we click and key and release it.

22
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.760
You will notice that the on key event is fired causing an alert to be displayed in the web browser HVM

23
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.220
else.

24
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.000
Keyboard events on key down on key press and on key up are useful and we want to run code when the user

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.640
presses a key on the keyboard.

26
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.300
In the next lecture we will learn about mouse events and HMO.
