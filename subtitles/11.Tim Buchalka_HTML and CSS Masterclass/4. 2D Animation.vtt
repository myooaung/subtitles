00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.540
In this lecture we will learn about 2-D animation and see SS to transform property allows us to move

2
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.310
rotate scale and skew elements by animating this property on our HVM elements we can make our elements

3
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.290
move on our webpage.

4
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.080
Let's start by creating a blue box on our page.

5
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.510
We will add a development to our Web page and Starla to have a width and height of 100 pixels and a

6
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.790
background color of blue.

7
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.890
We will then Center the div on our Web page horizontally by giving the margin left in margin right properties

8
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.510
of value of auto.

9
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.680
We will also add a 50 pixel margin at the top.

10
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.820
Next we will write the code for our animation we will specify that the animation will go from a rotation

11
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.140
of zero degrees to a rotation of 360 degrees.

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.390
We will link this animation to our element by adding the animation name and animation duration properties

13
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.420
to the style of our div..

14
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.770
We will use the animation iteration count property and specify a value of infinite to make the animation

15
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.230
repeat endlessly.

16
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.580
We will add the animation timing function property and give it a value of linear to give our animation

17
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.010
a consistent speed.

18
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.560
Let's go to the web browser and run our code or blue square now rotates 360 degrees on the web page.

19
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.200
Let's jump back to the editor.

20
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.240
Let's take a look at animating our square using translate as opposed to Rotti.

21
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.290
We will change that to and from lines in our animation code to use translate instead of Rotti then we

22
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.890
will go to the web browser and run our code now our block moves back and forth on our Web page.

23
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.500
Let's go back to the editor.

24
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.300
Next we will look at how we can animate the scale of an HMO element we will change our animation code

25
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.850
to go from point 1 or 10 percent scale to 1.0 or 100 percent scale then we will go to the web browser

26
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.920
and run our code as you can see the scale of our object now animates from 10 percent to 100 percent.

27
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.300
Let's jump back to the editor.

28
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.320
We can also animate the skew of our square.

29
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.090
We will change our animation code to animate the skew from 40 degrees to negative 40 degrees.

30
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.660
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the skew of our square is animated

31
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.190
from 40 degrees to negative 40 degrees and the next lecture we will learn about 3-D animation and see

32
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.770
SS.
