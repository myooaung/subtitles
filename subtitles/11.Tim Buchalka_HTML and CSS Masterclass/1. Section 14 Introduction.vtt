00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.700
In this section we will learn about the basics of CSX.

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.310
First we will learn what CSSA is and how we can create a CSSA style sheet.

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.480
We will look at how to use the HDMI link tag to link an external CSSA style sheet to an HMO web page.

4
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.580
Next we will compare and contrast when we should use an external CSSA style sheet versus when we should

5
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.210
embed the CSSA style code directly into the HVM l code using the style tag we will learn about the three

6
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.090
ways that we can style elements inline internal and external and the ideal use case for each.

7
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.610
After that we will take a closer look at CSSA syntax.

8
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.750
We will learn what terms like selector declaration property and value mean and the role that they play

9
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.370
in defining CSSA styles.

10
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.230
We will also look at the syntax of comments in CSSA then we will learn about cascading order which is

11
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.860
the order of precedence for CSSA styles cascading.

12
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.500
Order is an important topic as it defines what happens when inline internal or external styles conflict

13
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.870
with one another.

14
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.520
After that we will learn about the CSSA box model.

15
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.660
The box model is a conceptual way to understand the structure of HVM elements and how CSSA styles that

16
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.720
affect margin's borders and padding affect the display of the content of these elements.

17
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.450
Finally we will look at padding and margins and CSSA applying the concepts we learned in the box model

18
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.980
lecture hands on to gain a better understanding of these properties.

19
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.640
By the end of this section you will have an understanding of the fundamentals of C Ss.

20
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.800
You will be able to create external style sheets and link them to HVM files.

21
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.530
Additionally you will have a strong understanding of how HTL content can be modified using padding and

22
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.950
margins in the next lecture.

23
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.170
We will learn how to create a CSSA style sheet.
