00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.550
In this lecture we will recap what we learned in this section in this section of the course we learned

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.510
about some useful CSSA features.

3
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.730
First we learned about CSSA and these CSSA And these are combinations of letters and numbers that let

4
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.370
us display HVM male characters.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.550
We learned how to use several CMOS entities and how to mix them into our ASML content using the before

6
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.440
and after selectors.

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.500
We also learned how to add custom entities as bullet points to our lists.

8
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.270
Next we learned about the different types of units CSSA gives us to size elements on our Web page.

9
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.350
There are two types of sizes we can work with and SS absolute and relative an absolute length is a fixed

10
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.440
unit that will make an element display the exact size specified or relative length takes into account

11
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.500
factors like viewport size and scaling the element the absolute units that CSSA gives us our pixels

12
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.940
points millimeters picos centimeters and inches in terms of relative sizes.

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:22.150
We can specify units and E M E X S.H. R.E.M. VW VH V men v Macs and percent and E-M is relative to the

14
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.640
size of an element that e x unit is based on the size of the lower case X and whatever font we use another

15
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.370
relative font unit S.H. bases its size on the number 0 in a font.

16
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.690
S.H. stands for character the relative unit our GM sets the font size based on the root font size of

17
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.950
the web page.

18
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:53.500
R.E.M. stands for root and VW stands for a viewport with Unit 1 VW is equivalent to 1 percent of the

19
00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.310
viewport with of the H stands for a viewport height Unit 1 VH is equivalent to 1 percent of the viewport

20
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.390
height.

21
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.820
The main stance for the viewport minimum and this relative unit is based on it at a height or width

22
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.000
of the viewport.

23
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.650
Whichever one is smaller the max stands for a viewport maximum and this relative unit is also based

24
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.600
on the height or width of the viewport.

25
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.360
Whichever one is larger in the next section we will look at a summary of what we learned in this course.
