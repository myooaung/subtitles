00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.880
In this lecture we will learn about attributes that can be applied to any HVM element.

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.970
These attributes are called Global attributes the access key attribute lets us assign a key on the keyboard

3
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.490
to activate or focus an element depending on the browser you are using the key combination you need

4
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.760
to press may vary on Chrome Safari and Internet Explorer.

5
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.410
You press the old key and then the access key to activate or focus the element.

6
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.540
If you're using Firefox you press Allt shift and the access key to activate or focus the element the

7
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.840
class attribute allows us to specify a class that our HMO element belongs to.

8
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.130
Let's add a paragraph element with some example text to our Web page that we will use to demonstrate

9
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.070
the global attributes we will learn about in this lecture.

10
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.970
For this example let's say a class attribute with a value of class name to a paragraph element.

11
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.880
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

12
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.050
Let's jump back to the editor to specify a direction for element.

13
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.560
We use the DIR attribute of value of RTL we'll write the text from right to left on our Web page meaning

14
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.870
that our text starts on the right hand side of our Web page.

15
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.260
Let's add the DIR attribute to a paragraph element and give it a value of RTL.

16
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.590
Then we will run our code in the web browser to see the result.

17
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.260
Or is the default value for this property and means that the text will start on the left side of our

18
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.200
Web page.

19
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.960
Let's change the value of the dÃ¼rer attribute to multicar and then go to the web browser and run our

20
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.320
code

21
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.350
as you can see the text is now displayed from left to right.

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.530
Then we will go back to the editor the ID attribute lets us assign an ID to our element the lang attribute

23
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.570
lets us specify what language the content of the element is in a lang attribute with a value of E and

24
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.910
specifies that the language is English.

25
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.030
Giving the lang attribute of value of E.S. specifies that the content of the element is Spanish the

26
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.410
style attribute allows us to stylize our element.

27
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.330
For this example lets make our text the color blue then we will go to the web browser and run the code

28
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.740
to see the result of the code we just typed.

29
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.570
Let's go back to the editor the tab index attribute lets us specify the tab order for an element when

30
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.780
using the tab key to navigate a webpage a tab index of one will make an element selected on the first

31
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.690
click of the tab key tab index of two will make an element selected on the second click of the tab key

32
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.960
etc..

33
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.590
Let's add two more paragraph elements to our Web page for a total of three paragraph elements.

34
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.760
We will give the first element of tab index of three.

35
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.560
The second element the tab index of two and the third element a tab index of 1.

36
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.130
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code when we hit the tab key the first time.

37
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.200
You will notice that the third paragraph element is selected.

38
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.010
Since we gave it a tab index of 1 when we hit the tab key a second time.

39
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.110
The second element which we gave a tab index of to is selected.

40
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.370
Pressing the tab key a third time results in the first paragraph element being selected which we gave

41
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.160
a tab index of 3.

42
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.380
Let's jump back to the editor and look at the next example.

43
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.480
The title attribute lets us provide additional information about an element displayed when the user

44
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.170
mouse is over an element.

45
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.110
Let's have one paragraph element on our Web page and give it a title attribute.

46
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.060
Then we will give the title attribute of value of the text that will be displayed when the user mouse

47
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.050
is over the paragraph element.

48
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.350
Once we have done that we will jump to the web browser and run our code then we will go back to the

49
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.050
editor in the next lecture.

50
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.780
We will learn about HVM L5 specific attribute.
