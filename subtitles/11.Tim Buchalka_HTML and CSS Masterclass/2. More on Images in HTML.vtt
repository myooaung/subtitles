00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.170
In this lecture we will learn some more about images and each T.M. the alter attribute allows us to

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.240
provide text that will show only if there is a problem displaying the image on the web page.

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.800
Let's add an image element to our Web page.

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.220
We will give the image a source of our star PMG image then we will add to all the attribute and give

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.770
it some text to display if there's a problem showing the image if we want to see an example of the text

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.350
displaying we can misspell the file name of our image to force it not to load.

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990
Let's change the A in the image name to an O.

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.970
Then we will run our code in the browser as you can see the alked value that we provided is displayed

9
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.770
in the browser.

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.090
Since there was a problem displaying the image.

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.140
Let's jump back to the editor.

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.190
Don't forget to change the all when the image name.

13
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.140
Back to an A so that our image can be used in the following examples we can use the title attribute

14
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.780
to display a tool tip if the user hovers over the image with their mouse.

15
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.000
We will use the title attribute and give it a value of the text we want to be displayed when the user

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210
hovers over the image with their mouse.

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.430
Let's run our code in the browser then we will hover over the star image with our mouse.

18
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.710
As you can see the text that we specified as the title is displayed.

19
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.360
Let's go back to the editor and look at another example we can use the float property to specify if

20
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.160
we want our image to display to the left or right of text.

21
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.510
We will add a paragraph element with some text to our Web page that we will use to illustrate the effect

22
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.220
of the float property.

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.780
Finally we will add a style element to our Web page and specify that images should float to the right

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.920
of TX.

25
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.770
This will make our image display to the right of the text.

26
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980
Let's go to the web browser and write our code.

27
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.900
As you can see the image is displayed to the right of our text.

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.440
Let's go back to the editor.

29
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.400
Alternatively if we want our image to display to the left of our text we can change our float properly

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.100
to have a value of left.

31
00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.050
Let's change the float value to left and then run our code as you can see the image is now displayed

32
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.700
on the left hand side of R-TX then we will go back to the editor and look at another example.

33
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.640
CHMELA provides us the figure and Fig caption elements to display a caption under our image to create

34
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.160
a figure we can use to figure tag.

35
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.410
Any content that is part of our figure will be inside of the opening figure tag and closing figure tag

36
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.520
lets it an opening and closing figure tag to our code around our image element.

37
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.430
We can add these tags around our image to make our image part of the figure.

38
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.670
We can add a caption to our figure by using the caption tag.

39
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.890
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our image and its caption are displayed

40
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.170
together on our Web pages a figure.

41
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.090
Keep in mind that we can use elements other than images inside of our figure element and that multiple

42
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.710
images can also be used.

43
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.370
Let's jump back to the editor.

44
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.470
We looked at how we can add images to our Web page by using the image tag.

45
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.110
We can also use the starlight to reach background image property to add our images the background of

46
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.230
an element.

47
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.310
This allows us to display the image as the background of other elements like headings paragraphs etc..

48
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.550
For this example we will add a paragraph element to our Web page and give it an inline style.

49
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.200
We will use the background image property and assign an image using the L function.

50
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.210
We will also add the text content that we want the image to be the background of.

51
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.360
We will copy and paste the text content several times so that it is long enough where we will be able

52
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.640
to see the full background image behind it.

53
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.450
Note that if you choose to display the image in this manner you need to make sure that the image name

54
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.880
is within single quotes not double quotes since double quotes around the entire style.

55
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.370
Also notice that using this method we need to use the u r l function and then pass in the name of the

56
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.950
image.

57
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.830
It is OK if the image is a file names such as J or P and G and not necessarily an image zero.

58
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.560
Let's go to the web browser and run our code as you can see the image that we specified is the background

59
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.200
to our elements text content.

60
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.490
Let's go back to the Editor

61
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.970
Note that we can also add gifs using image tags Ted animated GIF images to our Web page.

62
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.590
Let's add an image element to our code and give it a source of our animated gif gif image.

63
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.500
Be sure to specify the file extension as Dot gef in the source attribute.

64
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.830
We will also give our elements a height and width of 200.

65
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.400
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code as you can see our animated GIF is displayed on

66
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.320
our Web page.

67
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.090
Let's go back to the editor another way that we can display images and HVM is using the picture tag

68
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.820
a picture element has multiple source elements of various sizes and whichever image is best for the

69
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.930
current size of the web browser is the image that is displayed.

70
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.370
First we will specify an opening and closing picture tag then we give our picture element to one or

71
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.190
more source elements the media attribute will specify the minimum with that the browser should be to

72
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.270
display that source image the source that attribute will specify the source of the image.

73
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.960
We will add the resource elements to our code.

74
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.220
We will use the media attribute and give it a min width of 1000 pixels 500 pixels and 200 pixels respectively

75
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.190
for each of our source elements.

76
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.140
We will then use the source set attribute and give it a source of our large star Medium star and small

77
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.720
star PMG images respectively.

78
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.390
The last child element of any picture element has to be an image element specified with the image tag

79
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.400
in case the browser the user is viewing the web page on does not support the picture tag or if there

80
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.100
is a problem loading the other specified images.

81
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.720
Let's add an image element and specify our star PMG image.

82
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.640
Then we will go to the web browser and run our code.

83
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.140
Now if we resize the browser you will notice that the different images are displayed depending on the

84
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.990
width of the browser

85
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.720
in the next lecture.

86
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.190
We will learn how we can embed video into web pages using HMO.
