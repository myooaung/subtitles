00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] Build packages are used

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.030
every time a build occurs, but usually we don't do a lot

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.050
of extra configuration we just specify the package type.

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.030
Once again let's jump to our Plugins page.

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.070
We're going to scroll down here to the packaging tools.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.050
We'll start at the top and start with the EAR.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.010
Now the EAR and the Enterprise Archive is used

8
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.040
for large scale J2EE or Jakarta EE deployments.

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.020
These EAR files actually alow you to put

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.050
all the other packages in them.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
Things like ejbs, wars, jars, rar files,

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.020
a whole list of things can actually go into an EAR

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.000
and an EAR allows you to deploy them once,

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.030
instead of deploying each one individually.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.060
On the Usage page you'll see that you have a little bit

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.020
of configuration that you can apply,

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.070
but really it's when you execute package and the packaging

18
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.090
of your artifact is EAR that this will get executed.

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.030
Again there's some advanced configuration,

20
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.000
but you can read through that on your own

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
if you're doing EAR file deployments.

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.020
Anymore very few of us are doing EARs so it's not

23
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.040
as important for a lot of us to understand it,

24
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.070
but if you are, all of your information is here.

25
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.030
Let's take a look now at the WAR file.

26
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.010
A WAR file is a web archive and the web archive

27
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.070
is what goes into an application server, specifically,

28
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.040
a web application server.

29
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.050
So this would be something as small as Tomcat or Jetty

30
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.060
or as large as WebLogic or WebSphere.

31
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.040
This is how we expose web applications,

32
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.010
whether they're websites or web services,

33
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.090
things like SOAP and REST are all defined in WAR files

34
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.030
until you get into modern embedded application servers,

35
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.010
but that's for another conversation.

36
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.080
You can take a look that there are some configuration

37
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.050
that you need to do, especially if you are deploying things

38
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.030
without a traditional web.xml file.

39
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.000
As you read through these documentations you can look at

40
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.090
not only the package structure

41
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.010
that a WAR file needs to have, but the way

42
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.030
that it works when it's actually executing.

43
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.020
If you are building WAR files today, learn this information.

44
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.060
Now let's jump back to the beginning here

45
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.030
and now we're going to take a look at JAR files.

46
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.010
JAR files are by far the most common project

47
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.050
that you will build.

48
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.020
And if you don't specify a packaging

49
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.060
this is what you're going to get anyway.

50
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.030
A JAR file is just that, it's a Java archive.

51
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.000
It can be put anywhere that you want to put code.

52
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.060
You can run it on your local machine,

53
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.040
you can run it on a web application server,

54
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040
you can run it on embedded servers.

55
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.090
JAR files really are the way that Java is packaged

56
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.050
in most situations.

57
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.010
Now when you're doing JAR files there are some things

58
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.010
that you can customize, things like the manifest

59
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.000
and the details that go into it,

60
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.080
some of the ways that the archive itself configured

61
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.020
and all of that is documented on this page.

62
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.080
But I do want to reiterate once again that if you are doing

63
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.080
traditional development, you most likely are doing JAR files

64
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.010
unless you specify something else.

65
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.050
And the really cool thing is that now

66
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.040
with embedded application servers and with the way

67
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.050
that cloud computing works I can use a JAR file

68
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.010
that has been shaded with an embedded application server

69
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.080
and I can run web applications through a JAR file today.

70
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.040
It's a little bit different way of thinking,

71
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.080
but JAR is really the way that most of us are doing

72
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.010
all of our development, whether it's a simple library

73
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.070
or a full scale application.

74
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.030
Now there are other packaging

75
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.090
and they're really beyond the scope of this course,

76
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.070
'cause they're not that common.

77
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.020
The one to look at it is the shade and we're going to focus

78
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.060
on that quite a bit later because shading is really powerful

79
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.090
if you want to build an application

80
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.060
that you can just hand to somebody

81
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.080
and let them run without having any other dependencies.

82
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.080
We're going to focus on that in the dependencies section,

83
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.000
later on in this course.
