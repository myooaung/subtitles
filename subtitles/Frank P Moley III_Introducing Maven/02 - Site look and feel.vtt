00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.070
- [Instructor] Now I don't want to sound too critical,

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.090
but Maven sites are not the prettiest.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.000
The CSS hasn't appeared to have changed in quite some time.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.010
As such, your organization

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.050
may want to invest some time into skinning the sites

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.000
to make them more visually appealing,

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.020
especially if you are providing them for outside teams.

8
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.010
Now while I'm not going to skin a site,

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.070
I do want you to see the wealth of documentation about it.

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.060
So I want you to navigate in your browser

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.070
to Maven dot Apache dot org slash plugins

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.030
slash Maven site plugins slash examples

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.090
slash creating skins dot html.

14
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.080
Now this is a wealth of documentation

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.020
about how to actually go about creating your custom skin.

16
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.030
Providing the style sheet as well as other behaviors

17
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.090
that you may want to add

18
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
to your site to make it more appealing.

19
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090
By using the skinning process,

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.090
you can actually make all of your sites look the exact same,

21
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
but different than anyone else's default skin.

22
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.000
Furthermore, you can make it match your corporate website

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.010
which is very appealing

24
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.060
if you're providing this documentation to a third party.

25
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.080
So throughout this page,

26
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.040
it gives you all of the instructions

27
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.090
on how to build, how to construct the CSS,

28
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.020
how to use Velocity templates, if you want to,

29
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.040
to get your html output,

30
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.090
and over on the left hand side,

31
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.020
there's very specific use cases.

32
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.000
Now one other thing that I also want to note

33
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.070
is you can actually scroll down

34
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.050
on the left side and go to the skins option.

35
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.020
You will see that there actually are some available skins

36
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.060
that you can just use as is.

37
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.020
We've been using the Maven default skin,

38
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010
and as I said, this has been out for quite some time,

39
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.080
but there's some more modern skins.

40
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.050
The Fluido skin is based on bootstrap CSS

41
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.040
from Twitter, for instance,

42
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.020
and there's several that have been retired

43
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.050
and as you scroll down,

44
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.080
you'll also see that there's some that are outside

45
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080
of Maven itself.

46
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.070
Now I'm not going to justify which skin is better than another.

47
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.090
That's all for your personal appearance,

48
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.080
and quite frankly,

49
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.050
if you really want to put time into skinning your site,

50
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.070
you're probably going to want to build your own,

51
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.060
but these skins that have already been built

52
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.020
can lead you down the path to building your site

53
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.090
much more efficiently

54
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.000
because you can see what other people have done.

55
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now again, this is not something that we're going to go

56
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.090
through in this course.

57
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.080
I just wanted you to be exposed

58
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.060
that that sort of red and white and black skin

59
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.040
is not something you have to live with,

60
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.030
which makes Maven sites just a little bit more appealing

61
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.000
when you can go customize them.
