00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.020
- [Instructor] Once again, we're going to briefly talk

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.020
about the build section here, since we will spend

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.010
a significant amount of time on builds later in this course,

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.010
but I do want to spend a few moments to introduce

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:20.030
the build configuration that I've already supplied for you.

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.030
Once again, let's navigate to the pom file

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.040
of our learning maven presidents project.

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.010
Now let's navigate down to the build section.

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.060
You'll see that instead of dependencies

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.040
we're now working with plugins.

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.000
While the definition of a plugin

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.080
is very similar to a dependency

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.000
there's actually a lot more configuration that is available.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.080
This is one place Maven does an amazing job

15
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.050
of documenting these configurations.

16
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.090
Now we have to find a couple of build plugins here,

17
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.030
and we will explain them in all their detail later,

18
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.050
but I do want to focus on the Maven compiler plugin.

19
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.050
You'll see it's a very basic configuration here

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.020
telling Maven to use the Java 11 compiler

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.050
and to target the Java 11 runtime.

22
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.030
Of course, we've replaced these with properties

23
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.000
from a previous video, but what I want to show you

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.020
is how to get this information for you for your plugins.

25
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.050
I want you go to your browser

26
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:37.010
and navigate to https://maven.apache.org.

27
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.040
In the left navigation pane

28
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.020
you'll see plugins towards the bottom,

29
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.000
and I want you to click on that link.

30
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.050
Now, you will see a list of Apache plugins.

31
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.000
There are also other providers that you can see

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.020
towards the bottom of this page as we scroll down,

33
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.080
things that are outside the Maven land.

34
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.040
So for now however, let's find the compiler plugin

35
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.030
and look at it by clicking on it,

36
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.000
and it's towards the top.

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.030
Now on the left side, I'd like you to click the usage link.

38
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.090
Here, you'll see basic configuration for the plugin.

39
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.040
Scroll a little further down on the left

40
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.080
and you will see several examples.

41
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.050
These are use cases that you can use

42
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.090
to build your configuration for a specific plugin.

43
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, what I would like you to do is select

44
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the Compile Using -source and -target Javac Options.

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.050
You'll see an example similar to

46
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.070
what I have done in the exercise files.

47
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.040
This documentation makes configuration

48
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.010
significantly easier, so use this site often

49
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.090
as it will help you.

50
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.030
Now I'd like to finally jump into the terminal

51
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.060
and I want to talk about how to execute a build.

52
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.010
While we are going to talk about the build lifecycle in detail

53
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.080
it's worth noting that executing the build

54
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.050
and everything up to it is as simple

55
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.040
as executing a Maven command,

56
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.060
and to do that let's first navigate to our project,

57
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.040
and we will execute Maven, mvn clean package.

58
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.070
Go ahead and hit enter.

59
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.040
Now the clean here is an optional command

60
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.090
but I use it often when I'm doing Maven projects

61
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.010
because it tends to remove issues

62
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.080
with other Maven operations.

63
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.050
Now the package command produces the final artifact

64
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.030
which in this case is a jar file.

65
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.060
You'll see that we have build success,

66
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.010
so if we navigate to our target directory at this point,

67
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.030
and then we do a ls -la, you'll see

68
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.080
that we have a jar file called

69
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.040
learning-maven-presidents-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar,

70
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.060
and that version, as well as the artifact name

71
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.020
comes from our pom itself, and the jar's also there,

72
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.080
you just don't see it, but we'll talk about packaging

73
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.020
as well later on.

74
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.000
That's all there is to building a project with Maven.
