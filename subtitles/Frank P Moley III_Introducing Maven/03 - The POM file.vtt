00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.020
- [Instructor] So that we've talked about Maven

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.060
and the Java project structure,

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.060
it's time to get into the heart and soul of Maven,

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.000
the POM.xml file

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.030
Often, you will hear a Java developer

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.080
who has experience with Maven tell you

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.030
to do something in the POM file,

8
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.000
but you may be asking what it is really.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.090
The POM file is the Project Object Model

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.030
it contains all of the details about the project,

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.080
the dependencies, the build,

12
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.050
and the reporting of the project itself.

13
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.030
The project information is top-level details of the project

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.030
This includes items like the group the project belongs to,

15
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.090
this is an organization unit in a Maven repository

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.000
and often corresponds to the root package of your project.

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.010
It also includes the project or artifact identifier,

18
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.060
this is the common name of your project.

19
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.020
Version is also included in the project information.

20
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.000
Most often developers use semantic versioning

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080
for Maven projects but there are also a few qualifiers

22
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.020
added like snapshot or release

23
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.040
which varies from project to project.

24
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.020
There are a lot of other sections in the POM file

25
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.050
and we're going to talk about some of them individually

26
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.070
as we go through this course.

27
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.030
As such, I want to introduce you to them here.

28
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.070
Properties are often underutilized but important

29
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.050
in both small and large projects.

30
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.010
Dependencies and the associated dependency

31
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.070
management sections are what most people

32
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.030
immediately think about when they're thinking about

33
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.050
Maven POM files.

34
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.050
There's also a build section that defines plugins used

35
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.070
to build your project.

36
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.020
Finally, there's a report section

37
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.010
which identifies how to report information

38
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.010
about your project.

39
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.090
Now there are a couple sections

40
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.020
that we are not going to talk about

41
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.040
but they are important when you need them.

42
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.030
These tend to be organization specific

43
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.090
instead of project specific but not always.

44
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.060
They include repositories which point

45
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.000
to Maven repositories for artifacts.

46
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.070
Plugin repositories which, as you might imagine,

47
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.040
point to the plugins used by Maven itself.

48
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.000
And then there are profiles allowing

49
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.040
for overrides of configuration

50
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.000
and providing default behavior for common tasks.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.040
Now these are all outside the basics of this course

52
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.090
because as I said, they're organization specific

53
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.090
most of the time.

54
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.060
We are now ready to dissect the most important sections

55
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000
of the POM file.
