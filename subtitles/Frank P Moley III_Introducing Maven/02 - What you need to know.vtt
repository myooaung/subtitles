00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Instructor] Before we jump into

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.010
working with Apache Maven,

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.070
I want to spend a bit of time

4
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.030
level-setting on the knowledge and tools

5
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.060
you will need to be successful in this course.

6
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.050
Starting with the skills you need,

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm not going to focus much time on the actual Java code.

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.070
That isn't the focus of this course.

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.040
As such, I'm going to expect you to know

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.030
how to write some basic Java.

11
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.010
I would like you to also know a little bit about

12
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.030
how Java artifacts work and are packaged.

13
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.050
While this isn't a core prerequisite,

14
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.090
it will help you better understand

15
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.060
the time-savings that Apache Maven is providing,

16
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.000
and why it is such a valuable tool to have in your toolbox.

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.080
One of the most important skills you need to know

18
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.050
is knowledge of proper XML syntax.

19
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.040
Apache Maven configuration is defined in an XML file,

20
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.080
and, as such, you need to know how to read

21
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.090
and be able to write proper XML documents.

22
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.020
Now, since this course is on Apache Maven,

23
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.020
you should have the tool installed on your machine.

24
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, I'm not going to go through the steps,

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.090
they're pretty simple,

26
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.060
but I do want to point out some of the high-level needs.

27
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.080
First and foremost, you need Java installed on your machine,

28
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.090
and specifically, a JDK.

29
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.070
I'm going to be running Java 11 on my machine,

30
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.070
but you should be able to do everything with

31
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.090
any modern, supported version of the JDK.

32
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.030
You will need to have Maven installed on your machine.

33
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
The installation is really just an unpacking

34
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.040
of the download file, if you are doing a manual install.

35
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
However, if you're using a Mac, for instance,

36
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.010
there's a tool called Homebrew to do most of these steps.

37
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.000
And there are similar ways to do this

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.050
with other operating systems.

39
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.000
You then need to ensure that

40
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.020
Maven executable is on your path.

41
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.090
This executable is named MVN, or Maven.

42
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.030
Now, many times,

43
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.090
you will see references to M2_HOME in Maven documentation.

44
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.040
This isn't a requirement of any operating system,

45
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.020
or of Maven itself.

46
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.090
It's just a convention of pointing to the root directory

47
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.070
with an environment variable, and then,

48
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.030
adding the bin directory under that environment variable

49
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.050
to your path.

50
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.020
More formal instructions are located

51
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.060
on the Apache Maven projects website.

52
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.060
Finally, you need somewhere to work in.

53
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.080
As such, you need an IDE or a text editor

54
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.010
to make all of your changes.

55
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.030
Really, it doesn't make a difference what you use,

56
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.010
but sometimes, syntax highlighting and formatting

57
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.060
is a nice benefit of modern text editors, or IDE's.

58
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.070
However, you can use Vim if you want to.

59
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.070
I will be using IntelliJ Ultimate edition.

60
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.060
I will have some nice features at my disposal

61
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.080
that I may use.

62
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.060
However, all of the tooling is available

63
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.040
through manual operations in your text editor or IDE

64
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.050
if you don't have equivalent functions.

65
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.030
And that really is all we need to get started,

66
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.000
so let's jump in to Apache Maven.
