00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.020
- [Instructor] So now that we've run through

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.030
the basics of Apache Maven,

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.080
you might be asking what's next in your learning path

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.020
with this fine tool.

5
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.020
But before we go there,

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.070
I want to take a brief minute to recap

7
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.000
where we have been in this course.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.010
We started off by looking at Apache Maven as a whole.

9
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.020
It's purpose, configuration, and components of Maven.

10
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.030
Then we dug into the build lifecycle

11
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.050
and the common build plugins.

12
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.050
And finally we ended on looking at the reporting aspects

13
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.010
of Apache Maven in a little bit more detail.

14
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.050
So now what?

15
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.030
I would encourage you to really explore

16
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.040
all of the possibilities of Apache Maven

17
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.060
for your build and reporting needs.

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.070
Look into building an archetype for use

19
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.040
in your organization.

20
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.090
Or maybe just a Parent POM

21
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.080
that your other developers can consume.

22
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.030
Maybe you might want to play around with the skin

23
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.060
of your Maven site.

24
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.000
Or even just implement a site for team documentation

25
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.070
if you're not already doing so.

26
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.000
All in all, it's just about playing with the technology.

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.070
Finally, I want to thank you for taking the time

28
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.070
to watch this course.

29
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.000
I truly enjoy creating content that helps developers

30
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.050
and as such, my commitment to you doesn't end here.

31
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.070
Often I spend time on Twitter or other networks

32
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.080
helping subscribers to LinkedIn Learning

33
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.060
understanding the concepts that we have discussed

34
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.010
in my courses.

35
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.000
Feel free to reach out to me

36
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
on all major development platforms as fpmoles.

37
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I am always happy to help.

38
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So thank you once again for your time

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.080
and I hope you enjoy Apache Maven

40
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.000
and find it as useful as I do.
