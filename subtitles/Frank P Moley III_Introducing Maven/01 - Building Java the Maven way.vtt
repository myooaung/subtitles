00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.070
- [Frank] Today's Java developer has several options

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.070
when building his or her applications.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
Apache Maven not only solves the build needs

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.000
of most developers, but extends itself to include

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.080
such areas as dependency management, unit testing,

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.070
documentation and reporting.

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.050
Now, you can achieve these same tasks with many other tools,

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.000
but Apache Maven provides a coherent, clean

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and extensible framework to build your applications,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.030
either as run-of-the-mill components

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.010
or as unique, complex, and customized builds

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.010
all with the same tooling.

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.030
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

14
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm a Software Developer and Architect who is passionate

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.050
about software, DevOps, distributed systems,

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.070
and ultimately learning.

17
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.010
In this course, we will focus on the basics

18
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.090
of using Apache Maven to build Java applications

19
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.030
and look at some of the more advanced features

20
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.060
along the way.

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.050
So with that said, let's go build some Java,

22
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.000
the Apache Maven way.
