00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.040
- [Instructor] Reporting is one of the great benefits

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.040
of Apache Maven.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.050
With the reporting structure,

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.010
you not only are able to generate documentation

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.050
about your project

6
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.090
but also documentation about the various aspects

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.060
of the build process.

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.030
Let's go back to our IDE

9
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.090
and open up the learning-maven-presidents

10
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.040
and then the pom file.

11
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.080
Now I want you to scroll down

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.050
to the reporting section.

13
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.060
And you will see the that I've only defined

14
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.080
one additional report.

15
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.050
And this is the Surefire Report.

16
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.060
This report provides information on your tests

17
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.070
as well as test coverage.

18
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.070
And you will see however that Maven has built

19
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.020
and support for a lot of reporting documentation

20
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.090
even without this report.

21
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.020
Now once again, we will spend a significant amount

22
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080
of time actually looking at reporting.

23
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.030
But for now, let's just look at the basics.

24
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.080
To generate the report, let's jump back

25
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.040
into our terminal.

26
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.040
Once again we're going to go to our learning-maven-presidents,

27
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.070
and we're going to type maven clean package

28
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.080
just like we did before.

29
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.000
But now we're going to add a site command

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060
onto this as well.

31
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.080
Now the reason that we're going to run

32
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.000
the package command here is so that we can get all

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.060
of the testing output, and the compilations done.

34
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
The site command actually would generate the documentation

35
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.040
for us.

36
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.060
Now once this command is done,

37
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.080
we need to navigate to the target site

38
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.090
and we're going to open up the index-dot-html file

39
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.040
and a browser.

40
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.060
So we're done.

41
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.050
We'll navigate to target, and then we're going to go to

42
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.030
the site directory.

43
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.030
And now I'm going to do an open on index-dot-html.

44
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.080
Now this opens up in my default browser,

45
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.020
which in this case is Chrome

46
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.050
and you'll see the very beginning, I have some information

47
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.060
about my project.

48
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.070
I've got when this was launched published,

49
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.080
the version of my project, and then the description

50
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.040
that came from my pom file.

51
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.080
So let's move around a little bit here

52
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.030
and take a look.

53
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.030
So on our project information,

54
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.040
we sort of have a hyperlinked page that gives us

55
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.030
all of the other reports that we can touch

56
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.070
that are by default part of the Maven site.

57
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.090
The about we've already looked at as the index page.

58
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.070
Now the plugin management is the plugins

59
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.020
that are available to Maven.

60
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.090
Now we didn't actually select any of these.

61
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.020
These all came for free with the Apache Maven.

62
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.040
When we click on the plugins,

63
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.000
we can look at some of the ones that we're using

64
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.030
and some of the ones that are available again

65
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.030
from Apache itself.

66
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.000
And then some things that we've configured

67
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.040
like the report plugins for Surefire.

68
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.020
Then there's this summary which gives us things

69
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.040
like the name, the description, any homepage

70
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.080
that we've specified on, anything about

71
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.040
our organization.

72
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.080
Specific details about the java version,

73
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.060
the type, the group ID and artifact ID.

74
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.000
Let's take a look at the project report section here.

75
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.070
You'll see that we've only have one list

76
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.070
and this is Surefire Report that we've specifically

77
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.000
had documented in our pom file.

78
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.070
Let's go ahead and click on that.

79
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.080
In the Surefire Report, you'll see that

80
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.030
we had one test that executed.

81
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.040
It executed with the success rate of 100%

82
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.000
and it took less than half a second.

83
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
There are no failures.

84
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.040
There's also a package list which gives us

85
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.040
all of the packages, and whether there were tests run

86
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.050
in each of those packages.

87
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.080
And then we get details about the group itself.

88
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.040
And all of the tests that we'll run for our group.

89
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.070
And this is just sort of how the Surefire Report

90
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.090
comes out.

91
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.050
And this is by default.

92
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.010
There are things you can do that sort of build

93
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.030
this up some more.

94
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.060
But this is just your default behavior.

95
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.040
But if you're publishing this to your management,

96
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.060
this starts to give them a way

97
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.080
to look at your project and know

98
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.070
that you're executing tests.

99
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.000
All of this simple report that came from a pom file.
