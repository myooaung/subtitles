00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] Properties in a POM file

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.040
are often an indication of someone

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.040
who has manipulated POM files for some time

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.010
and has felt pain that the properties aim to solve.

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.050
So before we jump into configuration,

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.040
let's talk about the purpose.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.090
Properties have several key features that I find value in.

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.000
First, is it reduces duplication.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.040
Often times when configuring the POM,

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.090
you find yourself putting the same value for an item

11
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.020
and properties helped reduce that.

12
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.060
In the same vain, it allows you to streamline configuration.

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.020
Often when used in conjunction with a parent POM,

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.000
which we'll talk about later,

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.010
you can radically improve the configuration.

16
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.070
You also get the benefit of keeping items in sync.

17
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.030
Especially versions of similar libraries.

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.050
Properties allow you to leverage a version once

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.040
and reference it.

20
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.020
Again, it stands in the same light

21
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.060
that once you have abstracted versions to a property,

22
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.050
you can upgrade in one place

23
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.010
by upgrading the property itself.

24
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.080
So let's open our project and specifically the POM file

25
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.060
in our presidents application

26
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.010
so that we can leverage properties.

27
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.040
So in the exercise files, you'll see that there is,

28
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.020
in learning Maven, a POM file

29
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.070
and there is also a directory

30
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.090
called learning Maven presidents.

31
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.070
Open that up, and open up the POM file in that directory.

32
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.030
This is the POM file for our project.

33
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.060
And we'll go through and talk about these

34
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.080
as we go throughout the course.

35
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.000
But the first thing that I want to do

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.040
is I want to add some properties here.

37
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.070
So we'll start with the properties section,

38
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.020
and then we're going to add a few properties.

39
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.000
The first one we're going to do is jackson.version

40
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.060
and the version that we are using is 2.9.8

41
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.070
and you can see that here

42
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.000
by scrolling down just a little bit.

43
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.090
We're also going to do an slf4j version

44
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.040
and we're using 1.7.25

45
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.090
and we're going to add a j unit.jupiter version.

46
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.000
Now you don't have to use properties just for versions,

47
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but this is one of the most common uses of properties.

48
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.080
Now we're going to mention a Java version

49
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.050
and in this case it's 11.

50
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.090
And then the last one that we're going to set

51
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.040
is a sure fire version.

52
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.080
Now if you're wondering how I picked which properties

53
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.060
we were going to choose, the way I did that

54
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.060
is by looking at what was replicated below

55
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.030
in the dependencies and the plug-ins.

56
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.070
So let's go to the first dependency

57
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.080
which is jackson and we've defined a property for that.

58
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.060
Now the syntax to reference a property is

59
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.070
dollar sign, curly brace,

60
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.090
and then you type in the property name,

61
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.090
in this case jackson.version.

62
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.000
We're going to do the same thing

63
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.060
throughout the rest of our POM.

64
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.020
Wherever we've created a property that we can use,

65
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.000
we're going to go ahead

66
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.060
and replace the value with that property.

67
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.080
Now not everything has a property

68
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.040
because we haven't duplicated them,

69
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.030
so there's no real value yet in adding them.

70
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.070
Now some projects reference properties for everything

71
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.090
and that's totally up to the developer.

72
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.060
As I finish this up,

73
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.050
we should get to the point

74
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.080
where there is no more duplication of version numbers

75
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.000
in our project.

76
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.090
You'll see that I don't just have to use it for versions,

77
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.040
I can actually use it here for a Java version.

78
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.000
Which, while it is a version technically,

79
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.090
it's not a plug-in version or a dependency version,

80
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.070
it's a configuration version.

81
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.090
This is really powerful

82
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:18.010
if you want an easy way to upgrade your Java versions.

83
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.030
And with that, we're good to go.

84
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.090
Now this variable syntax for referencing properties

85
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.070
is also leveraged by the platform itself.

86
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.010
There are a plethora of properties

87
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.020
that you can tie into when doing your project processing.

88
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.070
And I suggest you read up on the Maven documentation,

89
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.000
especially around interpolation.
