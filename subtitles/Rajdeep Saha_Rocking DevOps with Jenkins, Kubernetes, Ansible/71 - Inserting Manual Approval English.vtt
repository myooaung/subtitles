00:00.090 --> 00:01.110
From time to time.

00:01.110 --> 00:05.550
You want to insert a manual approval step in your aid pipeline.

00:05.850 --> 00:09.600
In this lecture, we're going to learn how you can do that using Jenkins.

00:09.630 --> 00:10.170
All right.

00:10.170 --> 00:10.920
Let's get started.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.470
I'm in a sample Jenkins job.

00:13.500 --> 00:19.440
It is pretty straightforward to pause the Jenkins job and wait for user input.

00:19.470 --> 00:25.740
You simply need to give input, message, colon, and then whatever message you're going to give, Jenkins

00:25.740 --> 00:29.160
is going to display that, and Jenkins will show two buttons.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.610
One is proceed, another one is abort.

00:31.620 --> 00:32.770
So if you click, proceed.

00:32.790 --> 00:35.280
Jenkins will continue the build.

00:35.640 --> 00:42.450
So in this case, I am putting this input message in its own steps and it's on stage.

00:42.750 --> 00:43.700
But it's up to you.

00:43.710 --> 00:50.250
You can even put this inside an existing step like this, and that would also work.

00:51.330 --> 00:55.410
And for this Jenkins example, I'm using demo from before.

00:55.650 --> 00:59.040
So this Jenkins file is invoking a lambda.

00:59.070 --> 01:05.340
The function name is Get Bitcoin Price, which gives you the Bitcoin price and then we display the results

01:05.520 --> 01:07.050
using this cut command.

01:07.230 --> 01:10.800
All right, let's click save and then click Build now.

01:11.370 --> 01:11.760
All right.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.480
So now it is paused in manual approval.

01:15.960 --> 01:21.050
So if you hover over mouse, it is going to give you the option, proceed or abort.

01:21.060 --> 01:26.310
So if you want to proceed, you click proceed and the job will continue.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.510
There we go.

01:27.690 --> 01:34.020
Alternatively, you can click this dropdown icon by the build number and you could see this option paused

01:34.020 --> 01:34.680
for input.

01:34.680 --> 01:35.880
You can click that.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.210
That's going to show the same message and you can click proceed here.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.950
And that will do the same thing.

01:41.550 --> 01:46.470
This is the most straightforward way to introduce manual approval directly in Jenkins.

01:46.950 --> 01:48.630
There are other alternative ways.

01:48.630 --> 01:55.230
For example, you can invoke a step function from the Jenkins file and you can add manual approval in

01:55.230 --> 01:56.130
step function.

01:56.250 --> 01:56.880
All right.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
That's it for this one.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.120
I'll see you guys in the next video by.
