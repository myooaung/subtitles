Welcome boys and girls, to a sample pipeline job demo.

00:05.730 --> 00:11.430
So in the last lecture we understood how to run a freestyle project, so we copied over our git repository

00:11.430 --> 00:14.210
and displayed the content of one file.

00:14.220 --> 00:18.720
So in this lecture we are going to do the same, but with a pipeline project.

00:18.720 --> 00:24.330
So I'm going to name this job sample pipeline job to and select pipeline, then click.

00:24.330 --> 00:27.720
Okay, so I'm going to scroll down.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.130
So for Pipeline Job, everything is controlled through the script.

00:32.130 --> 00:37.110
So let's click Hello World by default.

00:37.110 --> 00:41.010
It just gave us one stage which is stage hello.

00:41.010 --> 00:53.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to replace this with copy git report and this is a cool thing.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.660
So here I need to write some code to copy over the GitHub repository.

00:57.870 --> 01:04.830
So Jenkins gives this pipeline syntax which can be used to generate the code.

01:04.830 --> 01:13.920
So let's click this pipeline syntax and from the sample step dropdown, I'm going to select Git and

01:13.920 --> 01:16.830
then I'm going to give the repository URL.

01:16.830 --> 01:19.230
So this is going to be the same repository as before.

01:19.230 --> 01:24.240
Branch is master no credential needed because it's a public repository.

01:24.480 --> 01:24.930
All right.

01:24.930 --> 01:31.230
And then I'm going to click Generate Pipeline Script and then I'm going to copy this, go back to our

01:31.230 --> 01:33.600
job and simply put it here.

01:33.780 --> 01:41.550
Now, if I want, I can display the content in the next step, or I could create a different stage.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.270
So let's create a different stage just for fun.

01:45.270 --> 01:49.380
So I'm just going to copy this block and then paste it here.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.500
I'm going to name the stage as a display.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.430
Read me.

01:53.430 --> 02:00.990
So again, I'm going to click pipeline syntax and then I'm going to select our shell script.

02:02.880 --> 02:09.450
So Kurt, read me that MD Pipeline script.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.370
Simply copy this.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.780
Go back to the job.

02:13.750 --> 02:14.410
Best tear.

02:15.450 --> 02:23.070
Also, if you noticed under this pipeline script, you have way more options than what was available

02:23.070 --> 02:25.260
under build for free style projects.

02:25.260 --> 02:28.860
So that's another thing that's a little bit different.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.740
Go back to the job, click save.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.330
And then let's click build now.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.080
All right.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.710
So our pipeline job has run.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.690
You have two options to check out the logs.

02:41.750 --> 02:47.150
If you want to check out the logs for the specific stage so you can just bring your mouse over here

02:47.150 --> 02:51.200
and then you can click logs and it is going to show the logs.

02:51.200 --> 02:56.640
So this tab basically copied over the git repository and the next step the same way if you click roll,

02:56.660 --> 03:04.310
log it, just showing the content of the file or the way I do it is I just go here, click this small

03:04.310 --> 03:11.210
arrow icon and then click console output and then it shows your familiar console output in one place.

03:11.570 --> 03:13.520
And this is how you create a pipeline job.

03:13.670 --> 03:15.230
All right, folks, that's it for this one.

03:15.230 --> 03:17.090
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture.
