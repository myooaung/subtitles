Welcome, boys and girls, to a quick lecture.

00:02.610 --> 00:10.140
So in last couple lectures we used Jenkins environment variable called Build Underscore Number, and

00:10.140 --> 00:12.870
we pass that from one job to a downstream job.

00:13.230 --> 00:17.730
But how would you know the list of all environment variables that Jenkins has?

00:18.240 --> 00:26.700
So the way you find out is you go to your Jenkins main page and then at the end of the URL, just put

00:26.700 --> 00:35.210
a front slash and then EMV dash pass, dot, XHTML, press enter.

00:35.220 --> 00:42.510
And this should open up the page with all the available environment variables that you can use inside

00:42.510 --> 00:43.800
your Jenkins file.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.750
Our Jenkins jobs in general.

00:46.140 --> 00:46.560
All right.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.130
So like I said, go to your dashboard.

00:49.140 --> 00:57.690
So basically the main Jenkins URL and then append slash EMV, dash fas dot XHTML, and that should give

00:57.690 --> 00:58.440
you the list.

00:58.470 --> 01:00.000
All right, folks, that's it for this one.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.710
I'll see you guys and girls in the next one.
