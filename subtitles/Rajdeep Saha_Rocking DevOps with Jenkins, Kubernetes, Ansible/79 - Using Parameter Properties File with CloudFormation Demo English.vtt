In this lecture, we are going to learn how you can specify the values of all this cloud formation input

00:08.460 --> 00:15.240
parameter in a properties file and use the name of that file to pass in the Jenkins job parameter.

00:15.240 --> 00:22.230
So so far we have been specifying those cloud formation parameters like this under parameter dash overrides

00:22.230 --> 00:22.860
field.

00:23.610 --> 00:31.620
So instead of that we created this WordPress underscore parameter dot properties file and we just specified

00:31.620 --> 00:35.070
all the cloud formation input parameter as key value.

00:35.730 --> 00:36.960
So note the format.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.310
This is very important.

00:38.310 --> 00:42.660
The format of the dot properties file is an array and then key value.

00:43.020 --> 00:47.400
If you just has one input parameter, you can just do like this.

00:47.400 --> 00:51.510
If you have multiple like this, you can just come separate each key and value.

00:51.510 --> 00:58.350
So let me save this note that we already ran this cloud formation and we have our WordPress running

00:58.350 --> 00:59.760
from the previous demo.

01:00.090 --> 01:06.630
So I change this DB password a little bit so that when we resubmit this job, cloud formation sees that

01:06.630 --> 01:10.860
something has changed, create the chain set and then make the changes.

01:11.490 --> 01:15.720
If you skipped the last demo, then you don't need to change anything.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.730
You can just submit as is.

01:17.730 --> 01:25.050
So looking at the Jenkins file, so far we have been using the Jenkins parameter within this command

01:25.050 --> 01:29.760
as Doppler and then the curly braces and then the name of the parameter.

01:30.540 --> 01:37.650
And then we are accepting the name of the parameter file with this name parameters, underscore file,

01:37.650 --> 01:38.670
underscore name.

01:38.670 --> 01:44.520
So if we scroll down, scroll right, the dash dash parameter overrides.

01:44.610 --> 01:48.450
If you just put like this, this is going to air out.

01:48.450 --> 01:55.230
So this is a little bit weird because what Jenkins does is Jenkins doesn't know that this is a name

01:55.230 --> 02:00.750
of a file for some reason, and this only happens for this parameter overwrite fail.

02:00.750 --> 02:07.110
Because if you pass a name of the file within a variable for template file, it works fine.

02:07.680 --> 02:14.100
So for the parameter overwrite file, you have to put this file, colon, slash, slash and Jenkins

02:14.100 --> 02:14.820
will know that.

02:14.820 --> 02:16.920
Okay, this is a parameter properties file.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.690
So let me save this.

02:18.780 --> 02:22.020
I'm going to push the changes to my GitHub repository.

02:26.250 --> 02:26.700
All right.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.780
So everything is parameterized right now.

02:29.790 --> 02:34.200
Let's go back to Jenkins job click build with parameters.

02:34.980 --> 02:39.420
So for the stack name, I'm going to reuse the existing step name values.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.240
So if I go to cloud formation, the name of the stack name is WordPress.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.790
That's test zero one.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.270
I mean, I'll tell it.

02:46.290 --> 02:50.760
Alternatively, you can create a new stack as well, but I'm just going to use that.

02:51.420 --> 02:54.210
Now the name of the parameters file.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.640
So I push the parameters properties file.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.740
So this is the name.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.490
So I'm just going to copy this.

03:00.290 --> 03:02.090
And then posted here.

03:03.230 --> 03:06.320
And then the template name or press start.

03:06.370 --> 03:08.120
Jason Go back.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.450
Jason And then the region.

03:11.570 --> 03:18.350
Another thing is, let's say the parameter file is within a subfolder within your GitHub repository.

03:18.830 --> 03:24.710
Let's say the folder name is parameter, so you can simply give like this file, colon slash, nice

03:24.800 --> 03:30.170
name of the sub folder and then dollar the name of the Jenkins input parameter.

03:30.860 --> 03:34.820
Anyway, we are using the main branch for everything without any sub folder.

03:35.630 --> 03:37.820
All right, so let's click build.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.620
Let's go to the console output.

03:42.250 --> 03:42.590
All right.

03:42.630 --> 03:44.610
Just waiting for the chance set.

03:44.830 --> 03:50.020
I'm going to pause the video for a minute and then I'm going to log into cloud formation console on

03:50.020 --> 03:51.160
my account.

03:51.190 --> 03:51.550
All right.

03:51.570 --> 03:53.020
OnStar has been updated.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.010
All right.

03:54.010 --> 03:57.580
So now we know how to pass parameters into cloud formation.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.750
We learned it in two different ways.

03:59.770 --> 04:03.160
One way is to hardcore them into the Jenkins file.

04:03.280 --> 04:08.290
The other way is using a properties file and past the name of the file to the Jenkins file.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.150
All right, folks, that's it for this one.

04:10.180 --> 04:12.130
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture.
