00:01.700 --> 00:05.280
Now let's go over the Argo CD set apart.

00:05.300 --> 00:12.110
So I spun up a X cluster, which is a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using a case, it'll create cluster

00:12.110 --> 00:12.680
command.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.990
But not that this demo will work with any Kubernetes cluster.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.560
It doesn't need to be on a W.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.110
S for setting up Argos CD.

00:21.140 --> 00:24.260
I'm going to just follow their documentation.

00:24.470 --> 00:29.030
I'll give all the links in the description, so I'm just going to follow each step.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.910
So first, so I'm going to install Argo CD.

00:35.420 --> 00:38.400
Next, I'm going to download Argo CDC ally.

00:38.420 --> 00:42.490
So if you are using a mac, you can run this brave install argo city.

00:42.500 --> 00:47.210
I am on windows so I'm going to run chaco, install Argo quickly.

00:47.330 --> 00:51.320
Note that if you are using the UI like we are, you don't need to do this.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.720
But I'm just going to show you just in case.

00:57.020 --> 01:03.270
And you can access the legacy API server using a load balancer or ingress or port forwarding.

01:03.290 --> 01:07.160
For this demo, I'm just going to do port forwarding because that's the easiest.

01:10.020 --> 01:15.050
So note that once you run this command, this terminal, the command will keep on running.

01:15.060 --> 01:18.990
So I'm going to create another terminal to run the other commands.

01:18.990 --> 01:22.230
But at this point, our city should be up and running.

01:22.230 --> 01:25.380
So let's go to localhost colon 88.

01:26.110 --> 01:27.340
You'll get this warning.

01:27.340 --> 01:30.460
You can ignore it because we are just running from localhost.

01:32.370 --> 01:32.730
All right.

01:32.730 --> 01:40.590
In that username you give admin and to get the password, you copy this command, go back to terminal.

01:40.890 --> 01:43.170
So I'm going to switch to the other terminal.

01:43.170 --> 01:49.320
And if you are running in windows you can delete this best 64.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.650
So I'm going to run this so you'll get this output.

01:52.650 --> 01:56.880
So again, if you're in the Mac and you can run the full command, you can just copy paste.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.990
But in Windows we have to decode this best 64.

02:05.390 --> 02:10.090
So go to this base64 decode, encode and then decode.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.900
So this is the password.

02:13.110 --> 02:14.850
Go back to Argo City.

02:15.980 --> 02:16.850
Signing.
