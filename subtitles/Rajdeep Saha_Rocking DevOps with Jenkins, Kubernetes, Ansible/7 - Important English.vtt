00:00.120 --> 00:06.300
There are so many DevOps tools and so many different DevOps topics that it could get little overwhelming

00:06.300 --> 00:07.410
and confusing.

00:07.650 --> 00:13.680
You might be thinking exactly what topics you should master to get your DevOps job.

00:14.100 --> 00:20.790
In this video, I'm going to go over exactly what skill you need to master to get a job.

00:21.330 --> 00:29.070
I have created and curated this flowchart by going through hundreds of DevOps jobs, as well as from

00:29.070 --> 00:37.170
my practical experience of interviewing for DevOps position, both as a interviewee and an interviewer.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.030
All right, let's get started.

00:40.620 --> 00:47.910
So I have divided the skills into two broad categories must have and highly recommended.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.830
The names are self-explanatory.

00:49.830 --> 00:54.840
You have to know the areas that is under master technology and highly recommended.

00:54.870 --> 00:57.300
It will separate you from other candidates.

00:57.980 --> 01:01.700
So the first thing you need to understand is Linux commands.

01:01.730 --> 01:03.020
Now, don't panic.

01:03.050 --> 01:06.380
You don't need to understand the inner workings of Linux.

01:06.380 --> 01:10.460
And what are the intricate differences between different Linux versions?

01:10.490 --> 01:17.780
You need to know the commands that can be used with DevOps tools as well as for your data operations.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.170
Next thing you need to master is git commands.

01:21.320 --> 01:28.520
So Git and Git have specifically is deeply integrated with any DevOps tools in the market.

01:28.640 --> 01:34.700
So you need to understand how to check in your code, how to do a pull request, how to resolve fashion,

01:34.700 --> 01:37.310
conflict, how to roll back, etc..

01:37.340 --> 01:40.790
Next thing you need to know is infrastructure as code.

01:40.820 --> 01:46.280
I have given two choices here for the companies who do most of their work in NWS.

01:46.310 --> 01:49.070
They use cloud formation so you can master that.

01:49.250 --> 01:53.550
Alternatively, you can learn TerraForm, which is cloud agnostic.

01:53.570 --> 01:58.350
Next topic you need to master is at least one dev hub service.

01:58.370 --> 02:04.580
So this is the actual DevOps tool using which you are going to create your DevOps pipeline.

02:04.610 --> 02:07.610
I have given three different DevOps tools here.

02:07.880 --> 02:17.150
If your project is 100% native, then you should learn it as provided DevOps tools such as code, build

02:17.150 --> 02:19.460
code, commit code, pipeline, etc..

02:19.550 --> 02:21.050
And then Jenkins.

02:21.050 --> 02:22.970
And the third one is GitLab.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.550
I highly recommend Jenkins.

02:25.580 --> 02:30.950
Most of the jobs require Jenkins as the preferred choice of DevOps tool.

02:30.980 --> 02:33.350
It is still the number one tool.

02:33.620 --> 02:39.110
Learning Jenkins will open the most amount of job opportunity for your DevOps career.

02:39.140 --> 02:44.800
Now the next thing you need to know is DevOps pipelines as in workflows.

02:44.810 --> 02:51.860
Just learning the tools is okay, but you need to understand how you implement different workflows using

02:51.860 --> 02:52.550
that tool.

02:52.580 --> 02:58.790
For example, how do you build and push Docker container images to a container repository?

02:58.910 --> 03:02.810
How do you deploy your container to a Kubernetes cluster?

03:02.840 --> 03:05.840
How do you run Shell script from Jenkins?

03:06.170 --> 03:11.330
How do you submit your infrastructure as code from your DevOps tool?

03:11.390 --> 03:14.720
How do you trigger a lambda from Jenkins?

03:14.750 --> 03:21.800
How do you install your software into easy to using Ansible with Jenkins and much more?

03:21.830 --> 03:28.940
A lot of candidates don't do this part and hence they don't understand the pros and cons of different

03:28.940 --> 03:31.250
ways to do different workflows.

03:31.280 --> 03:38.420
Next, we go into the highly recommended area, so you should master at least one of the relevant technology

03:38.420 --> 03:42.020
amongst Kubernetes, lambda or traditional ESI two.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.200
So Kubernetes is highly recommended here.

03:45.200 --> 03:51.470
And finally, you need to bring all your learnings together and do some practice, interview, question

03:51.470 --> 03:52.460
and answer.

03:52.460 --> 03:59.450
And after you do all that, you should be able to apply for almost all DevOps jobs and get the job.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.960
So let's go over what's covered in this course.

04:03.080 --> 04:08.420
So in this course, we are going to go over the Linux commands that you need for your DevOps job.

04:08.420 --> 04:16.130
Now Git and GitHub is its own separate area, but in this course I'm going to go over the essential

04:16.130 --> 04:19.650
git commands that are critical for your DevOps job.

04:19.670 --> 04:23.670
Next, I'm going to go over the cloud formation basics.

04:23.690 --> 04:30.950
I have kept the TerraForm icon here because I'm going to go over TerraForm workflows during DevOps pipeline.

04:31.190 --> 04:35.240
Next one, we are going to go over Jenkins in depth.

04:35.510 --> 04:42.170
If you complete the Jenkins parts of this course, you should be all set for the interviews as well

04:42.170 --> 04:44.000
as your actual projects.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.850
Next part is DevOps pipeline.

04:46.880 --> 04:53.150
As part of this course, we are going to go over multiple workflows, the workflows I mentioned in the

04:53.150 --> 04:55.580
previous slide as well as more.

04:55.610 --> 04:58.010
The next area is Kubernetes.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.330
Kubernetes is its own huge area on itself.

05:02.540 --> 05:09.500
But as part of this course, I'm going to go through Kubernetes primer because we are doing a lot related

05:09.500 --> 05:16.220
to Kubernetes with DevOps, such as building an image, pushing it to registry, deploying your application

05:16.220 --> 05:22.580
container, image to Kubernetes, cluster, etc. That's why I wanted to go through the basic lectures

05:22.580 --> 05:28.430
so that you have some sort of foundation to understand those lectures as well as go forward and learn

05:28.430 --> 05:29.750
more of Kubernetes.

05:29.870 --> 05:34.610
Next, I'm going to go over the DevOps interview question and answer.

05:34.610 --> 05:42.560
So the ideal recommended path is you can learn the Linux command from this course and then from Git

05:42.560 --> 05:49.850
and GitHub, you can check out my highest rated rocking Git and GitHub, a real world guide course for

05:49.850 --> 05:52.160
cloud formation and TerraForm.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.700
You can learn that from my rocking cloud formation.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.500
CDK with the DevOps.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.060
Interview guide course.

05:59.060 --> 06:06.170
And for the Kubernetes, check out my highest rated rocking Kubernetes with Amazon Ex Forget and DevOps

06:06.170 --> 06:06.770
course.

06:06.860 --> 06:12.020
Now again, I don't want it to make it sound like you have to get my courses.

06:12.020 --> 06:17.930
But since they are the highest rated and best seller and students say good stuff about it, feel free

06:17.930 --> 06:18.850
to check them out.

06:18.860 --> 06:22.610
But if you already have some other courses, you have material.

06:22.610 --> 06:25.910
By all means, please go ahead and study from those.

06:26.270 --> 06:26.870
I know.

06:26.870 --> 06:30.080
I know what you folks are thinking right now, Raj.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.720
How about certifications and coding?

06:32.720 --> 06:35.420
You did not mention them in your flowchart.

06:36.130 --> 06:42.400
So think about certifications is SATs are good only to get recruiter attention.

06:42.610 --> 06:46.810
Once you go to the interview, no one cares about the site.

06:46.840 --> 06:52.630
You will be asked questions on the topics that I went through in the flowchart.

06:52.660 --> 07:00.490
If you do want to get a site to distinguish yourself from the other candidates, go for a sysadmin associate

07:00.490 --> 07:02.260
or a DevOps pro.

07:02.290 --> 07:04.240
You can also get Kubernetes sites.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.430
They are quite valuable at this point.

07:06.460 --> 07:12.370
Avoid super specific sites, especially if you are beginning your career in DevOps.

07:12.520 --> 07:20.290
Super specific sites like TerraForm sites are not that valuable and it has less bang for your buck.

07:20.290 --> 07:26.200
In most of the job applications, you would see that it is nice to have the DevOps certification or

07:26.200 --> 07:27.520
Kubernetes certification.

07:27.520 --> 07:34.630
In very rare occasions you would see someone asking for super specific certifications like TerraForm

07:34.630 --> 07:35.440
Ansible.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.970
Now about coding.

07:36.970 --> 07:41.350
Coding is not a primary requirement for DevOps jobs.

07:41.440 --> 07:48.910
It can be picked up at job and more importantly, there are no coding ground for DevOps interviews.

07:48.910 --> 07:53.020
That's why I did not put it under mask tab or highly recommended.

07:53.110 --> 08:00.250
It is kind of nice to have if you want you can learn one of the coding language and then run some dev

08:00.250 --> 08:06.340
hub scripts in it so that when the interviewer asks, Hey, can you tell me how you automated some of

08:06.340 --> 08:07.270
your processes?

08:07.270 --> 08:13.360
So you can say, in addition to using Jenkins and batch scripts and infrastructure as code, you could

08:13.360 --> 08:18.040
say that you have also used some sort of coding to run some scripts.

08:18.670 --> 08:22.870
And if you do want to learn some coding, learn Python.

08:22.900 --> 08:27.450
Python is very diverse and can be used in different areas.

08:27.460 --> 08:33.550
For example, for DevOps, you can use Python to run some scripts, you can use Python to code back,

08:33.550 --> 08:34.810
end up the APIs.

08:34.810 --> 08:42.790
Python can be used to write HTML programs, and recently Python even started to get used in the front

08:42.790 --> 08:44.020
end applications.

08:44.260 --> 08:51.160
Just for the record, I know Python quite well, but I learned it because I was in the project related

08:51.160 --> 08:56.920
to IML when I was giving interview for cloud architecture as well as DevOps.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.590
No one asked any questions on Python.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.750
All right, back to the flowchart.

09:01.780 --> 09:09.100
Hopefully this flowchart was helpful to reduce the confusion on your mind that what DevOps topics you

09:09.100 --> 09:10.930
should study and practice.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.250
That's it for this one.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.830
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture by.
