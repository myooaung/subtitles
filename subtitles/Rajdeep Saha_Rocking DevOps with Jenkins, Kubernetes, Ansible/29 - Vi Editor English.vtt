00:00.090 --> 00:01.720
Welcome, Cosmo Girls, to this lecture.

00:01.740 --> 00:05.980
In this lecture, we're going to learn about the infamous VI.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.240
ED So VI pronounced us.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.790
VI is a screen oriented text.

00:11.790 --> 00:15.540
Ed Originally created for the Unix operating system.

00:15.600 --> 00:22.740
This Ed is very popular because it comes preinstalled with all Unix and Linux distributions.

00:22.740 --> 00:29.340
So if you learn this once you can edit change files in any Linux or Unix distribution.

00:29.340 --> 00:33.060
However, VI ed could be a little painful to learn.

00:33.300 --> 00:40.290
Fortunately, in all, newer Linux distributions such as Amazon, Linux, two, Red Hat, Enterprise

00:40.290 --> 00:47.730
Linux Centaurus you can actually use your keyboard to do a lot of changes instead of going through commands,

00:47.850 --> 00:50.790
and that's what we are going to learn in this lecture.

00:50.820 --> 00:56.220
Most of the times the operating system you are going to use will be the newer operating systems.

00:56.220 --> 00:56.670
All right.

00:56.670 --> 01:01.440
So let's go to the terminal to create a file with VI editor.

01:01.440 --> 01:05.130
You simply type VI and then name of the file.

01:07.960 --> 01:12.970
Let's say I want to create a file named lan via txt press enter.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.320
It will open up the file.

01:15.250 --> 01:19.480
Now, one of the very important thing to remember is VI.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.950
Ed has two models.

01:20.980 --> 01:26.690
One is command mode and the other one is insertion mode in the command mode.

01:26.710 --> 01:30.590
You cannot insert anything in the file by default.

01:30.610 --> 01:33.710
Files in VI will open up in command mode.

01:33.730 --> 01:38.110
So even if I'm typing something on my keyboard, nothing will be inserted.

01:38.720 --> 01:46.670
To go into the incite mode to put something on the file you press the key I and you could see on the

01:46.670 --> 01:54.920
lower left corner we have this word insert now to notify that we are in the insert mode.

01:55.070 --> 01:58.880
Now, if I type something, they will be inserted into the file.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.690
Just to give you a test of the older VI.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.110
Let's say you want to write something on the second line.

02:06.410 --> 02:12.080
You had to go back to the command mode and you can go back to the command mode by pressing the escape

02:12.080 --> 02:12.740
key.

02:12.740 --> 02:19.010
And you could see as soon as I pressed the escape key, the insert notation on the bottom left went

02:19.010 --> 02:22.550
away, and now you press all key.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.110
That creates a new line and it also gets you into insertion mode.

02:27.870 --> 02:34.140
But fortunately in the New World Linux, you don't need to go back and forth with command mode and insert

02:34.140 --> 02:34.770
mode.

02:35.160 --> 02:42.090
Now you can press enter like any other keyboard editor and it will create a new line.

02:43.230 --> 02:49.140
Similarly, before to do copy paste, you had to do a bunch of stuff, but now you can simply go to

02:49.140 --> 02:50.910
another page.

02:50.940 --> 02:57.840
Let's say I'm in the Jenkins page, I'm going to copy this using control c come back to the high editor

02:58.020 --> 03:02.520
and then you can just press control V and that should work.

03:02.910 --> 03:06.540
Now, one handy thing to remember is undoing any change.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.870
So the undoing change command is you as an undo.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.560
But remember this, these are all commands.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.460
So to execute any command, you have to go back to the command mode.

03:17.910 --> 03:21.100
So as you can see, we are currently in the insert mode.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.380
Go back to the command mode.

03:22.380 --> 03:24.750
You have to press the escape key again.

03:24.750 --> 03:33.090
And then if you press the key, whatever you did last will be undo would be mindful of these two modes

03:33.090 --> 03:35.990
because it's very easy to mess things up.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.530
So let's say I'm in command mode and now I want to paste something.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.020
It will pass by to mess something up.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.010
Watch this.

03:44.010 --> 03:45.210
So I'm in command mode.

03:45.210 --> 03:47.490
I'm just going to press control.

03:47.490 --> 03:51.920
V As you could see, I wanted the line to be in the first line.

03:51.930 --> 03:56.430
It kind of pasted it, but then you could see it did not pass the whole thing.

03:56.760 --> 04:03.540
So I'm going to delete this again and then let me press escape to go back to the command mode, take

04:03.540 --> 04:05.340
my cursor to the first line.

04:05.490 --> 04:11.760
Now let's go to the inside mode by pressing I and then I'm going to pass something.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.700
As you could see now it passed properly.

04:14.850 --> 04:18.510
Personally, I find it very handy to remember the undo command.

04:18.930 --> 04:24.000
So let's say I go back to the command mode and then try to pass something.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.410
It messed something up.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.250
I see.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.330
I'm in the insert mode.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.600
I press escape.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.600
Press you to undo.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.770
Take my cursor up.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.210
Press I go back to the insert mode and then insert stuff again.

04:36.390 --> 04:41.310
You can use your keyboard arrow keys and delete keys with all the new Linux distributions.

04:41.310 --> 04:47.820
For example, if you want to delete this, you can simply delete using the backspace or delete.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.230
That's what I'm using.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.850
But again, a lot of the older Linux distribution, it was not allowed.

04:53.850 --> 04:58.260
So that was super painful when I was learning VI in my college days.

04:58.650 --> 05:04.050
So now let's talk about how to save the files or not save the files again.

05:04.050 --> 05:08.430
Remember, to save any file, you generally need to run a command.

05:08.550 --> 05:11.790
So always go back to the command mode.

05:11.790 --> 05:15.060
And to do that you press the escape key.

05:15.330 --> 05:16.830
It went to the command mode.

05:16.830 --> 05:24.870
If you want to save the file, but you want to keep the file open, you press colon and then w you could

05:24.870 --> 05:27.990
see the commands on the bottom left press enter.

05:28.170 --> 05:32.760
So now this line via the text file is saved, but it is still open.

05:33.360 --> 05:43.980
If you want to save the file and quit again, press colon in the command mode, press w, q and then

05:43.980 --> 05:45.300
press enter.

05:45.930 --> 05:49.950
All right, now the file is saved, but we got out of the file.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.140
You could see we got the command prompt back.

05:52.740 --> 05:54.480
So let me create the screen.

05:54.990 --> 05:57.000
To open up an existing file.

05:57.060 --> 06:06.300
You simply run the same command y and then learn via txt press enter it opened up the file.

06:06.330 --> 06:09.330
Now let's say you type something.

06:12.440 --> 06:18.290
And let's say you did a lot of changes and you don't want to go back and undo everything so you can

06:18.290 --> 06:28.070
quit the file without saving by pressing escape to go back to the command mode and then press colon.

06:28.830 --> 06:32.190
Q And exclamation mark.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.390
The press enter.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.620
It did not save.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.840
It just went out.

06:37.870 --> 06:40.210
Phi Phi Phi text again.

06:40.210 --> 06:46.720
You could see our changes are not saved and let's say you are in a file, you are just browsing it and

06:46.720 --> 06:50.740
you want to get out, basically quit without doing anything again.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.930
Press Escape To go back to command mode.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.670
The command is colon.

06:54.970 --> 06:56.710
Q Enter.

06:56.710 --> 06:59.680
So note that let me go back to the file again.

06:59.680 --> 07:10.390
Let's say I go back to the insert mode and then I put a line and you don't want to save this just typing

07:10.390 --> 07:12.100
escape to go to command mode.

07:12.100 --> 07:18.100
Colon Q is not going to work in a lot of Linux distributions if I press Q.

07:18.100 --> 07:25.210
Now, it senses that you already changed something, so just putting colon Q is not going to work.

07:25.210 --> 07:29.410
That is only going to work if you went into the file, you browse it and then you want to quit.

07:29.740 --> 07:38.200
If you are added something, you have to run colon Q and exclamation mark to overwrite any changes you

07:38.200 --> 07:38.650
did.

07:38.860 --> 07:40.480
So basically press that.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.710
And then if I go back again, the random line is not saved.

07:44.770 --> 07:45.340
All right.

07:45.340 --> 07:50.140
I'm going to give a cheat sheet attached to this lecture so you can refer to the commands.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.400
But couple of takeaways.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.760
People always mess up the command mode and insert mode.

07:54.790 --> 07:58.900
Remember, if you copy paste stuff in command mode, things will get messy.

07:58.990 --> 08:06.280
So always remember that you have to go to insert mode to press stuff and command mode to run the commands.

08:06.280 --> 08:12.550
And by default VI always stays in command mode and it shows it on the bottom left.

08:12.550 --> 08:20.290
Personally, I tried to use VI as less as possible because most of the time I would work in Cloud nine

08:20.290 --> 08:21.790
or Visual Studio code.

08:21.790 --> 08:29.020
So I'll just open up the files there and then do it in a regular editor and then save it and then use

08:29.020 --> 08:29.830
the scripts.

08:30.280 --> 08:35.080
But you might get some interview questions, especially if you are someone new in DevOps.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.170
They might ask you What are the modes in VI?

08:38.700 --> 08:42.880
How, what commands would you run to save the file, etc.?

08:42.880 --> 08:44.680
Again, refer to the cheat sheet.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.900
All right, folks, that's it for this one.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.180
I'll see you guys and girls in the next one by.
