00:00.090 --> 00:03.330
Welcome guys and gals to this cloud formation demo.

00:03.750 --> 00:10.110
So in this lecture we are going to run our very first cloud formation, but at the same time we are

00:10.110 --> 00:15.720
going to take a look at the cloud formation console and get ourselves familiar with it.

00:15.810 --> 00:21.570
Okay, so I'm in the trusty NWS console, so I'm going to search for a cloud formation.

00:23.870 --> 00:30.530
Klick this by default, it's going to take you to the stack screen where it's going to show you all

00:30.530 --> 00:31.970
your existing stacks.

00:32.240 --> 00:36.080
If you don't have anything yet, it's it's going to show empty.

00:36.710 --> 00:42.530
So now let's click create stack and with new resources standard.

00:42.530 --> 00:47.350
So as you can see, there are a couple of ways to submit a confirmation.

00:47.630 --> 00:54.500
So one way is if you have a confirmation template that you upload it into as three and then you can

00:54.500 --> 01:02.150
put the S3 URL here, or if you have a confirmation in your local computer, you can click this and

01:02.150 --> 01:05.000
then click Choose File and then upload the file.

01:05.570 --> 01:08.360
So we're we're not going to do that for this video.

01:08.660 --> 01:12.650
We're going to go the easy way since this is our very first confirmation demo.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.980
So we're going to click Use a sample template.

01:16.490 --> 01:20.510
So confirmation provides you with a number of templates.

01:20.900 --> 01:29.630
So if you click this dropdown, so you will see you have option of LAMB stack, Ruby on Rails stack

01:29.630 --> 01:31.790
and a WordPress blog.

01:31.790 --> 01:36.020
And then you have the multi A-Z version of those three and of the windows.

01:36.020 --> 01:40.070
And then there's this cloud from our tool that we're going to learn later on.

01:40.820 --> 01:43.910
You guys and girls are probably thinking, Huh?

01:43.910 --> 01:48.560
Raj All the stacks look pretty complex, like a lamp stack.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.680
WordPress Like where are the simple ones?

01:51.680 --> 02:00.590
Like easy to S3 sans, etc. We're not so click outside and then see this view.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.450
More sample templates.

02:02.570 --> 02:06.050
I click this button and it's going to open up another page.

02:07.240 --> 02:14.290
So clicking that opened up this page and here you can see templates and snippets via a service.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.010
So see this browse sample templates via WS service.

02:18.010 --> 02:20.860
So I'm going to click this sample templates.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.780
So let's click that.

02:23.320 --> 02:29.920
And here you can see individual confirmation templates for the main services.

02:30.340 --> 02:30.530
Okay.

02:30.550 --> 02:38.380
So I'm going to go for hello world of confirmation or hello all of us in general, which is SE three,

02:38.380 --> 02:38.980
right.

02:39.370 --> 02:45.820
So I'm going to go to this Amazon simple storage service and click it and then it's going to give you

02:45.820 --> 02:46.890
these two templates.

02:46.900 --> 02:53.470
One is Amazon S3 bucket with the deletion promise policy or Amazon S3 website.

02:53.730 --> 02:54.150
Okay.

02:54.160 --> 03:01.120
Here we are going to click this launch stack for Amazon S3 bucket with the deletion policy.

03:01.120 --> 03:08.400
So if you click that so you can see it brings you back to that confirmation create stack screen.

03:08.410 --> 03:11.860
However it has this Amazon S3 URL filled up.

03:12.460 --> 03:20.500
So what happens is any time you upload a template file or you want to run a template file confirmation

03:20.500 --> 03:23.950
automatically uploads it into an S3 bucket.

03:23.950 --> 03:25.630
It refers it from there.

03:25.810 --> 03:34.090
Okay, so now scroll down and click next and it automatically gives the stack name for the cloud formation.

03:34.270 --> 03:35.560
Click next.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.510
Scroll down.

03:37.510 --> 03:38.860
Click next.

03:40.510 --> 03:40.860
Okay.

03:40.870 --> 03:44.290
Scroll down and then click Create Stack.

03:45.190 --> 03:51.130
And as soon as you click that, you will see our stack with the name as three retention sample.

03:51.490 --> 03:54.400
The status is creating progress.

03:55.060 --> 03:58.150
So on the right side, there are multiple tabs.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.160
One is the stack info.

04:00.580 --> 04:06.370
So this is basically the stack ID and the description and then the status.

04:06.490 --> 04:08.260
A couple of other things.

04:08.260 --> 04:08.550
Okay.

04:08.650 --> 04:15.130
So if you click the events even shows what's happening behind the scene when the cloud formation is

04:15.130 --> 04:15.730
running.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.790
So it's more useful.

04:18.790 --> 04:25.000
Like if something fails and then you come to events, then it gives you a little bit more information.

04:25.060 --> 04:29.770
I wanted to show you guys and girls the event section because it's pretty handy.

04:29.770 --> 04:36.730
Like I mentioned, if the stack failed, it kind of gives you which state failed and the reason.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.570
So this is one of the stack that fell that I submitted.

04:40.570 --> 04:43.930
So you can see it says Rollback in progress.

04:44.200 --> 04:51.460
The following resources fail to create and then it says, Hey, this API is security group.

04:51.460 --> 04:54.400
You are not authorized to perform this operation.

04:54.670 --> 04:58.210
So the event is pretty handy and it gives you a timestamp.

04:58.630 --> 05:03.430
So you know what happened when along with the failure messages and reasons.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.270
Okay, we are back to our SE three stack resources shows you the resources that the cloud formation

05:10.270 --> 05:11.080
spun up.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.050
So this confirmation spun up S3 bucket.

05:14.350 --> 05:20.230
So basically it gave the logical ID, physical ID and the status and we click this.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.210
So it should open up the S3 bucket that just got created.

05:26.950 --> 05:33.250
For the output section so you can print certain things from the cloud formation if you want, and then

05:33.250 --> 05:36.040
all that stuff comes into the output section.

05:36.040 --> 05:43.930
We are going to go on this in a separate lecture parameters you can think of as fields or variables

05:43.930 --> 05:47.530
that a user can input into the cloud formation.

05:47.530 --> 05:51.700
And the template is the cloud formation template that we submitted.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.900
And on the top right, you have a bunch of different options as well.

05:56.170 --> 06:02.560
So you will option to delete this cloud formation stack, you can update the stack and then you could

06:02.560 --> 06:04.330
do a couple of different things.

06:04.330 --> 06:10.030
We are going to learn all about this in our future lectures and then this create stack.

06:10.030 --> 06:13.630
You can create now the stack going back to the screen.

06:13.900 --> 06:21.430
So this page is a really good resource to learn about individual confirmation for each of the services.

06:22.060 --> 06:29.150
So let's say if you want to spin up an easy to cloud formation, you can come here and then Amazon is

06:29.150 --> 06:30.700
in two instance in a security group.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.740
So that's pretty basic.

06:32.980 --> 06:35.740
You can view the cloud formation to study it.

06:35.740 --> 06:43.360
You can copy it from here and paste it in your local code ID or if you want to launch the stack, you

06:43.360 --> 06:48.340
can click this launch stack and it will go through the create stack screens.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.800
All right, guys and girls, first cloud formation in the books.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.600
Join me in the next lecture.
