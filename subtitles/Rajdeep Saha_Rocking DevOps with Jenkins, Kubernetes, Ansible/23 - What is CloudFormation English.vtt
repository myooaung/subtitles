00:00.090 --> 00:02.550
Welcome back, guys and girls, to this lecture.

00:02.580 --> 00:08.970
So in the last lecture, we learned what is infrastructure as code and what are some of its benefits.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.040
So in this lecture, let's take a closer look at one of the infrastructure escort services in a W s

00:16.200 --> 00:16.760
a W.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.390
S cloud formation.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.480
So what is cloud formation?

00:20.490 --> 00:24.300
So you guys and girls already know the couple basic things.

00:24.540 --> 00:31.800
It is infrastructure escort service for us in cloud formation, you code your infrastructure in a file

00:31.800 --> 00:39.150
which you call template, and when you run this template, it spins up a diverse infrastructure.

00:39.150 --> 00:45.900
So you can use this template to quickly replicate your infrastructure across multiple accounts and across

00:45.900 --> 00:54.420
multiple environments such as dev, stage prod, disaster recovery, etc. This template file is written

00:54.420 --> 01:01.770
in JSON or YAML, and one thing to keep in mind is this cloud formation is free of charge.

01:01.980 --> 01:08.850
You only pay for the provision infrastructure that the template is creating for you, and there is a

01:08.850 --> 01:15.210
way for you to calculate the cost of the provisional infrastructure that's getting created by the template.

01:15.210 --> 01:17.820
And we are going to cover this in a separate lecture.

01:18.390 --> 01:21.030
So let's take a look at a sample template.

01:21.030 --> 01:25.950
Don't worry, we're going to go over all these variables and all this stuff.

01:25.950 --> 01:30.270
But for now, let's just take a look at it to get a very basic understanding.

01:30.840 --> 01:34.530
So this is a template to spin up an S3 bucket.

01:34.530 --> 01:42.840
So this type under resources, this a W.S. Colon Colon S3 Colon Colon bucket tells cloud formation to

01:42.840 --> 01:48.330
speed up a S3 bucket and then it prints out the name of the bucket.

01:48.330 --> 01:53.130
So when you run this template, it is going to create a bucket.

01:53.130 --> 01:54.450
So think about it.

01:54.450 --> 01:58.620
You don't have to go to console and manually create a bucket.

01:58.620 --> 02:05.610
And once you have this template and you run this template in your 100 plus accounts and it's going to

02:05.610 --> 02:08.250
create S3 bucket on those hundred accounts.

02:08.670 --> 02:12.690
So you are probably thinking, Raj, it's a bucket.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.690
Maybe I'll just go in the console and create the bucket.

02:15.690 --> 02:16.920
What's the big deal?

02:17.190 --> 02:22.980
Well, the thing is, in real world projects, things are more complicated, right?

02:22.980 --> 02:28.140
So what if in the bucket you have to give access control to public grid?

02:28.320 --> 02:30.990
Maybe you are using that bucket as a website.

02:30.990 --> 02:37.200
So you have to have an index document, error document, you have to have a special deletion policy,

02:37.470 --> 02:43.020
you have to output the website URL so things can get quite complicated.

02:43.020 --> 02:47.130
So once you code all this in the template, that's it.

02:47.130 --> 02:53.850
You just did it once and then you run it multiple times in multiple accounts and it's going to replicate

02:53.850 --> 02:56.820
the same infrastructure over and over again.

02:56.820 --> 03:03.210
And there is no risk of human error of not selecting some option or something from the console.

03:03.210 --> 03:06.870
Again, don't worry too much about the fields, the output.

03:06.870 --> 03:11.760
This resource says we are going to learn about all of these in separate lectures.

03:11.760 --> 03:17.010
But I just wanted to give you guys and gals a little test how a template looks like.

03:17.550 --> 03:23.070
So there are a couple of times which are going to come up a lot, so let's go over them.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.720
So the first is template.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.760
You guys and gals already know this one.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.560
It is the blueprint for resources written in JSON or YAML.

03:31.650 --> 03:33.530
Next one is stack.

03:33.540 --> 03:42.390
Once you submit a template, it creates a stack and stacks can be created, updated and deleted.

03:42.480 --> 03:49.560
So if your template is spinning up multiple resources in one go, let's say it's spinning up A-Z to

03:49.710 --> 03:56.880
it's some S3 bucket and if some with the template it creates a stack and when you delete the stack it

03:56.880 --> 04:04.260
can go and delete all the provision resources that the template spun up and the next one is said.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.740
So you can go and change a stack.

04:07.890 --> 04:16.050
Let's say you already spun up ac2 using a template which created a stack, and now you want to go attach

04:16.050 --> 04:22.440
some different security group or you want to include the C two in a auto scaling group or something

04:22.440 --> 04:25.710
so you can go and update the stack.

04:25.830 --> 04:32.760
However, before submitting the changes a chance, it will show you the summary of proposed changes.

04:32.760 --> 04:37.950
Also, it's going to show you the impact of the change on the running resources.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.080
So this one is pretty handy.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.500
We of course have separate lectures on channel sets.

04:43.530 --> 04:43.970
Okay.

04:43.980 --> 04:50.580
And before I end this lecture again, think of all the benefits that infrastructure as code brings to

04:50.580 --> 04:51.270
the table.

04:51.270 --> 04:55.230
So, of course, cloud formation inherits all those benefits.

04:55.650 --> 04:58.080
All right, guys and girls, that is the lecture.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.880
I see you guys and girls in the next lecture.

05:00.090 --> 05:00.780
By.
