Welcome to another optional installation lecture.

00:04.110 --> 00:08.250
So in this lecture, I'm going to show you how you can install X CTL.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.990
So currently, if I do X here, I'll get cluster.

00:13.440 --> 00:19.230
You can see it says in scary red color it can still is not recognized.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.870
So basically it is not installed.

00:22.290 --> 00:31.080
So if you google install x ctrl, I generally click the first NWS that Amazon.com documentation.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.120
So let's click that.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.740
So there are a couple of prerequisites.

00:34.770 --> 00:39.780
First, you have to install that obviously, which I showed in a previous lecture.

00:40.020 --> 00:46.770
And then you have to configure RWC credentials and then we have to do install and configure CTL, which

00:46.770 --> 00:47.680
we did.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.390
And finally, you have to install X CTL.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.530
So again, for Mac OS and Linux is a little easier.

00:55.530 --> 01:02.940
You will just call a file and then just pseudo just move it to the user local bin and then you are all

01:02.940 --> 01:03.590
set.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.710
I'm going to show it for Windows because Windows one is a little tricky.

01:08.010 --> 01:13.200
So to do Windows you need to install this program chocolaty.

01:13.470 --> 01:16.620
This is actually handy down the line.

01:16.620 --> 01:23.640
When we install Helme and other stuff on Windows, we can use this chocolaty program to install all

01:23.640 --> 01:24.110
that.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.530
So let's do that.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.380
So installing chocolate.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.550
So I'm going to open up this link.

01:29.790 --> 01:36.630
So first, ensure that you are using an administrative shell and install with PowerShell.

01:36.630 --> 01:47.310
So I'm going to use Visual Studio Code's PowerShell, but I'm going to close this and then type in visual

01:47.760 --> 01:51.060
and then right click run as administrator.

01:51.600 --> 01:51.960
Click.

01:51.960 --> 01:59.490
Yes, we are back in as administrator and then we are going to install it.

01:59.500 --> 02:06.180
PowerShell with PowerShell you must ensure get execution policy is not restricted.

02:06.480 --> 02:12.380
So if you run this, I mean probably you will get restricted if you haven't changed it before.

02:12.410 --> 02:15.690
So as you can see, this says restricted.

02:16.560 --> 02:20.700
So if it returns restricted, then run, set, execution policy.

02:20.700 --> 02:21.870
All signed.

02:24.090 --> 02:24.590
Okay.

02:24.600 --> 02:29.190
And then if you rerun this, you can see it's not restricted anymore.

02:30.830 --> 02:31.130
Okay.

02:31.130 --> 02:33.980
So now run the following command.

02:35.300 --> 02:41.130
So I'm just going to click this copy to click Clipboard, come back to Visual Studio code.

02:41.540 --> 02:42.500
Oh, it's a big command.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.600
All right, let's do this now.

02:44.600 --> 02:50.240
You can see it's getting chocolatey from the steps, and then it's going to install it.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.910
Okay, it is done.

02:53.360 --> 02:59.090
Okay, so now let's check out if it is installed type choco.

03:00.230 --> 03:02.000
Okay, let's do this.

03:03.390 --> 03:06.210
It gives a version, so that means it is installed.

03:06.930 --> 03:10.680
Now we are ready to install x CTL.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.050
So I'm going to copy this.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.450
Go back to our trusty Visual Studio code posted.

03:21.130 --> 03:21.370
Okay.

03:21.370 --> 03:23.230
It's going to take a minute or two.

03:23.650 --> 03:24.010
Yes.

03:24.010 --> 03:25.990
It's a successful.

03:26.610 --> 03:29.820
And then we're going to check the scarcity of Russian.

03:32.090 --> 03:34.940
All right, so we got Exeter fashion.

03:34.940 --> 03:39.200
That means Exeter is successfully installed.

03:39.560 --> 03:46.100
All right, guys and gals, at this point, we have a WSI installed, configured, correctly, installed,

03:46.100 --> 03:47.850
and now x CTL.

03:47.870 --> 03:51.650
We are ready to dive into the actual demos.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.860
All right, guys and girls, see you in the next lecture by.
