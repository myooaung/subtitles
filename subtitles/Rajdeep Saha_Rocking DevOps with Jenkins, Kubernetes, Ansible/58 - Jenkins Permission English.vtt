00:00.150 --> 00:02.130
All right, so I know I promised.

00:02.130 --> 00:07.380
I'm going to show you how to write Jenkins file the easy way, but let's go over quickly.

00:07.380 --> 00:10.260
One of the very important things, Jenkins permission.

00:10.740 --> 00:15.990
Let's say you are writing a Jenkins file which will copy a GitHub repository.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.600
It should display the rhythm file from the repository, and then you want to display a list of S3 buckets.

00:21.900 --> 00:28.290
So to to display the list of S3 buckets, you need to run a w S3 ls command.

00:28.290 --> 00:34.800
So now remember that this Jenkins job at the end of the day is running on an agent.

00:35.220 --> 00:38.670
So in our case the agent is easy too.

00:38.790 --> 00:44.490
So the agent must have the required software installed with proper credentials.

00:45.060 --> 00:51.240
So if we are trying to copy a GitHub repository, so the security group of the ESI two as well as the

00:51.240 --> 00:59.220
network access control list of the VPC, should allow outgoing traffic to the Internet to grab my GitHub

00:59.220 --> 01:05.580
repository, as well as it should also have the permission to go check as three.

01:06.390 --> 01:12.960
So what's happening is this Jenkins job will just run the command, so the easy two should have the

01:12.980 --> 01:21.300
WSI installed and the EC two role should have the permission to go check as three.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.580
So this is just one of the example.

01:23.580 --> 01:30.330
Let's say your Jenkins job wants to deploy Lambda or wants to deploy to Kubernetes cluster.

01:30.330 --> 01:35.820
So in all those cases, the agent must have the required permission.

01:36.360 --> 01:43.260
As part of this, I want to go list the S3 buckets, so we have to check whether the EC2 role has the

01:43.260 --> 01:44.730
appropriate permission or not.

01:44.730 --> 01:48.000
So let's check it out and add it if we don't have it.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.350
This is my is easy to console and this is a two with the name Jenkins is running my Jenkins software.

01:55.800 --> 02:00.180
So to check the IAM role, you go to security and then you see the IAM role.

02:00.570 --> 02:01.740
Let's click that.

02:04.660 --> 02:15.340
So currently this I am role only has access to easy to assign and confirmation, but it does not have

02:15.360 --> 02:18.610
SE three policy currently.

02:18.910 --> 02:25.810
So even if we try to execute aws3 else command from the Jenkins file, it is going to fail.

02:26.140 --> 02:28.600
So for that we need to add permission.

02:28.600 --> 02:36.670
And to add permission you click, add permission, attach policies and then search for as three.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.680
There is a lot with SW three.

02:38.920 --> 02:45.640
Amazon has three full access and alternatively you can also give specific access just to list the S3

02:45.640 --> 02:48.010
buckets and not full access.

02:48.340 --> 02:51.820
But for simplicity of this demo, I'm just going to give full access.

02:52.030 --> 02:53.590
Click Attach Policies.

02:53.830 --> 02:55.630
All right, now we are all set.

02:55.660 --> 02:59.920
Now let's go to the next lecture and check out how to write Jenkins file the easy way.
