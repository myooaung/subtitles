Welcome present, girls, to this lecture.

00:01.770 --> 00:05.450
In this lecture, we're going to learn about A.W. Kelly.

00:06.450 --> 00:07.800
So first things first.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.770
What is the WCI and why do we need it?

00:11.190 --> 00:13.470
We learned a lot of Linux commands.

00:13.470 --> 00:14.880
Was that not enough?

00:15.450 --> 00:23.910
No, because all the Linux commands you can manipulate with the Linux objects such as a file folder

00:24.310 --> 00:26.850
as well as you can call an external URL.

00:26.970 --> 00:35.250
But what if you want to manipulate some Amazon resources, such as you want to list the S3 buckets in

00:35.250 --> 00:39.150
a Amazon account, or you want to create a new S3 bucket?

00:39.480 --> 00:48.030
What if you want to create a s lambda or you want to provision a new Amazon X cluster so traditional

00:48.150 --> 00:51.930
Linux commands cannot interact with the set of resources.

00:51.930 --> 00:54.960
So that's why it usually comes into play.

00:55.170 --> 01:02.880
So a clear command line interface is a unified tool to manage your services.

01:03.480 --> 01:11.340
So you run these commands in command line, and more importantly, you can run these commands inside

01:11.340 --> 01:13.170
DevOps scripts.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.650
And this commands starts with a W.

01:16.650 --> 01:24.000
S for example, if you want to list the S3 buckets in your account, you will run a w s as three ls.

01:24.270 --> 01:26.340
So think for it for a minute.

01:26.970 --> 01:31.650
So let's say you want to provision a x cluster.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.030
How can you do that?

01:33.030 --> 01:40.800
Well, you can run a w s c a command from the command line, a w s x create cluster, etc..

01:40.800 --> 01:48.240
And since you can run these commands from dev scripts, because at the end of the day DevOps scripts

01:48.240 --> 01:52.530
can be run using in a Linux box from the DevOps tools.

01:52.530 --> 01:55.650
We will do all this in a hands on in a letter chapters.

01:55.650 --> 02:03.780
You can use this s CLI commands to provision, manipulate or list any three sources.

02:03.780 --> 02:09.390
That's why it obviously is very important and it is very critical by default.

02:09.510 --> 02:15.870
This is not part of your Linux operating system because this is created by S and provided by a w s.

02:15.960 --> 02:23.280
So you need to install a W SLA if not preinstalled in some of the tools CLI is already preinstalled.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.590
So let's go over a couple of examples.

02:26.130 --> 02:35.760
So where you can run this SLA, you can install a SLI in local ID such as Visual Studio code, you can

02:35.760 --> 02:38.580
run a W SLA in cloud nine.

02:38.580 --> 02:44.850
So Cloud nine terminal automatically comes with a SLA installed, so you don't need to install it.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.360
The new option is a w.

02:46.470 --> 02:50.370
S which is very convenient is at s cloud shell.

02:51.030 --> 02:54.870
So we also have a w SLA installed in a W cloud shell.

02:54.870 --> 03:02.370
And again, you can run this SLA command from any DevOps tool with that SLA installed.

03:02.580 --> 03:07.080
So expanding a little bit on running a double SLA from DevOps tool.

03:07.500 --> 03:14.730
So when you run SQL commands in your local IDE Visual Studio code, in this diagram you have to set

03:14.730 --> 03:20.640
up a s IAM user and you have to get the secret key and secret access key.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.440
And then you need to configure this local ID to connect to your account.

03:25.440 --> 03:33.690
So in this case, it obviously is using your IAM credentials, but let's say you are running your SLA

03:33.720 --> 03:37.290
commands from your DevOps tool such as Jenkins.

03:37.920 --> 03:44.910
The Jenkins is running inside an Amazon EC2 and there is the IAM role attached to the EC2.

03:45.330 --> 03:52.470
So when you run a sales command from this Jenkins using Jenkins file, it is going to use the AC to

03:52.470 --> 04:00.360
role attach to the Amazon ESI two and SLA must be installed on this Amazon ESI two so that Jenkins can

04:00.360 --> 04:01.080
use that.

04:01.290 --> 04:07.260
Don't worry, we are going to go over a bunch of real world examples using Jenkins and obviously down

04:07.260 --> 04:07.800
the line.

04:08.370 --> 04:14.250
So let's say you want to list the S3 buckets using S3 three LS from the Jenkins file.

04:14.280 --> 04:23.370
This role, the IAM role attached to the AC two should have the S3 access policy attached to it.

04:23.610 --> 04:24.180
All right.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.080
And app theory.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.290
Lets see these SLA commands in action.

04:28.530 --> 04:30.780
All right, guys and girls join me in the next lecture.
