00:03.310 --> 00:04.060
All right.

00:04.060 --> 00:07.990
So Jenkins is up and running on AC two in this video.

00:08.020 --> 00:11.470
Let's go over a brief overview of the Jenkins console.

00:11.500 --> 00:11.890
All right.

00:11.890 --> 00:16.330
So on the bottom right of the screen, you have the Jenkins version.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.100
All the good stuff is on the left.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.750
So to create a job, you will use a new item.

00:22.750 --> 00:28.600
And to manage your Jenkins install plugins, you are going to select Manage Jenkins.

00:28.900 --> 00:35.170
So if you select Manage Jenkins, it is going to open up this view with system configuration, security

00:35.170 --> 00:37.270
status, etc..

00:37.780 --> 00:46.030
So the way I navigate this is I actually hover my mouse over this dashboard and then click this down

00:46.030 --> 00:51.550
arrow and here it shows the same option, but it makes it easier.

00:51.550 --> 00:57.520
So you could see if you hover your mouse to manage Jenkins All the options come in and you can simply

00:57.520 --> 00:59.710
select the one you want to go.

00:59.710 --> 01:06.160
And we are going to go over these options on individual lectures as we go through different demos and

01:06.160 --> 01:07.360
different use cases.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.510
So let's learn about this configure system one real quick.

01:10.510 --> 01:17.260
So just for fun, let's select configure system and this shows all the Jenkins information will be saved

01:17.260 --> 01:21.910
in slash far last lib SLAs Jenkins on the AC too.

01:22.180 --> 01:25.240
If you have installed Jenkins and local you can go there as well.

01:25.240 --> 01:28.120
It's going to show you a local directory system.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.470
Message is just a message which is going to show in your Jenkins screen.

01:32.470 --> 01:38.860
For example, let's say you put I will run Jenkins and get better paying job and click Save.

01:39.910 --> 01:44.440
And you can see on your Jenkins console, it will show the message.

01:45.070 --> 01:51.160
Don't use this creative option because the one you want to use is new item on the left, either from

01:51.160 --> 01:53.230
here or on the dashboard.

01:53.230 --> 01:54.070
New item.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.000
Why?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.590
You should not use anything here.

01:56.770 --> 01:57.520
Real quick.

01:57.520 --> 02:02.320
So I'm going to open up a Jenkins where I have a bunch of stuff already done.

02:02.530 --> 02:05.770
This is the screen you probably going to see most of the time.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.190
So the new item here is kind of gone.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.090
Only where you can create new item is from the left.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.140
And here you can create different views.

02:14.140 --> 02:19.790
So you can click this plus icon and it is going to open up this list view or my view.

02:19.810 --> 02:21.220
So my view is default.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.230
You can click list view.

02:25.000 --> 02:25.300
Click.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.140
Okay.

02:26.410 --> 02:32.750
And then you can select what jobs you want to see, what columns in the job you want to see.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.030
So it's up to you.

02:34.060 --> 02:37.810
Most of the times the administrator will set this up for you, for the whole team.

02:37.960 --> 02:46.990
And going back to the initial screen, it kind of shows what jobs I ran or what jobs ended successfully

02:47.020 --> 02:55.510
marked by the green checkmark and what jobs failed marked by the red x icon and the jobs which has just

02:55.510 --> 03:03.790
three dots and neither a green checkmark or a red x means I have created the jobs, but I have not submitted

03:03.790 --> 03:04.180
them.

03:04.210 --> 03:04.800
All right.

03:04.810 --> 03:08.530
Let's go ahead and build our very first Jenkins job.
