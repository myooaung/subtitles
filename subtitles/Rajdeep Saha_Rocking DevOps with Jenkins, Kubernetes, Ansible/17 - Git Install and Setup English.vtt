Before we can start having all the fun, first we have to install Kit and configure a couple of things.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.670
That's what we are going to do in this lecture.

00:07.680 --> 00:08.700
Let's get started.

00:08.790 --> 00:17.490
Download Git from Git Dash SMK Downloads is a pretty lightweight download and you can download based

00:17.490 --> 00:19.920
on your operating system throughout the course.

00:19.920 --> 00:26.340
I'm going to use Visual Studio code so you can download visuals to your code from code dot Visual Studio

00:26.340 --> 00:33.390
dot com slash download Git will work with any other ideas you currently have, but if you are following

00:33.390 --> 00:39.510
the demo and you want your screen to look and feel like the ones I'm showing in the demo, I would recommend

00:39.510 --> 00:41.040
using Visual Studio code.

00:41.040 --> 00:48.120
Once both Git and Visual Studio code are downloaded and installed, you can run Git version in the Visual

00:48.120 --> 00:51.180
Studio Code terminal and you should get the version back.

00:51.180 --> 00:55.290
That means Git is successfully installed and ready to be used.

00:55.290 --> 00:58.800
Now we have to configure Git but it is pretty straightforward.

00:58.800 --> 01:06.900
We only have to configure the username and user email because Git uses this information with every git

01:06.900 --> 01:13.110
commit and that information is baked into the commit history so that when you look at the history,

01:13.110 --> 01:21.450
you can track who made the change to configure the username run this command git config does dash global

01:21.450 --> 01:25.140
username and then put your name in double codes.

01:25.140 --> 01:29.610
We are putting double codes because we have a space in between the first name and last name.

01:29.610 --> 01:36.930
And this dash dash global option ensures that any git project you do in your machine it is going to

01:36.930 --> 01:37.890
use this name.

01:38.070 --> 01:45.150
Alternatively, you can set this name for each project, but generally you have the same name for all

01:45.150 --> 01:46.740
your projects that you are doing.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.200
So we are going to run with this global option.

01:49.200 --> 01:55.200
Press Enter All right, username is set similarly to set user email.

01:55.200 --> 02:03.330
You run this command git config dash dash global user dot email and then your email address press enter.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.230
That's it.

02:04.230 --> 02:06.810
That's all the configuration you need with Git.

02:06.810 --> 02:09.120
You will also need a account in GitHub.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.170
So go to github dot com and then sign up using email.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.570
It's pretty straightforward and simple process.

02:15.630 --> 02:16.140
All right.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.300
With that being said, let's start the fun.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.050
Join me in the next lecture with our first git demo.
