00:00.150 --> 00:02.670
Our very first Jenkins file demo.

00:02.700 --> 00:03.870
Let's go.

00:03.960 --> 00:09.030
I'm simply going to copy this pipeline script and then jump into Jenkins console.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.450
Click New Item.

00:10.470 --> 00:14.340
We have to select a pipeline job because it is a pipeline script.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.500
Freestyle project cannot have a pipeline script.

00:17.520 --> 00:21.570
I'm going to give this job the name test Jenkins file zero one click.

00:21.570 --> 00:22.170
Okay.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.760
Scroll down.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.350
Here is the pipeline script.

00:25.350 --> 00:26.370
So you have two options.

00:26.370 --> 00:31.350
You can paste the Jenkins file here or you can point to a GitHub.

00:31.710 --> 00:36.480
So for simplicity, I'm just going to put everything in the Jenkins job so that we can change it and

00:36.480 --> 00:37.530
test it easily.

00:37.740 --> 00:40.910
So let's test this and we are going to test it out.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.620
Click Save, Click Build.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.750
Now, pretty straightforward.

00:45.750 --> 00:51.120
If we go back to the Jenkins file, it has three stages build, test and deploy.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.860
And within each stage we're just echoing, building, testing and deploying.

00:55.860 --> 01:02.730
So the Jenkins job view shows each stage separately, and then you can individually go check out the

01:02.730 --> 01:03.120
logs.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.270
If you click logs, it is going to say building.

01:06.270 --> 01:10.680
So going back to configure, if you scroll down to the Jenkins file.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.980
So the thing to remember is within these steps it can execute any command.

01:17.370 --> 01:24.090
So even though for this one, I'm just saying Echo, if you want to build a Java project, you can run

01:24.120 --> 01:32.160
a mac command if you want to install some libraries and then zip everything up for a lambda package,

01:32.160 --> 01:38.730
you can run those commands like pip install and zip all that stuff and you can add additional stages

01:38.730 --> 01:39.870
quite easily.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.140
For example, let's say you want to add another test.

01:43.200 --> 01:52.260
Let's say you want to change this to unit test and you want to create another stage called integration

01:52.260 --> 01:53.070
test.

01:53.340 --> 02:00.840
And you can change this and you can add as many commands as you want within each stage.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.660
So you simply copy and paste.

02:04.580 --> 02:08.120
Testing Part two.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.670
Let's click this save and build now.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.050
All right.

02:15.050 --> 02:16.190
So pretty straightforward.

02:16.190 --> 02:18.560
Another new stage cam integration test.

02:18.950 --> 02:26.690
And you can see the full output by going to console output and you could see each stage just shows what

02:26.690 --> 02:27.410
it does.

02:27.410 --> 02:31.520
So going back to the Jenkins file, this is a pretty straightforward Jenkins file.

02:31.790 --> 02:37.520
One challenge you will face is how are you going to remember all the commands?

02:37.700 --> 02:45.140
Let's say you want to grab a GitHub repository to this Jenkins job and then maybe you want to run a

02:45.140 --> 02:51.080
Ansible playbook and maybe you want to install something something into Kubernetes cluster.

02:51.470 --> 02:54.620
The good news is you don't need to remember all of that.

02:54.620 --> 02:59.450
So I'm going to show you easy way to write Jenkins file in the next lecture.
