Welcome, guys and girls, to this lecture.

00:02.010 --> 00:07.440
In this lecture, we are going to learn different ways to spin up against cluster.

00:07.530 --> 00:14.460
So on the left, this is you, the almighty user, and on the right is our x cluster.

00:14.460 --> 00:18.660
So let's see which ways we can spin up this cluster.

00:19.710 --> 00:21.570
So there's always a WAC console.

00:21.570 --> 00:25.200
You can log into it with console and spin up a cluster.

00:25.680 --> 00:32.310
You can always code cloud formation and run it as a cloud formation template which will spin up like

00:32.310 --> 00:33.330
s cluster.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.750
Next option is CLI.

00:37.050 --> 00:47.970
So using CLI commands you can spin up a gas cluster and do all kinds of stuff and the number four is

00:47.970 --> 00:49.680
exit alkali.

00:50.010 --> 00:57.300
So I'm going to go through this thing is if you want to spin up a gas cluster from console or SLI or

00:57.300 --> 01:04.650
cloud formation, you actually have to do a lot of stuff because certain scenarios, some subnets need

01:04.650 --> 01:05.430
to be private.

01:05.430 --> 01:07.740
Some new routing rules needs to be set.

01:07.740 --> 01:11.130
In some cases, a new VPC needs to be created.

01:11.610 --> 01:12.990
So that is a lot of stuff.

01:13.410 --> 01:16.260
But the X CTL is a CLI tool.

01:16.530 --> 01:23.760
It's the open source tool where you can give one command and it will do all the necessary steps in the

01:23.760 --> 01:26.310
background and spin up your cluster.

01:26.310 --> 01:33.840
So we have separate lectures and demos on the CTL method, and this is the preferred method of spinning

01:33.840 --> 01:35.100
up X cluster.

01:35.100 --> 01:43.020
So now that we know this four different ways to spin up the cluster, let's talk about where from you

01:43.020 --> 01:44.100
are going to run this.

01:44.100 --> 01:52.090
Right, so it is console like we know you can go in the console but to run cloud formation the NWC like

01:52.090 --> 01:56.280
still Sealy you need some kind of terminal, right?

01:57.030 --> 01:59.670
So what are the different ways you can do that?

02:00.030 --> 02:06.030
So the first option is always your local laptop or desktop or Mac or whatever machine you use.

02:06.360 --> 02:13.650
You can use press credentials, the secret key and the secret access key run and configure command and

02:13.650 --> 02:17.910
then you can spin up whatever you want from your local PC.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.430
Second is cloud nine.

02:20.430 --> 02:28.350
So instead of using your local laptop, you can spin up a cloud nine instance and then use the terminal

02:28.350 --> 02:31.110
for that to run all the commands.

02:31.110 --> 02:37.170
Either you can still do SLI or even you can write the cloud formation and summit from cloud nine.

02:37.320 --> 02:44.700
You can always pin up a Amazon AC two and then switch into the AC to go to the terminal and then run

02:44.700 --> 02:46.020
the CLI commands.

02:46.650 --> 02:53.160
So again, for this course, I'm going to show you guys and girls that mix up all three methods and

02:53.160 --> 02:55.620
then you can pick and choose whichever one you prefer.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.640
So there's one more way to spin up, which is quite important.

03:00.150 --> 03:03.270
So that is DevOps tools, right?

03:03.270 --> 03:11.340
Because in actual a production environment you won't have access to any terminal or even the console.

03:11.340 --> 03:17.100
So you really cannot go to console and submit cloud formation or go to console and spin up because directly.

03:17.670 --> 03:20.760
So you need to automate this whole process.

03:20.760 --> 03:28.620
So using DevOps tools like Jenkins or Code Pipeline, you can automate this cloud formation or SQL,

03:29.100 --> 03:33.150
or you can still see a light and spin up ICS.

03:33.630 --> 03:40.710
So I highly recommend this because I strongly believe like this, this knowledge is what separates a

03:40.710 --> 03:47.670
pen and paper architect with an actual hands on architect, because in interview, if are giving interview

03:47.670 --> 03:53.730
in a real world enterprise, they will always ask you about how are you going to automate, creating,

03:53.730 --> 03:59.010
maintaining, updating your guest cluster because you cannot just log into console and do all that stuff.

03:59.460 --> 04:02.910
So I have a separate chapter on this in this course.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.670
So we are definitely going to go over it in detail.

04:06.180 --> 04:06.630
All right.

04:06.630 --> 04:09.750
With that being said, let's jump into the next lecture.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.380
All right.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.780
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture by.
