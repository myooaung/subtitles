00:02.260 --> 00:07.340
All right, let's create our very first Jenkins job to create a job.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.940
Click this new item on the top left.

00:10.630 --> 00:12.070
Give a name of the job.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.080
I'm going to give the name very fast.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.280
Jenkins job.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.710
Select Free Style Project.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.420
Scroll down, click.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.080
Okay.

00:20.650 --> 00:25.120
So there are a lot of sections in the Jenkins job and we are going to go through all of it as we go

00:25.120 --> 00:26.050
through the course.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.050
For now, scroll down to this build step.

00:29.050 --> 00:32.300
So this build is the heart of Jenkins job.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.360
It tells Jenkins what to do.

00:34.390 --> 00:38.080
Click this arrow and you have multiple options here.

00:38.110 --> 00:45.040
Execute Windows, Batch Command, execute Shell and Gretel, etc. Select execute shell.

00:45.340 --> 00:48.100
And here you can give any shell command.

00:48.250 --> 00:52.650
So if you think about it, anything at the end of the day could be a shell command.

00:52.660 --> 00:57.780
You want to install some external library, you could run a shell command to do that.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.220
You want to compile your Java program.

01:00.220 --> 01:02.040
You can run a shell command to do that.

01:02.050 --> 01:03.550
You want to zip something.

01:03.550 --> 01:05.320
You could run a shell command to do that.

01:05.320 --> 01:12.280
You can even run Kubernetes command, which at the end of the day is a shell command to install something

01:12.280 --> 01:13.210
on Kubernetes.

01:13.210 --> 01:15.630
But more on that fancy stuff later on.

01:15.640 --> 01:21.590
Let's just start with Hello World so I'm just going to type echo hello world from Jenkins.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.830
Scroll down click Save.

01:24.040 --> 01:31.200
At this point, the job is created, but it has not built to run the job or build the job.

01:31.210 --> 01:33.160
Click build now.

01:33.850 --> 01:35.470
And that will run the job.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.520
And the job runs will come under billed history.

01:39.910 --> 01:44.110
Every time you run a job, a new version number will come in.

01:44.140 --> 01:48.910
So if I run, build now again, you should see number two.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.640
How do you see the outputs from the job?

01:51.820 --> 02:00.400
You can simply click this pound one and then go to console output and here it says the command it executed

02:00.400 --> 02:08.050
is echo all from Jenkins and the output is hello world from Jenkins and the job finished successfully.

02:08.140 --> 02:17.470
Alternatively, from this screen you can select this down arrow and directly select console output and

02:17.470 --> 02:20.740
you can also delete this build, edit, all that stuff.

02:21.130 --> 02:26.020
You can click go back to the project if you want to edit the job, click configure.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.120
Scroll down.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.530
And we can edit the jobs.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.850
Click Save.

02:35.090 --> 02:41.370
And if you click Build now, the version three will appear with our newly typed message.

02:41.390 --> 02:44.420
So if I click this icon click console output.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.440
Here you go.

02:45.470 --> 02:46.880
Hello, all from Jenkins.

02:46.910 --> 02:48.560
Dave hops, rocks.

02:48.590 --> 02:49.520
All right.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.560
First Jenkins job in the books.

02:51.590 --> 02:52.690
That's it for this one.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.130
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture by.
