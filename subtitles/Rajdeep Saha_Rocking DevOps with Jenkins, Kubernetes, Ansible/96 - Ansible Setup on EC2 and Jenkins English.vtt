00:02.200 --> 00:07.390
First I have to install Ansible on the AC to where my Jenkins is running.

00:07.570 --> 00:10.270
So this is the AC to where my Jenkins is running.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.950
I'm going to click Connect.

00:12.740 --> 00:20.760
And then connect again and they should open up the command window from the searching into the AC box.

00:20.780 --> 00:24.650
Then I'm going to run sudo yum install ansible.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.950
All right, Ansible is installed.

00:29.310 --> 00:34.080
Now we have to get the Ansible plugin and set it up in our Jenkins.

00:35.110 --> 00:43.810
So from the dashboard click manage Jenkins manage plugin and then under available search Ansible.

00:45.740 --> 00:49.370
How we go select that and then install without restart.

00:50.280 --> 00:50.730
All right.

00:50.730 --> 00:52.970
And we'll plug in is installed.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.690
Go back to the top of the page.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.370
But to use Ansible, that's not enough.

00:57.390 --> 01:05.610
You need to when you create a Ansible job, the Jenkins need to know where on the ESI toolbox where

01:05.610 --> 01:09.180
the Jenkins is running, should it look to execute those symbols?

01:09.780 --> 01:15.270
So to do that, click manage Jenkins again and then click Global Tool Configuration.

01:17.030 --> 01:19.070
So click add ansible.

01:19.670 --> 01:22.010
You can give the name Ansible.

01:22.190 --> 01:27.230
And then here you have to give the path from the AC to where we just installed Ansible.

01:27.950 --> 01:36.770
So going back to our sage instance and then run which ansible, it gives the path.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.560
So you don't need to give the last ansible part.

01:39.560 --> 01:48.530
So I can just copy, slash, user slash and slash and then go back to Jenkins and then paste it here.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.570
Okay, that's it.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.650
Click Save.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.940
All right, so now the setup is complete.

01:54.950 --> 01:57.230
Now we are going to go create a new job.
