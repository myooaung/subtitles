00:00.150 --> 00:00.360
Okay.

00:00.430 --> 00:07.020
So let's start with the easiest option, which is the newly released OS shell console.

00:07.380 --> 00:13.140
So in your account, in the top right, you will see this cloud shell icon.

00:13.140 --> 00:17.960
So if you click that, it should open up a cloud shell terminal.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.280
So it takes a couple of minutes.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.640
So I'm going to pause the video and come back when this terminal is up and running.

00:22.650 --> 00:23.160
All right.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.440
So Cloud Shell is up and running.

00:25.440 --> 00:25.860
A W.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.100
S Cloud shell already have a W sky installed.

00:29.100 --> 00:34.440
And to check it out, you could simply run a w s dash dash version.

00:35.010 --> 00:43.170
So it shows the NWSL live version, 2.5.8 is already installed and now let's run some SQL commands.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.140
So let's say we want to list the S3 bucket.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.000
So you can simply run a w s as three ls.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.080
This lists all the buckets in my account.

00:56.710 --> 01:04.930
Also, keep in mind that a cloud shell inherits the permissions from the IAM user that I'm logged into

01:04.930 --> 01:12.700
this account with since my current logged in user has the permission to list S3 buckets.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.300
SQL Command for listing S3 bucket is going through.

01:16.860 --> 01:17.620
All right, folks.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.540
That's it for this one.

01:18.550 --> 01:20.290
I'll see you guys and gals in the next lecture.
