00:00.090 --> 00:04.950
In this lecture, we are going to learn what is the difference between Jenkins freestyle project and

00:04.950 --> 00:05.940
pipeline jobs.

00:06.240 --> 00:12.150
So every time you click this new item, you are presented with this menu where you have to select the

00:12.150 --> 00:13.260
type of your job.

00:13.260 --> 00:17.630
The two main types of the jobs are freestyle project and pipeline.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.120
So what are the differences?

00:19.140 --> 00:21.540
Let's actually understand this with an example.

00:21.540 --> 00:26.520
So I have a freestyle job open on the left and a pipeline job opened on the right.

00:26.520 --> 00:33.480
At first glance everything looks very similar, but if you scroll down the freestyle job under the build

00:33.480 --> 00:37.490
step, you can only select one of these actions.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.720
So let's say you want to execute a shell command.

00:39.720 --> 00:49.440
You can click this and then you can type in Echo Hollow and then you can add another build step, but

00:49.440 --> 00:52.650
you can only select from the selection that's given here.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.930
Let's say I want to invoke Ansible playbooks.

00:54.930 --> 01:01.120
I selected that and then I can fill all this up on the right side on the pipeline job.

01:01.140 --> 01:05.160
The superpower is you can actually input a script.

01:05.700 --> 01:10.140
So in this script you can define what actions you want to take.

01:10.140 --> 01:17.100
So beyond what's available on the freestyle sample job with pipeline jobs, you can do a lot more things.

01:17.400 --> 01:22.140
And one of the most powerful feature of Jenkins is using Jenkins file.

01:22.140 --> 01:28.470
So Jenkins file basically tells the Jenkins job what to do if I have to compare this.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.860
Think of it as like an infrastructure as code.

01:31.860 --> 01:38.940
So instead of you selecting stuff on the console, you can stitch together different stages and different

01:38.940 --> 01:41.790
steps and you could do a lot more.

01:42.420 --> 01:49.620
So this is what happens in the Real World Project because once you have a Jenkins file, it is easier

01:49.620 --> 01:56.100
to fashion, control it, change it, revert back, test it, rather than selecting stuff from the build

01:56.100 --> 01:56.550
step.

01:56.580 --> 02:02.130
Another advantage of pipeline jobs is you can restart the job from in between.

02:02.130 --> 02:09.660
So let's say a multiple steps or multiple stages and it fills in between and you can restart the Jenkins

02:09.660 --> 02:11.700
job from that step.

02:11.700 --> 02:17.790
But whereas on the freestyle jobs, you cannot really restart from the middle, you have to restart

02:17.790 --> 02:18.720
from the start.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.850
But if you have just like one step, something simple, freestyle is the way to go.

02:23.850 --> 02:28.400
But in any real world projects, a pipeline is what it's used.

02:28.410 --> 02:34.470
Another difference is on the left, on the output of sample freestyle job, there is really no graphical

02:34.470 --> 02:35.580
representation.

02:35.580 --> 02:40.920
So you can just go to the console output which shows the log for the job.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.480
On the right.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.400
We are doing the same thing and don't worry, we're going to go for the demo, how to create the sample

02:47.400 --> 02:49.350
freestyle job and the pipeline job.

02:49.860 --> 02:55.020
But just to give you an idea, you can see it gives a nice gooey feel.

02:55.530 --> 02:59.280
So for Pipeline, all this, these two are different stages.

02:59.520 --> 03:06.210
It kind of shows how much time each stage took and if, let's say the second stage stage failed, you

03:06.210 --> 03:07.830
could have restarted it much easier.

03:07.830 --> 03:11.820
You can just display the logs of this stage.

03:11.820 --> 03:16.710
But on the left for the sample freestyle job, you cannot really do any of this stuff.

03:16.710 --> 03:22.770
Another point is you saw on the build step, there are only certain things that you can select, but

03:22.770 --> 03:29.520
for pipeline jobs, there are lot more things that you could do and if you want, you can even insert

03:29.520 --> 03:31.320
your own groove code.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.840
So a lot more flexibility with pipeline jobs compared to freestyle jobs.

03:37.020 --> 03:37.440
All right.

03:37.440 --> 03:43.230
Now that you understand the difference between freestyle and pipeline job, let's check them out in

03:43.230 --> 03:44.760
action in the next lecture.
