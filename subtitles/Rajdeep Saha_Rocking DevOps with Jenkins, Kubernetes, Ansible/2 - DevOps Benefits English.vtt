00:00.120 --> 00:02.490
So let's take a look at some of the DevOps benefits.

00:02.520 --> 00:07.830
DevOps has benefits in two different areas, technical and cultural.

00:08.280 --> 00:15.840
And the technical benefits because everything is automated, you can deliver your software faster as

00:15.840 --> 00:22.480
well as faster problem remediation, and it is easier to replicate best practices.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.970
What does that mean in real world?

00:24.990 --> 00:27.750
You are not going to have just one environment.

00:27.750 --> 00:32.400
You will have sandbox dev, test, staging and production.

00:32.790 --> 00:36.100
Since you automated and codified everything.

00:36.120 --> 00:43.260
Replicating process is as simple as just copy pasting your pipeline for another environment with the

00:43.260 --> 00:43.980
organization.

00:43.980 --> 00:48.150
Best practices built in the pipeline without any human error.

00:48.300 --> 00:54.840
Because you are saving time on fix and maintenance, creating new environment, you have more time to

00:54.840 --> 00:57.580
innovate and work on business problems.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.940
What are some of the cultural benefits now?

00:59.940 --> 01:05.250
The developer operations and in some cases testers are in the same team.

01:05.250 --> 01:08.160
There is improved communication and collaboration.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.880
And this one is a big one.

01:10.890 --> 01:13.290
Greater professional opportunities.

01:13.410 --> 01:20.580
Developers can learn tools for operations and vice versa, and get better job and pay, which leads

01:20.580 --> 01:22.970
to happier, more productive teams.

01:22.980 --> 01:29.940
So at this point, I would like you to think this couple questions for your organizations or project.

01:30.270 --> 01:37.830
How long would it take your organization to deploy a change that involves a single line of code?

01:37.830 --> 01:41.730
And can you do this on a repeatable, reliable basis?

01:42.000 --> 01:50.550
Without DevOps, the answer will be no, because even to do a single line of code change with traditional

01:50.550 --> 01:57.570
deployment, you still have to go through all those long, tedious and manual processes with DevOps.

01:57.570 --> 02:01.980
Since everything is automated, it can be done in seconds.

02:02.070 --> 02:05.820
Comparing DevOps and non DevOps organizations.

02:05.830 --> 02:13.860
Organizations that implemented DevOps have four times lower change failure rate 24 times faster recovery

02:13.860 --> 02:21.750
times, 200 times more frequent deployments, and 44% more time spent on new features and code.
