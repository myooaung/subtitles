00:00.180 --> 00:03.180
Welcome, ladies and girls, to the Linux Basic Commands Lecture.

00:03.180 --> 00:09.570
So these commands you will use both for your DevOps work as well as your day to day I.T. work.

00:09.870 --> 00:10.320
All right.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.770
With that being said, let's get started to change.

00:13.770 --> 00:19.710
Current working directory, you will use C, D and then the path of the directory.

00:20.190 --> 00:25.410
And then to see which current working directory you are currently sitting on, you will use the command

00:25.410 --> 00:28.290
p, d or present working directory.

00:28.560 --> 00:36.390
So in the previous command we keyed into this resources directory and now if I run p.w dx it is going

00:36.390 --> 00:42.780
to display the whole path to list the files in the current directory you will run ls command.

00:42.780 --> 00:49.860
Not that this command is not going to display the hidden files to list the files with little bit more

00:49.860 --> 00:58.710
information you will run ls with dash l option as in long listing as you could see, it shows how many

00:58.710 --> 01:00.540
files we have in this directory.

01:00.540 --> 01:06.750
It shows the date it was created as well as the size and the permission.

01:07.350 --> 01:10.680
This command still doesn't show any hidden files to see.

01:10.680 --> 01:21.030
The hidden files you will do ls dash a as in all and you can run ls dash l for long listing of all files,

01:21.030 --> 01:22.800
including the hidden files.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.500
The next command, which is very important, is setting a value for the environment variable.

01:28.500 --> 01:35.490
So for example, you created this variable as underscore region and you want to set the value to the

01:36.060 --> 01:38.070
region you are currently working on.

01:38.220 --> 01:44.580
So you will set the value by running this export command export and then the name of the variable.

01:44.580 --> 01:47.640
And in this case there is no separate command to create the variable.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.960
This is just one command.

01:48.960 --> 01:56.670
The export s underscore region equals to us west two will create this s underscore region environment

01:56.670 --> 02:03.450
variable and then assign the value us west to and then to display the value of this environment variable

02:03.450 --> 02:07.920
you will simply do echo and then dollar and then name of the variable.

02:08.010 --> 02:12.660
So the echo command can be used to display other stuff as well.

02:12.660 --> 02:19.110
For example, if you just echo Dave hops rocks, it is just going to display DevOps rocks.

02:19.290 --> 02:24.360
Note that these environment variables are only persistent through the session.

02:24.360 --> 02:30.630
If you close your Linux session and then open up another terminal, these environment variables are

02:30.630 --> 02:31.230
gone.

02:31.230 --> 02:34.740
Now let's take a look at creating directory commands.

02:34.890 --> 02:42.330
So you create a directory by running deer or mac directory and then name of the directory.

02:42.330 --> 02:46.590
This will create this new directory in your current working directory.

02:47.280 --> 02:53.100
So let's say you created this directory and then you keyed into this Jenkins artifact directory and

02:53.100 --> 02:54.990
then you run a p.w dx.

02:55.290 --> 02:59.190
It is going to show the whole path with the new directory at the end.

03:00.020 --> 03:07.490
Now if you want to go up one directory, so you want to go back to see Udemy videos.

03:07.520 --> 03:16.280
Kate underscore your case and resources, you will simply type seed space, dot dot, so basically CD

03:16.280 --> 03:23.660
space and then two periods and as you could see that would bring you up one directory up you can join

03:23.660 --> 03:26.510
multiple commands with semicolon.

03:26.870 --> 03:29.750
So let's say you are sitting in C colon.

03:29.750 --> 03:37.910
Udemy videos k eight underscore X and you want to go into the working directory resources and then you

03:37.910 --> 03:39.320
also want to list the files.

03:39.320 --> 03:47.090
So instead of running CD resources and then else you can just run multiple command using CD resources,

03:47.090 --> 03:53.540
semicolon lists, and that will make your working directory resources as well as list all the files

03:53.540 --> 03:55.250
inside the resources folder.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.890
Now how will you make multiple new directories?

03:57.890 --> 04:04.250
What I mean by that is let's say you want to create a directory, a new one, and the new two directory

04:04.250 --> 04:09.620
inside that new one directory and then new three inside that new tool.

04:09.980 --> 04:13.640
So one way is you can keep running make directory and CD.

04:13.640 --> 04:19.640
So you run Mac directory, that's a new one and then you CD into new one and then you do a mac directory

04:19.640 --> 04:20.390
new to.

04:21.080 --> 04:28.610
Alternatively, the easier way to do that is make directory dash p option and then you can give the

04:28.610 --> 04:33.890
folders a folder structure, let's say slash new one, slash new tool, slash new three.

04:33.890 --> 04:39.380
And, and this command will create all these three new directories in one shot.

04:39.530 --> 04:45.770
If you want to remove a specific file or folder, you can run REM and the name of the file or folder.

04:45.770 --> 04:51.320
In this case I'm removing test txt so I'm giving R.M. test txt.

04:51.890 --> 04:58.100
If you pass a folder name after rem, remember that the folder needs to be empty.

04:58.880 --> 05:05.890
If you want to remove all the files from inside a folder and then remove the folder, you can run rem

05:05.930 --> 05:12.560
dash r as in recursive and then you can give the folder name or the whole folder structure.

05:12.860 --> 05:19.640
So in this case, this will remove any files inside new one, new to new three, as well as it will

05:19.640 --> 05:21.590
remove all three folders.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.060
So be careful when running rem dash r.

05:25.370 --> 05:29.420
If you want to copy file to another folder, you run CPP command.

05:29.420 --> 05:37.280
So in this case I'm copying Dave hops test txt file inside dave hops test folder.

05:37.280 --> 05:43.310
So I'm simply running cp the name of the file that I want to copy and then the destination.

05:44.370 --> 05:45.630
You can also move.

05:45.660 --> 05:52.710
So instead of CP, you run MV in this case, DevOps test, that test will be moved from the current

05:52.710 --> 06:01.320
directory to inside DevOps test directory to move one directory to another directory you can do CP dash

06:01.320 --> 06:03.090
ah as in recursive.

06:03.540 --> 06:10.140
In this case I'm moving the directory security inside the directory DevOps test.

06:10.410 --> 06:14.460
So in Linux the directory is basically the folder in Windows.

06:14.820 --> 06:15.750
You got the idea.

06:15.930 --> 06:16.500
All right.

06:16.500 --> 06:21.330
Those are the basic Linux commands that you will use in your day to day work.

06:21.630 --> 06:26.760
And with that being said, let's take a look into Linux file and user commands in the next lecture.
