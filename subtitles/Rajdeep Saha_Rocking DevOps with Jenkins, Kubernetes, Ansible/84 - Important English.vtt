Welcome, guys and girls, to this chapter.

00:02.250 --> 00:08.490
In this chapter, we are going to learn how you can deploy the container image of your application to

00:08.490 --> 00:09.630
Kubernetes cluster.

00:10.050 --> 00:16.080
For the Kubernetes cluster, we are going to use Amazon Ex or elastic Kubernetes service, and we are

00:16.080 --> 00:24.180
going to automate this whole DevOps pipeline using Jenkins as well as the brand new concept in Kubernetes

00:24.180 --> 00:25.170
DevOps world.

00:25.260 --> 00:29.880
Gitops Just a couple of quick things to keep in mind before we get started.

00:30.240 --> 00:39.810
Even though Jenkins running on DT to the micro AC Tools is under free tier, Amazon X is not under free

00:39.810 --> 00:40.410
tier.

00:40.950 --> 00:48.090
So if you decide to do the demo with me and if you provision Amazon Elastic Kubernetes service cluster,

00:48.240 --> 00:53.610
you will pay $0.10 per hour for each of the next cluster that you create.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.690
So for example, for this demo you need one X cluster.

00:57.810 --> 01:05.340
And if you follow this demo and run this x cluster for two or 3 hours, you will pay 20 to $0.30.

01:05.430 --> 01:11.760
Alternatively, you can decide to just watch this videos and grab the concepts, or you can follow along

01:11.760 --> 01:14.730
with me with the demo and pay that nominal fee.

01:14.730 --> 01:16.770
The decision is totally up to you.

01:17.340 --> 01:23.250
Another quick note for those of you who are already enrolled in my best selling Kubernetes course,

01:23.250 --> 01:30.960
rocking Kubernetes with Amazon Case Forget and DevOps in Udemy, you will find this chapter familiar

01:31.350 --> 01:35.550
because these concepts belong to both DevOps and Kubernetes.

01:35.550 --> 01:39.750
So these lectures are covered in this Kubernetes course as well.

01:39.750 --> 01:45.420
But for those of you who have not gone through those lectures, as well as new students in this course,

01:45.420 --> 01:50.130
let's get started and learn how you can use Jenkins with Kubernetes.
