In this lecture, we are going to learn what are Jenkins plug ins and how to install them.

00:07.580 --> 00:15.680
Plug ins are the primary means of enhancing the functionality of a Jenkins environment to satisfy organization

00:15.680 --> 00:17.720
or user specific needs.

00:18.110 --> 00:23.720
Let's say, for example, you want to integrate your GitHub repository with your Jenkins job.

00:23.720 --> 00:31.190
So to do that, you could write a bunch of groovy programs where you call GitHub API, you pass your

00:31.190 --> 00:36.950
authentication, and then you build everything that you want to do with the GitHub repository.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.530
But this would be very tedious.

00:39.560 --> 00:48.920
Instead, you can install a ready to use Jenkins plugin for GitHub and all you need to input is your

00:48.920 --> 00:52.010
repository and user ID and password.

00:52.040 --> 00:58.310
Another plugin example could be if you want to run your Jenkins job in a Docker container, you could

00:58.310 --> 01:03.500
simply install a Docker container plugin for Jenkins, which will allow you to do that.

01:03.500 --> 01:07.940
So it does all the heavy lifting for you so that you can just use it.

01:07.940 --> 01:10.850
Plugins or one of Jenkins superpower.

01:11.090 --> 01:18.950
So Jenkins has over 1800 plus community contributed plugins and if needed, you can write your own plugin

01:18.950 --> 01:19.530
as well.

01:19.550 --> 01:22.820
Let's say you want to find plugin for Docker.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.780
So you can simply search Docker and you could see all the plugins that are available.

01:28.810 --> 01:31.360
The number of plugins could be a little overwhelming.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.900
So as we go through reusable projects and real world projects, I will point out what plugins you should

01:37.900 --> 01:38.860
be installing.

01:38.890 --> 01:43.410
Let's jump into our Jenkins console to Access plugin.

01:43.420 --> 01:51.760
You can either go manage Jenkins or more conveniently click this down arrow by dashboard, manage Jenkins

01:51.760 --> 01:54.040
and then manage plugins.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.420
I want to click this.

01:56.240 --> 02:02.690
So when Jenkins get installed, Jenkins automatically installs some of the common plugins.

02:02.780 --> 02:08.990
So if you click this install tab, it is going to show you the plugins that's already installed.

02:09.290 --> 02:13.620
So Git is a critical component to work with any DevOps tools.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.080
So if you scroll down.

02:15.920 --> 02:22.550
You can see it installed this git client plugin, git plugin and GitHub API plugin.

02:23.280 --> 02:29.830
Now by default, Docker plugin is not installed to find and install a plugin.

02:29.850 --> 02:37.440
You go back up, click this available tab and on the search bar type in the name of the plugin or part

02:37.440 --> 02:43.800
of the name and you could see this plugins, Docker, Docker, Pipeline, Docker API, etc..

02:44.100 --> 02:48.300
So if you click this plugin, it is going to give a little overview.

02:48.330 --> 02:54.150
Plugin allows containers to be dynamically provisions as Jenkins node using Docker and down the line

02:54.150 --> 03:00.030
we have a bunch of Docker container demos that uses this plugin, so I'm going to install this.

03:00.030 --> 03:07.890
So I want to click this checkmark and you have to option install without restart and download now and

03:07.890 --> 03:09.480
install after restart.

03:09.570 --> 03:13.740
Most of the cases you can do install without restart.

03:14.790 --> 03:20.820
It is going to download the plugin onto your DC two box and then run the installation.

03:20.880 --> 03:27.060
Scroll down and for this plugin you could see it says you can start using the installed plugin right

03:27.060 --> 03:27.540
away.

03:27.930 --> 03:35.040
So click this, go back to the top of the page, brings back to the dashboard and then if you go dashboard

03:35.040 --> 03:43.860
manage Jenkins, manage plugins again, click installed and if you scroll down, you should see the

03:43.860 --> 03:45.840
Docker plugin.

03:45.930 --> 03:46.710
There you go.

03:46.710 --> 03:52.320
It shows the Docker plugin and if you want, you can uninstall the plugin as well and you can simply

03:52.320 --> 03:55.590
click this red x icon which will uninstall it.

03:55.710 --> 03:59.190
You can only only uninstall certain plugins.

03:59.190 --> 04:05.130
Certain plugins are integrated with the core of Jenkins, so you cannot really uninstall them.

04:05.340 --> 04:05.790
All right.

04:05.790 --> 04:06.990
So that's about it.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.360
The plugin very important component of Jenkins.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.640
This is why Jenkins is so powerful.

04:11.640 --> 04:12.870
That's it for this one.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.460
Join me in the next lecture.
