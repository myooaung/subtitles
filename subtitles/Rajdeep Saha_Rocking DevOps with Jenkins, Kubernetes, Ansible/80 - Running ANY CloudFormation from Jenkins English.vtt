Welcome, guys and girls, to another cloud formation with Jenkins lecture.

00:03.660 --> 00:11.160
So if you think about it, the way we created this Jenkins job, you can actually run any cloud formation

00:11.640 --> 00:16.530
because these Jenkins jobs is taking these four parameters.

00:16.530 --> 00:21.120
That stack name will be the name of the stack that you can give here.

00:21.660 --> 00:26.580
So the cloud formation stack name is basically the unique name that each cloud formation template gets

00:26.580 --> 00:27.510
submitted with.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.440
And then let's go over the template name.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.960
So this is the actual confirmation template.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.760
So you can input any template that you want.

00:37.770 --> 00:44.120
And all you need to do is pass the parameters for that template using these properties file.

00:44.130 --> 00:51.000
So you can basically keep these Jenkins job and keep passing different stack name, different template

00:51.000 --> 00:55.710
name and the input input parameter values for the confirmation template.

00:55.710 --> 01:00.530
And then you select a region where it should run that cloud formation and that's it.

01:00.540 --> 01:06.750
So using this generic Jenkins job, you can submit any cloud formation template.

01:06.870 --> 01:10.170
All right, folks, short lecture, but very powerful feature.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.210
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture.
