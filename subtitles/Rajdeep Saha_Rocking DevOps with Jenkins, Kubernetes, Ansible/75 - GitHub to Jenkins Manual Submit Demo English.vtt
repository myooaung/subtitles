In this lecture, we are going to demo how you can integrate a junkie job with GitHub repository.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.360
We are going to do this in two parts.

00:10.380 --> 00:15.750
In the first part, we are going to manually submit the Jenkins job that is connected to your GitHub

00:15.750 --> 00:16.530
repository.

00:16.650 --> 00:21.930
And in the second part, we are going to automate that where anything changes in your GitHub repository.

00:21.960 --> 00:26.310
Your Jenkins job will be automatically submitted using Webhook for this demo.

00:26.340 --> 00:32.310
We are going to use a very simple cloud formation, which is creating a S3 bucket and then printing

00:32.310 --> 00:35.680
that name of the bucket as the output for the first part.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.870
Jenkins file is pretty straightforward.

00:37.890 --> 00:43.960
It is just running a shell command and the command is capped and the name of the cloud formation file.

00:43.980 --> 00:48.750
So basically we are going to print out what's inside the cloud formation YAML file.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.500
And in the part two, we are actually going to run the confirmation.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.010
All right.

00:53.010 --> 00:58.400
From our Jenkins Dashboard Click New item and then give the name of the job.

00:58.410 --> 01:04.080
I'm going to give the name run CFD zero one select pipeline jobs, click.

01:04.080 --> 01:04.770
Okay.

01:05.070 --> 01:13.020
And under pipeline, you have to select pipeline script from scheme and the scheme will be git and you

01:13.020 --> 01:14.860
have to give the repository URL.

01:14.880 --> 01:22.410
So go back to your repository, click code, copy the DPS link, go back to the Jenkins job, pass the

01:22.410 --> 01:23.130
link here.

01:23.910 --> 01:25.380
So a couple of things to keep in mind.

01:25.380 --> 01:30.570
If this repository is public, you do not need to give any credentials.

01:30.570 --> 01:36.150
But if your repository is private, which this case it is, you will see this error.

01:36.150 --> 01:41.460
And then you have to select the GitHub credentials and the error will go away.

01:42.030 --> 01:48.120
The branch specified specifies which branch should this job look at for the Jenkins file and the other

01:48.120 --> 01:48.810
files.

01:49.110 --> 01:54.120
All new GitHub repository creates the main branch as man instead of master.

01:54.480 --> 02:00.210
So you have to rename this and in the other lectures you will see you can use other branch names and

02:00.210 --> 02:01.950
you have to change the names accordingly.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.980
Here the script path by default.

02:04.980 --> 02:07.230
The name of the file is Jenkins file.

02:07.230 --> 02:12.210
We'll keep it as is because we are using the same name for our Jenkins file.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.800
All right, click Save.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.530
So I'm going to manually build this.

02:16.530 --> 02:20.820
So all this job is going to do is display the cloud formation.

02:20.820 --> 02:21.450
YAML.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.620
Click build now.

02:24.370 --> 02:27.460
Click the job name click console output.

02:28.310 --> 02:35.510
It shows the Cat Command that the Jenkins file is running and it displays the content of our cloud formation

02:35.510 --> 02:36.680
from our GitHub.

02:36.710 --> 02:39.560
Now let's automate this using Webhook.
