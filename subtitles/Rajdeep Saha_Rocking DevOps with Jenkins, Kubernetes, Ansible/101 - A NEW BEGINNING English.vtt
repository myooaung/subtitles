Hello.

00:00.460 --> 00:01.010
And girls.

00:01.050 --> 00:03.180
Roger, instructor of this course.

00:03.450 --> 00:05.910
This is the very last video of this course.

00:05.910 --> 00:12.180
So, first of all, congratulations on finishing this course, and thank you for giving me a chance

00:12.180 --> 00:14.490
and enrolling in this DevOps course.

00:14.730 --> 00:22.710
Beyond this, I also have a YouTube channel where I post videos about different services, deep dives

00:22.710 --> 00:29.900
on technologies such as Kubernetes, DevOps, serverless tips and tricks for cloud DevOps interviews,

00:29.910 --> 00:38.430
how my workday looks like as a solution architect, etc. I also share how I switched my career from

00:38.430 --> 00:42.930
legacy technology to NWS and how you can do the same.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.540
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.

00:45.540 --> 00:50.460
My LinkedIn YouTube links are all given in my Udemy profile.

00:50.490 --> 00:52.890
Reach out to me with questions beyond.

00:52.890 --> 00:59.370
Get questions if you feel like you are stuck in your career and wondering whether you should do this

00:59.370 --> 01:01.540
certification or that certification.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.750
What technologies you should learn.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.970
Feel free to leave a note to me.

01:06.240 --> 01:12.390
I have been through that phase myself and it brings me great joy to help other people achieve their

01:12.390 --> 01:13.220
career goals.

01:13.260 --> 01:13.890
All right.

01:13.890 --> 01:16.350
With that being said, thank you again.

01:16.350 --> 01:17.190
Good luck.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.740
Keep learning and keep rocking.
