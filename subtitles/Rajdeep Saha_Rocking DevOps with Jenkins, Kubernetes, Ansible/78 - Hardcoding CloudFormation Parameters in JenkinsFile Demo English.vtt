00:01.660 --> 00:05.200
In the last lecture, we set up this Parameterized Jenkins job.

00:05.410 --> 00:12.220
In this lecture, what we are going to do is pass some of those parameters using Jenkins file, but

00:12.220 --> 00:16.300
we are also going to hardcoded the confirmation parameters in this lecture.

00:16.570 --> 00:22.660
And then once we are comfortable with passing parameters from Jenkins file in the next lecture, we

00:22.660 --> 00:28.420
are going to pass the cloud formation parameters using a dedicated parameter file.

00:28.750 --> 00:29.290
All right.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.510
With that being said, let's jump into this demo.

00:31.510 --> 00:33.700
So let's open up the Jenkins file.

00:33.940 --> 00:38.110
So instead of just doing the display of the cloud formation.

00:39.430 --> 00:44.890
We are going to run a shell script which is going to run this ad was cloud formation, deploy command.

00:45.160 --> 00:51.590
Now note that I am grabbing the stack name from the parameter stack underscore.

00:51.610 --> 00:52.420
Name.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.690
Name of the formation template from template.

00:55.690 --> 00:56.710
Underscore name.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.980
But the thing to remember is you can mix and match.

01:00.010 --> 01:04.000
It doesn't mean you have to use all the Jenkins job parameter.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.860
For example, even if I am grabbing the name of the region as a choice parameter, I can always hardcoded

01:11.860 --> 01:16.060
in this Jenkins shell script, so I'm just coding it to us.

01:16.060 --> 01:23.320
OST two and also for the parameter overrides, I am not grabbing the parameters from the file.

01:23.350 --> 01:29.230
Instead I'm hot coding the db password, db root password, db user and key name.

01:29.410 --> 01:34.480
The rest of the parameters in the cloud formation has a default value, so we don't have to do anything

01:34.480 --> 01:35.110
with those.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.390
All right, let's have this file.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.930
And I'm going to push the changes to to my GitHub repository.

01:48.810 --> 01:51.550
All right, now we are back to our Jenkins job.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.300
So we're going to pass the name of the stack as.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.270
For this demo.

01:57.270 --> 02:02.940
It doesn't matter what name you pass in these parameters, underscore file, underscore name because

02:02.940 --> 02:08.550
we are hard coding the confirmation parameters directly in the Jenkins file and this is the template

02:08.550 --> 02:09.030
name.

02:09.030 --> 02:13.710
They should match the name of the cloud formation that you have in your GitHub repository.

02:14.280 --> 02:20.370
Note that for our case, everything is under this main branch and there is no subfolder.

02:20.370 --> 02:23.190
If you have a self folder, you need to code accordingly.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.650
You'll see some example of that down the line.

02:25.650 --> 02:30.300
So the name of our cloud formation is zero to underscore WordPress JSON.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.920
So I'm just going to copy this.

02:34.360 --> 02:38.080
Best attire, even though I'm selecting a choice.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.920
Remember in the Jenkins file, I'm not using it yet.

02:40.930 --> 02:42.400
All right, let's try it out.

02:43.700 --> 02:44.090
All right.

02:44.090 --> 02:46.460
Our job is submitted with number two.

02:47.210 --> 02:50.060
So we are going to go to the console output of this job.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.860
Go to the console output.

02:52.070 --> 02:52.550
All right.

02:52.550 --> 02:54.320
This is the cloud formation command.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.610
And you could see it's displaying the values.

02:57.620 --> 03:05.780
We have input into the Jenkins parameter, such as what press does test 0102, underscore what press

03:05.780 --> 03:07.430
two, JSON, etc..

03:07.460 --> 03:11.030
Let's check our cloud formation console to see what's going on.

03:11.780 --> 03:12.200
All right.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.580
What press does test zero one stack create in progress?

03:17.690 --> 03:20.400
If we click events, it's going to show what's going on.

03:20.420 --> 03:25.820
It is going to take a little bit of the time because it's creating security group issues, etc..

03:26.210 --> 03:26.870
All right.

03:26.870 --> 03:29.110
Successfully created an updated stack.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.400
So let's go check out the information.

03:32.030 --> 03:33.320
Create complete.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.100
This is our website URL, so let's check it out.

03:38.850 --> 03:39.840
All right.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.970
Our WordPress is up and running.

03:41.970 --> 03:48.030
This is the familiar WordPress admin and install WordPress setup screen where you have to give the user

03:48.030 --> 03:49.950
name, password and a bunch of other stuff.

03:50.310 --> 03:51.660
I'm not going to go through it.

03:51.660 --> 03:57.330
You can do that if you're interested, but let's go back and tweak a little bit more to our Jenkins

03:57.330 --> 03:58.650
parameterized job.

03:58.800 --> 04:04.890
So at this point we successfully passed some parameters to the Jenkins job, but the cloud formation

04:04.890 --> 04:08.640
parameters, we still hardcoded in our Jenkins file.

04:08.910 --> 04:14.190
So in the next lecture, I'm going to show how you can pass all those parameters from the parameter

04:14.190 --> 04:14.620
file.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.320
All right, folks, see you in the next lecture.
