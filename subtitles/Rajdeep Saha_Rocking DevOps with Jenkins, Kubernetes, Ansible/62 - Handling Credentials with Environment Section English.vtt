00:00.090 --> 00:05.820
In this lecture, we are going to learn about another optional section of Jenkins file environment variable

00:05.820 --> 00:06.400
section.

00:06.420 --> 00:12.450
As the name suggests, this is very similar to Linux environment variable or any global variable.

00:12.450 --> 00:18.180
In Python or Java, you define environment variables under the section environment.

00:18.420 --> 00:23.340
And let's say in this case I'm creating this variable name stage and I'm defining this value.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.570
What to it?

00:24.570 --> 00:28.070
This variable will be available throughout the whole pipeline script.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.860
Alternatively, you can also define environment within stage.

00:31.860 --> 00:36.900
Even though that's not very common, you can access this environment variable like this.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.590
Let's say I want to display this stage variable.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.810
So if I want to display it, I'm going to do echo.

00:42.810 --> 00:48.930
Current stage is then the dollar symbol and then curly braces and then name of the environment variable.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.680
Some environment variables Jenkins provides you out of the box.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.900
Those are standard environment variables.

00:54.900 --> 01:01.410
For example, every time you submit a Jenkins job, it gets submitted with a unique build number.

01:01.410 --> 01:08.310
So this build number is available to you using standard variable build underscore number.

01:09.060 --> 01:15.030
So for example if I want to display it echo current build number is dollar calibrates build underscore

01:15.030 --> 01:15.660
number.

01:15.750 --> 01:22.680
Not that I did not need to define this build underscore number in this environment section and this

01:22.680 --> 01:24.750
build number is quite handy.

01:24.870 --> 01:30.330
And let's say for example, we are building a Docker container image and instead of using the tag latest

01:30.330 --> 01:34.410
for each build, I want to use the build number as the tag.

01:34.410 --> 01:39.060
So each of the docker container generated is unique for each build.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.620
So here is an example.

01:40.620 --> 01:45.630
And don't worry, we are going to go through all this Jenkins file when we go through reusable projects

01:45.630 --> 01:46.830
and real world projects.

01:46.830 --> 01:53.910
But in this case I am building a Docker image and I'm tagging it with dollar build underscore number.

01:53.910 --> 02:00.330
So every time this job is run, a new docker container image will be created with the tag, same as

02:00.330 --> 02:01.860
the build number of the job.

02:01.860 --> 02:07.680
So how do you know what other standard environment variables Jenkins is providing it to you?

02:08.370 --> 02:09.390
To find that out.

02:09.390 --> 02:16.770
All you need to do is simply go to the URL of your Jenkins and then slash pipeline death syntax slash

02:16.770 --> 02:19.260
gobbles pound env.

02:19.290 --> 02:23.880
So if I go to the page for my Jenkins so you can see it lists all the variables.

02:24.360 --> 02:28.710
We displayed the example with the build number, but there a bunch of other ones available.

02:29.430 --> 02:35.730
So one of the most practical use cases of environment section is actually username and password.

02:35.760 --> 02:40.200
Let's say you have a bunch of username password saved under Jenkins credential.

02:40.260 --> 02:46.530
Let's say in this case I have my docker hive user I.D. and token saved under the ID Docker hub.

02:46.710 --> 02:53.340
So if I want to use this in my Jenkins file, I will define this environment section and then this variable

02:53.340 --> 02:55.040
docker hub underscore creds.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.830
I am grabbing the credentials where the ID is Docker hub.

02:58.860 --> 03:03.840
Remember the username and the password is saved with the same ID it needs to match.

03:03.870 --> 03:11.310
So the important part here is when you use this environment variable in this way, Jenkins will create

03:11.310 --> 03:19.620
two different variables under the hood, so it will save that username for these Docker hub credentials

03:19.770 --> 03:25.170
in the variable Docker hub, underscore creds, underscore user or user.

03:25.170 --> 03:30.390
And it will also save the passwords with Docker hub, underscore creds, underscore P as W.

03:30.810 --> 03:37.170
So if I scroll down, I can use the Docker login command with the username Docker hub, underscore creds,

03:37.170 --> 03:43.050
underscore user password as Docker Hub underscore creds, underscore P as W.

03:43.990 --> 03:52.120
Not that you did not have to define this, underscore us R or underscore P as W in this environment

03:52.120 --> 03:52.900
section.

03:52.930 --> 03:56.090
Don't worry too much about this particular Jenkins file.

03:56.110 --> 04:02.590
We will go over this Jenkins file in detail when you go over how to build and push your container image

04:02.590 --> 04:03.520
to Docker Hub.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.580
All right, folks, that's how you use the environment section.

04:06.610 --> 04:07.550
That's it for this one.

04:07.570 --> 04:09.450
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture.
