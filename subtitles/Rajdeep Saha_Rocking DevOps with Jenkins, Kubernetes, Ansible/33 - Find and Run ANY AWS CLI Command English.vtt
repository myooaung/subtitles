00:00.180 --> 00:01.920
Welcome, girls, to this lecture.

00:02.130 --> 00:07.440
This is an important lecture because in this lecture we are going to learn how you can find and run

00:07.440 --> 00:09.510
any cell I command.

00:10.080 --> 00:16.890
This is a more of a teaching you how to fish kind of a lecture and not giving you the fish directly.

00:17.190 --> 00:22.980
So in future, if something changes, new service comes out, you will know how to handle it.

00:23.340 --> 00:23.790
All right.

00:23.790 --> 00:27.300
With that being said, let's jump into our trusty cloud shell.

00:27.780 --> 00:28.200
All right.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.860
So we have cloud shell up and running with SQL already installed.

00:32.430 --> 00:39.150
Now then go to Google and run NWS CLI commands.

00:39.150 --> 00:44.190
And the first link from us should be the link that we are looking for.

00:44.760 --> 00:52.890
So it is Amazon.com slash CLI and then click CLI reference.

00:53.490 --> 00:56.100
Here is all the commands that's available.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.300
So let's say you want to list all the lambdas in your account.

01:00.930 --> 01:07.590
So if you scroll down, it is going to list all the available services that you can use the CLI with.

01:07.620 --> 01:14.580
What I do is if I know what service I want to work with, I simply press control F or the find command

01:14.790 --> 01:18.180
and then type in the name of the service, in this case Lambda.

01:18.300 --> 01:26.760
And then you click this and this s means the command will start with the S and then you need to use

01:26.760 --> 01:32.160
Lambda and then you scroll down and it shows all the available commands.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.510
So here you have to just maybe do click a couple of times.

01:36.510 --> 01:38.040
You might not get this right.

01:38.490 --> 01:42.810
So let's say we want to display all the lambdas available in my account.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.890
So basically I am trying to list all the lambdas.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.230
So you might think get function is it.

01:49.230 --> 01:55.490
But if you click get function it's actually to get the details of a particular lambda.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.650
So now you know that's not the correct command.

01:58.650 --> 02:02.460
So you go back and then you see this list functions.

02:02.460 --> 02:07.830
So you click that and it shows returns a list of lambda functions, right?

02:07.830 --> 02:13.500
So you know, this is the command you need to use and if you scroll down, it is going to show an example.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.160
But let's say you want to have example for everything.

02:17.760 --> 02:24.000
So the good way to remember is it shows the W.S. Lambda List functions, and then it shows the required

02:24.000 --> 02:25.950
and optional fields.

02:25.950 --> 02:31.470
Whichever option is inside this square brackets means they're optional.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.450
You don't need to provide them.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.940
So for this command, since we are starting with SQLite, this is a pretty straightforward command that

02:38.940 --> 02:40.320
is no required fields.

02:40.950 --> 02:42.370
So how do you run this command?

02:42.390 --> 02:43.260
Very simple.

02:43.260 --> 02:47.970
You type it up s space, lambda space list dash functions.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.770
So let's try it out.

02:50.190 --> 02:51.330
Adam Lewis Test.

02:51.330 --> 02:55.590
Lambda Space List Functions.

02:58.770 --> 02:59.150
All right.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.640
So it gives me all the lambdas in this account and in this region.

03:02.640 --> 03:10.260
So get bitcoin price and then I can keep scrolling and it is going to show everything so you can type

03:10.260 --> 03:13.410
control C to get out of the listing.

03:13.530 --> 03:19.620
Now let's say you want to invoke a lambda function, so I'm going to go back to all the available options

03:19.620 --> 03:20.730
under lambda.

03:20.940 --> 03:23.910
So invoke this sounds like the right one.

03:23.910 --> 03:30.420
Click invoke and then if you scroll down, you could see in this case you need to pass the function

03:30.420 --> 03:38.910
name and out file so this out file will save the output and note that both the function name and out

03:38.910 --> 03:41.670
file is not inside a square bracket.

03:41.670 --> 03:49.170
That means they are mandatory fields and the function name you could give the function name or the air

03:49.170 --> 03:49.650
in.

03:50.400 --> 03:57.150
So let's say I have this lambda function get bitcoin price to which gets the bitcoin price for the current

03:57.150 --> 03:58.230
date and time.

03:58.350 --> 04:06.090
So if I run test it simply says price of bitcoin is this and then it doesn't take any input.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.810
So let's try to invoke this lambda function.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.610
So we have this function area.

04:12.630 --> 04:19.290
And so I'm just going to copy this function and go back to the cloud shell and then I'm going to open

04:19.290 --> 04:22.110
this and the command side by side.

04:22.290 --> 04:27.360
All right, so let's start typing in blue as lambda.

04:27.540 --> 04:28.770
Invoke.

04:29.640 --> 04:36.320
And then we put dash dash function that's name past the air.

04:36.330 --> 04:39.930
N And then we have to give the name of the file.

04:40.080 --> 04:47.220
Let's say we're just going to put output txt this output txt file does not need to exist.

04:47.550 --> 04:52.950
This NASA command will create the file as well as put the output inside this file.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.960
All right, so let's present our status quo.

04:56.990 --> 05:02.330
200 means the function has been invoked successfully and the output is saved in output.

05:02.450 --> 05:05.600
TXT So we can see that we already learn this part.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.780
How do you display the content of a file in Linux?

05:08.780 --> 05:10.820
Cat sparse file let.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.450
So it shows the price of Bitcoin.

05:17.320 --> 05:17.770
All right.

05:17.770 --> 05:20.470
So that's how you invoke a lambda.

05:20.500 --> 05:26.530
Hopefully at this point, you folks are starting to get the idea of how to run any ad command.

05:27.010 --> 05:28.480
So let's go back out.

05:29.110 --> 05:31.510
Let's say we want to create an S3 bucket.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.700
So I'm on the SLA command page, so I'm simply do control F and it's three.

05:37.390 --> 05:38.020
Here we go.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.250
Select us three.

05:39.700 --> 05:43.510
Okay, so now we want to create a three.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.880
So we're going to scroll down to available commands.

05:46.330 --> 05:53.830
S3 fortunately doesn't have that many available commands, so m b is four meg bucket.

05:53.950 --> 05:58.410
If you don't know that, you have to click around a little bit or you can google up to you.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.740
So emby.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.960
So if I scroll down.

06:02.740 --> 06:04.240
So pretty straightforward.

06:04.780 --> 06:07.210
Space three, space emby.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.090
And then you have to give the name of the bucket.

06:10.690 --> 06:13.060
So here are some examples as well.

06:13.510 --> 06:26.610
So let's try it out on the left end of Lewis three and B se three column slash slash wac fly cause test.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.390
Let's press enter.

06:29.990 --> 06:30.380
All right.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.780
The bucket is successfully created.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.140
So now I also want to remove this bucket.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.320
So to remove ram.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.760
So very similar to the Linux commands.

06:40.760 --> 06:47.490
So scroll down a w s paste three spacer n and then the name of the bucket with the S3.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.180
Your ISO basically has three columns last class.

06:51.290 --> 06:55.460
So I'm going to type in s s space s three.

06:55.460 --> 06:56.870
Space r.

06:56.870 --> 06:57.530
M.

06:58.380 --> 07:04.890
And then se three column slash slash WAC ally

07:07.590 --> 07:09.480
course test presenter.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.210
All right, the bucket is removed.

07:12.240 --> 07:18.330
All right, folks, this is how you can find and run any SQL commands.

07:18.330 --> 07:25.140
And this will become handy when we actually run a DevOps jobs to create, manipulate, delete different

07:25.590 --> 07:26.310
resources.

07:27.060 --> 07:28.610
Alright, folks, that's it for this one.

07:28.620 --> 07:31.080
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture by.
