00:00.120 --> 00:03.870
Welcome, guys and girls, to running TerraForm from Jenkins lecture.

00:04.220 --> 00:10.770
And so before we do all the fun stuff of running the actual TerraForm, write the Jenkins file and stuff,

00:11.160 --> 00:13.800
we have to take care of some installation and set up.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.720
We're going to go over that in this lecture.

00:15.750 --> 00:16.290
All right.

00:16.290 --> 00:17.310
Let's get started.

00:19.360 --> 00:25.780
So when it comes to terraform with the Jenkins set up, you need to install TerraForm in Jenkins agent.

00:25.780 --> 00:28.180
So we are running Jenkins in EC2.

00:28.180 --> 00:34.780
So we are going to install terraform on EC2 and then we have to install the TerraForm Jenkins plugin

00:34.780 --> 00:39.730
from Jenkins and then you have to set up the TerraForm Path in Jenkins.

00:39.730 --> 00:45.370
And the last thing you need is whatever your TerraForm script is trying to do, let's say in this case

00:45.370 --> 00:48.460
we are trying to provision an x cluster.

00:49.060 --> 00:56.260
So the Jenkins agent must have appropriate IAM role attached to it with the appropriate policies with

00:56.260 --> 01:00.550
access to create all the necessary components for x cluster.

01:00.970 --> 01:02.890
All right, let's do one by one.

01:02.890 --> 01:09.190
Let's start with installing TerraForm in Jenkins agent to find out how to install TerraForm in your

01:09.280 --> 01:11.620
agent Google TerraForm.

01:11.830 --> 01:16.660
And so our case we are running on EC2, which is running on Amazon Linux two.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.110
So let's click download TerraForm and then go to Linux.

01:23.110 --> 01:25.390
And in our case we are using Amazon Linux.

01:25.390 --> 01:28.660
So you have to select the appropriate operating system you are using.

01:29.410 --> 01:29.800
All right.

01:29.800 --> 01:33.970
So now we are going to search into the Jenkins agent.

01:34.570 --> 01:37.240
So my Jenkins is running inside the CC too.

01:37.390 --> 01:40.000
I'm going to use the Xlm Connect.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.590
So click connect.

01:42.040 --> 01:49.240
All right, go back to the installation instruction and then I'm going to run the commands one by one.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.230
All right.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.880
Next, I'm going to add this hash cop report.

02:00.290 --> 02:00.800
All right.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.400
And finally, we're going to run install TerraForm.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.100
All right.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.220
TerraForm is installed.

02:11.730 --> 02:18.180
If I clear my screen and type, which terraform it is going to show us the path.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.860
So its user being terraform.

02:19.860 --> 02:26.880
We need to use this for setting up the Jenkins path, but before that, let's go into Jenkins and install

02:26.880 --> 02:28.260
TerraForm plugin.

02:28.350 --> 02:30.000
All right, click this icon.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.860
By this time, you folks all know how to install plugins, manage plugins and click available and then

02:38.820 --> 02:40.170
type terraform.

02:40.350 --> 02:43.980
All right, click terraform install without restart.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.530
All right, it's done.

02:46.530 --> 02:49.980
So now we have to set up the path to do that.

02:49.980 --> 02:56.490
I got to manage Jenkins and the global tool configuration and then scroll down.

02:56.490 --> 03:04.050
You should see TerraForm at TerraForm uncheck this install automatically because we already installed

03:04.170 --> 03:09.480
TerraForm, we are just going to give the path to the install directory, give the name as terraform

03:09.480 --> 03:10.950
install directory.

03:10.950 --> 03:12.570
So here you have to give the directory.

03:12.570 --> 03:17.550
So if we go back, it is slash user slash bin.

03:17.550 --> 03:24.060
So we are just going to put slash user slash bin and then you have to put a slash.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.860
All right, click save.

03:25.890 --> 03:26.370
All right.

03:26.370 --> 03:32.160
Now, the last thing is to set up the IAM role for the Jenkins legend in our case, ESI two.

03:32.970 --> 03:38.790
So if I select the ESI two and then go to security, it is going to show us the IAM role.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.160
So if I click this so here in the ESI two role, you want to attach the policies that you need and generally

03:47.160 --> 03:48.570
you use list privilege.

03:48.570 --> 03:53.370
So if you want to submit cloud formation and create a S3 bucket, we saw this before.

03:53.370 --> 03:58.680
You attach the policy to submit cloud formation and policy to create S3 bucket.

03:59.250 --> 04:05.610
But since in this chapter we are going to do a bunch of things like create VPC and then create a cluster,

04:05.610 --> 04:11.890
and IT guest cluster requires a lot of permissions and not just the Kubernetes cluster you need ESI

04:11.940 --> 04:16.560
to Nat Gateway, PPC, egress, all that stuff.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.430
So I'll just put admin access in this role just for this demo.

04:20.820 --> 04:26.160
But in your Real World project, when you are doing a specific thing, you should always attach specific

04:26.160 --> 04:26.910
policy.

04:27.770 --> 04:28.010
Okay.

04:28.010 --> 04:34.370
So now what we're going to do is we're just going to check if our Jenkins job can have access to this

04:34.370 --> 04:35.090
terraform.

04:35.780 --> 04:38.060
So we're just going to click new item.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.240
I'm gonna terraform check pipeline, click.

04:41.240 --> 04:41.930
Okay.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.820
Scroll down just to Hello World.

04:48.620 --> 04:52.040
And after this hello world I'm put S-H.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.540
Tough on fashion.

04:57.540 --> 05:02.580
So I'm just checking if this basic TerraForm Command runs in our Jenkins job.

05:03.210 --> 05:04.410
Click Save.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.550
Click Build now.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.290
OC Tran.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.630
We're going to check the console output.

05:10.510 --> 05:11.210
Here we go.

05:11.230 --> 05:13.960
The Terraformed version gave us the most up to date.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.830
Version Terraformed.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.450
Version 1.1.9.

05:16.870 --> 05:17.710
All right, folks.

05:17.710 --> 05:20.830
At this point, TerraForm is installed.

05:21.280 --> 05:27.910
Both the software in our Jenkins agent, as well as Jenkins plugin, as well as the path is set.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.630
So let's jump into the next lecture and run some TerraForm scripts.
