00:00.120 --> 00:03.900
Welcome guys and girls to another TerraForm with Jenkins demo.

00:03.930 --> 00:08.070
In this demo, we are going to provision a Kubernetes cluster.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.240
Let's get started.

00:09.780 --> 00:14.140
There are some things to keep in mind for TerraForm Plus, Jenkins Plus.

00:15.330 --> 00:21.720
So obviously the TerraForm for ECS is a little bit more involved than creating the VPC.

00:22.320 --> 00:29.160
So the best way to do this is take the terraform from some official repository for this demo.

00:29.190 --> 00:35.870
I'm going to use the official S X blueprint, so I'm going to go over the repository.

00:35.880 --> 00:40.500
This repository is quite handy for you, for your real world projects.

00:40.830 --> 00:45.020
And then this terraform also requires running help charts.

00:45.030 --> 00:46.910
So we need to install help.

00:47.220 --> 00:54.380
And then, like I mentioned before, as TerraForm releases new version, they change the key words.

00:54.390 --> 00:59.400
I don't know why, but they do it and the existing TerraForm scripts will break.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.700
So hopefully NWS keeps the TerraForm scripts up to date as the TerraForm version changes.

01:06.090 --> 01:09.450
I am recording this lecture May of 2022.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.920
So down the line, if you get an error, try to stackoverflow it.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.140
Try to check the version requirements.

01:16.170 --> 01:21.360
The official ethics blueprint does specify the version requirements, so check your TerraForm version

01:21.360 --> 01:22.170
and all that stuff.

01:22.230 --> 01:24.060
But hopefully everything runs smoothly.

01:24.060 --> 01:28.860
And last but not the least, the AC two agent must have appropriate IAM role.

01:29.310 --> 01:35.370
So for this demo I have attached the administrator role, but you can check the terraform output and

01:35.370 --> 01:41.250
see what resources TerraForm created and then selectively attach those policies.

01:42.150 --> 01:47.130
But anyway, let's go over that TerraForm official six blueprints.

01:47.310 --> 01:47.790
All right.

01:47.790 --> 01:53.550
So this is the repository for official TerraForm X blueprints.

01:54.030 --> 01:59.220
If you go inside the examples folder, it has a lot of real world examples.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.770
So this repository is really awesome.

02:01.890 --> 02:07.950
So you can create a complete Kubernetes cluster with the add ons that you generally use, such as metric

02:07.950 --> 02:13.020
servers, etc. You can install Kubernetes cluster with cross plan.

02:13.050 --> 02:19.830
For us, we are doing this X cluster with the new VPC like a fresh install, but check this out if you

02:19.830 --> 02:26.490
need a fully private access cluster, all the terraform are givens and once you understand this demo,

02:26.880 --> 02:29.070
you can run all of this, right?

02:29.070 --> 02:30.540
So that's the beauty of it.

02:31.320 --> 02:36.330
So let me go back out and then go to X cluster with new VPC.

02:37.230 --> 02:42.810
So what we are going to do is we are going to use this repository and then we are going to follow this

02:42.810 --> 02:45.330
red me to create our Jenkins job.

02:45.420 --> 02:52.200
So if you scroll down, it is going to specify the tools or softwares it need to run.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.180
So it requests TerraForm.

02:54.180 --> 02:59.610
A version should be greater than equal to 1.0.08 cli.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.840
We already installed that as well so helm we need to install helm.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.020
It should be greater than equal to 2.4.1.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.860
And Kubernetes is basically the CTL package.

03:10.860 --> 03:13.900
We are not going to do this one because we are not going to run it.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.310
We're just going to provision the Kubernetes cluster.

03:17.310 --> 03:23.540
We have separate demo on how to install applications into Kubernetes cluster using Gitops.

03:23.550 --> 03:30.510
All right, so we have this terraform, we have a W s CLI, so let's install HELME and then we are going

03:30.510 --> 03:32.490
to go and set up the Jenkins job.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.030
All right.

03:33.030 --> 03:39.060
So for that, you can go to official helm documentation and we are going to run this commands.

03:39.570 --> 03:43.890
So let's connect to the Amazon, see to where our Jenkins is running.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.550
So click this.

03:45.550 --> 03:46.780
Click Connect.

03:47.170 --> 03:50.410
All right, then I'm going to run this command.

03:52.410 --> 03:53.370
Then I'm going to see.

03:53.610 --> 03:53.940
What?

03:53.940 --> 03:55.020
The file.

03:56.820 --> 04:00.090
And finally run the shell script.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.610
All right, helm installed.

04:04.610 --> 04:05.630
So let's check.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.220
Helm fashion.

04:08.310 --> 04:08.670
All right.

04:08.670 --> 04:10.530
Russian 3.8.2.

04:10.950 --> 04:11.600
All right.

04:11.610 --> 04:18.300
Helm is installed, so I'm going to scroll up and we have to use these steps.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.560
So let's go to our Jenkins shop.

04:20.580 --> 04:21.120
All right.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.930
So we have a standard Jenkins job up type pipeline.

04:25.290 --> 04:28.050
Nothing special, no options checked.

04:28.230 --> 04:31.110
So this is the important part, the pipeline script.

04:31.650 --> 04:34.010
So the first, we are cloning the TerraForm repo.

04:34.020 --> 04:43.590
Again, I'm using pipeline syntax and this time we are cloning the S6 blueprint repository.

04:43.590 --> 04:43.830
Right.

04:43.830 --> 04:48.420
So basically the sequence blueprints code copy this.

04:48.570 --> 04:57.630
We are using this pipeline syntax and then check out and then repository URL branch specify our main

04:57.630 --> 05:01.080
and that's a public repository so we don't need credentials.

05:01.110 --> 05:01.860
Here we go.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.780
So I'm just going to copy this.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.730
And then that's what I pasted here.

05:06.630 --> 05:07.020
Okay.

05:07.020 --> 05:10.350
And then this part we already know from the previous demo.

05:10.950 --> 05:17.040
So Shell script block, we are seeding into example slash case cluster with new VPC.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.940
So I am actually just following the commands here.

05:20.940 --> 05:21.240
Right.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.410
So it's doing Git Clone.

05:22.410 --> 05:28.200
We did that with check out and then I'm doing seed examples and then terraform in it.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.720
So if I go back to the Jenkins job.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.490
In it.

05:32.490 --> 05:39.450
And based on this red me file, it's doing an export a w s underscore region and then it is doing TerraForm

05:39.450 --> 05:39.990
plan.

05:39.990 --> 05:43.540
So if I go back to Jenkins, I am setting up a.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.070
S region to us so s two and then terraform plan.

05:47.400 --> 05:54.480
And then if I go back terraform apply without to appropriate it says entity has to apply so here to

05:54.660 --> 06:01.080
apply or to approve and then the Jenkins job is going to wait till we click, proceed or abort.

06:01.080 --> 06:06.000
It is going to ask a question whether we want to destroy the TerraForm resources or not.

06:06.000 --> 06:14.130
So I'm going to go and show the X cluster on my console and then we're going to go and destroy it again.

06:14.130 --> 06:20.280
Like I said in the last lecture, the seed only works within the scope of the shell script.

06:20.670 --> 06:24.840
As soon as you get out of it, it goes back to the previous folder.

06:25.170 --> 06:28.650
That's why I have to do a seed here again.

06:28.650 --> 06:31.980
And then after from Destroy does that shatterproof.

06:31.980 --> 06:38.550
I have also given the Jenkins file inside this TerraForm folder with the name X underscore Jenkins file

06:38.550 --> 06:39.690
for your reference.

06:39.840 --> 06:45.270
All right, so let's save this job and then click build.

06:45.270 --> 06:48.600
Now let's go to console output.

06:49.420 --> 06:50.850
So it's creating all this stuff.

06:50.860 --> 06:54.310
VPC Private subnet, public subnet, net gateway.

06:54.340 --> 06:58.150
EMI So this will take 10 to 15 minutes.

06:58.150 --> 07:02.050
So I'm going to pause the video and come back once it's done.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.340
All right.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.610
So our TerraForm reply has finished running.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.360
So if I scroll up, it shows all the details.

07:10.360 --> 07:19.360
So it created a exe managed node group, it created the cluster with the name, it was pre prod dev

07:19.360 --> 07:20.200
x.

07:20.380 --> 07:25.420
So as I was saying, this creates a lot more resources than the VPC.

07:25.780 --> 07:32.140
So you could see it created 75 different resources like public subnet, private subnet, NAD Gateway,

07:32.170 --> 07:34.120
egress rule, all that stuff.

07:34.630 --> 07:39.310
So let's go to a console and see if our X cluster is indeed there.

07:40.060 --> 07:40.510
All right.

07:40.510 --> 07:41.230
I am in a W.

07:41.230 --> 07:44.910
S console to go to Elastic Community Service.

07:44.920 --> 07:49.930
You can simply type X and how do we go Elastic Kubernetes service?

07:50.710 --> 07:51.610
All right.

07:51.610 --> 07:56.260
Our cluster is up and running as pre prod dev x.

07:56.530 --> 08:04.240
So if I click it and go to configuration compute, here is the manage node group.

08:04.720 --> 08:10.780
So if I go to EC2 I should see the worker nodes for this man is node group.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.040
Let's go to easy to.

08:13.430 --> 08:15.470
Instances, running instances.

08:15.680 --> 08:22.430
So this is my Jenkins instance, but the bottom three are the instances for x.

08:22.460 --> 08:22.990
Let's see.

08:23.000 --> 08:23.960
Tag.

08:24.530 --> 08:24.950
Yep.

08:25.010 --> 08:26.870
NWS prepaid debit cards.

08:27.530 --> 08:29.330
So the x cluster is up.

08:29.330 --> 08:32.240
So at this point, you can give access to people.

08:33.050 --> 08:36.050
You can deploy applications to it and all that stuff.

08:36.590 --> 08:43.700
But like I said, we are going to deploy applications to X cluster using Jenkins and Gitops.

08:44.240 --> 08:51.260
So in this lecture I just wanted to show how you can run practically any terraform from Jenkins.

08:51.500 --> 08:58.050
But before we end the lecture, if you are following me, please make sure you destroy the x cluster.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.750
Else we will pay a lot of money.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.890
Click the arrow post for input destructor.

09:03.890 --> 09:06.320
If I'm resources, click proceed.

09:06.920 --> 09:11.210
All right, so now it should destroy the X cluster.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.740
All right, I'll let it run.

09:12.740 --> 09:15.170
But hopefully this chapter was useful.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.820
My goal was not just to show you how to run one single terraform.

09:20.120 --> 09:27.460
My goal was to show you how you can go to this official TerraForm Repository or any other official repository,

09:27.470 --> 09:33.230
grab the TerraForm, install the required softwares, and then run it from your Jenkins file.

09:33.260 --> 09:34.430
That's it for this one.

09:34.460 --> 09:37.130
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture by.
