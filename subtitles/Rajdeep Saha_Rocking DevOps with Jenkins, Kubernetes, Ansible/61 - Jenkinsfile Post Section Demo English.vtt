Welcome, boys and girls, to the Jenkins File Post demo.

00:03.390 --> 00:09.300
Let's jump into the Jenkins console family using the same job that we used for the Jenkins file.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.290
The easy way.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.720
So basically it's copies.

00:12.750 --> 00:17.100
A GitHub repository displays a read me file list S3 buckets.

00:17.190 --> 00:25.560
What I did was I added the post section and this post section should only run when one are more than

00:25.560 --> 00:28.230
one stages of this job failed.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.960
And I'm just displaying job filled.

00:31.140 --> 00:37.020
And what I'm going to do is this list has three buckets, says A.W. s three L's.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.140
So I'm just going to remove this last part.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.330
So this command should fail.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.650
So let's save this and then submit this job.

00:47.650 --> 00:51.730
All right, so the copy report went successfully.

00:51.730 --> 00:53.800
So does the display read me file.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.460
But the list is three buckets failed, as we suspected.

00:57.730 --> 01:01.270
And you could see the declarative post actions ran.

01:01.570 --> 01:05.140
It ran because this list as three buckets failed.

01:05.920 --> 01:14.980
So now I'm going to go back to this Jenkins file and put back the three less common back.

01:14.980 --> 01:22.090
And in this case, when I submit the job, the post section should not run because the other stages

01:22.090 --> 01:23.410
should execute fine.

01:23.410 --> 01:26.530
So let's click save, click build now.

01:26.830 --> 01:27.580
All right.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.030
So in this case, the first three stages went fine.

01:31.030 --> 01:35.560
And as a result, the declarative post actions did not execute.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.970
And if I change from failure to always.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.330
And changes to buy.

01:44.510 --> 01:45.830
Click Save.

01:47.270 --> 01:47.810
Click Build.

01:47.810 --> 01:48.460
Now again.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.130
So this time all the three stages along with the post should run.

01:53.150 --> 01:53.810
All right.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.760
Pretty straightforward.

01:56.060 --> 02:01.400
Again, post is used mostly if there is an error and you want to take some action.

02:02.090 --> 02:03.710
All right, folks, that's it for this one.

02:03.710 --> 02:05.740
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture.
