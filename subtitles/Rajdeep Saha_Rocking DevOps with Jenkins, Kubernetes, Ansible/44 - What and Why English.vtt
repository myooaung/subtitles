00:00.090 --> 00:01.170
All right.

00:01.200 --> 00:05.640
Finally, it's time to talk about the superstar of DevOps.

00:05.760 --> 00:12.840
Jenkins In this lecture, we are going to learn what is Jenkins and why is it so popular?

00:14.310 --> 00:21.180
At this point, we understand the different phases of DevOps as well as what is CI and what is CDD.

00:21.690 --> 00:29.760
But remember, DevOps has been around for more than ten years and it is a multibillion dollar market

00:29.760 --> 00:33.680
with year over year growth of double digit percentage.

00:33.690 --> 00:39.120
So it's normal that a lot of big companies want to capture this market.

00:39.510 --> 00:44.730
Jenkins is one of the automation tool for this, but that's not the only one.

00:44.760 --> 00:51.450
There are over 100 DevOps tools, including some of the tools from big companies.

00:54.180 --> 01:03.000
And after many years of fierce battle, Jenkins is the winner, according to a recent DevOps survey.

01:03.030 --> 01:07.870
64% of all DevOps pipelines run on Jenkins.

01:07.890 --> 01:13.680
The next software is Tim City, where only 8% of the DevOps pipelines run there.

01:13.710 --> 01:19.060
Then Circle CI and then the rest of the tools divide the remaining percentages.

01:20.050 --> 01:25.000
So the main question is why Jenkins Why is it so popular?

01:25.030 --> 01:30.260
So Jenkins is an open source sicced tool for Dave Hobbs.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.710
It started in 2004.

01:33.040 --> 01:38.810
The main superpower of Jenkins is it has the package flexibility.

01:38.830 --> 01:48.010
You can install and run Jenkins in your local machine on prem, easy to docker, forget Kubernetes and

01:48.010 --> 01:48.580
more.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.950
And it is cloud agnostic.

01:50.950 --> 01:58.060
Doesn't matter which cloud you use, you can always use Jenkins to instrument your second pipeline.

01:58.090 --> 02:06.870
The other superpower of Jenkins is it has superior integration with numerous tools for all DevOps phases.

02:06.880 --> 02:13.270
As you could see, there is a lot of components for each of these DevOps phases, such as compiling

02:13.270 --> 02:20.980
code saving artifacts, unit testing, integration, testing, deploying, etc. And it is impossible

02:20.980 --> 02:23.230
to have one tool fits all.

02:23.350 --> 02:30.910
But the superpower of Jenkins is whatever tools you use for compiling your code, testing your code,

02:30.910 --> 02:33.340
even doing security analysis.

02:33.430 --> 02:37.270
Jenkins integrates with almost all of them.

02:37.330 --> 02:42.460
The next reason Jenkins is so popular is because of its vibrant community.

02:42.880 --> 02:49.540
Remember that Jenkins is open source, so they are not even charging money for you to run it like some

02:49.540 --> 02:51.010
other DevOps tools.

02:51.040 --> 02:55.360
Jenkins has over 1800 plus plugins.

02:55.600 --> 03:02.590
You can even contribute your own plugins to the ecosystem or if you want, your company can write its

03:02.590 --> 03:04.090
own private plugins.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.010
Jenkins supports all that.

03:06.760 --> 03:14.320
Since it has been around from 2004 and it runs on any infrastructure, it is very easy to find quick

03:14.320 --> 03:20.080
starts, workshops and example and if you face any issues while deploying these.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.200
Jenkins Quick stats are real world applications.

03:23.290 --> 03:29.110
You get extensive question answers that's already out there as well as documentation.

03:29.140 --> 03:36.340
If your enterprise does not want the open source Jenkins and want some sort of enterprise support as

03:36.340 --> 03:40.480
well as some security checks and balances, that's fine as well.

03:40.510 --> 03:46.630
There are other third party companies that build DevOps offerings on top of Jenkins.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.750
One big example of this is CloudBees.

03:49.870 --> 03:56.860
And last but not the least, Jenkins is constantly evolving and progressing with technology.

03:57.220 --> 04:05.470
When Jenkins came out, it could only run on virtual machines, but today it kept up with all the container

04:05.470 --> 04:06.270
development.

04:06.280 --> 04:11.700
You can run Jenkins not only on Kubernetes, but on target as well.

04:11.710 --> 04:16.120
So keep these reasons in mind in the interview, if the interviewer asks you.

04:16.150 --> 04:17.390
What is Jenkins?

04:17.410 --> 04:25.150
Explain that Jenkins is an open source ICD tool for doing all the DevOps phases, but also explain some

04:25.150 --> 04:27.220
of the superpowers of Jenkins.

04:27.250 --> 04:31.030
Now let's take a look at Jenkins and DevOps job market.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.510
Why should you learn?

04:32.530 --> 04:43.360
Jenkins The average salary, if you know Jenkins in USA is 97,000 per year and in India 6.1 lakh per

04:43.360 --> 04:43.780
year.

04:44.140 --> 04:47.910
Note that this is just to know Jenkins.

04:47.920 --> 04:54.520
If you understand Jenkins and then some of the cloud components, your salary goes up even more.

04:54.550 --> 05:01.610
The second reason Jenkins is so popular and why you should run Jenkins is most DevOps job requires.

05:01.630 --> 05:10.510
Jenkins So if I look at LinkedIn jobs, there are over 60,000 jobs in United States that requires Jenkins.

05:11.020 --> 05:17.460
Similarly, in India, there is around 17,000 jobs that require Jenkins.

05:17.470 --> 05:19.630
So if you made the decision to learn.

05:19.630 --> 05:22.480
Jenkins, you made the right choice.

05:22.510 --> 05:25.510
All right, folks, let's dive deeper into Jenkins.

05:25.540 --> 05:26.570
That's it for this one.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.630
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture.
