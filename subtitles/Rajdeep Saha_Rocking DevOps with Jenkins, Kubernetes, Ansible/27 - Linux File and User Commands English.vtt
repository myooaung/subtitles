00:00.120 --> 00:04.200
In this lecture, we're going to go over Linux file and user commands.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.280
Let's get started.

00:05.760 --> 00:10.770
So the first thing that will be used often will be creating a new file.

00:11.040 --> 00:16.680
So you run, touch, and then name of the file, and this will create a new blank file.

00:17.070 --> 00:21.120
So personally, the command I use a lot is code.

00:21.660 --> 00:28.140
So code is a tool that you can install in Visual Studio code and then you can run, as you could see,

00:28.140 --> 00:30.540
code space, name of the file.

00:30.540 --> 00:36.030
And it is going to create the new file as well as open this new file in your ID.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.940
So you can just type in code and then save.

00:39.240 --> 00:45.930
Now, let's say you don't want to use the code command so you can create the new file using touch,

00:45.930 --> 00:48.240
and then you can do that.

00:48.240 --> 00:54.380
And then the redirect symbol and then the name of the file in this case, new file txt.

00:54.570 --> 01:00.720
And then you can type in the lines, let's say adding some lines, second line and then you press control.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.770
DX To end the input and save the file and to display the file.

01:05.790 --> 01:09.180
You can run Cat and then just the name of the file.

01:09.180 --> 01:16.290
So note that for displaying the file there is no redirect symbol, just the cat command and then the

01:16.290 --> 01:21.810
name of the file and then it is going to display the two lines we have input in the previous step.

01:21.990 --> 01:29.280
So unfortunately you have to use VI editor in most cases because in most cases you want to copy, paste

01:29.280 --> 01:35.040
or do a little bit of advanced editing rather than just inputting line in the command line.

01:35.610 --> 01:40.860
So Fi editor is not fun and it's a totally different topic.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.140
So I'm going to cover via editor in a separate lecture.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.830
Now let's go over some of the user commands.

01:47.070 --> 01:52.140
And so when you are in Linux, you will be logged in as a user.

01:52.260 --> 01:54.750
So if you run a Who am I?

01:54.750 --> 01:57.180
It is going to show you the current user.

01:57.930 --> 02:04.890
So in the DevOps world, let's say you are logged in to ec2 and you probably have seen this by default.

02:04.890 --> 02:09.140
You are logged in as the username easy to dash user.

02:09.150 --> 02:17.700
So if you run, who am I from your C to box after usage n it is going to show you easy to dash user.

02:18.330 --> 02:25.050
So similarly, when you want to switch into AC two, you have to provide a switch and then the name

02:25.050 --> 02:29.940
of the user and then add the right IP address of your ESI to box.

02:30.120 --> 02:36.090
You can switch user using the as you command so as you stand for switch user.

02:36.720 --> 02:42.120
So let's say you want to switch user to reg and this user does not exist.

02:42.510 --> 02:47.520
So let's say you want to switch user to route to do a lot of administrative stuff.

02:47.850 --> 02:52.770
So you could do some space route and then you have to give the password.

02:53.070 --> 02:57.990
So if you are just a user of the system, you are not going to have the password.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.740
So it is going to fail as authentication failure.

03:02.010 --> 03:06.090
So how are you going to install a new softwares and packages?

03:06.540 --> 03:13.020
So for that you have to use sudo as in super user do.

03:13.590 --> 03:22.650
So what it is doing is it is not allowing you to switch the user to root, but it is allowing you to

03:22.650 --> 03:26.100
run install commands using super do.

03:26.130 --> 03:32.190
So in this case, let's say you want to install this lynx package, so you are going to run sudo and

03:32.190 --> 03:38.220
then depending on the operating system, either yum install lynx or pip install lynx and then it is

03:38.220 --> 03:43.380
going to install the package and then you will be reverted back to your current user.

03:43.500 --> 03:43.980
All right.

03:43.980 --> 03:50.370
Now that we are getting into a real world DevOps cases, let's take a look at how are you going to call

03:50.370 --> 03:53.430
API with Linux commands in the next lecture?
