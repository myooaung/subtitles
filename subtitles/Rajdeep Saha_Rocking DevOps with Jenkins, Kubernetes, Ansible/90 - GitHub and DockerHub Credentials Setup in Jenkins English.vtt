00:00.090 --> 00:01.200
To go forward.

00:01.200 --> 00:08.880
We need to connect to GitHub and Docker Hub from Jenkins, and we do that by using the credential saved

00:08.880 --> 00:09.770
in Jenkins.

00:09.780 --> 00:15.660
So I've covered this in the initial chapters, so please feel free to watch that lecture.

00:15.660 --> 00:17.880
How to Set Credential In Jenkins.

00:17.880 --> 00:23.280
But just for quick refresh, I have also included how to do that in this quick lecture.

00:23.310 --> 00:24.900
All right, let's get started.

00:25.680 --> 00:34.410
We are in the familiar Jenkins console to save the credentials, click manage Jenkins, manage credentials

00:34.910 --> 00:37.230
and the global click Jenkins.

00:37.230 --> 00:40.260
And then global credentials add credentials.

00:40.560 --> 00:47.190
This ID field is important because we are going to refer to this field from our Jenkins file.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.210
So I'm going to name this Docker hub.

00:51.210 --> 00:54.270
I'm going to add another credential for my GitHub.

00:55.110 --> 01:02.670
I'm going to name the ID GitHub in this case, not that the username here should be the user name of

01:02.670 --> 01:07.020
the GitHub, not the email ID that you use to log in with.

01:07.080 --> 01:13.790
So if you go to your GitHub repository and you should see a name for your account, in this case it's

01:13.800 --> 01:14.630
Aha Dash.

01:14.640 --> 01:21.870
Rajdeep So that's what I'm going to use, not the login email ID and the password is not your GitHub

01:21.870 --> 01:22.830
password.

01:22.830 --> 01:29.490
You need to generate a token and that's what you need to use in the Jenkins to generate GitHub personal

01:29.490 --> 01:30.210
token.

01:30.240 --> 01:38.340
You go to GitHub and under your profile click settings, scroll down, go to developer settings and

01:38.340 --> 01:41.790
then personal access token and then you can put a note.

01:44.730 --> 01:52.320
And then select repo webhook notification and that should be sufficient click generate token and this

01:52.320 --> 01:55.620
is the token you need to copy and paste it here.

01:58.020 --> 02:02.820
Now that the credentials are all set, let's go ahead and create the building demand job.
