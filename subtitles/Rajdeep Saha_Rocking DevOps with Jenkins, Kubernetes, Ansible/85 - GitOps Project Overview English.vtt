00:00.090 --> 00:01.470
What are we going to achieve?

00:01.470 --> 00:02.720
By end of this chapter?

00:02.730 --> 00:05.540
We have application running in Kubernetes.

00:05.550 --> 00:12.150
That application is saying Hello Docker, and the magic starts happening when you change the code and

00:12.150 --> 00:13.320
push it to GitHub.

00:13.350 --> 00:20.160
As soon as you commit the changes, a Jenkins job gets submitted automatically, builds a new image,

00:20.160 --> 00:25.440
pushes the new image to Docker Hub, changes the deployment file with the latest image ID.

00:25.470 --> 00:32.220
The new image automatically gets deployed to the Kubernetes cluster using GitHub apps, and our application

00:32.220 --> 00:33.990
starts pointing to the new pod.

00:33.990 --> 00:40.170
Topics we are going to cover in this chapter are Gitops what is it and why do we need it?

00:40.470 --> 00:46.740
Then we're going to go over the real world gitops workflow for the demo along with the difference with

00:46.740 --> 00:48.570
traditional DevOps workflow.

00:49.200 --> 00:56.670
Then we are going to go over the Docker file and Jenkins file for the demo Jenkins installation Jenkins

00:56.670 --> 00:58.200
Jobs set up.

00:58.560 --> 01:06.210
Then we are going to install our Gitops tool, which is Argo CD, Argo CD set up for the application,

01:06.330 --> 01:14.010
then automating GitHub to Jenkins using webhook and finally zero touch end to end, which is the state

01:14.010 --> 01:14.940
of Nirvana.

01:15.090 --> 01:18.000
A couple of things to keep in mind before we get started.

01:18.120 --> 01:25.650
I decided to add this GitHub chapter to the course because from my day to day work in the field with

01:25.650 --> 01:30.000
a lot of customers, I'm seeing that Gitops is getting very popular.

01:30.300 --> 01:37.050
I anticipate Gitops replacing part of traditional DevOps this year and next year.

01:37.050 --> 01:41.540
That's why I want you folks to get ahead of the curve by lining it up.

01:41.910 --> 01:49.440
Secondly, we are going to use Jenkins as part of this real world demo note that Jenkins is a separate

01:49.440 --> 01:55.980
code by itself, so we are not going to go over the basics and how Jenkins components work, but I'm

01:55.980 --> 01:59.280
going to go over how to install Jenkins and how to set up the jobs.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.090
All right.

02:00.090 --> 02:02.490
With those things in mind, let's get started.
