WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:01.520
All right.

00:01.530 --> 00:04.530
Time has come to install Jenkins.

00:04.560 --> 00:12.540
In this lecture, we're going to learn how you can install Jenkins on a W s specifically on Amazon EC2,

00:12.540 --> 00:16.740
and that's how almost all real world projects will run.

00:16.740 --> 00:19.500
Jenkins All right, let's get started.

00:20.160 --> 00:25.800
For all the demos throughout this course, I am actually going to use Jenkins running on a W.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.810
S a couple of important things.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.690
All the demos will be under free tier.

00:30.690 --> 00:33.390
You should install Jenkins on t two.

00:33.630 --> 00:40.200
Micro is a two instance type and T two dot micro is covered under free tier and you should not be charged

00:40.200 --> 00:41.280
any dollar amount.

00:41.280 --> 00:47.760
One of the real world demo that involves exe are elastic Kubernetes service where we deploy our application

00:47.760 --> 00:51.060
to a Kubernetes cluster will incur a charge.

00:51.060 --> 00:52.800
But that's not because of that.

00:52.800 --> 00:59.160
Jenkins EC is has a minimal cost of running and I'll call that out.

00:59.160 --> 01:06.420
So if you want to avoid any charge, you should just watch those X videos and not do it again.

01:06.420 --> 01:09.480
The charge will not be from running Jenkins.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.360
It will be for running Kubernetes on a w.

01:12.390 --> 01:12.790
S.

01:13.730 --> 01:20.330
And the next thing pretty obvious is you do require an account to install Jenkins and I guess you can

01:20.330 --> 01:24.530
open one for free today at Western Amazon.com.

01:24.950 --> 01:25.810
All right.

01:25.820 --> 01:32.080
So I'm going to use the official Jenkins on installation instructions in the documentation.

01:32.090 --> 01:38.870
It talks about creating a key pair and then later on it is going to use that key pair with a party to

01:38.870 --> 01:40.610
SFH into the instance.

01:41.090 --> 01:45.560
We are going to use the modern way of searching into ESI two.

01:45.590 --> 01:51.680
We don't need any keeper, we will use a SIM, so I'm going to skip this step entirely.

01:51.680 --> 01:57.590
I'm also going to skip this, create a security group part and I'm going to come directly to the launch

01:57.590 --> 02:03.020
and Amazon, ESI, to instance this one, I'm just going to follow whatever it said.

02:03.020 --> 02:09.140
So I'm in my console to create a new instance Click Launch Instances.

02:09.350 --> 02:15.930
I'm going to give the name Jenkins on ESI two and by default Amazon Linux 2 a.m..

02:15.980 --> 02:21.860
I will be selected and this is free tier eligible, so I'm going to keep that selected, keep everything

02:21.860 --> 02:26.960
as is instance type DT to micro which will again be free tier eligible.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.820
If I scroll down by default, it will allow SSL traffic from anywhere.

02:31.850 --> 02:36.680
That's fine for this demo under configure storage instead of eight.

02:36.680 --> 02:42.410
I'm just going to give 16 gigabyte and free tier customers can get up to 30 gigabyte.

02:42.410 --> 02:45.050
So we should also be under free tier.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.170
All right, click launch instance.

02:49.020 --> 02:55.440
Successfully initiated launch of instance, it's going to give you an ID, so click that link.

02:55.460 --> 03:00.690
It is going to take us to the AC two console and the instant state is pending.

03:00.690 --> 03:04.470
It's going to go through all the startup phases and it will come to running.

03:04.470 --> 03:08.430
So I'm going to pause the video and come back when our ESI two is up and running.

03:08.430 --> 03:13.680
And I have opened up the installation instruction along with our console side by side.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.900
So the instruction instruction is on the right.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.270
So we just launched the Amazon DC two instance, so I'm going to scroll down.

03:21.270 --> 03:22.590
So we did all that.

03:22.590 --> 03:27.690
So now we are going to switch into the instance and install Jenkins.

03:27.690 --> 03:29.520
We are not going to use putty.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.060
Putty is the old approach and quite painful.

03:33.390 --> 03:40.560
What we're going to do is select the AC two that we just provisioned and click this connect button in

03:40.560 --> 03:41.820
that console.

03:41.820 --> 03:48.180
It is going to take you to AC two instance, connect with the default username AC to dash user click

03:48.180 --> 03:48.870
connect.

03:50.010 --> 03:50.790
All right.

03:50.790 --> 03:54.240
So we are zoomed in to our instance.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.420
On the right, I'm going to scroll down.

03:58.020 --> 04:01.430
So first we need to run sudo yum update.

04:01.440 --> 04:08.520
So I want to copy that and paste it over here and then we're going to run this w git command to get

04:08.520 --> 04:10.230
the jenkins package.

04:11.200 --> 04:11.890
Okay then.

04:11.890 --> 04:14.590
Copy this command and run this.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.640
Then run sudo upgrade.

04:18.650 --> 04:21.020
So basically just copy paste the commands.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.280
Pretty straightforward.

04:22.630 --> 04:22.860
Press.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.590
Yes.

04:24.350 --> 04:24.890
All right.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.960
Now let's install Java.

04:29.340 --> 04:29.880
All right.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.440
Java is installed.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.530
Now let's install Jenkins.

04:34.950 --> 04:35.850
Copy this.

04:35.850 --> 04:36.750
Press this.

04:39.140 --> 04:41.540
All right, Jenkins installation is complete.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.160
Then we are going to enable the Jenkins service to start at the boot.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.580
In case you stop the AC two instance and start it again.

04:50.330 --> 04:52.320
All right, then start.

04:52.340 --> 04:54.170
Jenkins as a service.

04:56.610 --> 05:02.850
All right, Jenkins is started, and you can check the status of the Jenkins service by running this

05:02.850 --> 05:03.750
command.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.550
All right, so as you could see, the Jenkins service is active running.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.310
So now Jenkins is installed and running.

05:11.310 --> 05:17.970
So we're going to go back to our AC two console, select the AC two that we just provisioned, and then

05:17.970 --> 05:21.330
copy this public IP for address.

05:21.330 --> 05:28.320
So I'm going to click this icon to copy it, open up a new tab, paste the IP address.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.700
And this part is important.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.750
You have to put colon 8080.

05:34.590 --> 05:38.640
So press enter and this will fail not to panic.

05:38.820 --> 05:41.820
This is because we need to update our security group.

05:41.820 --> 05:45.690
So go back to the U.S. to go to security.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.870
Has the security group click this.

05:49.410 --> 05:49.860
All right.

05:49.860 --> 05:54.650
So in the security group, only thing that's allowed now is S-H.

05:54.780 --> 06:00.090
So we have to add a HTTP connection as well as custom TCP port 88.

06:00.450 --> 06:11.240
So click edit inbound rules and don't change anything that's there click add rule and here select http.

06:12.260 --> 06:19.580
And you can select cinder block as the internet as an 0.0.0.00.

06:19.940 --> 06:30.920
Click Add rule again and then select custom TCP and give the port as 80, 80 and the source give the

06:30.920 --> 06:31.820
whole internet.

06:32.150 --> 06:35.570
So in Real World Project, your administrator will set this up.

06:35.570 --> 06:41.510
Your administrator will limit this to the IP address range of your company network.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.610
But for this demo this is fine.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.440
Click Save Rules.

06:46.180 --> 06:46.660
All right.

06:46.660 --> 06:55.300
So now the security group has SSH access, regularized HTTP access as well as custom TCP port 88 access.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.710
So let's go back to our DC to copy the public IP address.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.350
Open another tab.

07:02.750 --> 07:03.650
88.

07:04.970 --> 07:06.260
Press Enter.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.640
There we go.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.850
Unlock Jenkins.

07:08.870 --> 07:14.150
So now we need to get the password from the AC to Jenkins installation.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.460
So I'm going to resize this again.

07:16.730 --> 07:17.690
So go under.

07:17.690 --> 07:19.170
Configure Jenkins.

07:19.190 --> 07:25.280
Scroll down, copy this command and then go back to EC2.

07:25.610 --> 07:29.000
And then if you have the system session open, that's fine.

07:29.090 --> 07:32.090
Else select the easy to click connect again.

07:32.630 --> 07:33.650
Click Connect.

07:34.470 --> 07:35.010
All right.

07:35.010 --> 07:37.110
Now passed the command.

07:37.140 --> 07:38.790
So this is the password.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.220
Copy this whole thing.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.970
Go back to the Jenkins.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.270
Give the administrator password.

07:44.280 --> 07:44.700
Click.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.690
Continue.

07:46.690 --> 07:47.620
Don't save this.

07:47.650 --> 07:48.370
All right.

07:48.370 --> 07:54.310
We get the customize Jenkins screen by default install suggested plug ins will be selected.

07:54.310 --> 07:57.250
So keep that as is and then click on that.

07:58.670 --> 07:59.060
All right.

07:59.060 --> 08:05.090
So now this is going to install some of the default plug in and open up the Jenkins console.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.290
All right.

08:06.290 --> 08:09.350
So now you need to create your first admin user.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.850
You can give you a name.

08:10.850 --> 08:19.040
So I'm just going to give my name, give any password, confirm the password as a given proper email

08:19.040 --> 08:24.950
address, because if you lose your password, you will need to use this email address to restore your

08:24.950 --> 08:25.670
password.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.770
All right, then click seven.

08:27.770 --> 08:28.880
Continue on the bottom.

08:28.880 --> 08:29.570
Right.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.640
This is the Jenkins URL.

08:31.640 --> 08:38.240
You don't need to keep this copy pasted the way I do it, I go back to the AC two console, select the

08:38.240 --> 08:40.520
AC two where my Jenkins is running.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.510
Copy this.

08:41.510 --> 08:44.810
And again, paste the IP colon.

08:44.810 --> 08:46.370
80, 80.

08:47.710 --> 08:54.340
You have to give this attached because the web server that's running Jenkins is running in the 88 port.

08:54.370 --> 08:57.910
If you skip that, it's not going to work anyway.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.080
Go back to setup.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.060
Click Save and Finish.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.140
That's it.

09:03.170 --> 09:06.290
Our Jenkins is up and running on easy to click.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.180
Start using Jenkins.

09:08.210 --> 09:12.890
All right, folks, join me in the next video where we go over the Jenkins console.
