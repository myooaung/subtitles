00:00.090 --> 00:03.660
Welcome, boys and girls, to a sample freestyle job demo.

00:03.750 --> 00:09.930
So let's say you have this repository called Lambda and it will work with any GitHub repository.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.520
You don't have to select this one.

00:11.820 --> 00:19.350
And what we want to do is get this repository inside our Jenkins and maybe you want to display content

00:19.350 --> 00:20.760
or certain files.

00:21.030 --> 00:25.620
So for this case, I want to display the content of the read me file.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.130
So let's go back to Jenkins and create a free style job.

00:29.190 --> 00:29.550
All right.

00:29.550 --> 00:32.090
To create a free style job, click new item.

00:32.100 --> 00:36.750
I'm going to name this sample freestyle job to select free style project click.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.410
Okay.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.000
So under source code management, select git.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.190
And if you don't have to do anything with Git, then of course you don't have to select this step and

00:47.190 --> 00:53.040
then go back to your repository, click code and get the https url.

00:54.130 --> 00:55.580
Go back to the Jenkins job.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.020
Put the repository while at this repository is public.

00:59.020 --> 01:01.420
So I don't need to put credentials.

01:01.420 --> 01:06.580
But if your repository is private, you do need to select appropriate credentials.

01:06.940 --> 01:07.210
Okay.

01:07.210 --> 01:13.810
I'm going to keep the brand specifiers as master because this is a older repository of me.

01:13.810 --> 01:17.350
So you could see the main branch is still named as master.

01:17.470 --> 01:25.570
And if I scroll down from this add build step, I'm going to select Execute Shell and I'm going to run

01:25.580 --> 01:29.740
Cat Command read me Dot MD.

01:29.740 --> 01:34.930
So basically this step is copying over the content of this repository.

01:35.050 --> 01:41.170
And then on the build step, I am executing the shell command which is playing the content of the read

01:41.170 --> 01:46.150
me file and we can put another execute shell just for fun.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.120
We could say echo.

01:48.430 --> 01:50.920
Hello from freestyle Jenkins job.

01:51.820 --> 01:57.510
I'm not going to select any post build actions, so post build action you can use to trigger other Jenkins

01:57.580 --> 01:58.090
jobs.

01:58.090 --> 02:03.730
But we are going to learn all about how to trigger upstream downstream jobs, how to pass parameters,

02:03.730 --> 02:05.620
all that stuff in a later lecture.

02:06.370 --> 02:10.180
All right, click Save and then click Build Now.

02:11.310 --> 02:12.480
It's already run.

02:12.990 --> 02:20.310
So click this click console output or so the git step brought in the repository and then I'm doing cat

02:20.310 --> 02:21.900
to read me --.

02:22.110 --> 02:27.240
And here it's displaying the rhythmic file and on the next step it's showing.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.430
Hello from Freestyle Jenkins job.

02:29.460 --> 02:34.100
Another thing to mention is the options that you see under this build.

02:34.110 --> 02:37.260
It will change based on what plugins you add.

02:37.620 --> 02:40.370
For example, I installed Ansible plugins.

02:40.380 --> 02:42.920
You will see something like invoke Ansible playbook.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.860
So as you add more plugins and more options will appear here.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.630
All right, folks, that's it for this one.

02:48.630 --> 02:51.150
I'll see you guys and gals in the next lecture by.
