WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:00.660
All right.

00:00.660 --> 00:05.190
Now that the setup is done, let's check out TerraForm with Jenkins in action.

00:05.370 --> 00:07.490
Let's start with a simple example.

00:07.500 --> 00:13.410
In this demo, we are going to learn how you can create a VPC as well as destroy.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.890
Try it everything using TerraForm in Jenkins.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.680
All right, so let's go over the artifacts first.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.900
Then we are going to create the Jenkins file.

00:22.260 --> 00:27.150
All the artifacts for this demo is inside this folder named TerraForm.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.440
So if we click that there are two dot TF or TerraForm file.

00:31.890 --> 00:32.860
Pretty straightforward.

00:32.880 --> 00:37.340
If I go to the new VPC that TF it is creating a new VPC.

00:37.350 --> 00:45.750
It's allocating a slash 16 CIDR range and then it is giving the name of the VPC as demo VPC terraform.

00:46.170 --> 00:52.470
If I go out, the provider type specifies the region where we want to create the VPC.

00:52.620 --> 00:56.160
So the region I'm selecting is US West two.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.020
You can change it as needed.

00:58.770 --> 01:03.570
The other file is Jenkins file, but I would show it directly inside the job.

01:03.870 --> 01:07.080
So let's go to Jenkins and check out the pipeline script.

01:07.320 --> 01:07.740
All right.

01:07.740 --> 01:08.780
This is the Jenkins job.

01:08.790 --> 01:10.800
This is the standard pipeline job.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.610
At this point.

01:11.610 --> 01:17.340
You folks already know how to create a pipeline job and nothing special, no options selected.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.190
So let's go over the pipeline script.

01:20.190 --> 01:26.190
And I have given the same pipeline script inside this GitHub repository for you to check out later.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.950
Anyway, let's go back to the Jenkins job.

01:29.040 --> 01:29.490
All right.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.650
The first step, we are cloning the TerraForm Repository.

01:32.670 --> 01:37.440
So inside the steps, always starting with a good, hearty hello world.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.780
And then I'm doing the checkout.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.000
So I use the pipeline script for that.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.970
So basically pipeline syntax and then from here, select checkout, give the repository URL if it is

01:50.970 --> 01:56.400
private, give the credential, change the branch name and then generate pipeline script.

01:56.520 --> 02:01.830
And it gave me this checkout checkout command, so I just pasted it here.

02:01.830 --> 02:05.040
Then the important part, TerraForm provision.

02:05.670 --> 02:08.580
So I am doing a shell script code block.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.820
So I am keyed into the folder TerraForm because everything is inside the TerraForm folder in the Git

02:14.820 --> 02:22.710
repository and then I'm running the standard TerraForm commands, I'm in it to initialize the TerraForm

02:22.710 --> 02:26.430
stack and then TerraForm plan and then TerraForm apply.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.290
We tell from apply.

02:28.290 --> 02:34.410
If you have run to from apply from a terminal, you know it it prompts you whether to proceed it and

02:34.410 --> 02:35.070
you have to type.

02:35.070 --> 02:35.730
Yes.

02:35.970 --> 02:41.850
So this dash dash auto approve means it is going to say yes and proceed.

02:43.280 --> 02:51.710
One thing to note is whenever you use this change directory or CD in shell script in Jenkins file that

02:51.710 --> 02:56.480
is only active during the duration of the current Shell script.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.650
BLOCK So which is kind of weird.

02:58.670 --> 03:05.090
So as soon as the Shell script block is done, executing the control is going to go out to the main

03:05.090 --> 03:05.960
directory.

03:06.260 --> 03:11.030
So that's why I have given this S-H p.w, our present working directory.

03:11.030 --> 03:17.600
And you will see as soon as the Shell script block is done, executing the P.W dx is going to show that

03:17.600 --> 03:19.370
the control went out of TerraForm.

03:19.910 --> 03:26.900
So if you want to do each of this line as a shell script command such as script CD TerraForm and then

03:26.900 --> 03:30.310
another shell script terraform init like this.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.610
I'm just going to show you.

03:31.910 --> 03:44.210
So let's say if you do this, see the terraform and then if you do see Sage TerraForm in it, it is

03:44.210 --> 03:50.750
not going to work because as soon as this line is done, it is going to go out and then terraform.

03:50.930 --> 03:54.830
It is going to give an error that I don't see any TerraForm file here.

03:55.910 --> 04:02.390
So anyway, we are going to see this as well with this WD and then we have this stage time to kill.

04:02.420 --> 04:09.530
So basically this is where Jenkins is going to ask you whether you want to proceed or not, and it is

04:09.530 --> 04:12.200
going to wait in this stage indefinitely.

04:12.800 --> 04:18.110
So I wanted to show you folks in a blue console that our VPC is created and then we're going to come

04:18.110 --> 04:19.640
back and click Proceed.

04:19.640 --> 04:25.040
And after we click Proceed, it is going to go to this search and destroy stage.

04:25.130 --> 04:30.870
And here also we have to seed, terraform and then semicolon terraform destroy.

04:30.890 --> 04:32.170
Does dash auto approve?

04:32.180 --> 04:34.700
So it is going to go and delete the VPC.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.800
So this is another way to do that.

04:36.800 --> 04:43.910
If you don't want to do a shell script block, you can run multiple Linux commands separated by semicolon.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.680
So this will also work.

04:46.850 --> 04:47.330
All right.

04:47.330 --> 04:51.370
So before I submit this, let's go to my VPC console in a lab.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.540
Lewis So you can see I am in US West.

04:53.900 --> 05:00.050
There is only one default VPC, so another PC should get created after some with this job.

05:00.680 --> 05:05.270
So let's save this and then click build now.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.850
All right, let's go to console output.

05:11.420 --> 05:11.810
All right.

05:11.810 --> 05:20.780
So it cloned the repository and then it did terraform in it, and then it detach from plan and then

05:20.780 --> 05:21.830
terraform apply.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.510
Does dash auto approve?

05:23.870 --> 05:30.200
Also note that remember the present working directory command for the previous shell script block.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.540
Everything was inside terraform folder.

05:32.630 --> 05:36.740
As soon as that block is done, it went out of the TerraForm folder.

05:36.740 --> 05:38.210
It went one level up.

05:38.330 --> 05:45.260
All right, so the VPC is created, so resources one added and now Jenkins job will wait.

05:45.830 --> 05:46.760
So let's go to A.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.520
S and refresh this page.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.540
Here we go.

05:50.540 --> 05:55.820
The new VPC is created Demo VPC, TerraForm and the VPC ID and everything.

05:56.210 --> 05:57.980
If we check the tags.

05:57.980 --> 05:58.670
Here you go.

05:58.670 --> 06:03.320
Purposes Jenkins TerraForm demo name is also demo of VPC TerraForm.

06:03.650 --> 06:05.600
All right, so our VPC is created.

06:05.600 --> 06:10.880
So now let's go back to the Jenkins job so you can click proceed here as well.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.560
And if you click abort, Jenkins job will end with the PC app.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.900
So I wanted to show you another way to do that.

06:17.900 --> 06:22.490
So if you click this dropdown arrow for this job.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.500
And then Harris paused for input.

06:25.530 --> 06:30.120
If you click that, it kind of shows you in a big, bold way.

06:30.150 --> 06:36.960
So I'm going to click Proceed and it is going to take you to the console output and then the VPC is

06:36.960 --> 06:38.160
destroyed.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.730
So if I go back to a WS console, refresh this.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.450
All right.

06:42.450 --> 06:45.180
The demo tab from APC is gone.

06:45.210 --> 06:51.210
All right, folks, this is how you create and destroy a VPC using TerraForm from Jenkins.

06:51.810 --> 06:58.110
So now that we understand how to run a simple terraform, we are going to go one step further and provision

06:58.110 --> 07:02.970
a exe or elastic Kubernetes service cluster using TerraForm.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.310
All right, folks, join me in the next lecture.
