00:00.150 --> 00:03.360
All right, so now write our Jenkins file the easy way.

00:03.480 --> 00:09.630
And again, for this one, we are going to copy a GitHub repository display file, display a list of

00:09.630 --> 00:12.810
S3 buckets, and we already took care of the permissions.

00:13.080 --> 00:19.740
So if you haven't watched the previous lecture on Jenkins permission to ensure how to attach policies

00:19.740 --> 00:23.460
to the agent, please check it out before trying this demo.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.370
All right, so let's jump into the Jenkins console.

00:26.370 --> 00:32.400
And for the repository, we're going to copy this Kubernetes code repository.

00:32.580 --> 00:37.370
This repository is a part of installing something in the Kubernetes cluster.

00:37.380 --> 00:37.950
Don't worry.

00:37.950 --> 00:43.650
We're going to have a separate chapter on deploying Docker and containers into Kubernetes.

00:44.490 --> 00:47.760
So what's in this repository is not super important.

00:47.760 --> 00:54.450
For now, we're going to copy over everything from this GitHub repository to our Jenkins Java environment,

00:54.450 --> 00:57.690
and then we just want to display this red file.

00:57.810 --> 00:58.230
All right.

00:58.230 --> 01:01.770
Going back to the Jenkins console, click new item.

01:02.550 --> 01:08.130
I'm just going to name it Jenkins file, Easy Way, click pipeline click.

01:08.130 --> 01:08.700
Okay.

01:10.050 --> 01:10.500
All right.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.960
So this is the pipeline script.

01:13.320 --> 01:18.540
So what you have to do is click the sample pipeline and click Helloworld.

01:19.290 --> 01:23.430
And now I click this pipeline syntax.

01:23.430 --> 01:29.970
So the first thing we want to do is copy the GitHub repository inside this pipeline syntax.

01:29.970 --> 01:34.620
It gives you all the things that you can do from the Jenkins file.

01:34.800 --> 01:41.700
For example, the Ansible, you can invoke Ansible playbook or you can build a job, you can check out,

01:42.030 --> 01:48.180
you can change current directory so you can do a bunch of stuff for GitHub repository.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.610
You need to do a checkout.

01:50.610 --> 01:56.400
So check out from version control and then you need to give the repository URL.

01:56.940 --> 02:05.400
So if I go back to my GitHub repository copy over the DPS link pasted here, this is a public repository,

02:05.400 --> 02:12.720
so we don't need any credentials and the brand specify it says Master, we are going to check what is

02:12.720 --> 02:13.740
the main branch.

02:13.770 --> 02:15.900
The main branch is named man.

02:16.500 --> 02:23.580
So we are going to change it here to main and then generate pipeline script.

02:23.670 --> 02:24.270
All right.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.730
So this is the Jenkins file syntax.

02:26.730 --> 02:35.010
So I'm going to copy this, go back to my job and inside this step, I'm just going to paste it.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.260
And then.

02:38.700 --> 02:48.120
I'm going to name this as copy repository and then we want to display the read me file so you can either

02:48.120 --> 02:51.360
do it in the same step or the next stage.

02:52.020 --> 02:55.800
So just for fun, I'm going to create another stage.

02:57.660 --> 03:00.480
So I'm just going to do this.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.590
And I'm going to name this display.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.440
Read me file.

03:09.540 --> 03:09.720
Okay.

03:09.930 --> 03:12.410
And then I'm going to click pipeline syntax again.

03:12.420 --> 03:18.030
So to display the file, we need to run a cat command, which is a Unix command, which is like a shell

03:18.030 --> 03:18.570
script.

03:18.570 --> 03:21.260
So we need to find S-H.

03:22.500 --> 03:28.920
So there are a lot of options and the more plugins you install, the more options you will see.

03:28.950 --> 03:30.630
Here you go, shell script.

03:30.870 --> 03:34.620
And the shell script is Cat and the name of the file.

03:34.620 --> 03:38.220
So read me dot MD without MD.

03:38.220 --> 03:40.100
All right, generate pipeline script.

03:40.110 --> 03:40.920
Here you go.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.970
You copy this.

03:42.000 --> 03:51.240
Go back to the Jenkins job and then delete this line and then just pass this.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.180
Okay.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.240
And the last step is we want to display the S3 buckets.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.970
So I'm going to create another stage.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.660
And that's also a weekly command.

04:06.690 --> 04:10.710
So we are going to run at least three L's.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.900
And then I'm going to rename this.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.630
To list as three buckets.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.220
Click, click, save.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.380
Then build now.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.800
All right, it's building.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.330
Okay.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.430
So now let's check out the output.

04:31.700 --> 04:39.890
Console output, you can see after it ran the checkout command, it's actually cloning the remote git

04:39.890 --> 04:42.290
repository so it cloned it.

04:42.530 --> 04:46.910
And on the next stage which is displayed, read my file.

04:46.940 --> 04:49.220
I'm doing Cat Red Dot md.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.750
So it's actually displaying the whole read me file.

04:52.760 --> 04:57.680
So at this point, the whole repository is copied over and this is very, very popular.

04:58.220 --> 05:04.100
When we go through the real world projects, it will see the first step will almost always be copying

05:04.100 --> 05:09.560
over the repository, using the checkout command, and then we can run any of these files.

05:10.400 --> 05:10.790
All right.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.470
So it does all that.

05:12.680 --> 05:17.510
And then we are running it up as three ls command all right.

05:17.510 --> 05:22.220
And it displayed all the SW three buckets in this region.

05:22.340 --> 05:23.200
All right, folks.

05:23.210 --> 05:27.120
So this is how you write the Jenkins file the easy way.

05:27.140 --> 05:31.430
And I'm going to use this a lot so you can see the other options as well.

05:31.730 --> 05:34.400
It has a lot of options, so it's super handy.

05:34.400 --> 05:39.920
You don't need to remember any of those commands to write the Jenkins file, and we're going to see

05:39.920 --> 05:42.530
this in action in future projects as well.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.230
All right, folks, hopefully this was helpful.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.180
I'll see you guys in Gulf in the next video.
