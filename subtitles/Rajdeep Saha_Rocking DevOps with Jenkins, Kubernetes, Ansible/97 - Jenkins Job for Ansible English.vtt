WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.140
Let's go over the Ansible yaml.

00:04.680 --> 00:12.180
So what this Ansible is doing is it's basically install Apache server by running Yum S3, DPD and then

00:12.180 --> 00:16.230
starting the Apache server and then it's deploying a static website.

00:16.230 --> 00:23.070
So basically copying index HTML from this GitHub repository to the destination.

00:23.280 --> 00:29.670
In var dub dub dub HTML on the ESI to the listed under web server.

00:30.360 --> 00:37.020
So if I go back up and then go to web server inventory and say here's the IP address of the web server

00:37.020 --> 00:40.890
and the Ansible user is equal to ESI to that user.

00:41.430 --> 00:43.350
So this is not a real IP yet.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.700
So I'm going to spin up AC two and whatever the IP address is, I'm going to put it here.

00:48.060 --> 00:54.630
But the important part is that this should match whatever we are using in the Ansible YAML.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.980
And it's going to copy over this index that is HTML to that easy to pretty straightforward it just says

01:01.980 --> 01:03.330
cloud DevOps rocks.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.570
Okay, so let's do one thing.

01:05.580 --> 01:09.660
Let's just create our EC2, which will act as the web server.

01:10.140 --> 01:16.080
So basically the Jenkins job should be able to ssh into this web server.

01:16.080 --> 01:23.100
Easy to run the simple playbook, install Apache, start Apache and copy over index to this HTML file.

01:23.100 --> 01:27.400
When we went over the high level flow we showed to web server executes.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.000
But from this demo we are just going to do with one web server, etc..

01:31.710 --> 01:40.140
So thing to remember is when you create the ACTU, you have to specify a key pair that can be used to

01:40.170 --> 01:41.610
SSH into the EC2.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.460
So the Jenkins job should have access to that.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.010
So we're going to go over that part as well.

01:47.070 --> 01:47.490
All right.

01:47.490 --> 01:49.920
Let's click launch instances.

01:50.490 --> 01:53.010
I'm going to select Amazon Linux to.

01:54.670 --> 01:56.710
I'm going to select T to micro.

01:57.310 --> 01:59.680
I'm going to keep everything as is.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.880
And then review and launch, click launch.

02:05.900 --> 02:14.570
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new key pair and I'm going to name it and symbol demo

02:14.570 --> 02:20.750
and I'm going to download the key pair and then I'm going to launch instances.

02:21.690 --> 02:23.070
Let's go back here.

02:23.650 --> 02:23.880
Okay.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.570
So it's pending.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.670
So it's going to take a minute or so.

02:27.000 --> 02:27.420
All right.

02:27.420 --> 02:30.630
Now let's go back to Jenkins and configure our job.

02:31.140 --> 02:32.670
Click new item.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.550
This will be a pipeline job.

02:39.820 --> 02:42.640
I'm going to name it Ansible demo click.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.360
Okay.

02:45.350 --> 02:52.760
So I'm going to put the pipeline script here to show you that, how you can write the Jenkins file for

02:52.760 --> 02:55.760
some of these complex plugins such as Ansible.

02:56.090 --> 02:58.060
So I'm going to select Helloworld.

02:58.070 --> 03:00.590
So it gives us a template to work with.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.060
So now I just create a two stage.

03:03.080 --> 03:09.860
One is the steam checkout where we copy over our GitHub repository, and the next step we run the Ansible.

03:10.310 --> 03:15.230
But I haven't filled up the steps yet because I wanted to show you this cool thing.

03:15.650 --> 03:21.200
So let's say you want to copy over gate or you want to run Ansible and you have to write the Jenkins

03:21.200 --> 03:22.340
file syntax.

03:22.460 --> 03:27.560
So Jenkins gave you this pipeline syntax which generates the syntax for you.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.440
So let's click pipeline syntax.

03:30.890 --> 03:33.680
So let's say you want to copy over this git.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.480
So select git and then give the repository URLs.

03:37.490 --> 03:44.240
If I go back to my Jenkins GitHub repository code strips copy over.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.640
And then go back here past it.

03:47.640 --> 03:52.980
And this repository is private, so we have to give our credentials.

03:52.980 --> 04:01.350
So I'm going to select my GitHub credentials and then change the branch from master to Main.

04:01.680 --> 04:01.950
Okay.

04:02.010 --> 04:03.720
Generate pipeline script.

04:04.050 --> 04:04.500
All right.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.580
So this is this is our Jenkins file script.

04:09.210 --> 04:13.500
So if we go back to the job and then we can just paste it here.

04:14.620 --> 04:14.890
Okay.

04:14.920 --> 04:23.410
Similarly for Ansible, also we click the pipeline syntax and then see then symbol is default selected

04:23.410 --> 04:27.070
because it's the first one invoke an Ansible playbook.

04:27.220 --> 04:30.100
So the Ansible tool is Ansible.

04:30.190 --> 04:35.590
So remember we set up the Ansible in the global configuration.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.320
Now the playbook file path in workspace.

04:38.320 --> 04:43.360
So workspace is the folder that's copied over from your git repository.

04:44.080 --> 04:50.860
So the playbook file path will be this install apache dot html.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.780
So there's a copy the name.

04:54.880 --> 05:00.340
Go back, install a patch or HTML, and this is the inventory file path.

05:00.580 --> 05:01.800
So go here.

05:01.810 --> 05:04.330
This is web server dot envy.

05:05.200 --> 05:13.500
So now under S-H, you have to give the search key that it can use to log in to our instance.

05:13.510 --> 05:18.550
So another thing we need to change is let's see the IP address.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.800
So the IP address is this.

05:20.800 --> 05:28.180
So I'm just going to copy this and then go to my GitHub repository and in the web server inventory,

05:29.290 --> 05:32.800
I'm just going to pass this IP address.

05:33.850 --> 05:34.290
Okay.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.890
Click comment changes.

05:37.530 --> 05:37.830
Okay.

05:37.860 --> 05:39.900
Going back to the sage connection.

05:39.900 --> 05:49.290
So here you have to add Jenkins and then select this kind option and then select sage username with

05:49.290 --> 05:50.430
private key.

05:51.000 --> 06:06.630
The ID you can give anything a sage key description you can give a sage key to access skype server username

06:06.630 --> 06:09.210
will be c to dash user.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.100
And then you can select this, then it's not going to show you the username, but that's okay.

06:14.100 --> 06:14.700
Easy to use.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.170
That is pretty common username.

06:16.440 --> 06:20.160
And then the private key click enter directly.

06:20.160 --> 06:25.920
And remember we saved this Ansible demo key that we use to spin up our too.

06:26.790 --> 06:29.730
So I'm going to show this in folder.

06:30.360 --> 06:35.760
So I'm actually going to open my Visual Studio open file.

06:37.450 --> 06:40.780
Download will demo open.

06:41.710 --> 06:43.540
So now copy this whole thing.

06:43.540 --> 06:49.390
Control A, control C and then go back to your Jenkins.

06:49.840 --> 06:54.520
Click Add and then past the whole content.

06:55.450 --> 06:56.710
All right, click add.

06:57.100 --> 07:01.300
Now, under here, we should be able to see the easy to user.

07:01.330 --> 07:04.420
All right, we don't need a vault credential.

07:04.780 --> 07:10.780
Keep everything as is, and then disable this host ssh key check.

07:10.810 --> 07:17.230
Else it will try to check every time and it might make your job fail certain times.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.230
All right, click generate pipeline script.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.360
So copy this.

07:22.810 --> 07:28.510
Go back to your Jenkins job and pass the status step.

07:29.140 --> 07:31.450
All right, let's click Save.

07:32.430 --> 07:36.520
So after we run the Jenkins job, it should install Apache in the first too.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.530
If I scroll right, you can see the key name is and symbol demo.

07:41.190 --> 07:45.570
And then we should be able to access indexed HTML.

07:46.110 --> 07:47.210
All right, let's try it out.

07:47.220 --> 07:48.900
Let's click build now.

07:49.620 --> 07:51.810
Click this console output.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.930
You could see it is installing Apache.

07:54.930 --> 08:01.740
So basically it was able to SFH into the AC two and do all that stuff.

08:02.100 --> 08:02.640
All right.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.560
It's finished successfully.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.720
I'm just going to name this.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.220
To make it a little bit more convenient save.

08:11.550 --> 08:18.030
And then I'm going to name our Jenkins EC2 as Jenkins, so it's easier to understand.

08:18.390 --> 08:24.900
So at this point, if we connect back to our web server, I just want to see if index dot is HTML is

08:24.900 --> 08:25.740
copied.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.750
And if we go to

08:30.690 --> 08:36.260
var w w w xhtml and then ls.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.790
So our index model is copied.

08:39.420 --> 08:41.670
If we run indexed or html.

08:41.790 --> 08:43.560
All right, so this is our file.

08:44.280 --> 08:53.850
So before we invoke this using the public IP address, we have to make sure that the security group

08:53.970 --> 08:58.940
accepts traffic in port a t security group.

08:58.950 --> 08:59.370
All right.

08:59.370 --> 09:03.450
So currently it only accepts in port 22, which is not good.

09:04.170 --> 09:10.500
So I'm going to open up the security group in a new window and then click edit inbound rules.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.020
Drool.

09:13.440 --> 09:13.890
Okay.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.910
I'm going to select HTTP, which is TCP 80.

09:18.860 --> 09:21.220
And for now I'm just going to add everything.

09:21.230 --> 09:28.100
I'm also going to add extra DPS just for fun, even though this will not be a strip collection.

09:28.700 --> 09:29.210
All right.

09:29.210 --> 09:30.770
Click Save Rules.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.740
Now go back to our AC two.

09:33.860 --> 09:34.340
All right.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.140
So the security group is all set.

09:36.170 --> 09:41.450
Now let's copy the public IP address, open a new tab, paste it.

09:42.050 --> 09:42.980
All right.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.440
It's showing our indexed HTML.

09:45.770 --> 09:51.110
All right, folks, this is how you can run an Ansible playbook from your Jenkins job.

09:51.110 --> 09:54.380
And whatever you want to do from your Ansible playbook.

09:54.620 --> 09:55.700
You can code it there.

09:55.700 --> 10:02.990
As long as the Jenkins job has the key to log in to the AC two and do the stuff that you are specifying

10:02.990 --> 10:04.190
in the Ansible playbook.

10:04.220 --> 10:05.960
It should be able to execute those.

10:06.140 --> 10:07.950
All right, folks, that's it for this one.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.650
I'll see you guys and girls in the next lecture.
