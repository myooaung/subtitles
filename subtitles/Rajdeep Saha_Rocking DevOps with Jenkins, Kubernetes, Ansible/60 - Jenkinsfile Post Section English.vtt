In this lecture, we're going to learn about the post section of Jenkins file.

00:05.250 --> 00:12.750
The Jenkins File Post section is used to run additional steps at the end of pipeline or stage.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.030
It is not a required field.

00:15.030 --> 00:17.940
Most of the jobs you will write, you won't have this section.

00:17.940 --> 00:20.430
So why do you need this post section?

00:20.760 --> 00:27.480
Let's say you run a job and one of the stage fails, and in case the job fails, you want to notify

00:27.480 --> 00:30.540
somebody or you want to do some additional stuff.

00:31.050 --> 00:37.350
You can do that using this post section and it supports different condition.

00:37.350 --> 00:42.660
You can run this when the job fails or you can run this all the ways.

00:42.840 --> 00:43.980
So we're going to go over it.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.420
How does this look like?

00:45.610 --> 00:53.730
A couple examples are, let's say in this case, the post section will run always whether the job passes

00:53.730 --> 00:54.720
or fails.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.420
And in this case it's just going to display.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.250
I will always say hello again.

01:00.510 --> 01:08.430
In this case, the post will run only when the job fails, and in this case it's just showing.

01:08.430 --> 01:09.420
Job failed.

01:09.420 --> 01:11.850
But you can also send email notification.

01:12.120 --> 01:19.500
Remember, the failure section is identical to the steps section as in you can run any command.

01:19.710 --> 01:25.380
So if you want to trigger a lambda and you want that lambda to go do something, it can do all that.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.330
This one is a little different.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.370
So in this case the agent is non.

01:29.370 --> 01:30.540
That's the first thing.

01:30.540 --> 01:34.320
So each stage needs to specify its own agent.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.730
But moreover, the post is at the stage level.

01:39.120 --> 01:48.000
So for the second stage test on Linux, we want to always run this J unit command which runs some target

01:48.000 --> 01:51.990
test cases and these are the Jenkins file post conditions.

01:51.990 --> 01:58.680
So always we saw the example failure, we saw the example, but beyond that, there are multiple other

01:58.680 --> 01:59.610
conditions.

01:59.610 --> 02:04.410
You can also have multiple conditions within the same post section.

02:04.680 --> 02:11.010
For example, your post section may look like this where you have different conditions such as changed,

02:11.010 --> 02:18.300
success, unstable, aborted, and depending on the outcome of the Jenkins job, one of this section

02:18.300 --> 02:19.200
might run.

02:19.290 --> 02:25.290
And just to keep in mind, the change means it will run only if the current pipeline has a different

02:25.290 --> 02:29.730
status from the previously completed pipeline success.

02:29.730 --> 02:30.840
You got it run.

02:30.840 --> 02:38.880
If the pipeline is success typically denoted in the web y with a blue or green indication, unstable

02:38.880 --> 02:44.970
means the current pipeline has an unstable status, usually caused by test failings, code violations,

02:44.970 --> 02:53.010
etc. typically denoted in the web UI with a yellow indication and finally aborted, which is due to

02:53.010 --> 02:59.850
the pipeline being manually aborted, typically denoted in the web UI with a gray indication.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.530
All right, enough theory.

03:01.530 --> 03:07.110
Let's jump into the Jenkins console and check out this post section in action.
