00:00.120 --> 00:00.510
All right.

00:00.510 --> 00:03.240
So at this point, we are the end of the first chapter.

00:03.240 --> 00:05.170
We learned what is DevOps?

00:05.190 --> 00:12.390
Benefits of DevOps challenges, different tools, DevOps workflows, DEP check, etc. Where do you go

00:12.390 --> 00:12.990
next?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.940
So here you have an option.

00:15.180 --> 00:22.350
If you are already familiar with the DevOps prerequisites such as Linux commands, Git and GitHub,

00:22.380 --> 00:29.580
cloud formation or TerraForm and Kubernetes basics, then you can skip the next four chapters and go

00:29.580 --> 00:31.740
directly to the Jenkins chapter.

00:31.740 --> 00:37.890
But if you are not aware of these prerequisites, you should check this chapter selectively.

00:38.010 --> 00:41.670
If you don't know Kubernetes basics, check the Kubernetes Basics chapter.

00:41.670 --> 00:47.280
If you are not sure about some of the Linux stuff, check out the Linux chapter, etc. because we are

00:47.280 --> 00:53.880
going to use this foundational knowledge when we go into the Jenkins chapter, both in theory as well

00:53.880 --> 00:55.320
as hands on demos.

00:55.830 --> 00:56.310
All right.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.500
With that being said, that's it for this one.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.230
I'll see you guys and girls in the next chapter by.
