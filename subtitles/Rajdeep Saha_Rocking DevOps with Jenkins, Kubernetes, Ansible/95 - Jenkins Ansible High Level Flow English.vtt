Welcome, guys and girls, to the section.

00:03.880 --> 00:08.650
In this section, we're going to learn how Jenkins can be used with Ansible.

00:08.980 --> 00:13.930
But before we get started with the hands on demo, it is very important to understand the high level

00:13.930 --> 00:14.380
flow.

00:14.410 --> 00:15.730
So let's get into it.

00:17.150 --> 00:23.960
So let's say we have an Amazon EC2 with Jenkins on it running and we have our GitHub repository.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.930
In this repository we have our Ansible artifacts.

00:27.950 --> 00:34.280
So Ansible playbook and this playbook is, let's say, installing aperture Apache server, starting

00:34.280 --> 00:35.060
the server.

00:35.360 --> 00:42.680
Also as part of this playbook, we are copying over our own index that is HTML to appropriate aperture

00:42.680 --> 00:43.340
folder.

00:43.340 --> 00:50.780
And the whole goal of Ansible is to automate this kind of manual installation and configuration jobs.

00:51.230 --> 00:56.600
So let's say we have two Amazon institutes running where we want to run this Ansible playbook.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.130
So how our Jenkins job is going to work is in the first step.

01:01.130 --> 01:07.280
It's going to connect to the GitHub repository and copy over everything from that repository.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.800
So basically all the Ansible artifacts.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.130
So this part we already know nothing different here.

01:13.130 --> 01:22.640
It just do a git checkout from a repository and then what it's going to do using Ansible Playbook plugin

01:22.640 --> 01:30.110
is it's going to run this Ansible playbook in both these Amazon easy tools and then it's going to install

01:30.110 --> 01:33.890
Apache star Apache and copy over indexed HTML.

01:33.890 --> 01:40.190
And at the end of the demo, we should be able to invoke the public IP address of this Amazon easy to

01:40.190 --> 01:44.360
use and it should give us our own custom indexed HTML.

01:44.960 --> 01:45.440
All right.

01:45.440 --> 01:50.750
Now that we understand the high level flow, let's get into the demo and understand how it works in

01:50.750 --> 01:51.350
action.

01:51.590 --> 01:52.370
All right, folks.

01:52.370 --> 01:53.570
So in the next video.
