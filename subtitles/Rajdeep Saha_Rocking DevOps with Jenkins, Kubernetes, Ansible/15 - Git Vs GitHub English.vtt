One thing to remember is git is not same as GitHub.

00:06.960 --> 00:15.150
Git is a version control system and GitHub is a git repository hosting services which is built using

00:15.150 --> 00:15.780
Git.

00:15.780 --> 00:21.690
But GitHub has other features such as GitHub action, which does DevOps.

00:21.720 --> 00:27.540
Git is installed locally on the system GitHub runs on the cloud.

00:27.540 --> 00:33.780
Git is created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, who also created Linux.

00:34.380 --> 00:37.170
GitHub is created in 2008.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.840
It is currently owned by Microsoft.

00:40.020 --> 00:48.540
Git is open source and used in multiple cloud repository services, for example, GitLab, Code, Commit,

00:48.540 --> 00:54.060
etc. GitHub is not open source, it has free and paid tiers.

00:54.060 --> 01:01.680
Going back to the previous diagram, the implementation of this remote repository is GitHub, GitLab,

01:02.430 --> 01:10.080
Commit, etc. For this course we are going to learn Git with GitHub because that's the most real world

01:10.080 --> 01:15.780
practical implementation and you will get questions on your interview on Git and GitHub.

01:15.810 --> 01:18.240
So what are some ways to use Git?

01:18.510 --> 01:22.080
You can use Git using command line interface or CLI.

01:22.110 --> 01:28.080
This is super important because in your interview you might be asked some particular popular commands.

01:28.470 --> 01:31.710
You can also use Git using GUI.

01:31.710 --> 01:38.340
We are going to go over a couple of those and also Git can be used directly from DevOps tools.

01:38.340 --> 01:45.420
Once you know the commands and how to use command line interface, you can basically use Git anywhere.

01:45.420 --> 01:49.620
Even within DevOps tools, you can run the commands that you're going to learn.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.050
For our course we will use command line interface using Visual Studio code.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.180
We will learn gooey tool called git graph for repository.

02:00.180 --> 02:08.130
We are going to learn GitHub and we will also learn how to integrate Git with DevOps tool such as Jenkins

02:08.130 --> 02:09.270
Oracle Generals.

02:09.270 --> 02:16.110
Now that we understand what is Git and why we need it, let's take a look at Git workflow and history.
