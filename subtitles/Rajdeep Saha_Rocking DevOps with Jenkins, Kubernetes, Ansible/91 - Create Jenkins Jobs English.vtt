00:03.060 --> 00:11.520
To create a new junkie's job, click new item, give the name, build image and then select pipeline.

00:12.090 --> 00:12.420
Click.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.110
Okay.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.600
Scroll down to Pipeline.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.490
And instead of giving the pipeline script hair, we want to grab it from GitHub.

00:20.490 --> 00:24.960
So select pipeline script from Sxm and then git under ACM.

00:25.230 --> 00:32.340
Go back to GitHub, Kubernetes code repository, click code, copy the STC URL and then paste it in

00:32.340 --> 00:33.660
the repository URL.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.020
My repository URL is public.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.970
I kept it public so that you guys can go and fork it.

00:39.090 --> 00:43.690
But if your repository is private, you need to give your GitHub credentials here.

00:43.710 --> 00:50.490
Now under branch specify to change this to Main so you have to adjust this accordingly.

00:50.490 --> 00:57.600
All the new GitHub repositories, the main branch is named as main, but if you are following some old

00:57.600 --> 01:01.200
repository, it might be named as master.

01:01.380 --> 01:05.460
And for now, we are going to manually submit this Jenkins job.

01:05.460 --> 01:08.400
So I am not setting up the GitHub trigger yet.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.660
So click save.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.210
Now let's set up the update.

01:12.210 --> 01:14.190
Manifest Jenkins job.

01:14.310 --> 01:19.620
Go back to dashboard new item, give the name update manifest.

01:19.650 --> 01:26.480
Note that this name should match whatever you use in the Jenkins file for the build container image

01:26.490 --> 01:28.680
job going back to Jenkins.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.730
This is also a pipeline job.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.060
Click okay then select.

01:34.060 --> 01:43.840
This project is parameterized and then add a string parameter and name of the parameter is Docker tag.

01:43.870 --> 01:49.840
The default value is latest, but we are going to override it from the previous job and then scroll

01:49.840 --> 01:50.500
down.

01:50.710 --> 01:51.730
Same thing here.

01:51.730 --> 01:54.700
We are going to grab the Jenkins file from the git.

01:55.630 --> 02:01.120
And in this case, you have to give the URL for the Kubernetes manifest repo.

02:01.510 --> 02:04.120
So go back to the Kubernetes manifest repo.

02:04.660 --> 02:06.820
Copy the https URL.

02:06.850 --> 02:10.240
Go back to Jenkins and then paste it here.

02:10.780 --> 02:11.920
Same thing here.

02:11.950 --> 02:14.980
Update the branch to main click Save.

02:15.490 --> 02:17.320
All right, so now let's try to run this.

02:17.350 --> 02:21.640
Go to the build image job and click Build now.

02:23.490 --> 02:23.910
All right.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.790
Now it's triggering the manifest of that job.

02:26.850 --> 02:29.100
So let's go to manifest that job.

02:29.130 --> 02:29.640
All right.

02:30.030 --> 02:32.910
You can see this job is automatically submitted.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.220
Now, I want to show the output from this.

02:35.230 --> 02:38.280
So click this and then console output.

02:38.340 --> 02:42.730
So not this deployment YAML before we changed it.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.960
So the container image here shows the tag latest.

02:46.260 --> 02:49.800
And then our said command ran.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.410
And then the container image changed to tag one.

02:54.710 --> 02:56.730
Now let's go back to Docker Hub.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.670
Remember, it was empty.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.530
Let's refresh the page.

03:02.870 --> 03:03.500
Here we go.

03:03.530 --> 03:06.620
Our very first container image is in the repository.

03:06.950 --> 03:10.130
Now we are going to go and set up the Argo CD.
