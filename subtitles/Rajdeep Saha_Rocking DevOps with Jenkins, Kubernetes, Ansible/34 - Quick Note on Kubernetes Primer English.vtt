Ingles Welcome to the Kubernetes Primer chapter.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.790
Just a quick note before we go through this chapter.

00:06.810 --> 00:14.040
So obviously Kubernetes is a huge area and it's not possible to cover it in this one chapter, but we

00:14.040 --> 00:18.090
are going to create content and push it to Container Registry deployed to Kubernetes.

00:18.210 --> 00:24.240
So I just wanted to go over the basics so that you folks at least have some sort of foundation before

00:24.240 --> 00:25.560
you go do other stuff.

00:25.590 --> 00:31.230
Also, all the following lectures that actually from the introductory chapter from my bestselling Kubernetes

00:31.230 --> 00:35.540
course, rocking Kubernetes with Amazon Chaos, Forget and DevOps.

00:35.550 --> 00:41.970
So like I said, Kubernetes is its own course by itself is it's huge, it's complex, but it's super

00:41.970 --> 00:42.930
popular right now.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.060
So check this course out if interested.

00:45.060 --> 00:49.500
But if you already know Kubernetes or you have some other courses, that's fine as well.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.100
All right.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.020
With that being said, let's get started.
