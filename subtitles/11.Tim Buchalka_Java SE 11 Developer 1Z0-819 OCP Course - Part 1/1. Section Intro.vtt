<v ->In this section of the course</v>
2

2

00:00:06.340  -->  00:00:09.920
we're focusing on operators and decision constructs.
3

3

00:00:09.920  -->  00:00:13.320
A Java programme is made up of expressions and statements.
4

4

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:15.380
Expressions are formed with operators
5

5

00:00:15.380  -->  00:00:17.990
and variables to manipulate data.
6

6

00:00:17.990  -->  00:00:20.880
Statements manipulate the flow of the programme.
7

7

00:00:20.880  -->  00:00:23.720
Operators are the glue that hold expressions together.
8

8

00:00:23.720  -->  00:00:26.600
An expression can have one, two or many operands
9

9

00:00:26.600  -->  00:00:30.280
joined by an operator to generate some change to the data.
10

10

00:00:30.280  -->  00:00:32.710
So specifically, in this section of the course,
11

11

00:00:32.710  -->  00:00:33.950
we're gonna be focusing as I mentioned
12

12

00:00:33.950  -->  00:00:36.150
on operators and decision constructs.
13

13

00:00:36.150  -->  00:00:37.317
So we'll look at Java operators,
14

14

00:00:37.317  -->  00:00:39.460
including the use of parenthesis
15

15

00:00:39.460  -->  00:00:41.820
to override operator precedence.
16

16

00:00:41.820  -->  00:00:43.410
We'll look at Java control statements,
17

17

00:00:43.410  -->  00:00:45.660
including if, else and switch.
18

18

00:00:45.660  -->  00:00:47.930
And then we'll start looking at creating and using
19

19

00:00:47.930  -->  00:00:50.463
do/while, while, for
20

20

00:00:50.463  -->  00:00:53.620
and for each loops, including nested loops,
21

21

00:00:53.620  -->  00:00:56.050
using break and continue statements.
22

22

00:00:56.050  -->  00:00:57.650
All right, so let's get started.
