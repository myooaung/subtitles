00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:07.899
So, which JDK 11 should
you download and use?

2

00:00:08.500  -->  00:00:10.470
Well, there are a solid
range of options available.

3

00:00:11.070  -->  00:00:14.180
Oracle have got a paid version
of JDK 11 that you can use,

4

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:17.959
they also have an open-source version you can
use for free, and there are other vendors

5

00:00:17.959  -->  00:00:20.600
who offer a JDK 11 for download.

6

00:00:20.960  -->  00:00:23.360
Now, I've got a video on YouTube
where I go into much more detail

7

00:00:23.360  -->  00:00:28.840
about this, but in summary, Amazon,
Red Hat, and AdoptOpenJDK are

8

00:00:28.840  -->  00:00:32.269
three other alternatives to Oracle,
but there are others as well.

9

00:00:33.830  -->  00:00:36.810
Now, in this and my other
Java courses, I'm using and

10

00:00:36.810  -->  00:00:40.810
recommend Amazon Coretto JDK
version 11 and you'll see me

11

00:00:40.810  -->  00:00:41.809
using that as I mentioned.

12

00:00:42.060  -->  00:00:45.570
It's easy to download, it doesn't
require any registration, and it's

13

00:00:45.599  -->  00:00:49.439
updated regularly and supported for
the long term, and all for free.

14

00:00:49.990  -->  00:00:52.530
But again, there's other options
and certainly, Iâ€™m not getting paid

15

00:00:52.580  -->  00:00:54.040
to recommend the Amazon solution.

16

00:00:54.340  -->  00:00:56.019
I just find it to be a good option.

17

00:00:56.520  -->  00:00:59.790
Feel free to use any JDK 11
build you wish from any vendor

18

00:01:00.340  -->  00:01:01.530
and you should be good to go.

19

00:01:02.090  -->  00:01:05.869
Now, speaking of JDK installation,
because I assume you've got some Java

20

00:01:05.870  -->  00:01:09.889
experience, I don't have installation
videos in this section of the course.

21

00:01:10.209  -->  00:01:13.030
But I do have some JDK
installation videos in the last

22

00:01:13.030  -->  00:01:15.730
section of this course, so check
those out if you need them.

23

00:01:16.050  -->  00:01:18.920
All right, next video, we'll
briefly talk about IDEs.

24

00:01:19.470  -->  00:01:20.640
See you in the next video.
