00:00:05.420  -->  00:00:07.330
So, this is not a mock test course.

2

00:00:07.900  -->  00:00:11.170
There will be some question samples
in the form of quizzes, but for the

3

00:00:11.170  -->  00:00:15.300
most part, I'll be demonstrating
code samples that might emulate a

4

00:00:15.300  -->  00:00:19.769
question on the exam and strategies
for reading the code, and what types

5

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:23.760
of things the certification exam might
be trying to test in that question.

6

00:00:24.660  -->  00:00:28.620
I'll be using code samples in an
iterative way, tweaking the code in

7

00:00:28.630  -->  00:00:33.730
various ways to point out how subtle
a single change and its effect can be.

8

00:00:34.469  -->  00:00:37.800
Actually writing and executing the
code yourself for each variation

9

00:00:38.099  -->  00:00:41.700
should help you to grasp and memorize
the nuances and recognize them

10

00:00:41.910  -->  00:00:43.879
in similar questions on the exam.

11

00:00:46.250  -->  00:00:48.959
I've also used slides
extensively in this course.

12

00:00:49.349  -->  00:00:52.230
All of these slides you see in the
videos are available to download.

13

00:00:52.699  -->  00:00:56.220
Watch the last video in this course
to find out how to download them.

14

00:00:56.590  -->  00:00:59.629
These slides are invaluable
for exam preparation so grab

15

00:00:59.630  -->  00:01:00.500
them while you remember.

16

00:01:01.360  -->  00:01:04.000
So, I'm assuming you know the
basics of Java, and therefore,

17

00:01:04.000  -->  00:01:07.259
we'll try to point out interesting
language constructs, as well as

18

00:01:07.289  -->  00:01:09.289
errors common and not common.

19

00:01:09.849  -->  00:01:14.270
Even if you've been coding in Java
for 15 or 20 years, there are features

20

00:01:14.530  -->  00:01:18.740
you may not use regularly, or features
you may have known once but forgotten

21

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:21.880
the details of, because you just
never use that feature in real life.

22

00:01:23.710  -->  00:01:28.229
Also, there are questions on the
exam which if you use a decent IDE,

23

00:01:28.539  -->  00:01:31.640
you may have simply forgotten or
would never code that way because

24

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:35.990
the IDE does some optimization for
you, but it is perfectly legitimate

25

00:01:36.300  -->  00:01:39.690
and the exam may have a question
on non-standard coding items.

26

00:01:40.130  -->  00:01:44.120
I'll also be pointing at features
introduced since the java 8 SDK, which

27

00:01:44.120  -->  00:01:47.540
if you're super busy, you may not have
had a chance to explore thoroughly.

28

00:01:49.500  -->  00:01:53.600
Right, so let's head over now to the
official oracle page for the 1Z0-819

29

00:01:53.600  -->  00:01:57.289
exam to check the topics you need
to know in order to pass the exam.

30

00:02:00.799  -->  00:02:03.049
There are links in the
resources section of this video.

31

00:02:03.049  -->  00:02:07.000
All right, so let's scroll down
there and under review exam topics,

32

00:02:08.560  -->  00:02:10.039
you can see a list of topics there.

33

00:02:10.060  -->  00:02:13.840
It’s quite an extensive list and
these are all topics you need to

34

00:02:13.840  -->  00:02:15.539
know in order to pass the exam.

35

00:02:16.330  -->  00:02:20.859
So note that all these topics are
covered in their entirety, in this and

36

00:02:20.860  -->  00:02:24.169
my other 10Z-819 course here on Udemy.

37

00:02:24.179  -->  00:02:28.960
Right, so I'm going to try
and make this course fun, as

38

00:02:28.960  -->  00:02:30.330
well as productive and useful.

39

00:02:30.600  -->  00:02:33.930
If you're like me, you may roll your
eyes at some of the exam questions

40

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:38.330
since the compiler and any of one of
the latest IDEs really makes so much

41

00:02:38.330  -->  00:02:41.630
of this work trivial - why do we have
to try and memorize it for an exam?

42

00:02:42.170  -->  00:02:45.090
Well, unfortunately, that's how
Oracle roll, so we do need to

43

00:02:45.090  -->  00:02:48.119
know how to do things without
the help of an IDE sometimes if

44

00:02:48.120  -->  00:02:49.420
you want to get Java certified.

45

00:02:51.760  -->  00:02:53.889
Still, with that said, there
are some interesting golden

46

00:02:53.900  -->  00:02:56.880
nuggets hidden in the exam
questions which may surprise you.

47

00:02:57.490  -->  00:03:00.109
So, I hope that I can point them out
and give even the most experienced

48

00:03:00.129  -->  00:03:03.160
developer and “oh interesting,
I did not know that” moment.

49

00:03:03.510  -->  00:03:07.310
In some ways, the exam questions are
like logic puzzles, and who doesn't

50

00:03:07.310  -->  00:03:09.030
among us love a good logic puzzle?

51

00:03:09.969  -->  00:03:12.799
So even when I review the basics,
try not to put on the ‘I know

52

00:03:12.799  -->  00:03:13.989
everything already’ blinders.

53

00:03:14.290  -->  00:03:15.360
I think you know what I mean.

54

00:03:16.370  -->  00:03:18.740
All right, so let's go through now
a few other things you need to know

55

00:03:19.070  -->  00:03:20.500
to get the most out of this course.

56

00:03:20.790  -->  00:03:21.970
See you in the next video.
