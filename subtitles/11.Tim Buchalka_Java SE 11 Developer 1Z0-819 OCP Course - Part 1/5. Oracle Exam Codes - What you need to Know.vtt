00:00:05.250  -->  00:00:07.950
All right, so let's talk
about the Oracle codes

2

00:00:08.470  -->  00:00:09.990
used for the various exams.

3

00:00:10.610  -->  00:00:13.600
So, yes, Oracle does use weird
coding or exam designations.

4

00:00:14.009  -->  00:00:17.470
They've got the 1Z0-808,
1Z0-815, 1Z0-816, and

5

00:00:17.699  -->  00:00:20.979
10Z-819 to name just a few.

6

00:00:21.500  -->  00:00:23.430
Now, I've got no idea who
came up with these codes, but

7

00:00:23.430  -->  00:00:24.540
here's what you need to know.

8

00:00:25.200  -->  00:00:30.810
Firstly, 10Z-819 is the designation
or code for the current Java 11 exam.

9

00:00:30.810  -->  00:00:34.000
And you can see that I've got a link
on screen now showing this page for

10

00:00:34.000  -->  00:00:37.350
the Java SE Developer 1Z0-819 exam.

11

00:00:38.030  -->  00:00:41.010
Now, if you've got no current
Java certification, you'll

12

00:00:41.010  -->  00:00:43.400
need to set the 1Z0-819 exam.

13

00:00:43.760  -->  00:00:45.699
Forget about all the
other codes in that case.

14

00:00:46.090  -->  00:00:48.179
Now, as you can see there,
scrolling down you can see that

15

00:00:48.179  -->  00:00:51.500
number of questions is 50 and
you've got 90 minutes to answer

16

00:00:51.500  -->  00:00:54.319
them, and the passing mark is 68%.

17

00:00:54.319  -->  00:00:56.769
So, you get 68% and
you are Java certified.

18

00:00:57.340  -->  00:01:00.870
You can see clearly that's talking
about Java 11 all across this page.

19

00:01:02.500  -->  00:01:06.060
Now, if you've got previous Java
certification, perhaps Java 6, 7,

20

00:01:06.060  -->  00:01:08.270
or 8, you can set an upgrade exam.

21

00:01:08.520  -->  00:01:09.889
I want to just quickly show you that.

22

00:01:09.910  -->  00:01:12.300
When I fill up a new page
or a new tab rather, I'll

23

00:01:12.300  -->  00:01:13.450
paste in another link here.

24

00:01:16.000  -->  00:01:19.889
You can see this is an upgrade exam,
if you're already an existing Oracle

25

00:01:19.890  -->  00:01:23.859
certified professional for Java
6, 7, or 8 and you want to upgrade

26

00:01:23.870  -->  00:01:25.909
to the Java SE 11 certification.

27

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:29.560
So as you can see, if we scroll down
a little bit there, the pass mark's

28

00:01:29.590  -->  00:01:34.680
only 61%, but there are 80 questions
and you get 180 minutes to pass them.

29

00:01:35.220  -->  00:01:37.780
Now, this might change because, at
face value, it doesn't make a lot

30

00:01:37.780  -->  00:01:39.320
of sense to sit this upgrade exam.

31

00:01:39.679  -->  00:01:42.769
The price seems to be the same
and there are more questions.

32

00:01:42.840  -->  00:01:44.929
Even though, you have got
longer to actually answer them.

33

00:01:45.370  -->  00:01:48.820
The bottom line though is if you
do decide to set the 1Z0-817 exam,

34

00:01:49.230  -->  00:01:52.990
you need to already be certified in
a previous version - 6 or higher.

35

00:01:54.290  -->  00:01:56.940
Now obviously, this page could
update, so it may well be changed

36

00:01:56.940  -->  00:02:00.770
by the time you get to watch this
video, but that's the current status.

37

00:02:02.950  -->  00:02:05.479
But whether you are previously
Java certified, or not, this

38

00:02:05.480  -->  00:02:08.529
course and its other companion
course will collectively give

39

00:02:08.530  -->  00:02:11.990
you all the information you need
to become Java 11 certified.

40

00:02:12.340  -->  00:02:15.930
All right, so moving on now, I want
to briefly discuss JDK vendors, and

41

00:02:15.930  -->  00:02:18.989
whether you need to use Oracle's
official version of the JDK, or not.

42

00:02:19.400  -->  00:02:21.160
More on that in the next video.
