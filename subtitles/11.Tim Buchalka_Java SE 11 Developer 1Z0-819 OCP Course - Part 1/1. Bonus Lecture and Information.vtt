<v ->Congratulations, on reaching</v>
2

2

00:00:01.510  -->  00:00:02.580
the end of this course.

3

00:00:02.580  -->  00:00:03.940 line:15% 
I'm Tim Buchalka, in case you didn't
4

4

00:00:03.940  -->  00:00:05.920 line:15% 
recognise the voice and the ugly mug.
5

5

00:00:05.920  -->  00:00:08.000 line:15% 
I recorded the videos in this course.
6

6

00:00:08.000  -->  00:00:09.420
So this quick video is designed
7

7

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:10.940
to get some valuable programming,
8

8

00:00:10.940  -->  00:00:13.820
free information, into your hands today.
9

9

00:00:13.820  -->  00:00:15.760
So firstly, here's access to a tonne
10

10

00:00:15.760  -->  00:00:16.900
of information, as I mentioned,
11

11

00:00:16.900  -->  00:00:18.707
including the slides to this
12

12

00:00:18.707  -->  00:00:21.113
"Oracle Java 11 Exam" course.
13

13

00:00:22.220  -->  00:00:23.180
You know when I was studying
14

14

00:00:23.180  -->  00:00:24.410
way back in the 1980s,
15

15

00:00:24.410  -->  00:00:26.420
which I know was a long time ago,
16

16

00:00:26.420  -->  00:00:27.730
it was hard to succeed
17

17

00:00:27.730  -->  00:00:29.090
as a programmer.
18

18

00:00:29.090  -->  00:00:30.320
There was no internet for starters.
19

19

00:00:30.320  -->  00:00:31.810
But also other than books,
20

20

00:00:31.810  -->  00:00:33.640
or universities, or colleges,
21

21

00:00:33.640  -->  00:00:34.670
there really was no way
22

22

00:00:34.670  -->  00:00:36.930
to basically talk to anyone,
23

23

00:00:36.930  -->  00:00:38.270
or get access to the information
24

24

00:00:38.270  -->  00:00:39.240
you needed to succeed.
25

25

00:00:39.240  -->  00:00:40.310
So you were largely on your own,
26

26

00:00:40.310  -->  00:00:41.270
in other words.
27

27

00:00:41.270  -->  00:00:42.560
So I wanted to change all that
28

28

00:00:42.560  -->  00:00:43.880
and give you all the tools
29

29

00:00:43.880  -->  00:00:45.900
and information you need to succeed.
30

30

00:00:45.900  -->  00:00:47.200
And as such, I'm trying to pass on
31

31

00:00:47.200  -->  00:00:48.660
my wisdom and experience,
32

32

00:00:48.660  -->  00:00:49.520
to make your goals
33

33

00:00:49.520  -->  00:00:50.540
of becoming a programmer,
34

34

00:00:50.540  -->  00:00:52.390
or getting a better programming job,
35

35

00:00:52.390  -->  00:00:54.560
make that goal a reality for you.
36

36

00:00:54.560  -->  00:00:55.650
So I'm gonna promise you here,
37

37

00:00:55.650  -->  00:00:57.140
here and now, that the information
38

38

00:00:57.140  -->  00:00:59.320
that I put together is really useful,
39

39

00:00:59.320  -->  00:01:00.153
to you as a developer.
40

40

00:01:00.153  -->  00:01:01.460
And it will make a difference.
41

41

00:01:01.460  -->  00:01:02.880
So let me explain the information
42

42

00:01:02.880  -->  00:01:04.880
I'm giving away to you free today.
43

43

00:01:04.880  -->  00:01:06.980
So firstly, I'm giving you free access
44

44

00:01:06.980  -->  00:01:09.080
to my "Learn to Code" course.
45

45

00:01:09.080  -->  00:01:10.050
And in this course,
46

46

00:01:10.050  -->  00:01:11.180
it's different to the courses
47

47

00:01:11.180  -->  00:01:13.290
that I've been producing on Udemy,
48

48

00:01:13.290  -->  00:01:14.730
because it's designed to help
49

49

00:01:14.730  -->  00:01:16.530
you understand how programming works,
50

50

00:01:16.530  -->  00:01:17.870
but how computers work,
51

51

00:01:17.870  -->  00:01:18.880
under the hood.
52

52

00:01:18.880  -->  00:01:19.790
So I'm talking right down
53

53

00:01:19.790  -->  00:01:20.960
to circuits and switches,
54

54

00:01:20.960  -->  00:01:22.400
how the hardware works.
55

55

00:01:22.400  -->  00:01:24.520
But also how computers talk
56

56

00:01:24.520  -->  00:01:25.353
in only one language,
57

57

00:01:25.353  -->  00:01:26.900
binary and machine code.
58

58

00:01:26.900  -->  00:01:27.850
Things of that nature,
59

59

00:01:27.850  -->  00:01:29.150
which you don't normally learn
60

60

00:01:29.150  -->  00:01:30.780
in a particular course.
61

61

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:32.460
All of this though, is designed
62

62

00:01:32.460  -->  00:01:34.280
to teach you information you need
63

63

00:01:34.280  -->  00:01:36.360
from a perspective of a programmer,
64

64

00:01:36.360  -->  00:01:37.450
so it's gonna help you, and make you,
65

65

00:01:37.450  -->  00:01:39.110
a better programmer long term.
66

66

00:01:39.110  -->  00:01:40.890
That's the sole aim in that course.
67

67

00:01:40.890  -->  00:01:42.830
So you'll get access to that free.
68

68

00:01:42.830  -->  00:01:43.760
Next, I'm gonna give
69

69

00:01:43.760  -->  00:01:44.630
you free access again,
70

70

00:01:44.630  -->  00:01:46.360
to my "Programmer's Guide"
71

71

00:01:46.360  -->  00:01:47.900
in eBook format.
72

72

00:01:47.900  -->  00:01:50.030
Now that also has over 100
73

73

00:01:50.030  -->  00:01:51.780
related videos, which you'll get...
74

74

00:01:53.301  -->  00:01:54.610
(laughs) If I can get it out.
75

75

00:01:54.610  -->  00:01:56.710
Access to as well, on all aspects
76

76

00:01:56.710  -->  00:01:58.460
of your programming career.
77

77

00:01:58.460  -->  00:01:59.910
So the eBook and videos
78

78

00:01:59.910  -->  00:02:01.880
collectively, answer pretty well
79

79

00:02:01.880  -->  00:02:03.170
all the important questions.
80

80

00:02:03.170  -->  00:02:04.630
Certainly, the majority
81

81

00:02:04.630  -->  00:02:06.010
of them relating
82

82

00:02:06.010  -->  00:02:09.030
to basically programming careers.
83

83

00:02:09.030  -->  00:02:10.180
Some of the example questions
84

84

00:02:10.180  -->  00:02:11.540
that it actually answers is,
85

85

00:02:11.540  -->  00:02:12.440
how long does it take
86

86

00:02:12.440  -->  00:02:13.890
to become a developer?
87

87

00:02:13.890  -->  00:02:14.960
Whether you need a degree
88

88

00:02:14.960  -->  00:02:16.580
to make it as a developer?
89

89

00:02:16.580  -->  00:02:17.560
What's the number one skill
90

90

00:02:17.560  -->  00:02:18.850
you need to have to succeed
91

91

00:02:18.850  -->  00:02:19.790
as a programmer?
92

92

00:02:19.790  -->  00:02:20.710
Now are you too old
93

93

00:02:20.710  -->  00:02:21.980
to become a developer?
94

94

00:02:21.980  -->  00:02:22.960
And one other one,
95

95

00:02:22.960  -->  00:02:24.500
do you need to be good at math
96

96

00:02:24.500  -->  00:02:25.860
to succeed as a programmer?
97

97

00:02:25.860  -->  00:02:27.040
But there's a tonne more.
98

98

00:02:27.040  -->  00:02:27.873
Over 100 as I mentioned.
99

99

00:02:27.873  -->  00:02:29.550
I think it's 106 videos,
100

100

00:02:29.550  -->  00:02:30.440
as of the date
101

101

00:02:30.440  -->  00:02:31.950
that I'm recording this video.
102

102

00:02:31.950  -->  00:02:32.880
And you'll get all of those,
103

103

00:02:32.880  -->  00:02:34.220
the answers to those questions.
104

104

00:02:34.220  -->  00:02:36.030
And look, I even take requests
105

105

00:02:36.030  -->  00:02:36.930
for future videos.
106

106

00:02:36.930  -->  00:02:38.400
So if you got a particular
107

107

00:02:38.400  -->  00:02:39.600
question, and it's not answered
108

108

00:02:39.600  -->  00:02:40.940
in the over 100 I've already answered,
109

109

00:02:40.940  -->  00:02:42.220
send me a message,
110

110

00:02:42.220  -->  00:02:43.180
and I'll actually do a video
111

111

00:02:43.180  -->  00:02:44.013
on that as well.
112

112

00:02:44.013  -->  00:02:45.770
So basically, anything you need to know
113

113

00:02:45.770  -->  00:02:47.120
about your programming career,
114

114

00:02:47.120  -->  00:02:48.730
is answered in the eBook,
115

115

00:02:48.730  -->  00:02:50.180
and also the related videos.
116

116

00:02:50.180  -->  00:02:51.700
What else, you still want more?
117

117

00:02:51.700  -->  00:02:53.010
Didn't I say this is all free anyway?
118

118

00:02:53.010  -->  00:02:53.843
I'm selling something
119

119

00:02:53.843  -->  00:02:55.220
that's for free, anyway.
120

120

00:02:55.220  -->  00:02:56.350
But seriously though,
121

121

00:02:56.350  -->  00:02:57.330
I'll also give you access
122

122

00:02:57.330  -->  00:03:00.720
to my "Programmer's Career Paths" eBook.
123

123

00:03:00.720  -->  00:03:01.553
Now this is something
124

124

00:03:01.553  -->  00:03:02.690
that is really important.
125

125

00:03:02.690  -->  00:03:05.020
Because it shows you the exact courses
126

126

00:03:05.020  -->  00:03:06.080
that you need to study
127

127

00:03:06.080  -->  00:03:08.660
to achieve your career goals.
128

128

00:03:08.660  -->  00:03:10.530
So in other words as an example,
129

129

00:03:10.530  -->  00:03:12.110
do you wanna be a web developer?
130

130

00:03:12.110  -->  00:03:12.943
I'll give you the low down
131

131

00:03:12.943  -->  00:03:13.970
on the specific courses
132

132

00:03:13.970  -->  00:03:16.210
you need to become a web developer.
133

133

00:03:16.210  -->  00:03:17.043
Do you wanna say,
134

134

00:03:17.043  -->  00:03:18.450
write cross-platform apps
135

135

00:03:18.450  -->  00:03:20.940
for mobile apps, for IOS and Android?
136

136

00:03:20.940  -->  00:03:22.030
Study these courses.
137

137

00:03:22.030  -->  00:03:22.863
Again, I'll go through
138

138

00:03:22.863  -->  00:03:23.880
those particular courses.
139

139

00:03:23.880  -->  00:03:24.713
Perhaps you wanna get
140

140

00:03:24.713  -->  00:03:26.460
into the Java enterprise space.
141

141

00:03:26.460  -->  00:03:27.293
Wanna do that?
142

142

00:03:27.293  -->  00:03:28.470
Study these courses.
143

143

00:03:28.470  -->  00:03:29.420
So on and so forth.
144

144

00:03:29.420  -->  00:03:30.740
So I'm putting the finishing touches
145

145

00:03:30.740  -->  00:03:31.990
now to that guide.
146

146

00:03:31.990  -->  00:03:32.980
And depending when
147

147

00:03:32.980  -->  00:03:33.900
you're watching this video,
148

148

00:03:33.900  -->  00:03:35.550
it may already be available.
149

149

00:03:35.550  -->  00:03:37.470
But if not, it won't be far away.
150

150

00:03:37.470  -->  00:03:39.240
Either case, you'll be getting access
151

151

00:03:39.240  -->  00:03:40.470
to that particular eBook
152

152

00:03:40.470  -->  00:03:41.900
for free, as well.
153

153

00:03:41.900  -->  00:03:42.733
All right lastly,
154

154

00:03:42.733  -->  00:03:43.566
cause I know this video
155

155

00:03:43.566  -->  00:03:44.399
is dragging on a bit.
156

156

00:03:44.399  -->  00:03:46.810
The Learn Programming Academy's channel,
157

157

00:03:46.810  -->  00:03:49.170
has 40 other courses here on Udemy.
158

158

00:03:49.170  -->  00:03:50.510
So I'm gonna give you the information,
159

159

00:03:50.510  -->  00:03:51.760
a bit of a summary on what each
160

160

00:03:51.760  -->  00:03:53.340
of those courses are all about.
161

161

00:03:53.340  -->  00:03:54.840
But also with a big discount link,
162

162

00:03:54.840  -->  00:03:55.870
to get them at the best
163

163

00:03:55.870  -->  00:03:57.550
price possible, as well.
164

164

00:03:57.550  -->  00:03:58.630
So what's the catch here?
165

165

00:03:58.630  -->  00:03:59.620
How much to pay? (laughs)
166

166

00:03:59.620  -->  00:04:00.453
Seriously though,
167

167

00:04:00.453  -->  00:04:01.560
I'm not really a salesman.
168

168

00:04:01.560  -->  00:04:04.270
No catch, it's 100% free.
169

169

00:04:04.270  -->  00:04:05.110
Now also remember,
170

170

00:04:05.110  -->  00:04:07.310
that you'll get access to the slides
171

171

00:04:07.310  -->  00:04:09.980
for this course, as well, totally free.
172

172

00:04:09.980  -->  00:04:10.813
All right, so how do
173

173

00:04:10.813  -->  00:04:12.330
you access this material?
174

174

00:04:12.330  -->  00:04:13.440
Well download the eBook
175

175

00:04:13.440  -->  00:04:14.870
that's right in this lecture,
176

176

00:04:14.870  -->  00:04:16.260
that you're watching right now.
177

177

00:04:16.260  -->  00:04:17.520
Just click on the resources
178

178

00:04:17.520  -->  00:04:18.850
that you can see onscreen now,
179

179

00:04:18.850  -->  00:04:20.180
on this particular lecture.
180

180

00:04:20.180  -->  00:04:22.230
And click on the bonus PDF,
181

181

00:04:22.230  -->  00:04:23.310
which you can see there.
182

182

00:04:23.310  -->  00:04:24.230
Open it up, and it's got
183

183

00:04:24.230  -->  00:04:25.530
everything that you need to access
184

184

00:04:25.530  -->  00:04:26.363
all the information,
185

185

00:04:26.363  -->  00:04:28.110
that I've talked about here today.
186

186

00:04:28.110  -->  00:04:29.070
So thanks for watching.
187

187

00:04:29.070  -->  00:04:30.190
And you may find you need
188

188

00:04:30.190  -->  00:04:32.160
to be logged onto a computer
189

189

00:04:32.160  -->  00:04:32.993
to get the eBook,
190

190

00:04:32.993  -->  00:04:33.940
because it may or may not
191

191

00:04:33.940  -->  00:04:36.290
show up if you're on a mobile device.
192

192

00:04:36.290  -->  00:04:37.710
So if you don't see it showing up
193

193

00:04:37.710  -->  00:04:38.750
when you're clicking on resources,
194

194

00:04:38.750  -->  00:04:40.680
or in fact resources doesn't show up,
195

195

00:04:40.680  -->  00:04:42.070
log into a computer,
196

196

00:04:42.070  -->  00:04:43.090
and you should have access to that.
197

197

00:04:43.090  -->  00:04:44.180
And just click it, as I said,
198

198

00:04:44.180  -->  00:04:45.013
open it up.
199

199

00:04:45.013  -->  00:04:46.560
And the information's in that PDF.
200

200

00:04:46.560  -->  00:04:47.780
But if you do get stuck,
201

201

00:04:47.780  -->  00:04:49.040
drop me a message on Udemy.
202

202

00:04:49.040  -->  00:04:50.120
And I'll get back to you,
203

203

00:04:50.120  -->  00:04:50.953
and make sure that you do
204

204

00:04:50.953  -->  00:04:52.560
actually get the access
205

205

00:04:52.560  -->  00:04:54.460
to that PDF today.
206

206

00:04:54.460  -->  00:04:55.293
All right so get to it.

Download the eBook right now,
208

208

00:04:57.640  -->  00:04:59.010
And thanks again for watching.
210

210

00:04:59.010  -->  00:04:59.880

211

211

00:04:59.880  -->  00:05:01.273
