Welcome to this course and thank you for investing in it.

2
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.570
My name is Tibaijuka and on the course instructor.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.140
So I'm assuming you're here because you want to get Java certified.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.260
And that's what this course is all about, Oracle, the owners of the Java language and the company

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.990
who create the exam that you will ultimately need to pass to become Java certified, like messing with

6
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.620
you in various ways, a set exam, and that exams because only very recently have they swapped back

7
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.960
to a single exam to become Java certified instead of the two exams you previously needed to pass.

8
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.970
That's a huge bonus for you.

9
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.260
Oracle often is tricky, rarely used syntax in their exam.

10
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.420
Questions to try and trip you up.

11
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.980
But don't worry, I've got your back.

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.900
He will be carrying over all that tricky stuff and the regular stuff you need to know in order to pass

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.520
the exam.

14
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.930
We'll be using Javor 11 in this course and not the just released job of 15 as of September 20 21, I'm

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.350
recording this if you don't know why Chapter 11 is being used.

16
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.740
I urge you to check out the Witcover 11 video of this section.

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.960
So as you can see by the name of this course, this is part one of my Java certification set of exam

18
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.360
courses for the zero eight one nine exam.

19
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.260
Why have I got to Java certification courses?

20
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.120
Well, technically, three if you include the now outdated Java.

21
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.280
Right.

22
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.330
Certification course.

23
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.900
Well, there's a reason for that.

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.420
Check out the courses to take to get Java certified video again in this section.

25
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.540
Now, what's the deal with all these wheat codes Oracle uses anyway?

26
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.180
I'm talking about the one zero eight one nine one zero eight one six one zero zero eight, et cetera.

27
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.950
Yes, I've got a video for that.

28
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.870
Check out to which Oracle exam.

29
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.970
I need to take video again in this section.

30
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.810
So I could go with help for all those videos I've just talked about or just watch them because they're

31
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.480
coming up in order, starting with an overview of what's in this course in the next video.
