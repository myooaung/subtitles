00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.830
So which courses do you need to enroll in to get Java certified as shown in this course title?

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.570
This is part one, so that implies there is a part to which there is an enemy.

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.610
And yes, you need that course also if you want to be completely covered for all the topics that will

4
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.050
come up in the exam.

5
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.330
Previously, you had to sit for two exams to get Java certified.

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.060
I had this course already released for the first exam and a work in progress for the second exam.

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.820
But Oracle decided to switch from the requirement of passing two exams to just a single one.

8
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.580
So that's great for you because the new exam is the same length as each of the two previous exams.

9
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.130
It's going to be easier for you to pass because there will be fewer questions per topic as they have

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.080
to cram the equivalent of two courses into this new single exam.

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.020
The actual material or topics covid haven't changed other than a few things being removed, so I decided

12
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.450
to fix what needed to be fixed up in this course, part one, and then finish off and release part two.

13
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.060
So, yes, you need to enroll in both of my courses, this one, part one, and also part two.

14
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.780
Collectively, they cover 100 percent of the material that can come up in the new exam.

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.330
So think of this course, part one as the Essentials collection and part two is the more advanced stuff.

16
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.250
Note that part to my other course contains little to no content from this course.

17
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.160
Part one, they are completely different courses.

18
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.250
I'd recommend you start with this course, part one for obvious reasons, then complete part two, at

19
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.170
which time you are then ready to sit the exam.

20
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.300
The only other thing I want to mention is that these courses are designed to assist you in passing the

21
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.850
exam.

22
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.770
They're not actually designed to teach you Java, though.

23
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.780
Yes, you'll learn a lot of new stuff, particularly with syntax and stuff that you use rarely or ever.

24
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.770
But as you have previously never used Java, you'll most likely struggle in both of these courses.

25
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.200
Fear not, though, because if you're in this scenario, I've got an 80 hour Java master class also

26
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.290
on Udemy, where you can learn Java from scratch so that if you need it for a good portion of that course

27
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.470
and you'll be ready for these two Java certification courses.

28
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.390
But if you have some exposure to Java and you focused on getting Java certified, you could go.

29
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.780
So let's move on to the next video where I want to explain briefly these ridiculous code acronyms or

30
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.570
whatever you want to call them, that Oracle used for their exams.

31
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.340
And what specifically you need to know.

32
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.870
See you in the next video.
