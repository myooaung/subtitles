00:00:00.200  -->  00:00:01.820
<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.820  -->  00:00:04.410
In this video we're going to take our Hello World app
3

3

00:00:04.410  -->  00:00:06.740
a little further and we're also going to add
4

4

00:00:06.740  -->  00:00:08.570
entry input fields.
5

5

00:00:08.570  -->  00:00:10.840
Input fields will allow us to retrieve data
6

6

00:00:10.840  -->  00:00:13.270
from users, let them input some stuff
7

7

00:00:13.270  -->  00:00:16.920
that we can then use within our functions.
8

8

00:00:16.920  -->  00:00:18.120
Let's get started.
9

9

00:00:18.120  -->  00:00:20.930
First of all we're going to create our label
10

10

00:00:20.930  -->  00:00:22.760
and our input field.
11

11

00:00:22.760  -->  00:00:26.910
So we will say name label is ttk.label
12

12

00:00:26.910  -->  00:00:30.491
and we will pass in the root and some text.
13

13

00:00:30.491  -->  00:00:33.410
We will also then pack it into the container.
14

14

00:00:33.410  -->  00:00:35.410
We will say side equal left
15

15

00:00:35.410  -->  00:00:39.060
and we're gonna say pad X equal zero, 10.
16

16

00:00:39.060  -->  00:00:41.890
What that does is it adds a little bit of spacing
17

17

00:00:41.890  -->  00:00:44.700
on the right side of the label.
18

18

00:00:44.700  -->  00:00:46.640
This one being the left side of the label,
19

19

00:00:46.640  -->  00:00:48.350
and this one being the right side.
20

20

00:00:48.350  -->  00:00:51.060
So you can imagine that it is adding 10 pixels
21

21

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:53.380
to the right of the label, so that when we add
22

22

00:00:53.380  -->  00:00:56.423
another item beside it, it will be slightly separated.
23

23

00:00:58.030  -->  00:01:00.150
Which it is going to be the name entry.
24

24

00:01:00.150  -->  00:01:02.270
That is the item that we're going to add beside it
25

25

00:01:02.270  -->  00:01:05.150
and that is ttk.entry.
26

26

00:01:05.150  -->  00:01:06.990
We're also going to put in the root.
27

27

00:01:06.990  -->  00:01:09.120
We're gonna define the width
28

28

00:01:09.120  -->  00:01:12.310
and we're also gonna say where the contents
29

29

00:01:12.310  -->  00:01:14.720
of this field should go.
30

30

00:01:14.720  -->  00:01:17.360
So whenever we type anything into this field,
31

31

00:01:17.360  -->  00:01:21.120
we want to be able to then use what's typed inside the field
32

32

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:22.330
at any point.
33

33

00:01:22.330  -->  00:01:24.960
To do that we will say text variable
34

34

00:01:24.960  -->  00:01:27.270
and we're gonna say user name.
35

35

00:01:27.270  -->  00:01:31.060
Now of course, we do have to define the user name variable
36

36

00:01:31.060  -->  00:01:32.906
which we don't have yet.
37

37

00:01:32.906  -->  00:01:35.840
Here is where tkinter enter differs
38

38

00:01:35.840  -->  00:01:38.550
from traditional types of code.
39

39

00:01:38.550  -->  00:01:42.398
In order to be able to get the contents of this entry field,
40

40

00:01:42.398  -->  00:01:47.398
we have to define a place in Python were this field
41

41

00:01:47.870  -->  00:01:49.250
can write to.
42

42

00:01:49.250  -->  00:01:53.717
And that is going to be called the tk.StringVar.
43

43

00:01:55.215  -->  00:01:59.480
A StringVar is just an object that is used to track
44

44

00:01:59.480  -->  00:02:02.570
the contents of these entry widgets.
45

45

00:02:02.570  -->  00:02:04.660
Essentially it contains a string,
46

46

00:02:04.660  -->  00:02:07.920
and that string will always be whatever is currently typed
47

47

00:02:07.920  -->  00:02:09.920
in this entry.
48

48

00:02:09.920  -->  00:02:13.840
Next up, we're also going to pack it buy saying
49

49

00:02:13.840  -->  00:02:16.040
side equals left,
50

50

00:02:16.040  -->  00:02:19.460
and we're gonna say name entry.focus.
51

51

00:02:19.460  -->  00:02:23.030
Focus is what you call on a particular component
52

52

00:02:23.030  -->  00:02:26.423
in tkinter, so that it appears focused on the window.
53

53

00:02:27.290  -->  00:02:30.690
Press play here and I'll show you what I mean by that.
54

54

00:02:30.690  -->  00:02:34.040
You can see now that the field has focus.
55

55

00:02:34.040  -->  00:02:36.114
It has a blue line around it, and you can immediately
56

56

00:02:36.114  -->  00:02:37.563
type on it.
57

57

00:02:39.110  -->  00:02:42.030
Now if we were able to somehow inspect the contents
58

58

00:02:42.030  -->  00:02:45.260
of the user name variable, you would see
59

59

00:02:45.260  -->  00:02:49.810
that it contains the string Jose amongst other things.
60

60

00:02:49.810  -->  00:02:53.923
Let's close this for now, and I will create a greet button.
61

61

00:03:03.160  -->  00:03:05.940
We have created now our button as well,
62

62

00:03:05.940  -->  00:03:08.190
and that is just as we had before,
63

63

00:03:08.190  -->  00:03:10.150
something in the root, with the text greet,
64

64

00:03:10.150  -->  00:03:12.190
and the command is this greet function up here
65

65

00:03:12.190  -->  00:03:13.390
that is currently empty.
66

66

00:03:14.440  -->  00:03:16.000
So to fill in this function,
67

67

00:03:16.000  -->  00:03:17.503
we're gonna say print.
68

68

00:03:19.620  -->  00:03:23.280
And in here we're gonna say hello, user name,
69

69

00:03:23.280  -->  00:03:27.870
which is this variable here, dot get.
70

70

00:03:27.870  -->  00:03:30.550
Dot get is a method that we call on
71

71

00:03:30.550  -->  00:03:34.200
these StringVar objects to retrieve the contents
72

72

00:03:34.200  -->  00:03:36.893
or the string contents of the variable.
73

73

00:03:40.400  -->  00:03:42.113
So let's run this.
74

74

00:03:43.900  -->  00:03:46.970
Now because all our components have been packed on the left,
75

75

00:03:46.970  -->  00:03:49.730
they all appear side by side.
76

76

00:03:49.730  -->  00:03:51.990
This is how side equal left works
77

77

00:03:51.990  -->  00:03:53.930
and we're gonna learn more about packing
78

78

00:03:53.930  -->  00:03:55.230
in the next video.
79

79

00:03:55.230  -->  00:03:58.880
So I'll type Jose here and then type and click greet
80

80

00:03:58.880  -->  00:04:01.713
and you can see that Hello, Jose is printed out.
81

81

00:04:03.160  -->  00:04:05.679
Now in order to make a little bit more of this,
82

82

00:04:05.679  -->  00:04:08.010
instead of user name.get,
83

83

00:04:08.010  -->  00:04:11.870
we can type user name.get or world.
84

84

00:04:11.870  -->  00:04:14.090
And what that'll do is if user name.get
85

85

00:04:14.090  -->  00:04:16.710
does not return a value or rather it returns
86

86

00:04:16.710  -->  00:04:20.590
an empty string, we're gonna type Hello, World instead.
87

87

00:04:20.590  -->  00:04:22.733
So you can see that Hello, World gets printed out
88

88

00:04:22.733  -->  00:04:24.263
at the bottom left.
89

89

00:04:25.780  -->  00:04:28.050
So we've learned a couple more things in this video.
90

90

00:04:28.050  -->  00:04:30.230
We have learned how to create labels
91

91

00:04:30.230  -->  00:04:34.970
or just static texts, as well as input fields, or entries
92

92

00:04:34.970  -->  00:04:37.450
in our tkinter applications.
93

93

00:04:37.450  -->  00:04:39.530
And we've also learned how to store the contents
94

94

00:04:39.530  -->  00:04:42.160
of those, inside our own variables.
95

95

00:04:42.160  -->  00:04:45.490
And finally we have learned about pad X and also
96

96

00:04:45.490  -->  00:04:48.060
it's counterpart which exists, pad Y,
97

97

00:04:48.060  -->  00:04:51.800
to add extra spacing around any component.
98

98

00:04:51.800  -->  00:04:54.050
I'll say at this point that pad X can be used
99

99

00:04:54.050  -->  00:04:56.160
on any component whenever you use pack.
100

100

00:04:56.160  -->  00:04:58.150
So you can put it here, or here,
101

101

00:04:58.150  -->  00:05:01.068
and that would also add spacing around these components
102

102

00:05:01.068  -->  00:05:02.760
if you want.
103

103

00:05:02.760  -->  00:05:06.320
In pad X, the zero is the left, and the 10 is the right.
104

104

00:05:06.320  -->  00:05:09.080
And in pad Y, the first one is the top
105

105

00:05:09.080  -->  00:05:11.233
and the second one is the bottom.
106

106

00:05:12.390  -->  00:05:13.880
So thank you for joining me in this video.
107

107

00:05:13.880  -->  00:05:14.980
Hope you've learned something.
108

108

00:05:14.980  -->  00:05:17.407
And in the next video, we're going to look at pack.
109

109

00:05:17.407  -->  00:05:18.333
See you there.
