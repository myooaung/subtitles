<v Narrator>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,600  -->  00:00:03,730
This is a small, side video.
3

3

00:00:03,730  -->  00:00:04,563
What I just wanted to tell you
4

4

00:00:04,563  -->  00:00:08,040
about this dark theme I've got.
5

5

00:00:08,040  -->  00:00:11,580
I like developing on a dark theme, but a lot of people don't
6

6

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:13,020
and I actually just realised this as I was
7

7

00:00:13,020  -->  00:00:16,580
recording the video, that I'm working on this dark theme
8

8

00:00:16,580  -->  00:00:19,760
and it's probably not the best thing to do for recording.
9

9

00:00:19,760  -->  00:00:22,500
I don't want to you suffer through my developing
10

10

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:23,900
in a dark theme if you don't like it
11

11

00:00:23,900  -->  00:00:27,340
and for recording we're going to swap over to a white theme.
12

12

00:00:27,340  -->  00:00:29,320
Also, sorry if you do like the dark theme 'cause we are
13

13

00:00:29,320  -->  00:00:30,900
going to be using a white theme.
14

14

00:00:30,900  -->  00:00:34,340
But, nonetheless, I wanted to show you that you can change
15

15

00:00:34,340  -->  00:00:38,410
from white to dark if you prefer it, so all you have to do
16

16

00:00:38,410  -->  00:00:40,820
is go over to your Preferences
17

17

00:00:43,240  -->  00:00:47,200
and in here in Appearance, you can choose your theme.
18

18

00:00:47,200  -->  00:00:49,500
So you can go to Default
19

19

00:00:49,500  -->  00:00:51,680
and that will be the white theme.
20

20

00:00:51,680  -->  00:00:53,570
So that's what we're gonna be using throughout the course.
21

21

00:00:53,570  -->  00:00:56,170
My apologies that the last video was in dark theme,
22

22

00:00:56,170  -->  00:00:59,590
we're going to stick to this theme, okay.
23

23

00:01:00,670  -->  00:01:03,830
This gives you this white theme.
24

24

00:01:03,830  -->  00:01:06,550
Now, by going back to the Preferences
25

25

00:01:06,550  -->  00:01:10,020
you can also change your editor,
26

26

00:01:11,330  -->  00:01:14,360
and in your editor, you've got your fonts
27

27

00:01:16,020  -->  00:01:18,650
and you've got a bunch of other things here
28

28

00:01:18,650  -->  00:01:20,900
like your colour schemes and things like that.
29

29

00:01:21,870  -->  00:01:23,090
For the
30

30

00:01:25,848  -->  00:01:27,710
I'm sorry I don't know why this is here.
31

31

00:01:29,740  -->  00:01:32,750
For the recording, I'm going to go over
32

32

00:01:32,750  -->  00:01:36,040
to my colour scheme font and I'm going to choose
33

33

00:01:36,040  -->  00:01:38,940
a different scheme, there is quite a few and that gives you
34

34

00:01:38,940  -->  00:01:42,590
like different colours of your fonts, like for example
35

35

00:01:42,590  -->  00:01:45,920
Twilight will give you a font that looks like this.
36

36

00:01:45,920  -->  00:01:48,360
Darkula will give you a font that looks like this.
37

37

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:50,410
And I'm going to go with my recording scheme
38

38

00:01:50,410  -->  00:01:53,180
which is one I created that has a nice readable font
39

39

00:01:53,180  -->  00:01:56,520
and it's quite large so you guys can see it in the video.
40

40

00:01:56,520  -->  00:02:00,650
So that's how you can change the font,
41

41

00:02:00,650  -->  00:02:03,650
the colours and the theme in PyCharm,
42

42

00:02:03,650  -->  00:02:05,610
just in case you want to do that before you
43

43

00:02:05,610  -->  00:02:07,930
start developing, and there is quite a lot
44

44

00:02:07,930  -->  00:02:10,410
of fonts that you can use for developing.
45

45

00:02:10,410  -->  00:02:13,700
Normally I recommend monospaced fonts, that's fonts where
46

46

00:02:13,700  -->  00:02:16,390
all the letters have the same spacing around them.
47

47

00:02:16,390  -->  00:02:18,160
All the letters are the same size,
48

48

00:02:18,160  -->  00:02:20,870
that just makes things a bit easier when you're programming.
49

49

00:02:20,870  -->  00:02:22,900
And if you're interested in knowing some of the fonts
50

50

00:02:22,900  -->  00:02:26,130
that I like for programming, just feel free to ask
51

51

00:02:26,130  -->  00:02:28,950
and I'll be happy to tell you.
52

52

00:02:28,950  -->  00:02:30,910
Anyway, that's it for this video.
53

53

00:02:30,910  -->  00:02:35,320
Just a small side video to tell you about these themes
54

54

00:02:35,320  -->  00:02:38,760
before I make you suffer with my dark theme.
55

55

00:02:38,760  -->  00:02:40,730
Now, we can move on to the next video and we're going
56

56

00:02:40,730  -->  00:02:42,940
to start developing this milestone project.
