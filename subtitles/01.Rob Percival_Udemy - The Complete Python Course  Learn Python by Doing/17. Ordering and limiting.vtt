<v Instructor>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.380  -->  00:00:05.130
In this video we're talking about ordering and limiting.
3

3

00:00:05.130  -->  00:00:06.820
These are two things you can do with Sequel
4

4

00:00:06.820  -->  00:00:10.180
that can be pretty handy in a number of scenarios.
5

5

00:00:10.180  -->  00:00:12.660
Let's have this purchases table here
6

6

00:00:12.660  -->  00:00:15.520
that has three columns and four rows.
7

7

00:00:15.520  -->  00:00:18.150
Notice how there's an id, an amount,
8

8

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:19.830
the money that was paid for this purchase,
9

9

00:00:19.830  -->  00:00:23.580
and also a date which is a Unix timestamp.
10

10

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:25.930
We could do something like this:
11

11

00:00:25.930  -->  00:00:28.060
Select star from purchases,
12

12

00:00:28.060  -->  00:00:30.380
and now instead of where, or indeed,
13

13

00:00:30.380  -->  00:00:35.380
as well as where, we can use order by amount.
14

14

00:00:35.490  -->  00:00:38.400
This is going to order in ascending fashion,
15

15

00:00:38.400  -->  00:00:40.800
giving us something like this:
16

16

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:45.800
9.99 at the top, followed by 14.99, 15.99 and 150.
17

17

00:00:47.210  -->  00:00:51.440
Of course we could order by amount descending instead
18

18

00:00:51.440  -->  00:00:55.820
by just putting DESC on the end for descending.
19

19

00:00:55.820  -->  00:00:59.630
And that gives us 150 at the top going down to 9.99,
20

20

00:00:59.630  -->  00:01:01.630
and if for some reason you wanted to make it explicit,
21

21

00:01:01.630  -->  00:01:03.670
that you wanted ascending,
22

22

00:01:03.670  -->  00:01:07.160
you can use ASC instead of DESC.
23

23

00:01:07.160  -->  00:01:08.550
Ascending is the default so you don't
24

24

00:01:08.550  -->  00:01:10.480
have to include it in Sequel Light,
25

25

00:01:10.480  -->  00:01:12.450
but it's possible that other database systems
26

26

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:13.410
may be different.
27

27

00:01:15.410  -->  00:01:17.750
You can order by amount descending,
28

28

00:01:17.750  -->  00:01:19.980
that's the largest at the top,
29

29

00:01:19.980  -->  00:01:23.220
and limit one, and that's gonna give you only the top
30

30

00:01:23.220  -->  00:01:25.500
most row of your database.
31

31

00:01:25.500  -->  00:01:28.230
That's the most expensive purchase that anybody has made,
32

32

00:01:28.230  -->  00:01:31.190
and potentially you could do then things like,
33

33

00:01:31.190  -->  00:01:33.070
notify the user that has made this purchase
34

34

00:01:33.070  -->  00:01:34.670
and tell them they've won a voucher or something
35

35

00:01:34.670  -->  00:01:36.570
for spending the most money in your store.
36

36

00:01:36.570  -->  00:01:39.599
I don't know, but you see the, you see the deal there.
37

37

00:01:39.599  -->  00:01:42.320
You can get the top most of something,
38

38

00:01:42.320  -->  00:01:43.630
and indeed instead of limit one,
39

39

00:01:43.630  -->  00:01:45.130
you can do limit two, or limit three,
40

40

00:01:45.130  -->  00:01:47.540
if you wanna get the top three of something.
41

41

00:01:48.560  -->  00:01:51.020
So these two, order by and limit,
42

42

00:01:51.020  -->  00:01:55.220
are pretty handy to use, and you can use them together.
43

43

00:01:55.220  -->  00:01:57.770
If you wanted to put a where clause,
44

44

00:01:57.770  -->  00:02:00.640
it would go before the order by clause.
45

45

00:02:01.590  -->  00:02:03.730
So you can also put that in there.
46

46

00:02:03.730  -->  00:02:06.590
Again, this course is not meant to be a in depth
47

47

00:02:06.590  -->  00:02:08.120
Sequel tutorial.
48

48

00:02:08.120  -->  00:02:09.570
I just wanted to guide you enough
49

49

00:02:09.570  -->  00:02:12.140
so that you can sort of interact with tables,
50

50

00:02:12.140  -->  00:02:13.790
and store and retrieve some data.
51

51

00:02:14.840  -->  00:02:16.810
If you want to learn much more about Sequel,
52

52

00:02:16.810  -->  00:02:19.840
then I'd encourage you to go and investigate,
53

53

00:02:19.840  -->  00:02:21.300
read stuff online,
54

54

00:02:21.300  -->  00:02:22.940
implement your own projects that use them,
55

55

00:02:22.940  -->  00:02:24.280
and learn through that,
56

56

00:02:24.280  -->  00:02:25.890
and of course you can also take some
57

57

00:02:25.890  -->  00:02:28.414
other courses if you are so inclined.
58

58

00:02:28.414  -->  00:02:29.610
But that's it for this video.
59

59

00:02:29.610  -->  00:02:32.890
I just wanted to guide you through ordering and limiting,
60

60

00:02:32.890  -->  00:02:34.540
and I'll see you on the next one.
