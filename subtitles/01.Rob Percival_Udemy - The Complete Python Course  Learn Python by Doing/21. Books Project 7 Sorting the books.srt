00:00:00,160  -->  00:00:01,060
<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,060  -->  00:00:03,494
In this video, we're going to look
3

3

00:00:03,494  -->  00:00:04,327
at sorting through our books
4

4

00:00:04,327  -->  00:00:06,890
to find only the best books by rating
5

5

00:00:06,890  -->  00:00:08,100
and by price.
6

6

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:09,480
Then, in the next video we're going
7

7

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:10,850
to add that to a menu.
8

8

00:00:11,740  -->  00:00:13,738
For now, we're going to make our app
9

9

00:00:13,738  -->  00:00:16,947
return or, rather, export these books
10

10

00:00:16,947  -->  00:00:19,670
so that we can import them from our menu.
11

11

00:00:19,670  -->  00:00:24,670
So we're gonna delete this for books, for booking books
12

12

00:00:24,740  -->  00:00:27,560
and we're gonna end with this books being equal
13

13

00:00:27,560  -->  00:00:29,660
to page dot books.
14

14

00:00:29,660  -->  00:00:33,240
In Python, every variable that you see here,
15

15

00:00:33,240  -->  00:00:36,380
requests, all books page, page content,
16

16

00:00:36,380  -->  00:00:39,660
page and books are automatically exported
17

17

00:00:39,660  -->  00:00:41,510
so that anybody else can import them.
18

18

00:00:42,590  -->  00:00:43,970
For example, as another example
19

19

00:00:43,970  -->  00:00:46,070
of what's happening here,
20

20

00:00:46,070  -->  00:00:49,370
if we go to our all books page,
21

21

00:00:49,370  -->  00:00:52,220
you can see that it creates a few things,
22

22

00:00:52,220  -->  00:00:54,820
it creates this class all books page,
23

23

00:00:54,820  -->  00:00:57,050
this books parser, all books page locators
24

24

00:00:57,050  -->  00:00:58,210
and beautiful soup.
25

25

00:00:58,210  -->  00:01:01,170
These four things are all available
26

26

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:03,690
sort of at the top level of the file.
27

27

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:06,100
When you go into app.py,
28

28

00:01:06,100  -->  00:01:08,950
you could import beautiful soup,
29

29

00:01:08,950  -->  00:01:10,770
it would be a weird thing to do
30

30

00:01:10,770  -->  00:01:12,420
but this is something you can do.
31

31

00:01:13,786  -->  00:01:15,560
And so the purpose of me telling you this
32

32

00:01:15,560  -->  00:01:17,430
is as soon as you create a variable
33

33

00:01:17,430  -->  00:01:19,760
like books equal page dot books
34

34

00:01:19,760  -->  00:01:22,810
which the result of launching this scraper
35

35

00:01:22,810  -->  00:01:25,180
you know and getting all that data out,
36

36

00:01:25,180  -->  00:01:27,985
this variable can now be imported
37

37

00:01:27,985  -->  00:01:29,680
by another file.
38

38

00:01:30,550  -->  00:01:32,970
When that file tries to import books,
39

39

00:01:32,970  -->  00:01:35,330
we will run through this entire file,
40

40

00:01:35,330  -->  00:01:36,560
end up calculating books
41

41

00:01:36,560  -->  00:01:37,530
and be able to import.
42

42

00:01:37,530  -->  00:01:39,886
So let's go over and create a new file
43

43

00:01:39,886  -->  00:01:44,110
that I'm going to call menu in the top level
44

44

00:01:44,110  -->  00:01:48,100
and from app we're going to import books, okay?
45

45

00:01:49,100  -->  00:01:50,400
Then we're gonna
46

46

00:01:50,400  -->  00:01:53,720
define a function print best books for example.
47

47

00:01:54,970  -->  00:01:57,930
What this is going to do is it's going to sort
48

48

00:01:57,930  -->  00:01:59,800
the books that we've got here,
49

49

00:01:59,800  -->  00:02:02,940
this list of book parser objects
50

50

00:02:02,940  -->  00:02:05,895
and it's only gonna give me the top five books,
51

51

00:02:05,895  -->  00:02:08,580
which means they're gonna be the five star books,
52

52

00:02:08,580  -->  00:02:11,150
some of them at least are going to be five stars.
53

53

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:17,058
Okay, so the best books are going to be
54

54

00:02:17,058  -->  00:02:19,960
and what we need to do here is sort the books
55

55

00:02:19,960  -->  00:02:23,250
by their rating, so what we're going to do
56

56

00:02:23,250  -->  00:02:26,470
is say sorted books
57

57

00:02:26,470  -->  00:02:28,020
and the key
58

58

00:02:28,020  -->  00:02:32,940
is going to be lamda x, x dot rating.
59

59

00:02:34,550  -->  00:02:35,760
Okay.
60

60

00:02:35,760  -->  00:02:36,960
All this does,
61

61

00:02:38,210  -->  00:02:39,043
oops sorry about that,
62

62

00:02:39,043  -->  00:02:41,640
all this does is it takes the books list
63

63

00:02:41,640  -->  00:02:45,450
or the collection and it sorts it
64

64

00:02:45,450  -->  00:02:49,870
for every element it's going to look at this key function
65

65

00:02:49,870  -->  00:02:52,090
to see what it's sorting by
66

66

00:02:53,140  -->  00:02:57,060
and in here we're telling it to sort by the rating property.
67

67

00:02:57,060  -->  00:02:59,397
So what it's doing is it's getting the first book,
68

68

00:02:59,397  -->  00:03:01,650
calling this function on it,
69

69

00:03:01,650  -->  00:03:04,500
that's gonna give it the books rating
70

70

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:06,990
and then it's gonna sort by that,
71

71

00:03:06,990  -->  00:03:09,300
so we're gonna end up sorting, you know,
72

72

00:03:09,300  -->  00:03:11,360
with this rating key.
73

73

00:03:12,560  -->  00:03:14,260
Then we can say for book
74

74

00:03:15,310  -->  00:03:17,560
in best books, print.
75

75

00:03:20,213  -->  00:03:23,620
Now this is going to give you a list of books
76

76

00:03:23,620  -->  00:03:26,100
because that's what we gave it in.
77

77

00:03:26,100  -->  00:03:28,810
So if you wanted, you could slice this list
78

78

00:03:28,810  -->  00:03:31,610
to only get the top say 10 books.
79

79

00:03:34,050  -->  00:03:37,330
Just like so, as we know from our list slicing.
80

80

00:03:38,980  -->  00:03:40,690
Now of course we must run
81

81

00:03:41,950  -->  00:03:44,240
this function in order for it to do something
82

82

00:03:44,240  -->  00:03:46,100
and again just to recap, the first thing
83

83

00:03:46,100  -->  00:03:48,330
we're gonna do is we're gonna import books
84

84

00:03:48,330  -->  00:03:50,450
from the app file so that's gonna go over
85

85

00:03:50,450  -->  00:03:52,710
to app and it's gonna run app
86

86

00:03:52,710  -->  00:03:54,070
and it's going to go through all of this,
87

87

00:03:54,070  -->  00:03:54,950
this is going to take a while
88

88

00:03:54,950  -->  00:03:56,440
'cause it has to get the books page
89

89

00:03:56,440  -->  00:03:58,470
and sort of parse through it
90

90

00:03:58,470  -->  00:04:00,020
and eventually it's gonna end this
91

91

00:04:00,020  -->  00:04:02,010
and then we're gonna import books
92

92

00:04:02,010  -->  00:04:04,250
which is now gonna be available
93

93

00:04:04,250  -->  00:04:06,900
and then we're gonna sort them and print them out.
94

94

00:04:06,900  -->  00:04:09,190
So let's right click our menu and run it.
95

95

00:04:10,999  -->  00:04:13,320
And there you have it, now we get 10 books
96

96

00:04:13,320  -->  00:04:15,790
that are all one star.
97

97

00:04:17,438  -->  00:04:20,040
By the way, a small side improvement you could try
98

98

00:04:20,040  -->  00:04:23,890
is this one stars, it should probably be one star
99

99

00:04:23,890  -->  00:04:27,350
without the S but you do want the S if you have many stars,
100

100

00:04:27,350  -->  00:04:30,150
so this is a small improvement you can try out if you want.
101

101

00:04:30,150  -->  00:04:31,670
Notice how all these books have one star,
102

102

00:04:31,670  -->  00:04:34,470
one star, one star, two stars, two stars, three stars.
103

103

00:04:36,046  -->  00:04:40,500
So we are sorting by default here on ascending okay?
104

104

00:04:42,900  -->  00:04:47,900
And the easiest way to sort in a descending way,
105

105

00:04:47,930  -->  00:04:50,650
is to multiply this by minus one.
106

106

00:04:55,780  -->  00:05:00,020
Now, instead of starting at one and going up,
107

107

00:05:00,020  -->  00:05:02,480
we're gonna start at the lowest number and go up
108

108

00:05:02,480  -->  00:05:06,190
so instead of one to five, we're gonna sort
109

109

00:05:06,190  -->  00:05:09,650
from minus five to minus one, which is gonna
110

110

00:05:09,650  -->  00:05:11,710
give us the order that we want.
111

111

00:05:11,710  -->  00:05:12,760
If we run this again,
112

112

00:05:14,530  -->  00:05:16,710
you can see now we get our five star books
113

113

00:05:16,710  -->  00:05:18,120
and then our four star books
114

114

00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:19,380
and our three star books.
115

115

00:05:21,240  -->  00:05:23,170
Okay, I hope this makes sense.
116

116

00:05:23,170  -->  00:05:24,307
All we're doing is we're essentially reversing
117

117

00:05:24,307  -->  00:05:26,270
the order of things.
118

118

00:05:28,370  -->  00:05:31,270
This is how you could get your best books.
119

119

00:05:31,270  -->  00:05:32,940
If you wanted your cheapest books,
120

120

00:05:32,940  -->  00:05:35,650
it would be exactly the same thing really.
121

121

00:05:35,650  -->  00:05:38,310
So much so that I'm going to copy
122

122

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:40,660
and paste which is not something you should do.
123

123

00:05:42,100  -->  00:05:44,930
And now instead of sorting by rating,
124

124

00:05:44,930  -->  00:05:47,000
multiplied by minus one,
125

125

00:05:47,000  -->  00:05:48,890
we're gonna sort by price and that's gonna give you
126

126

00:05:48,890  -->  00:05:50,660
your cheapest books.
127

127

00:05:50,660  -->  00:05:52,890
I'm gonna use a PyCharm shortcut here
128

128

00:05:52,890  -->  00:05:56,620
which is shift and the F6 key
129

129

00:05:56,620  -->  00:05:58,710
and that's gonna allow me to
130

130

00:06:00,110  -->  00:06:02,520
rename all the usage
131

131

00:06:02,520  -->  00:06:04,530
of this variable everywhere in this function
132

132

00:06:04,530  -->  00:06:06,380
so as you can see this one got renamed as well.
133

133

00:06:06,380  -->  00:06:09,960
So that's shift F6, if you're interested.
134

134

00:06:11,400  -->  00:06:15,110
We can also print the cheapest books now.
135

135

00:06:18,080  -->  00:06:20,000
And you can see there,
136

136

00:06:21,560  -->  00:06:24,970
that we get, this starts here,
137

137

00:06:24,970  -->  00:06:28,090
this is the cheapest book, or is it?
138

138

00:06:33,840  -->  00:06:35,870
Yeah, it's possible that this one is the,
139

139

00:06:35,870  -->  00:06:37,760
this one must be the cheapest book.
140

140

00:06:37,760  -->  00:06:39,290
This one here is where it starts,
141

141

00:06:39,290  -->  00:06:41,130
this is the cheapest book and then it goes up
142

142

00:06:41,130  -->  00:06:45,640
to 17, 17.20 and so far up until 37.
143

143

00:06:45,640  -->  00:06:47,250
If you wanted to make it a bit more obvious,
144

144

00:06:47,250  -->  00:06:48,110
you could print
145

145

00:06:50,010  -->  00:06:51,100
something like that.
146

146

00:06:54,810  -->  00:06:56,840
Just so it's a bit easier
147

147

00:06:56,840  -->  00:06:59,440
to see where it starts and where it ends
148

148

00:06:59,440  -->  00:07:01,390
and these are indeed the cheapest ones.
149

149

00:07:02,240  -->  00:07:03,580
Notice how there's little correlation
150

150

00:07:03,580  -->  00:07:05,820
between the quality the book and price,
151

151

00:07:05,820  -->  00:07:08,955
in terms of the star rating because this page is random,
152

152

00:07:08,955  -->  00:07:11,750
okay the prices and the stars are assigned randomly
153

153

00:07:11,750  -->  00:07:15,434
so there's no logic that goes on in here.
154

154

00:07:15,434  -->  00:07:16,630
Okay?
155

155

00:07:18,040  -->  00:07:20,170
Now if you wanted
156

156

00:07:20,170  -->  00:07:23,090
to sort by multiple things,
157

157

00:07:23,090  -->  00:07:24,490
you can also do that
158

158

00:07:24,490  -->  00:07:26,440
so that's something you can do as well.
159

159

00:07:26,440  -->  00:07:28,400
Let's have a look at how to do that.
160

160

00:07:30,100  -->  00:07:33,760
All you've gotta do if you want to sort by two things
161

161

00:07:33,760  -->  00:07:37,340
is instead of returning here the value
162

162

00:07:37,340  -->  00:07:40,390
that you wanna sort by, as you can see here,
163

163

00:07:40,390  -->  00:07:43,570
we're sorting by best so only by stars,
164

164

00:07:43,570  -->  00:07:47,100
so 44 point, 54.23 at the start.
165

165

00:07:47,100  -->  00:07:49,400
You can actually, don't do that,
166

166

00:07:49,400  -->  00:07:51,400
you can return a tuple
167

167

00:07:55,940  -->  00:07:58,130
of things and it's gonna sort by this one first
168

168

00:07:58,130  -->  00:08:01,450
and if it finds a few books that have the same rating,
169

169

00:08:01,450  -->  00:08:03,550
it's gonna sort them by price
170

170

00:08:03,550  -->  00:08:05,840
and you can continue adding keys here
171

171

00:08:05,840  -->  00:08:07,870
if you want so if we run this again,
172

172

00:08:09,120  -->  00:08:11,550
now you can see that we get the cheaper
173

173

00:08:11,550  -->  00:08:14,570
book in front and its cheaper book as well
174

174

00:08:14,570  -->  00:08:18,500
until we get to the more expensive ones, okay?
175

175

00:08:18,500  -->  00:08:20,210
But these are all five stars,
176

176

00:08:20,210  -->  00:08:22,030
then you have a cheaper book here,
177

177

00:08:22,030  -->  00:08:23,370
but it's four stars.
178

178

00:08:23,370  -->  00:08:25,930
So the most important sorting criteria was the stars
179

179

00:08:25,930  -->  00:08:28,380
because that was the first thing in our tuple,
180

180

00:08:28,380  -->  00:08:31,780
the second most important was the price, okay?
181

181

00:08:31,780  -->  00:08:34,299
So this is how you can do multiple sorting
182

182

00:08:34,299  -->  00:08:35,440
if you need to.
183

183

00:08:38,090  -->  00:08:39,530
So that's pretty useful.
184

184

00:08:39,530  -->  00:08:40,710
Okay that's it for this video,
185

185

00:08:40,710  -->  00:08:41,620
I just wanted to show you
186

186

00:08:41,620  -->  00:08:44,510
how to do the sorting of these books.
187

187

00:08:44,510  -->  00:08:48,170
Now we're gonna look at constructing the menu itself.
188

188

00:08:48,170  -->  00:08:49,720
I'll see you in the next video.
