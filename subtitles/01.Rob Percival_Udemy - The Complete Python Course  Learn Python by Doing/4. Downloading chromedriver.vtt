<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.350  -->  00:00:03.810
In this video we're doing to be downloading
3

3

00:00:03.810  -->  00:00:05.690
the ChromeDriver.
4

4

00:00:05.690  -->  00:00:07.660
One of these browser drivers allow us
5

5

00:00:07.660  -->  00:00:09.910
to talk to the browser programmatically.
6

6

00:00:09.910  -->  00:00:11.450
And you can find them for Chrome,
7

7

00:00:11.450  -->  00:00:13.593
Firefox, Internet Explorer and so on.
8

8

00:00:14.750  -->  00:00:17.630
The browser makers make these drivers
9

9

00:00:17.630  -->  00:00:20.764
precisely so that we can automate the browser
10

10

00:00:20.764  -->  00:00:23.110
using programming languages.
11

11

00:00:23.110  -->  00:00:26.950
And the primary reason for that is not to scrape content
12

12

00:00:26.950  -->  00:00:31.800
but to actually test websites running them on a browser.
13

13

00:00:31.800  -->  00:00:34.240
Automated software testing if you will.
14

14

00:00:34.240  -->  00:00:36.020
That's not what we're gonna be doing in this section
15

15

00:00:36.020  -->  00:00:37.950
but nonetheless that is the primary purpose
16

16

00:00:37.950  -->  00:00:39.393
of making these drivers.
17

17

00:00:40.320  -->  00:00:41.890
To download the ChromeDriver,
18

18

00:00:41.890  -->  00:00:45.640
we're going to go over to chromedriver.chromium.org
19

19

00:00:45.640  -->  00:00:47.020
and you have to make sure
20

20

00:00:47.020  -->  00:00:49.050
you have Chrome installed of course,
21

21

00:00:49.050  -->  00:00:53.400
since the ChromeDriver is gonna talk to your Chrome version.
22

22

00:00:53.400  -->  00:00:57.160
Make sure that Chrome is up-to-date
23

23

00:00:57.160  -->  00:00:59.650
and then download the latest stable release.
24

24

00:00:59.650  -->  00:01:02.530
When you go here, you'll see a very nice-looking website
25

25

00:01:02.530  -->  00:01:05.460
that allows you to download ChromeDriver.
26

26

00:01:05.460  -->  00:01:07.620
Just select your version.
27

27

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:09.970
If you're using Linux, download linux64,
28

28

00:01:09.970  -->  00:01:12.763
Mac, mac64, and Windows, win32.
29

29

00:01:13.720  -->  00:01:17.070
I'm gonna download mac64 and that downloads a zip file,
30

30

00:01:17.070  -->  00:01:18.860
same for all operating system.
31

31

00:01:18.860  -->  00:01:20.400
That zip file, when you open it,
32

32

00:01:20.400  -->  00:01:22.390
will contain just one thing
33

33

00:01:22.390  -->  00:01:26.290
which is a ChromeDriver executable.
34

34

00:01:26.290  -->  00:01:28.320
On Linux and Mac it'll be called ChromeDriver,
35

35

00:01:28.320  -->  00:01:31.210
on Windows it'll be called ChromeDriver.exe.
36

36

00:01:31.210  -->  00:01:35.000
All you have to do is unzip it, remove it from this zip,
37

37

00:01:35.000  -->  00:01:38.380
put it somewhere you can remember the path of and that's it.
38

38

00:01:38.380  -->  00:01:40.450
You're gonna need to remember the path
39

39

00:01:40.450  -->  00:01:42.390
because we need to tell Python
40

40

00:01:42.390  -->  00:01:46.580
where the ChromeDriver is located when you wanna use it.
41

41

00:01:46.580  -->  00:01:49.140
So just put it somewhere that you know where it is,
42

42

00:01:49.140  -->  00:01:51.610
remember the path and let's move onto the next video
43

43

00:01:51.610  -->  00:01:54.080
where we're gonna be using the ChromeDriver
44

44

00:01:54.080  -->  00:01:55.840
to launch Chrome.
45

45

00:01:55.840  -->  00:01:56.790
I'll see you there.
