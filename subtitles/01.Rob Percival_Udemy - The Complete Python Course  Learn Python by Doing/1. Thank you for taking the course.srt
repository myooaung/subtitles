<v ->I just wanted to take a few moments</v>
2

2

00:00:03,022  -->  00:00:06,720
to say thank you for joining me throughout this course.
3

3

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:10,020
I hope you've really enjoyed learning all about Python.
4

4

00:00:10,890  -->  00:00:14,450
We've gone from the very fundamentals back at the start;
5

5

00:00:14,450  -->  00:00:18,480
numbers, printing, strings and so forth
6

6

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:22,200
and we've ended up in a much more advanced stage.
7

7

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:24,910
We've even learned about one of the most difficult topics
8

8

00:00:24,910  -->  00:00:27,370
in Python which is asynchronous development.
9

9

00:00:28,350  -->  00:00:31,080
Over the way we've also looked at databases,
10

10

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:33,320
files, generators.
11

11

00:00:33,320  -->  00:00:34,550
We've looked at Flask.
12

12

00:00:34,550  -->  00:00:37,450
We've looked at web scraping and all sorts of stuff.
13

13

00:00:38,510  -->  00:00:41,540
Now you are ready to continue your Python journey
14

14

00:00:41,540  -->  00:00:44,390
and learn more about the topics that really interest you.
15

15

00:00:45,670  -->  00:00:47,930
So thank you for joining me once again
16

16

00:00:47,930  -->  00:00:49,730
and I'll see you in the next course.
