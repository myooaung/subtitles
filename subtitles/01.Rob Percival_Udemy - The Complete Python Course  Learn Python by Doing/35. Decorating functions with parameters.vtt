<v ->Hi guys, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.010  -->  00:00:04.240
In this video, we're going to learn
3

3

00:00:04.240  -->  00:00:06.910
about decorating functions with parameters.
4

4

00:00:06.910  -->  00:00:08.370
So, let's take a look at our example,
5

5

00:00:08.370  -->  00:00:10.830
and do a little bit more with it.
6

6

00:00:10.830  -->  00:00:13.700
Here we've got our make secure decorator
7

7

00:00:13.700  -->  00:00:16.430
and our get admin password function.
8

8

00:00:16.430  -->  00:00:18.130
If instead of get admin password
9

9

00:00:18.130  -->  00:00:20.470
we wanted to change this to get password
10

10

00:00:20.470  -->  00:00:23.590
and take in a panel decorator and then do something like
11

11

00:00:23.590  -->  00:00:27.300
if panel is admin then return one, two, three, four
12

12

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:30.200
otherwise if panel is billing
13

13

00:00:30.200  -->  00:00:33.660
then return super secure password.
14

14

00:00:33.660  -->  00:00:35.070
Something like that.
15

15

00:00:35.070  -->  00:00:37.940
Now, of course, when you call the function
16

16

00:00:37.940  -->  00:00:41.680
you're going to have to pass an A panel, such as billing.
17

17

00:00:41.680  -->  00:00:46.680
But this function actually won't take in the argument
18

18

00:00:46.730  -->  00:00:51.730
because our function here, calls the original function
19

19

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:53.520
without the argument.
20

20

00:00:53.520  -->  00:00:56.550
So here's what's gonna happen when you call get password.
21

21

00:00:56.550  -->  00:01:01.460
Remember, get password is replaced by secure function.
22

22

00:01:01.460  -->  00:01:02.630
So, secure function at the moment
23

23

00:01:02.630  -->  00:01:04.500
does not have any parameters
24

24

00:01:04.500  -->  00:01:07.910
so you won't be able to pass billing to it.
25

25

00:01:07.910  -->  00:01:11.620
In addition, when you call the original function
26

26

00:01:11.620  -->  00:01:13.380
no argument is passed either,
27

27

00:01:13.380  -->  00:01:16.240
so even if this function took the argument in,
28

28

00:01:16.240  -->  00:01:17.550
it wouldn't be passed in then.
29

29

00:01:17.550  -->  00:01:18.750
So obviously we have to fix that.
30

30

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:22.400
We have to put the panel in there and the panel in there.
31

31

00:01:22.400  -->  00:01:25.660
Then what happens is billing gets passed to secure function
32

32

00:01:25.660  -->  00:01:27.410
then it gets passed to the original function
33

33

00:01:27.410  -->  00:01:30.580
which is get password, and then this will work.
34

34

00:01:30.580  -->  00:01:32.160
However, this is not good
35

35

00:01:32.160  -->  00:01:36.430
because we have coupled our make secure decorator
36

36

00:01:36.430  -->  00:01:37.570
to this function.
37

37

00:01:37.570  -->  00:01:40.080
That means that we can't use it on other functions
38

38

00:01:40.080  -->  00:01:42.850
that take in different arguments.
39

39

00:01:42.850  -->  00:01:45.140
So instead, what you usually do with decorators,
40

40

00:01:45.140  -->  00:01:47.860
is you make them take unlimited numbers
41

41

00:01:47.860  -->  00:01:49.500
of arguments and keyword arguments
42

42

00:01:49.500  -->  00:01:51.580
so you can cater for everything.
43

43

00:01:51.580  -->  00:01:53.310
Then once you do that, as you may know already,
44

44

00:01:53.310  -->  00:01:56.230
is star args and star, star kwargs.
45

45

00:01:56.230  -->  00:01:58.670
And then you just pass them on as well
46

46

00:01:58.670  -->  00:02:01.200
to the original function.
47

47

00:02:01.200  -->  00:02:04.960
So that will make it work and also it won't limit you
48

48

00:02:04.960  -->  00:02:07.010
to using it with only this function.
49

49

00:02:07.010  -->  00:02:08.690
You can use it with any other function.
50

50

00:02:08.690  -->  00:02:11.810
This get password here must still be called
51

51

00:02:11.810  -->  00:02:15.420
with the correct argument for the original function.
52

52

00:02:15.420  -->  00:02:17.510
But this one here doesn't care
53

53

00:02:17.510  -->  00:02:20.170
what arguments are passed in.
54

54

00:02:20.170  -->  00:02:21.390
That's everything for this video.
55

55

00:02:21.390  -->  00:02:22.850
Thank you for joining me in this one,
56

56

00:02:22.850  -->  00:02:24.500
and I'll see you in the next one.
