In this video we're looking at scraping
3

3

00:00:03,990  -->  00:00:06,640
this quotes page that you see here
4

4

00:00:06,640  -->  00:00:09,220
and we're going to do that before moving on to the books
5

5

00:00:09,220  -->  00:00:11,830
just because this one's a little bit simpler.
6

6

00:00:11,830  -->  00:00:14,980
And what I'm going to teach you over the next few videos
7

7

00:00:14,980  -->  00:00:18,530
is how to structure your scraping applications
8

8

00:00:18,530  -->  00:00:20,880
so that you can do anything you want with them.
9

9

00:00:21,850  -->  00:00:24,060
In this section we're going to build two projects.
10

10

00:00:24,060  -->  00:00:25,720
The quotes page scraper,
11

11

00:00:25,720  -->  00:00:27,980
and then the books page scraper which is going to be
12

12

00:00:27,980  -->  00:00:30,530
actually very similar, at least in structure.
13

13

00:00:31,670  -->  00:00:34,360
Let's start by analysing this this quotes page.
14

14

00:00:35,630  -->  00:00:39,700
The URL, by the way, is quotes.toscrape.com
15

15

00:00:39,700  -->  00:00:41,890
so feel free to have a look yourself as well
16

16

00:00:41,890  -->  00:00:44,040
if you want to sort of play around with it.
17

17

00:00:45,040  -->  00:00:46,890
What we've got is, as you can see
18

18

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:48,520
a few different elements in the screen.
19

19

00:00:48,520  -->  00:00:51,080
We've got some sort of title up here,
20

20

00:00:51,080  -->  00:00:54,500
we've got a login page down here on the top right,
21

21

00:00:54,500  -->  00:00:55,860
we've got top 10 tags,
22

22

00:00:55,860  -->  00:01:00,090
so these things are presumably clickable so these are links.
23

23

00:01:00,090  -->  00:01:05,090
Then you've got individual quotes in these rectangles here
24

24

00:01:05,140  -->  00:01:07,310
these sort of cards.
25

25

00:01:07,310  -->  00:01:11,310
Whenever you see something that looks structured like this,
26

26

00:01:11,310  -->  00:01:13,490
you know it's going to be an easy scrape.
27

27

00:01:13,490  -->  00:01:15,680
This page is designed for scraping so of course it's going
28

28

00:01:15,680  -->  00:01:19,640
to be slightly simpler than other pages
29

29

00:01:19,640  -->  00:01:21,850
you may see out in the wild.
30

30

00:01:21,850  -->  00:01:23,930
But what we're going to learn in this section
31

31

00:01:23,930  -->  00:01:27,040
is really going to help us scrape any page,
32

32

00:01:27,040  -->  00:01:29,790
not just these simpler pages.
33

33

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:32,600
So what we've got here are a number of different cards.
34

34

00:01:32,600  -->  00:01:36,750
And each card contains a quote as well as the author
35

35

00:01:36,750  -->  00:01:39,810
and a bunch of tags here that we can scrape.
36

36

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:41,900
What we're going to do is we're going to create a programme
37

37

00:01:41,900  -->  00:01:45,730
that will give us the quote contents and also the author.
38

38

00:01:46,700  -->  00:01:48,600
That's it, pretty simple programme.
39

39

00:01:48,600  -->  00:01:51,510
Again, what you learn will mean that you will be able to
40

40

00:01:51,510  -->  00:01:54,840
extend that programme beyond that by any amount.
41

41

00:01:56,620  -->  00:01:59,780
So let's start by inspecting the page source
42

42

00:01:59,780  -->  00:02:01,520
just to know what it looks like.
43

43

00:02:02,820  -->  00:02:05,610
As you can see here on the right, we have ourselves
44

44

00:02:05,610  -->  00:02:09,710
the body of the HTML that contains all of the content.
45

45

00:02:09,710  -->  00:02:13,400
Inside there we've got a div which has a class container.
46

46

00:02:13,400  -->  00:02:15,450
That contains all of the content as well.
47

47

00:02:16,450  -->  00:02:20,270
And then we have a row which is a header box,
48

48

00:02:20,270  -->  00:02:22,240
and beside it we have another row,
49

49

00:02:22,240  -->  00:02:23,890
which is the rest of the content.
50

50

00:02:25,830  -->  00:02:30,830
Inside that row we have a number of, well two columns.
51

51

00:02:30,928  -->  00:02:32,800
One that is col-nd-8,
52

52

00:02:34,003  -->  00:02:36,100
and the other ne that is col-nd-4.
53

53

00:02:37,008  -->  00:02:40,680
And it also has another class called tags-box.
54

54

00:02:40,680  -->  00:02:43,390
So this is the tags, this is the quotes.
55

55

00:02:43,390  -->  00:02:47,090
In the quotes we have a number of divs,
56

56

00:02:47,090  -->  00:02:52,090
each div with a class quote that has one of the quotes.
57

57

00:02:52,200  -->  00:02:55,930
So we know that each of these divs is going to be
58

58

00:02:55,930  -->  00:03:00,110
exactly identical to all the others except in the content.
59

59

00:03:00,110  -->  00:03:03,960
But inside one div, we have a span which has a class text,
60

60

00:03:03,960  -->  00:03:06,091
and that contains the quote,
61

61

00:03:06,091  -->  00:03:11,091
and another span which contains by and also a small tag
62

62

00:03:11,120  -->  00:03:12,980
which contains the author,
63

63

00:03:12,980  -->  00:03:16,310
also a link which contains the about page of that author.
64

64

00:03:18,012  -->  00:03:21,940
Then it's got another div which contains the tags.
65

65

00:03:21,940  -->  00:03:25,426
There's a few things in here, and amongst them is an a tag
66

66

00:03:25,426  -->  00:03:28,390
and that has a class tag.
67

67

00:03:29,770  -->  00:03:34,280
So inside that tag we have change, deep thoughts,
68

68

00:03:34,280  -->  00:03:36,300
thinking, world, and so forth.
69

69

00:03:37,340  -->  00:03:39,480
If you were to look at any other of these quotes,
70

70

00:03:39,480  -->  00:03:41,570
you would see that it is essentially the same.
71

71

00:03:41,570  -->  00:03:44,140
A span with class tags and that contains a quote.
72

72

00:03:44,140  -->  00:03:47,060
Another span that contains a by and small tag which contains
73

73

00:03:47,060  -->  00:03:50,280
the author, and then another div here with the tags.
74

74

00:03:50,280  -->  00:03:51,113
And so forth.
75

75

00:03:52,020  -->  00:03:56,890
So we know that as long as we manage to get these divs
76

76

00:03:56,890  -->  00:04:01,580
and for each div get this data, we'll be able to extract
77

77

00:04:01,580  -->  00:04:04,140
all of the data that we need from the page.
78

78

00:04:04,140  -->  00:04:05,720
So we're going to do that in the very next video.
79

79

00:04:05,720  -->  00:04:09,440 line:15% 
We're going to structure our new application in order to
80

80

00:04:09,440  -->  00:04:11,610 line:15% 
be able to understand this page.
81

81

00:04:11,610  -->  00:04:13,330 line:15% 
I'll see you in the very next video.
