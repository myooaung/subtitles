00:00:00,790  -->  00:00:02,640
<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,640  -->  00:00:05,150
In this section, we're gonna have a Stata code,
3

3

00:00:05,150  -->  00:00:07,360
which is the code from the last section,
4

4

00:00:07,360  -->  00:00:08,930
the web scraping code.
5

5

00:00:08,930  -->  00:00:10,360
Let's go over it real quick,
6

6

00:00:10,360  -->  00:00:13,050
just in case you haven't seen it in a while.
7

7

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:16,310
We've got the entry point to our code, app.py,
8

8

00:00:16,310  -->  00:00:20,030
and that makes the requests to quotes.toscrape.com,
9

9

00:00:20,030  -->  00:00:21,910
which is just a quotes website
10

10

00:00:21,910  -->  00:00:23,690
that contains some quotes by famous people
11

11

00:00:23,690  -->  00:00:26,300
and gives us the HTML content of the page.
12

12

00:00:26,300  -->  00:00:30,063
That HTML content is passed on to our QuotesPage class.
13

13

00:00:30,063  -->  00:00:33,360
What that does is it creates a BeautifulSoup object,
14

14

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:36,780
which will allow us to traverse the HTML that we've received
15

15

00:00:36,780  -->  00:00:39,470
and find things inside the HTML,
16

16

00:00:39,470  -->  00:00:42,630
which is what we do down here in the Quote property.
17

17

00:00:42,630  -->  00:00:45,470
We go into that BeautifulSoup object.
18

18

00:00:45,470  -->  00:00:48,850
And we find elements, using the select method,
19

19

00:00:48,850  -->  00:00:51,370
matching this selector here.
20

20

00:00:51,370  -->  00:00:55,210
The selector is just any div in the page
21

21

00:00:55,210  -->  00:00:57,890
that has the class, quote.
22

22

00:00:57,890  -->  00:01:00,020
If you haven't seen the last section,
23

23

00:01:00,020  -->  00:01:02,160
I would recommend going through that first,
24

24

00:01:02,160  -->  00:01:04,870
just because it contains a bunch of explanations
25

25

00:01:04,870  -->  00:01:07,540
that you will need for this section as well.
26

26

00:01:07,540  -->  00:01:10,620
Now, after finding all the divs with that class with quote,
27

27

00:01:10,620  -->  00:01:15,280
it passes them into a QuoteParser object that we also made.
28

28

00:01:15,280  -->  00:01:17,580
And this one stores the parent,
29

29

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:20,550
which is basically the container of the quote.
30

30

00:01:20,550  -->  00:01:23,380
And then, has if you properties, as well;
31

31

00:01:23,380  -->  00:01:25,710
content, author, and tags.
32

32

00:01:25,710  -->  00:01:27,930
The content property, once again,
33

33

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:31,210
gets a locator from QuoteLocators file in this case
34

34

00:01:31,210  -->  00:01:34,410
and then, finds an element inside
35

35

00:01:34,410  -->  00:01:38,090
this quote with that locator.
36

36

00:01:38,090  -->  00:01:39,730
Same for author and tags.
37

37

00:01:39,730  -->  00:01:41,830
So basically, what is gonna happen is
38

38

00:01:41,830  -->  00:01:44,900
here we're gonna get a bunch of QuoteParcers,
39

39

00:01:44,900  -->  00:01:47,050
one for each div,
40

40

00:01:47,050  -->  00:01:48,670
and then, each of these objects,
41

41

00:01:48,670  -->  00:01:50,630
we can use to get the content author
42

42

00:01:50,630  -->  00:01:52,303
and tags of that quote.
43

43

00:01:54,050  -->  00:01:56,900
Then, at the end, we print out the page quotes.
44

44

00:01:56,900  -->  00:01:59,160
So you can actually run this just by right-clicking
45

45

00:01:59,160  -->  00:02:01,580
and running app.py and it's gonna launch
46

46

00:02:01,580  -->  00:02:05,120
and it's gonna give us all these quotes that we've got.
47

47

00:02:05,120  -->  00:02:07,320
So that has actually launched the page.
48

48

00:02:07,320  -->  00:02:09,630
Well, not launched the page, but it's gone to the page
49

49

00:02:09,630  -->  00:02:13,290
and got the HTML content using the requests module.
50

50

00:02:13,290  -->  00:02:15,350
And once we can the HTML content,
51

51

00:02:15,350  -->  00:02:18,073
it returned it to us and we've performed our searches.
52

52

00:02:18,910  -->  00:02:19,940
There's a problem, of course,
53

53

00:02:19,940  -->  00:02:24,940
which is that if we use JavaScript, then this won't work.
54

54

00:02:25,740  -->  00:02:27,820
Or if we were to navigate any other page
55

55

00:02:27,820  -->  00:02:29,690
that uses JavaScript, this won't work.
56

56

00:02:29,690  -->  00:02:31,460
I'll show you an example.
57

57

00:02:31,460  -->  00:02:34,610
Here, I've launched another quotes.toscrape.com instance,
58

58

00:02:34,610  -->  00:02:38,440
but this one is /search.aspx.
59

59

00:02:38,440  -->  00:02:40,890
This is a slightly different page that uses JavaScript,
60

60

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:45,200
so we can use this to try out our JavaScript scrapping.
61

61

00:02:45,200  -->  00:02:48,010
Notice that, if we were to use the requests module
62

62

00:02:48,010  -->  00:02:50,850
to get the HTML content of this page,
63

63

00:02:50,850  -->  00:02:52,970
we would get what the inspector
64

64

00:02:52,970  -->  00:02:54,630
gives us at this point in time.
65

65

00:02:54,630  -->  00:02:58,080
So we've got a couple drop-downs
66

66

00:02:58,080  -->  00:03:00,190
and a search button that is now partially hidden.
67

67

00:03:00,190  -->  00:03:01,620
I will move that a bit.
68

68

00:03:01,620  -->  00:03:03,490
There you go, my search button down there.
69

69

00:03:03,490  -->  00:03:08,490
Now that has a problem because the author drop-down,
70

70

00:03:10,780  -->  00:03:14,110
that you can see, here has a bunch of authors inside it.
71

71

00:03:14,110  -->  00:03:15,550
You can see them if you click on it
72

72

00:03:15,550  -->  00:03:17,750
and you can see it in the HTML.
73

73

00:03:17,750  -->  00:03:21,570
But the tag drop-down does not have any elements.
74

74

00:03:21,570  -->  00:03:26,110
It is only when you select an author that the tags change
75

75

00:03:26,110  -->  00:03:28,690
for tags that are available for this author.
76

76

00:03:28,690  -->  00:03:31,850
So basically, you're gonna be able to only select tags
77

77

00:03:31,850  -->  00:03:35,510
that match that author or things that the author sent.
78

78

00:03:35,510  -->  00:03:38,523
Because that change happens after the page is loaded,
79

79

00:03:39,690  -->  00:03:41,990
it means that our requests code
80

80

00:03:41,990  -->  00:03:45,210
cannot deal with something like this for two reasons.
81

81

00:03:45,210  -->  00:03:48,880
The first one is that the content of the page
82

82

00:03:48,880  -->  00:03:50,860
is changing using JavaScript.
83

83

00:03:50,860  -->  00:03:53,080
That is the only way to change page content
84

84

00:03:53,080  -->  00:03:55,320
and when we load a page using requests,
85

85

00:03:55,320  -->  00:03:58,730
we cannot execute JavaScript, so that is a problem.
86

86

00:03:58,730  -->  00:04:01,750
The second problem is we cannot use the requests module
87

87

00:04:01,750  -->  00:04:05,790
to interact with a drop-down inside the page.
88

88

00:04:05,790  -->  00:04:08,670
The requests module allows us to get the HTML content,
89

89

00:04:08,670  -->  00:04:11,210
so we would be able to see there is a drop-down,
90

90

00:04:11,210  -->  00:04:14,750
but we won't be able to click on it and make a change,
91

91

00:04:14,750  -->  00:04:17,060
so the requests code is not going
92

92

00:04:17,060  -->  00:04:20,190
to allow us to use this page.
93

93

00:04:20,190  -->  00:04:21,440
Then, if you click the search button,
94

94

00:04:21,440  -->  00:04:23,690
a further JavaScript change happens.
95

95

00:04:23,690  -->  00:04:27,830
That shows you a quote matching the results.
96

96

00:04:27,830  -->  00:04:29,610
What we have to do is we have to actually
97

97

00:04:29,610  -->  00:04:32,900
launch the Chrome browser, navigate to this page,
98

98

00:04:32,900  -->  00:04:35,500
and modify these drop-downs ourselves,
99

99

00:04:35,500  -->  00:04:37,160
then click the search button
100

100

00:04:37,160  -->  00:04:39,493
and finally, extract the result.
101

101

00:04:41,070  -->  00:04:43,380
So that's what we're gonna be doing in this section.
102

102

00:04:43,380  -->  00:04:47,030
As I mentioned earlier on, we've seen the code as it is now
103

103

00:04:47,030  -->  00:04:49,870
and that code as it is now is just for this page here,
104

104

00:04:49,870  -->  00:04:51,510
which doesn't use JavaScript.
105

105

00:04:51,510  -->  00:04:52,790
For our new page,
106

106

00:04:52,790  -->  00:04:55,730
we're gonna be doing everything in this section,
107

107

00:04:55,730  -->  00:04:57,353
so I'll see you in the next video.
