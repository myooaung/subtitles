00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,290
<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:03,840
In this video, we're talking about extracting data
3

3

00:00:03,840  -->  00:00:07,270
from our tables using the Select statement.
4

4

00:00:08,970  -->  00:00:11,910
In this table, we've got four columns, id, name,
5

5

00:00:11,910  -->  00:00:15,270
and address, and four rows going from one to four.
6

6

00:00:16,320  -->  00:00:18,840
When we want to use a Select statement,
7

7

00:00:18,840  -->  00:00:21,690
we have to specify three important things.
8

8

00:00:21,690  -->  00:00:24,720
The first one that we want to actually select data
9

9

00:00:24,720  -->  00:00:27,510
and not insert it, for example.
10

10

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:30,710
The second one, we have to say what columns we want to get
11

11

00:00:30,710  -->  00:00:32,210
in our results,
12

12

00:00:32,210  -->  00:00:34,610
whether it's the id column, the name column,
13

13

00:00:34,610  -->  00:00:36,620
or the address column, or all of them,
14

14

00:00:36,620  -->  00:00:37,970
or any combination of them.
15

15

00:00:38,970  -->  00:00:41,170
And finally, we also have to say what table
16

16

00:00:41,170  -->  00:00:43,410
we want to get our data from.
17

17

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:45,360
In this case, let's get it from this table here
18

18

00:00:45,360  -->  00:00:47,190
which I'm going to call people.
19

19

00:00:49,090  -->  00:00:52,380
So this would be a Select statement.
20

20

00:00:52,380  -->  00:00:55,280
First the Select keyword,
21

21

00:00:55,280  -->  00:01:00,130
then a star which means all columns, then the keyword from,
22

22

00:01:00,130  -->  00:01:02,780
and then the table that we want to select from.
23

23

00:01:02,780  -->  00:01:06,620
So this means select all the columns from people.
24

24

00:01:06,620  -->  00:01:09,250
And it would give us a result set that looks exactly
25

25

00:01:09,250  -->  00:01:11,140
like the original table.
26

26

00:01:11,140  -->  00:01:13,550
As you can see, it looks the same, three columns,
27

27

00:01:13,550  -->  00:01:16,750
four rows, all the data is there.
28

28

00:01:16,750  -->  00:01:21,030
Notice how we've not had to specify what rows we want.
29

29

00:01:21,030  -->  00:01:24,050
We're only specifying that we want all the columns.
30

30

00:01:24,050  -->  00:01:25,620
That's what the star means.
31

31

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:28,490
By default, the Select statement will select
32

32

00:01:28,490  -->  00:01:29,620
all of the rows.
33

33

00:01:29,620  -->  00:01:32,070
So, all of the data in your table.
34

34

00:01:32,070  -->  00:01:33,930
And we are going to learn how to limit that,
35

35

00:01:33,930  -->  00:01:36,700
how to get only some rows very soon,
36

36

00:01:36,700  -->  00:01:38,100
in a couple of video's time.
37

37

00:01:38,990  -->  00:01:41,160
Let's have a look at another example where we won't select
38

38

00:01:41,160  -->  00:01:43,600
all of the columns, we'll just select a couple of them.
39

39

00:01:43,600  -->  00:01:45,300
And, this would be this.
40

40

00:01:45,300  -->  00:01:48,690
Select name, address from people.
41

41

00:01:48,690  -->  00:01:52,190
And that's of course, going to give us two columns,
42

42

00:01:52,190  -->  00:01:53,870
name and the address.
43

43

00:01:53,870  -->  00:01:57,280
Notice how the id column is not present in our result set
44

44

00:01:57,280  -->  00:02:00,120
because we've not requested it with the Select statement.
45

45

00:02:01,720  -->  00:02:04,270
Of course, we could select id and name if we wanted
46

46

00:02:04,270  -->  00:02:06,910
for example, and that would give us again, two columns,
47

47

00:02:06,910  -->  00:02:09,810
id and name and it wouldn't give us back the address.
48

48

00:02:09,810  -->  00:02:12,410
Totally fine, you can do this if you want.
49

49

00:02:12,410  -->  00:02:14,550
Notice how the general formula here,
50

50

00:02:14,550  -->  00:02:17,400
the structure or the syntax of the statement
51

51

00:02:17,400  -->  00:02:19,680
is first of all, Select.
52

52

00:02:19,680  -->  00:02:22,540
Then, the columns you want, whether it's a star
53

53

00:02:22,540  -->  00:02:25,170
or whether it's a comma separated column names.
54

54

00:02:25,170  -->  00:02:27,810
Then the keyword from, and finally, the table.
55

55

00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:31,210
You can also merge them together so you can
56

56

00:02:31,210  -->  00:02:34,480
select id, star if you want.
57

57

00:02:34,480  -->  00:02:37,280
But this is a pretty silly thing to do in my opinion.
58

58

00:02:37,280  -->  00:02:39,890
I'm just telling you this because you can do this.
59

59

00:02:39,890  -->  00:02:42,590
But again, you get double the id columns,
60

60

00:02:42,590  -->  00:02:45,090
which is not very useful in most scenarios,
61

61

00:02:45,090  -->  00:02:46,310
probably any scenario.
62

62

00:02:47,200  -->  00:02:48,920
But none the less, it's something you can do.
63

63

00:02:48,920  -->  00:02:51,520
Again, the star just gets replaced by
64

64

00:02:51,520  -->  00:02:54,090
all of the column names in your table.
65

65

00:02:54,090  -->  00:02:56,900
So of course, you can use a star as well as
66

66

00:02:56,900  -->  00:02:58,060
other column names if you want.
67

67

00:02:58,060  -->  00:02:59,460
And this is gonna come in handy.
68

68

00:02:59,460  -->  00:03:00,560
The fact that we can do this
69

69

00:03:00,560  -->  00:03:02,370
is gonna come in handy later on.
70

70

00:03:02,370  -->  00:03:05,100
Doing this with single table is not so handy.
71

71

00:03:06,590  -->  00:03:08,030
Okay, that's it for this video.
72

72

00:03:08,030  -->  00:03:09,480
I'll see you in the next one.
