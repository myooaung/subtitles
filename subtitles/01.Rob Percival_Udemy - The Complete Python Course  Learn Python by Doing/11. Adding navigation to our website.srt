00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:01,600
<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,600  -->  00:00:04,270
Something that really bugs me about our application
3

3

00:00:04,270  -->  00:00:07,000
is that once you're in a post,
4

4

00:00:07,000  -->  00:00:08,660
you can't go back to the homepage
5

5

00:00:08,660  -->  00:00:10,900
unless you press the back button.
6

6

00:00:10,900  -->  00:00:14,780
Similarly, you can't really easily create a new post
7

7

00:00:14,780  -->  00:00:16,980
unless you type the URL yourself,
8

8

00:00:16,980  -->  00:00:19,700
you know, slash post slash create,
9

9

00:00:19,700  -->  00:00:20,533
and even when you're here,
10

10

00:00:20,533  -->  00:00:22,950
you can't go back to the homepage either.
11

11

00:00:22,950  -->  00:00:25,930
So it's always a good idea to add some proper navigation
12

12

00:00:25,930  -->  00:00:28,470
to your pages just so your users and yourself
13

13

00:00:28,470  -->  00:00:30,700
can go through them a bit easier.
14

14

00:00:30,700  -->  00:00:33,533
Let's go over to PyCharm and do this just now.
15

15

00:00:34,710  -->  00:00:37,840
I'm gonna stop the app first of all and minimise that,
16

16

00:00:37,840  -->  00:00:39,690
and in order to add the links,
17

17

00:00:39,690  -->  00:00:42,070
all I have to do is think
18

18

00:00:42,070  -->  00:00:43,570
about where we wanna put them.
19

19

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:48,030
Personally, I think that every page should have a link
20

20

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:49,260
to the homepage.
21

21

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:50,930
So I'm gonna add the link to the homepage
22

22

00:00:50,930  -->  00:00:52,613
inside based on HTML.
23

23

00:00:53,760  -->  00:00:56,410
This block content will be replaced
24

24

00:00:56,410  -->  00:00:59,410
by the child's content every page.
25

25

00:00:59,410  -->  00:01:01,050
So if you put something in here,
26

26

00:01:01,050  -->  00:01:03,720
it won't be present in any of the pages
27

27

00:01:03,720  -->  00:01:06,900
just because when you have home.jinja2, for example,
28

28

00:01:06,900  -->  00:01:08,753
this is going to replace this.
29

29

00:01:08,753  -->  00:01:11,060
It's not going to add to it.
30

30

00:01:11,060  -->  00:01:12,980
So if you wanna put something in every page,
31

31

00:01:12,980  -->  00:01:14,930
put it outside of the block of content.
32

32

00:01:15,860  -->  00:01:20,000
What we're gonna do here is add a URL to the homepage.
33

33

00:01:20,000  -->  00:01:21,530
And I think you can do this.
34

34

00:01:21,530  -->  00:01:24,930
Add a new anchor tag, add the HREF
35

35

00:01:24,930  -->  00:01:28,940
and make it point to the URL for of the homepage.
36

36

00:01:28,940  -->  00:01:29,773
Try that out.
37

37

00:01:29,773  -->  00:01:31,283
Pause the video and give it a go.
38

38

00:01:32,450  -->  00:01:33,710
I'm sure you managed.
39

39

00:01:33,710  -->  00:01:35,720
All that you do is create a new A sign,
40

40

00:01:35,720  -->  00:01:40,720
give it a new HREF of URL for and the homepage in here.
41

41

00:01:43,800  -->  00:01:47,733
Then close the tag and type in home, for example.
42

42

00:01:48,970  -->  00:01:52,440
Notice how the HREF needs these quotation marks around it
43

43

00:01:52,440  -->  00:01:54,900
because the HREF contents have to be
44

44

00:01:54,900  -->  00:01:56,743
inside quotation marks for HTML.
45

45

00:01:57,690  -->  00:02:02,030
This here will be replaced by the URL or the endpoint
46

46

00:02:02,030  -->  00:02:04,883
of your home function, this one.
47

47

00:02:05,980  -->  00:02:09,010
If we run the app now and we go back to Chrome
48

48

00:02:09,010  -->  00:02:11,880
and we refresh, we can see that we've lost the blog post,
49

49

00:02:11,880  -->  00:02:14,750
first of all, but we have this Home there.
50

50

00:02:14,750  -->  00:02:17,883
If we go into a specific post, that Home is still there.
51

51

00:02:19,170  -->  00:02:20,670
Something that isn't there, though,
52

52

00:02:20,670  -->  00:02:23,820
is the ability to create a new post.
53

53

00:02:23,820  -->  00:02:26,070
I think that creating a new post should only be
54

54

00:02:26,070  -->  00:02:27,110
in the homepage.
55

55

00:02:27,110  -->  00:02:29,040
So let's stop our app, minimise that
56

56

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:30,840
and go over to the homepage,
57

57

00:02:30,840  -->  00:02:33,940
and down below, add another link.
58

58

00:02:33,940  -->  00:02:36,463
Once again, I think you can do this.
59

59

00:02:37,940  -->  00:02:39,120
Hopefully, you got that.
60

60

00:02:39,120  -->  00:02:40,380
In order to create a new post,
61

61

00:02:40,380  -->  00:02:42,910
all we have to do is again the same.
62

62

00:02:42,910  -->  00:02:45,610
So create an A tag, which an anchor tag.
63

63

00:02:45,610  -->  00:02:47,533
In the HREF, type URL for,
64

64

00:02:48,480  -->  00:02:51,000
and then here, the name of the function
65

65

00:02:51,000  -->  00:02:56,000
that will give you your create.jinja2.
66

66

00:02:56,430  -->  00:02:58,730
That's the create function, so let's go there.
67

67

00:02:59,910  -->  00:03:01,260
It doesn't need any arguments.
68

68

00:03:01,260  -->  00:03:03,560
Any arguments could go here after a comma,
69

69

00:03:03,560  -->  00:03:05,660
but it doesn't need any because it doesn't
70

70

00:03:06,900  -->  00:03:08,673
take any parameters.
71

71

00:03:09,930  -->  00:03:11,500
That's it.
72

72

00:03:11,500  -->  00:03:12,670
Pressed something too many times there,
73

73

00:03:12,670  -->  00:03:15,090
and then type create post,
74

74

00:03:15,090  -->  00:03:17,890
create new post, for example, close the A tag,
75

75

00:03:17,890  -->  00:03:19,630
and that's it.
76

76

00:03:19,630  -->  00:03:21,500
Again, we can run our app.
77

77

00:03:21,500  -->  00:03:23,880
Go over here, refresh,
78

78

00:03:23,880  -->  00:03:26,900
and now we can see this Create new post thing there.
79

79

00:03:26,900  -->  00:03:29,400
So now we've got a bit of a nicer navigation there
80

80

00:03:29,400  -->  00:03:30,270
that we can navigate our page
81

81

00:03:30,270  -->  00:03:33,223
without having to type out the URLs ourselves.
82

82

00:03:35,280  -->  00:03:38,590
I want you to realise these are just building blocks.
83

83

00:03:38,590  -->  00:03:40,160
You know, you've got your links,
84

84

00:03:40,160  -->  00:03:42,490
you've got your P tags, your lists
85

85

00:03:42,490  -->  00:03:46,150
and a few things in Flask like URL for,
86

86

00:03:46,150  -->  00:03:48,100
redirect, render templates,
87

87

00:03:48,100  -->  00:03:50,490
the ability to show information,
88

88

00:03:50,490  -->  00:03:52,730
and there are countless things you can do
89

89

00:03:52,730  -->  00:03:54,620
with this knowledge already.
90

90

00:03:54,620  -->  00:03:57,680
Granted, the website could look a bit nicer.
91

91

00:03:57,680  -->  00:04:00,100
You wanna look at CSS for that.
92

92

00:04:00,100  -->  00:04:01,530
This is not the course for that
93

93

00:04:01,530  -->  00:04:03,680
because this is not a web course,
94

94

00:04:03,680  -->  00:04:06,650
but if you want to look at CSS for styling the page,
95

95

00:04:06,650  -->  00:04:09,160
make it look a bit nicer, add some colour,
96

96

00:04:09,160  -->  00:04:12,530
different font sizes, maybe not put everything just
97

97

00:04:12,530  -->  00:04:13,610
on the left of the page,
98

98

00:04:13,610  -->  00:04:15,110
maybe put things centred in the middle
99

99

00:04:15,110  -->  00:04:16,490
or something like that.
100

100

00:04:16,490  -->  00:04:17,410
You can learn about that,
101

101

00:04:17,410  -->  00:04:19,910
and it's actually fairly straightforward
102

102

00:04:19,910  -->  00:04:23,650
to do some simple but nice looking website.
103

103

00:04:23,650  -->  00:04:27,040
And now with Python, you can do a lotta stuff.
104

104

00:04:27,040  -->  00:04:29,670
You know Python pretty well by now.
105

105

00:04:29,670  -->  00:04:31,860
You can store things in a database
106

106

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:33,920
and do countless other things
107

107

00:04:33,920  -->  00:04:36,140
in terms of giving the use and information
108

108

00:04:36,140  -->  00:04:38,250
and calculating things.
109

109

00:04:38,250  -->  00:04:41,109
Hopefully, this opens new doors for you
110

110

00:04:41,109  -->  00:04:43,870
in terms of communicating with your users.
111

111

00:04:43,870  -->  00:04:45,540
I hope you've enjoyed this section,
112

112

00:04:45,540  -->  00:04:48,730
and I've been glad to guide you through Flask development,
113

113

00:04:48,730  -->  00:04:50,480
and I'll see you in the next video.
