<v Jose>Hi guys, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.020  -->  00:00:04.600
In this video, we're going to be adding a menu bar
3

3

00:00:04.600  -->  00:00:05.760
to our application,
4

4

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:09.050
so that we can create new files using it.
5

5

00:00:09.050  -->  00:00:10.480
Let's get started!
6

6

00:00:10.480  -->  00:00:14.020
First of all, we are going to add a couple of things here
7

7

00:00:14.020  -->  00:00:15.860
to our root.
8

8

00:00:15.860  -->  00:00:18.540
A title, which we don't need for a menu,
9

9

00:00:18.540  -->  00:00:19.940
but nonetheless, it looks good.
10

10

00:00:19.940  -->  00:00:22.840
And then we're going to add an option,
11

11

00:00:22.840  -->  00:00:26.500
which is a slightly confusing part of TkInter,
12

12

00:00:26.500  -->  00:00:29.060
but essentially through these options,
13

13

00:00:29.060  -->  00:00:33.050
you can change the behaviour of certain elements
14

14

00:00:33.050  -->  00:00:35.980
and certain things in different operating systems.
15

15

00:00:35.980  -->  00:00:38.140
Really, you have to read the documentation
16

16

00:00:38.140  -->  00:00:41.580
for each option in order to understand what they do,
17

17

00:00:41.580  -->  00:00:44.820
but when you add an option, then TkInter
18

18

00:00:44.820  -->  00:00:48.841
will communicate that to TK and TCL,
19

19

00:00:48.841  -->  00:00:51.470
and the UI will behave differently.
20

20

00:00:51.470  -->  00:00:56.270
In this case, we're going to add a tearOff of False.
21

21

00:00:56.270  -->  00:00:59.050
And what that means is, in some operating systems,
22

22

00:00:59.050  -->  00:01:02.900
the menus we'll be adding can be torn off
23

23

00:01:02.900  -->  00:01:07.380
from the interface and placed elsewhere in your screen.
24

24

00:01:07.380  -->  00:01:10.340
And we want to prevent that, so the menus that we add
25

25

00:01:10.340  -->  00:01:12.830
to our application, you won't be able to like
26

26

00:01:12.830  -->  00:01:14.930
separate from the application window.
27

27

00:01:14.930  -->  00:01:16.430
That's what this option means.
28

28

00:01:17.610  -->  00:01:21.780
Now underneath main here, we're going to add a menu bar.
29

29

00:01:21.780  -->  00:01:24.840
And that is just a tk.Menu.
30

30

00:01:24.840  -->  00:01:27.150
It's not a ttk menu,
31

31

00:01:27.150  -->  00:01:29.530
because it's not really a themable widget,
32

32

00:01:29.530  -->  00:01:30.780
it's just a menu bar.
33

33

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:33.110
And again, this menu bar will be different
34

34

00:01:33.110  -->  00:01:35.530
in each operating system, it will look different.
35

35

00:01:35.530  -->  00:01:37.910
For example, in Mac, it will show up here
36

36

00:01:37.910  -->  00:01:39.530
on the top of the screen.
37

37

00:01:39.530  -->  00:01:42.820
In Windows, it'll show up as like File, and so on,
38

38

00:01:42.820  -->  00:01:46.440
and in Linux, it'll differ depending on the distribution.
39

39

00:01:46.440  -->  00:01:49.040
Then we're going to say root.config(menu = menubar).
40

40

00:01:51.840  -->  00:01:53.900
And let's remove those spaces there.
41

41

00:01:53.900  -->  00:01:56.620
And what this means is we have created a menu bar,
42

42

00:01:56.620  -->  00:01:59.640
which is, you know, PyCharm, File, Edit, View,
43

43

00:01:59.640  -->  00:02:01.980
all of these things are one menu bar.
44

44

00:02:01.980  -->  00:02:04.880
Now we have to add a particular cascade,
45

45

00:02:04.880  -->  00:02:07.160
or a particular drop-down of elements.
46

46

00:02:07.160  -->  00:02:09.000
So we're going to add one called File.
47

47

00:02:09.000  -->  00:02:12.660
So we'll say file_menu is another tk.menu,
48

48

00:02:12.660  -->  00:02:16.322
but now the parent is the menubar,
49

49

00:02:16.322  -->  00:02:18.587
and we'll say menubar.add_cascade
50

50

00:02:20.010  -->  00:02:21.980
and we'll pass in the file_menu,
51

51

00:02:21.980  -->  00:02:24.810
and we'll pass in a label called "File."
52

52

00:02:24.810  -->  00:02:28.100
And what that does is, it creates a file element
53

53

00:02:28.100  -->  00:02:30.550
inside of the menu, and tells the menubar,
54

54

00:02:30.550  -->  00:02:33.850
which is our main menu, to add it as a drop-down
55

55

00:02:33.850  -->  00:02:35.380
that you can click.
56

56

00:02:35.380  -->  00:02:39.060
Then, in the file_menu, we're going to add a command,
57

57

00:02:39.060  -->  00:02:41.870
not a cascade, and the command
58

58

00:02:41.870  -->  00:02:44.020
is gonna have a label of "New",
59

59

00:02:44.020  -->  00:02:47.530
and the command is going to be create_file.
60

60

00:02:47.530  -->  00:02:49.940
Make sure to not call the create_file function there,
61

61

00:02:49.940  -->  00:02:52.270
just like we had with buttons earlier on,
62

62

00:02:52.270  -->  00:02:55.380
this command is just a callable function.
63

63

00:02:55.380  -->  00:02:57.540
Oh, by the way, we do have to specify that this
64

64

00:02:57.540  -->  00:03:01.050
is a menu item that we want to add to the menu bar,
65

65

00:03:01.050  -->  00:03:02.870
and not an element that we want to add
66

66

00:03:02.870  -->  00:03:05.950
to an already existing cascade inside an item.
67

67

00:03:05.950  -->  00:03:09.173
Just make sure to pass in the named argument there.
68

68

00:03:10.480  -->  00:03:12.420
Running the app now gives you the same thing
69

69

00:03:12.420  -->  00:03:14.420
that we had before, but now you can see at the top,
70

70

00:03:14.420  -->  00:03:17.230
we've got a File menu that we didn't have before,
71

71

00:03:17.230  -->  00:03:19.120
and then here we have New.
72

72

00:03:19.120  -->  00:03:23.425
Whenever we click New, we run the create_file function,
73

73

00:03:23.425  -->  00:03:26.120
which again creates a text area,
74

74

00:03:26.120  -->  00:03:29.680
makes sure that it fills everything inside the notebook,
75

75

00:03:29.680  -->  00:03:32.860
adds it to the notebook itself, which creates the new tab,
76

76

00:03:32.860  -->  00:03:35.380
and then selects it, which places focus
77

77

00:03:35.380  -->  00:03:37.600
on the newly created element.
78

78

00:03:37.600  -->  00:03:40.470
Again, if we type here, "Hello world,"
79

79

00:03:40.470  -->  00:03:42.470
and then we hit a new one,
80

80

00:03:42.470  -->  00:03:43.880
this one is still here in the middle,
81

81

00:03:43.880  -->  00:03:47.380
this one is now the end, and it's the one that's selected.
82

82

00:03:47.380  -->  00:03:51.070
All right, this is how you create menus in TkInter.
83

83

00:03:51.070  -->  00:03:53.160
First of all, you create a menu bar,
84

84

00:03:53.160  -->  00:03:55.930
which is the top level that contains
85

85

00:03:55.930  -->  00:03:58.640
all of the different menu cascades,
86

86

00:03:58.640  -->  00:04:00.840
and then you create different cascades,
87

87

00:04:00.840  -->  00:04:03.533
one for each group of actions.
88

88

00:04:04.410  -->  00:04:05.490
That's everything for this video.
89

89

00:04:05.490  -->  00:04:06.570
Thank you for joining me.
90

90

00:04:06.570  -->  00:04:08.103
I'll see you in the next one!
