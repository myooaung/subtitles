<v Narrator>Hi and welcome back,</v>
2

2

00:00:01,430  -->  00:00:04,940
let's review our quotes project in this video.
3

3

00:00:06,400  -->  00:00:08,680
Instead of starting from the quote parser
4

4

00:00:08,680  -->  00:00:11,570
let's start from the top of the project now.
5

5

00:00:11,570  -->  00:00:14,890
The first thing we do, is aside from importing things
6

6

00:00:14,890  -->  00:00:16,810
we get the page content,
7

7

00:00:16,810  -->  00:00:19,010
this is the entire HTML content
8

8

00:00:19,010  -->  00:00:20,150
of the entire QuotesPage
9

9

00:00:22,150  -->  00:00:26,520
We then give that content to our QuotesPage constructor,
10

10

00:00:26,520  -->  00:00:28,870
the in its method, so let's go over there,
11

11

00:00:30,140  -->  00:00:34,680
that then initialises this BeautifulSoup object,
12

12

00:00:34,680  -->  00:00:36,240
using the HTML parser
13

13

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:39,180
so this lets us search within this page.
14

14

00:00:40,930  -->  00:00:45,460
The quotes property of that finds a locator
15

15

00:00:45,460  -->  00:00:47,740
which is this QuotesPageLocators dot Quote
16

16

00:00:48,700  -->  00:00:53,700
which is just div dot quote, okay.
17

17

00:00:55,400  -->  00:00:58,700
Then it selects all the instances
18

18

00:00:58,700  -->  00:01:02,700
of that selector so every div that has a quote class
19

19

00:01:02,700  -->  00:01:04,910
will be selected by this,
20

20

00:01:04,910  -->  00:01:07,710
and if we go back to Chrome we can see
21

21

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:10,000
that the divs that have a class quote
22

22

00:01:10,900  -->  00:01:13,820
are all the individual quotes.
23

23

00:01:16,480  -->  00:01:19,400
And it's gonna return a QuoteParser
24

24

00:01:19,400  -->  00:01:21,920
given each of those tags
25

25

00:01:22,940  -->  00:01:25,770
for e in the tags that we found.
26

26

00:01:25,770  -->  00:01:27,660
Remember the tags that we found there
27

27

00:01:27,660  -->  00:01:31,300
are not strings, they are BeautifulSoup tags,
28

28

00:01:32,200  -->  00:01:34,440
so if we go into the quote parser,
29

29

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:37,290
this parent will be a BeautifulSoup tag
30

30

00:01:37,290  -->  00:01:39,080
which is that div.
31

31

00:01:40,620  -->  00:01:43,470
In BeautifulSoup, everything is a tag,
32

32

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:46,000
so when you load the entire HTML page,
33

33

00:01:46,000  -->  00:01:47,720
that's a tag that you can search on,
34

34

00:01:47,720  -->  00:01:50,040
that's an HTML tag.
35

35

00:01:50,040  -->  00:01:51,490
When you load one of these parents
36

36

00:01:51,490  -->  00:01:52,890
when you find one of these divs,
37

37

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:54,510
that's just another tag, in this case,
38

38

00:01:54,510  -->  00:01:58,260
it's a div tag that you can search on as well.
39

39

00:01:58,260  -->  00:02:01,430
So now this quote parser has one of these divs
40

40

00:02:02,490  -->  00:02:06,720
and in their properties here we are searching
41

41

00:02:06,720  -->  00:02:10,300
under this parent only and we're searching for
42

42

00:02:10,300  -->  00:02:14,700
the span dot text, the small dot author,
43

43

00:02:14,700  -->  00:02:16,330
and the different tags.
44

44

00:02:17,340  -->  00:02:20,680
In addition, this quote parser also has a repr method
45

45

00:02:20,680  -->  00:02:22,850
that allows us to print it out nicely,
46

46

00:02:22,850  -->  00:02:24,730
but of course we can choose to print out
47

47

00:02:24,730  -->  00:02:27,080
specific properties if we choose.
48

48

00:02:29,720  -->  00:02:32,200
So hopefully this makes sense,
49

49

00:02:32,200  -->  00:02:34,080
the way this app is structured
50

50

00:02:34,080  -->  00:02:37,340
is to separate concerns,
51

51

00:02:37,340  -->  00:02:41,040
separate the locators away from your logic,
52

52

00:02:41,040  -->  00:02:45,750
and also separate the page from its components.
53

53

00:02:45,750  -->  00:02:48,280
In this case, we're separating the quotes page
54

54

00:02:48,280  -->  00:02:50,240
from an individual quote.
55

55

00:02:50,240  -->  00:02:52,530
Even though they're both sort of similar,
56

56

00:02:52,530  -->  00:02:54,550
I don't like calling a quote a page
57

57

00:02:54,550  -->  00:02:57,980
because really it's a component within a page.
58

58

00:02:57,980  -->  00:03:00,840
If you separate your scrapers in this way,
59

59

00:03:00,840  -->  00:03:02,960
I am confident you're going to be able
60

60

00:03:02,960  -->  00:03:07,360
to do anything you want with your scraping project.
61

61

00:03:07,360  -->  00:03:08,660
Just because doing this is going
62

62

00:03:08,660  -->  00:03:09,830
to make them so much simpler
63

63

00:03:09,830  -->  00:03:12,690
to work with and as soon as you want to add a new page,
64

64

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:14,934
all you have to do is add a new file here
65

65

00:03:14,934  -->  00:03:17,270
and a new set of locators.
66

66

00:03:17,270  -->  00:03:19,230
If your locators change for any page,
67

67

00:03:19,230  -->  00:03:21,080
you just go there and modify them,
68

68

00:03:21,080  -->  00:03:24,070
and if you want to add a new component that you want
69

69

00:03:24,070  -->  00:03:26,280
to get data out of from a page,
70

70

00:03:26,280  -->  00:03:27,940
just have a new parser for it.
71

71

00:03:29,660  -->  00:03:31,630
Now we're going to build another project as well
72

72

00:03:31,630  -->  00:03:34,400
in this section, looking at scraping books
73

73

00:03:34,400  -->  00:03:38,010
and that's gonna be a larger project with a bit more sort
74

74

00:03:38,010  -->  00:03:41,440
of logging and changing pages and things like that
75

75

00:03:41,440  -->  00:03:43,080
so it's gonna be a bit longer,
76

76

00:03:43,080  -->  00:03:46,350
so don't worry too much if not everything is crystal clear,
77

77

00:03:46,350  -->  00:03:47,960
we're gonna do this again
78

78

00:03:47,960  -->  00:03:51,770
and we're gonna do more in the books project.
79

79

00:03:51,770  -->  00:03:53,720
So I'll see you in the very next video.
