<v Male Narrator>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,250  -->  00:00:02,450
In this video, we're going to look at
3

3

00:00:02,450  -->  00:00:06,370
separating locators into classes.
4

4

00:00:06,370  -->  00:00:10,280
So, what we're gonna do is not hard code
5

5

00:00:10,280  -->  00:00:13,280
these locators into the class ParsedItem.
6

6

00:00:14,870  -->  00:00:19,460
The ParsedItem is the item that represents
7

7

00:00:19,460  -->  00:00:22,550
the data that is in the html.
8

8

00:00:22,550  -->  00:00:27,000
It shouldn't represent, also, how to get that data.
9

9

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:30,540
So, how to get that data should be in a different place.
10

10

00:00:30,540  -->  00:00:31,620
So we're going to create a new class,
11

11

00:00:31,620  -->  00:00:34,440
which I'm gonna call ParsedItemLocators.
12

12

00:00:38,466  -->  00:00:40,310
And I've got it placed in a docstring here
13

13

00:00:40,310  -->  00:00:41,520
I have for my notes.
14

14

00:00:41,520  -->  00:00:43,600
Just, just so it's a bit easier for you.
15

15

00:00:43,600  -->  00:00:45,810
Look at this item in the html page.
16

16

00:00:45,810  -->  00:00:47,910
This allows us to easily see what our code
17

17

00:00:47,910  -->  00:00:50,500
would be looking at, as well as change it quickly
18

18

00:00:50,500  -->  00:00:52,920
if we notice it is now different.
19

19

00:00:52,920  -->  00:00:54,580
So, this may not make much sense until
20

20

00:00:54,580  -->  00:00:55,620
I start writing here.
21

21

00:00:55,620  -->  00:00:59,730
Name Locator is going to be article of product
22

22

00:00:59,730  -->  00:01:00,730
pod h3 a.
23

23

00:01:02,450  -->  00:01:05,250
Okay, that's the locator we used down here for the name.
24

24

00:01:06,250  -->  00:01:08,380
What if this changes?
25

25

00:01:08,380  -->  00:01:10,970
The website changes and when we get the html back,
26

26

00:01:10,970  -->  00:01:12,170
it's slightly different?
27

27

00:01:13,821  -->  00:01:17,080
The ParsedItem shouldn't care
28

28

00:01:17,080  -->  00:01:20,260
because the ParsedItem represents the item itself
29

29

00:01:20,260  -->  00:01:22,610
and not how to get the data from it.
30

30

00:01:23,770  -->  00:01:27,240
So, this is a small, but important distinction.
31

31

00:01:27,240  -->  00:01:30,600
And it all about how you think of your programme,
32

32

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:32,840
how your program's different parts interact
33

33

00:01:32,840  -->  00:01:34,180
with one another.
34

34

00:01:34,180  -->  00:01:37,100
Separating the how and the what
35

35

00:01:37,100  -->  00:01:39,420
is going to make your programmes much simpler.
36

36

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:41,490
And also simpler to work with.
37

37

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:43,130
So, instead of putting a string here,
38

38

00:01:43,130  -->  00:01:45,730
we're gonna, and do ParsedItemLocators.NAME LOCATOR.
39

39

00:01:47,900  -->  00:01:50,990
These would potentially and probably be in different files
40

40

00:01:50,990  -->  00:01:51,840
altogether.
41

41

00:01:51,840  -->  00:01:53,380
In this case, I'm leaving them in one file
42

42

00:01:53,380  -->  00:01:55,290
just for simplicity, but they would likely
43

43

00:01:55,290  -->  00:01:58,280
be in two different files, one for the locators
44

44

00:01:58,280  -->  00:01:59,400
and one for the item.
45

45

00:02:01,000  -->  00:02:04,100
The good thing is that as long as the website
46

46

00:02:04,100  -->  00:02:06,010
doesn't change massively, for example,
47

47

00:02:06,010  -->  00:02:07,440
if they just remove this class
48

48

00:02:07,440  -->  00:02:08,670
and maybe add a different class
49

49

00:02:08,670  -->  00:02:10,940
or something like that, you don't have to go
50

50

00:02:10,940  -->  00:02:13,720
and look at the item and read through all this code.
51

51

00:02:13,720  -->  00:02:16,440
No, all you have to do is go to the site,
52

52

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:21,440
find out the new html locator and change it.
53

53

00:02:21,700  -->  00:02:23,770
So, it's very straight forward.
54

54

00:02:23,770  -->  00:02:25,520
So, we're gonna do that for the others,
55

55

00:02:25,520  -->  00:02:27,600
and, once again, I'm gonna copy them
56

56

00:02:27,600  -->  00:02:28,920
just to save you some time.
57

57

00:02:28,920  -->  00:02:31,300
I think you're getting much better at programming
58

58

00:02:31,300  -->  00:02:32,690
by this stage of the course,
59

59

00:02:32,690  -->  00:02:35,130
so I think I'm allowed to now copy some code
60

60

00:02:35,130  -->  00:02:36,820
from my notes and save you some time.
61

61

00:02:36,820  -->  00:02:39,510
So, there we have our link, price, and rating locator
62

62

00:02:39,510  -->  00:02:41,840
and then we're just gonna replace them down here.
63

63

00:02:41,840  -->  00:02:46,550
And so this is the ParsedItemLocators.LINK LOCATOR.
64

64

00:02:48,420  -->  00:02:51,160
ParsedItemLocators.PRICE LOCATOR.
65

65

00:02:52,540  -->  00:02:57,540
And also, the ParsedItemLocators.RATING LOCATOR.
66

66

00:02:59,100  -->  00:03:04,100
Now, there are a couple of things in these methods here,
67

67

00:03:05,080  -->  00:03:09,180
like this pattern or this class that we're filtering out,
68

68

00:03:09,180  -->  00:03:12,020
that could possible be in another place,
69

69

00:03:12,020  -->  00:03:14,600
so that the item doesn't really care at all
70

70

00:03:14,600  -->  00:03:15,790
of where it's coming from.
71

71

00:03:15,790  -->  00:03:17,910
But, sometimes that's just not feasible
72

72

00:03:17,910  -->  00:03:19,940
and other times it's just too complicated
73

73

00:03:19,940  -->  00:03:23,130
in order to be worth the effort.
74

74

00:03:23,130  -->  00:03:25,430
So, by all means, try to do that if you want,
75

75

00:03:25,430  -->  00:03:26,680
but I would leave it like this
76

76

00:03:26,680  -->  00:03:28,530
and I think this is a great way
77

77

00:03:28,530  -->  00:03:32,290
of separating out where the item is on the page
78

78

00:03:32,290  -->  00:03:34,710
from how you're going to extract the data
79

79

00:03:34,710  -->  00:03:37,780
and, sort of, what the item represents.
80

80

00:03:37,780  -->  00:03:39,450
So, hopefully this makes a bit of sense.
81

81

00:03:39,450  -->  00:03:42,880
This way of separating concerns
82

82

00:03:42,880  -->  00:03:45,070
is something that we do all the time
83

83

00:03:45,070  -->  00:03:46,750
and this is how we structure our tests
84

84

00:03:46,750  -->  00:03:48,730
at work, professionally.
85

85

00:03:48,730  -->  00:03:51,350
And so, it's definitely a great way to go about it
86

86

00:03:51,350  -->  00:03:54,070
and it's gonna simplify your code greatly.
87

87

00:03:54,070  -->  00:03:56,490
I hope this makes sense and I'll see you on the next video,
88

88

00:03:56,490  -->  00:03:59,820
where we're going to start looking at retrieving the page
89

89

00:03:59,820  -->  00:04:01,700
using another library.
90

90

00:04:01,700  -->  00:04:02,650
I'll see you there.
