00:00:00,170  -->  00:00:01,440
<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:02,840
In this video, I wanted to show you
3

3

00:00:02,840  -->  00:00:05,170
a couple of commands that you can run
4

4

00:00:05,170  -->  00:00:08,500
in order to navigate your computer using the terminal.
5

5

00:00:08,500  -->  00:00:09,750
These can be quite handy.
6

6

00:00:10,790  -->  00:00:12,000
The commands I'm going to show you
7

7

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:15,420
are only going to work on macOS10 and on Linux,
8

8

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:18,710
but I'm going to give you the windows equivalents as well.
9

9

00:00:20,230  -->  00:00:22,740
So when you are on
10

10

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:24,600
macOS10 or Linux,
11

11

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:27,580
you can type P-W-D
12

12

00:00:27,580  -->  00:00:30,930
and that tells your the folder you're currently in.
13

13

00:00:31,800  -->  00:00:34,720
So in my case I am in /users/jslvtr.
14

14

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:40,100
On windows, this will be dir for directory.
15

15

00:00:42,200  -->  00:00:44,630
If you want to move to a different folder,
16

16

00:00:44,630  -->  00:00:48,410
you can do cd for change directory,
17

17

00:00:48,410  -->  00:00:51,450
and then you can type whatever folder you want.
18

18

00:00:51,450  -->  00:00:55,390
So for example, if you wanted to go to your desktop,
19

19

00:00:55,390  -->  00:00:57,740
you could type desktop.
20

20

00:00:57,740  -->  00:01:00,740
Notice how now I am in my desktop here
21

21

00:01:00,740  -->  00:01:05,010
and if I type pwd, I am now moved to my desktop.
22

22

00:01:05,900  -->  00:01:10,740
On windows, this will be chdir for change directory.
23

23

00:01:13,730  -->  00:01:17,180
Now of course the desktop folder that we've just moved into,
24

24

00:01:18,060  -->  00:01:22,370
is inside users/jsslvtr.
25

25

00:01:22,370  -->  00:01:25,500
Otherwise, it would tell us folder not found.
26

26

00:01:25,500  -->  00:01:27,090
For example I'm now in my desktop.
27

27

00:01:27,090  -->  00:01:30,080
If I try to do cd, into an asdf folder,
28

28

00:01:30,080  -->  00:01:32,430
it says no such file or directory.
29

29

00:01:32,430  -->  00:01:33,740
So you have to make sure that the folder
30

30

00:01:33,740  -->  00:01:35,980
you want to move into is inside
31

31

00:01:35,980  -->  00:01:37,530
the folder you're currently in.
32

32

00:01:38,430  -->  00:01:42,900
However you can also choose to move to a particular folder
33

33

00:01:42,900  -->  00:01:45,730
even if it's not inside where you currently are.
34

34

00:01:45,730  -->  00:01:48,920
In order to do that, you have to tell your computer
35

35

00:01:48,920  -->  00:01:51,470
the absolute path to that folder,
36

36

00:01:51,470  -->  00:01:53,550
starting at the very root.
37

37

00:01:54,570  -->  00:01:58,370
In windows, you would do change directory of C,
38

38

00:01:58,370  -->  00:02:01,170
going to C:\users\something
39

39

00:02:02,599  -->  00:02:07,210
or C:\data\whatever
40

40

00:02:07,210  -->  00:02:10,830
and in OS10 and Linux you do cd /
41

41

00:02:11,800  -->  00:02:14,970
which means the root of your computer
42

42

00:02:14,970  -->  00:02:16,220
and then you could do something like,
43

43

00:02:16,220  -->  00:02:19,600
/Library/Python/ and so forth.
44

44

00:02:19,600  -->  00:02:23,590
Then you can change directly into this folder.
45

45

00:02:23,590  -->  00:02:24,750
This is where I am now.
46

46

00:02:26,550  -->  00:02:28,220
As a small aside, if you want to go back
47

47

00:02:28,220  -->  00:02:32,158
to the previous folder, you can just type cd -.
48

48

00:02:32,158  -->  00:02:34,330
And this, I don't think works on windows,
49

49

00:02:34,330  -->  00:02:38,000
it just works on macOS10 and on Linux.
50

50

00:02:38,000  -->  00:02:40,090
If you want to look at what currently is
51

51

00:02:40,090  -->  00:02:42,950
in one of your folders, all you have to do
52

52

00:02:42,950  -->  00:02:46,050
is type the ls command.
53

53

00:02:46,050  -->  00:02:49,900
On Windows, this will also be the dir command.
54

54

00:02:51,291  -->  00:02:52,560
OK.
55

55

00:02:52,560  -->  00:02:56,070
So let's go over to one of the
56

56

00:02:56,070  -->  00:02:58,270
scraping books project for example,
57

57

00:02:59,650  -->  00:03:03,010
that we created earlier on in the course.
58

58

00:03:03,010  -->  00:03:05,020
Then we can type the ls command and we can see
59

59

00:03:05,020  -->  00:03:07,020
that we've got a few things here.
60

60

00:03:08,110  -->  00:03:09,590
Some of these things are newer,
61

61

00:03:09,590  -->  00:03:11,430
you may not have seen them yet because they are part of
62

62

00:03:11,430  -->  00:03:14,150
the asynchronous development section.
63

63

00:03:14,150  -->  00:03:16,760
The project here has been modified slightly,
64

64

00:03:16,760  -->  00:03:19,050
but don't worry, all is good,
65

65

00:03:19,050  -->  00:03:21,920
what we've covered in the course has not changed.
66

66

00:03:21,920  -->  00:03:23,820
This is just some new stuff I've added.
67

67

00:03:23,820  -->  00:03:25,320
And you can see that we've got here
68

68

00:03:25,320  -->  00:03:28,930
app.py, we've got this async_request.py,
69

69

00:03:28,930  -->  00:03:31,910
menu.py and so forth.
70

70

00:03:31,910  -->  00:03:33,910
There's even some folders you may not have seen before.
71

71

00:03:33,910  -->  00:03:35,640
Like this __pycache__ folder.
72

72

00:03:37,130  -->  00:03:39,420
That is fine, you don't have to worry about the pycache,
73

73

00:03:39,420  -->  00:03:40,820
it's jus a Python thing.
74

74

00:03:42,090  -->  00:03:46,270
Now, if we wanted to run this project here,
75

75

00:03:46,270  -->  00:03:47,760
we could do that by,
76

76

00:03:47,760  -->  00:03:49,688
in my case I'm going to type python3.6
77

77

00:03:49,688  -->  00:03:52,250
because I remember when we started this project
78

78

00:03:52,250  -->  00:03:56,130
I was using Python 3.6, python3.6 menu.py
79

79

00:03:57,570  -->  00:03:59,170
and then our application starts running
80

80

00:03:59,170  -->  00:04:01,680
and you know, we've got some extra logging
81

81

00:04:01,680  -->  00:04:03,270
that we added later on.
82

82

00:04:03,270  -->  00:04:05,940
I know that you've maybe not seen this,
83

83

00:04:05,940  -->  00:04:07,390
but nonetheless our programme starts working
84

84

00:04:07,390  -->  00:04:10,400 line:15% 
and then you'll see the menu up here
85

85

00:04:10,400  -->  00:04:11,450 line:15% 
and you can interact with it.
86

86

00:04:11,450  -->  00:04:13,670 line:15% 
This is, just your programme running
87

87

00:04:13,670  -->  00:04:15,580 line:15% 
as if it was running inside Python,
88

88

00:04:15,580  -->  00:04:17,530 line:15% 
now it's running inside this text console
89

89

00:04:17,530  -->  00:04:18,580 line:15% 
that you've got here.
90

90

00:04:20,350  -->  00:04:22,570 line:15% 
However, we had to run Python 3.6
91

91

00:04:23,510  -->  00:04:27,400 line:15% 
in order to run this project.
92

92

00:04:27,400  -->  00:04:29,410 line:15% 
If we wanted to create a virtual environment
93

93

00:04:29,410  -->  00:04:30,910 line:15% 
for this project so it was separate
94

94

00:04:30,910  -->  00:04:33,090 line:15% 
from the system installation of Python 3.6,
95

95

00:04:34,219  -->  00:04:35,413 line:15% 
we can do that.
96

96

00:04:35,413  -->  00:04:39,900 line:15% 
All we have to do is a virtualenv venv --python=python,
97

97

00:04:39,900  -->  00:04:42,750 line:15% 
I'm gonna use python3.7 for this virtual environment.
98

98

00:04:44,170  -->  00:04:46,960 line:15% 
This is going to create a brand new virtual environment
99

99

00:04:48,610  -->  00:04:50,940 line:15% 
and now when we type ls, we can see that there is
100

100

00:04:50,940  -->  00:04:54,370 line:15% 
a virtual environment folder that wasn't here before.
101

101

00:04:54,370  -->  00:04:56,870 line:15% 
This is the Python installation
102

102

00:04:56,870  -->  00:04:58,880 line:15% 
that we have copied into here.
103

103

00:04:59,917  -->  00:05:04,917 line:15% 
It doesn't have any of the libraries that it had before.
104

104

00:05:05,120  -->  00:05:06,320 line:15% 
So if we activate,
105

105

00:05:07,770  -->  00:05:09,765 line:15% 
by doing this remember to do,
106

106

00:05:09,765  -->  00:05:12,090 line:15% 
(clears throat) apologies
107

107

00:05:12,090  -->  00:05:17,090 line:15% 
\venv\scripts\activate.bat on windows,
108

108

00:05:17,283  -->  00:05:19,360 line:15% 
don't do that on mac, but do that on Windows.
109

109

00:05:19,360  -->  00:05:23,480 line:15% 
So if we activate and we try to run our menu,
110

110

00:05:23,480  -->  00:05:27,210 line:15% 
now it says no module named whatever it is that we needed.
111

111

00:05:28,560  -->  00:05:31,380 line:15% 
And again, this had changed slightly since the last time
112

112

00:05:31,380  -->  00:05:34,880 line:15% 
that we saw this project, but nonetheless
113

113

00:05:34,880  -->  00:05:36,730 line:15% 
Beautiful Soup would also be another one
114

114

00:05:36,730  -->  00:05:38,450 line:15% 
that wouldn't be found.
115

115

00:05:38,450  -->  00:05:41,080 line:15% 
If so, all you have to do is pip instal
116

116

00:05:42,740  -->  00:05:45,380 line:15% 
and you know, instal everything that it asks you
117

117

00:05:45,380  -->  00:05:46,570 line:15% 
ask it asks you it.
118

118

00:05:47,550  -->  00:05:49,050 line:15% 
We can then repeat, and by the way,
119

119

00:05:49,050  -->  00:05:50,810 line:15% 
I am cycling through all commands by pressing
120

120

00:05:50,810  -->  00:05:53,020 line:15% 
the up arrow in my console.
121

121

00:05:53,020  -->  00:05:55,820 line:15% 
Now it says "requests couldn't be found" so we can
122

122

00:05:55,820  -->  00:05:57,720 line:15% 
instal requests
123

123

00:05:58,750  -->  00:06:00,710 line:15% 
we can also instal Beautiful Soup 4
124

124

00:06:01,950  -->  00:06:03,180 line:15% 
and I think that's it.
125

125

00:06:04,840  -->  00:06:06,670
There you have it, now the programme is running.
126

126

00:06:06,670  -->  00:06:08,010
We've installed all the libraries
127

127

00:06:08,010  -->  00:06:09,810
in our virtual environment that we needed,
128

128

00:06:09,810  -->  00:06:11,900
and our programme is now working.
129

129

00:06:12,800  -->  00:06:15,200 line:15% 
So that's what we need in order to make it work.
130

130

00:06:18,350  -->  00:06:20,970 line:15% 
Now, if you type pip freeze,
131

131

00:06:20,970  -->  00:06:23,840 line:15% 
this is going to give you the libraries that are installed
132

132

00:06:23,840  -->  00:06:27,810 line:15% 
currently, in your version of Python that you're using.
133

133

00:06:27,810  -->  00:06:29,020 line:15% 
The version of Python we're using
134

134

00:06:29,020  -->  00:06:31,000 line:15% 
is the one in our virtual environment.
135

135

00:06:31,000  -->  00:06:33,210 line:15% 
So this gives us the libraries installed
136

136

00:06:33,210  -->  00:06:34,750 line:15% 
in our virtual environment.
137

137

00:06:34,750  -->  00:06:38,100 line:15% 
Notice how they're in the format of aiohdp==3.0.5.
138

138

00:06:40,220  -->  00:06:44,610 line:15% 
So we've got version 3.0.5 of this library.
139

139

00:06:44,610  -->  00:06:48,910 line:15% 
We've got version 2.18.4 of requests and so forth.
140

140

00:06:50,130  -->  00:06:53,380 line:15% 
And it's fairly frequent, when using virtual environments,
141

141

00:06:53,380  -->  00:06:56,169 line:15% 
to actually save these into a file.
142

142

00:06:56,169  -->  00:06:58,970 line:15% 
And just so you don't forget, that these are the versions
143

143

00:06:58,970  -->  00:07:01,050 line:15% 
you've got installed in this virtual environment.
144

144

00:07:01,050  -->  00:07:03,640 line:15% 
When you give this programme to someone else,
145

145

00:07:03,640  -->  00:07:06,290 line:15% 
they can then go and instal the exact same versions.
146

146

00:07:07,460  -->  00:07:12,010 line:15% 
So we can create a new file and put this content in it.
147

147

00:07:12,010  -->  00:07:13,470 line:15% 
You can do that in Python,
148

148

00:07:13,470  -->  00:07:15,870 line:15% 
or you can do that in any other editor.
149

149

00:07:17,160  -->  00:07:20,600 line:15% 
Or if you want, if you're using macOS10 or Linux,
150

150

00:07:20,600  -->  00:07:25,060 line:15% 
you can do pip freeze into requirements.txt.
151

151

00:07:26,500  -->  00:07:28,170 line:15% 
All this does is it says,
152

152

00:07:28,170  -->  00:07:31,720 line:15% 
all the output of pipfreeze, instead of printing it out,
153

153

00:07:31,720  -->  00:07:35,430 line:15% 
dump it into this new file called requirements.txt.
154

154

00:07:36,490  -->  00:07:39,660 line:15% 
OK, now if you were to open requirements.txt,
155

155

00:07:39,660  -->  00:07:42,170 line:15% 
you'd see that it contains all of this stuff.
156

156

00:07:43,058  -->  00:07:46,470 line:15% 
OK, in macOS10 and Linux,
157

157

00:07:46,470  -->  00:07:48,620 line:15% 
you can do the cat command
158

158

00:07:48,620  -->  00:07:51,670 line:15% 
in order to see the contents of a file.
159

159

00:07:51,670  -->  00:07:54,460 line:15% 
So as you can see, when I do cat requirements.txt
160

160

00:07:54,460  -->  00:07:56,560 line:15% 
you can see the contents of the file here.
161

161

00:07:58,760  -->  00:08:02,020 line:15% 
Now, why is this useful,
162

162

00:08:02,020  -->  00:08:04,930 line:15% 
if now I'm going to go and to pip instal?
163

163

00:08:04,930  -->  00:08:06,200 line:15% 
If you share this with someone else,
164

164

00:08:06,200  -->  00:08:09,050 line:15% 
they're gonna have to go and do pip instal aiohttp,
165

165

00:08:10,680  -->  00:08:13,810 line:15% 
I mean do they do this, do they do ==3.0.5
166

166

00:08:13,810  -->  00:08:16,230 line:15% 
in order to instal this specific version?
167

167

00:08:16,230  -->  00:08:17,410 line:15% 
Yeah.
168

168

00:08:17,410  -->  00:08:19,230 line:15% 
This is what you do in order to instal
169

169

00:08:19,230  -->  00:08:22,650 line:15% 
version 3.0.5 of this library.
170

170

00:08:22,650  -->  00:08:27,650 line:15% 
But if you share with them, this requrements.txt file
171

171

00:08:28,060  -->  00:08:31,650 line:15% 
they can actually do -r requirements.txt.
172

172

00:08:31,650  -->  00:08:35,490 line:15% 
So pip instal -r requirements.txt
173

173

00:08:35,490  -->  00:08:37,260 line:15% 
and then they're going to go through and instal
174

174

00:08:37,260  -->  00:08:40,060 line:15% 
all of these libraries, these specific versions of them.
175

175

00:08:41,060  -->  00:08:42,400 line:15% 
So as you can see, this can be really good
176

176

00:08:42,400  -->  00:08:45,430 line:15% 
to share everything you need for a project
177

177

00:08:45,430  -->  00:08:47,410 line:15% 
with someone else.
178

178

00:08:47,410  -->  00:08:49,470 line:15% 
For example, if you're working with someone else,
179

179

00:08:49,470  -->  00:08:52,690 line:15% 
or if you want to participate in some sort of team,
180

180

00:08:52,690  -->  00:08:55,960 line:15% 
you're probably gonna want a requirements.txt file
181

181

00:08:55,960  -->  00:08:57,890 line:15% 
so that you can share it with one another,
182

182

00:08:57,890  -->  00:08:59,180 line:15% 
and make sure that you're all using
183

183

00:08:59,180  -->  00:09:01,500 line:15% 
the same versions of libraries.
184

184

00:09:01,500  -->  00:09:03,830 line:15% 
If one person on the team is using a specific version
185

185

00:09:03,830  -->  00:09:05,780 line:15% 
and someone else is using a different version,
186

186

00:09:05,780  -->  00:09:07,720 line:15% 
you may actually encounter some inconsistencies
187

187

00:09:07,720  -->  00:09:10,010 line:15% 
in some things that may work differently.
188

188

00:09:10,010  -->  00:09:11,540 line:15% 
So make sure to not do that,
189

189

00:09:11,540  -->  00:09:15,300 line:15% 
and by having requirements.txt file is a great first step
190

190

00:09:15,300  -->  00:09:17,950 line:15% 
towards making sure that you're all on the same page.
191

191

00:09:19,430  -->  00:09:23,020 line:15% 
So that is how you would instal everything
192

192

00:09:23,020  -->  00:09:24,900 line:15% 
from my requirements.txt file,
193

193

00:09:24,900  -->  00:09:28,050 line:15% 
and as you can see, it's all pretty straightforward.
194

194

00:09:28,050  -->  00:09:30,540
Over the next few videos, we're going to look at something
195

195

00:09:30,540  -->  00:09:34,930
even more important when working with these projects.
196

196

00:09:34,930  -->  00:09:37,230
And also, this new thing that we're going to look at
197

197

00:09:37,230  -->  00:09:40,150
in these next few videos, is actually the recommended way
198

198

00:09:40,150  -->  00:09:42,840
of managing projects and dependencies in Python,
199

199

00:09:42,840  -->  00:09:44,270
as of Python 3.7.
200

200

00:09:45,670  -->  00:09:48,220
So stay with me and I'll see you on the next video.
