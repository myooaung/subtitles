<v Instructor>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,464  -->  00:00:04,110
In this video, we're looking at update and delete.
3

3

00:00:04,110  -->  00:00:05,595
I wanted to talk about this briefly
4

4

00:00:05,595  -->  00:00:07,465
before going into filtering
5

5

00:00:07,465  -->  00:00:11,019
just so you know why filtering is so important.
6

6

00:00:11,019  -->  00:00:14,600
Let's say we've got this table here of our people,
7

7

00:00:14,600  -->  00:00:17,633
and we want to do an update.
8

8

00:00:17,633  -->  00:00:20,413
This is a good old normal update statement.
9

9

00:00:20,413  -->  00:00:23,368
We do update and the table name that we want to update,
10

10

00:00:23,368  -->  00:00:26,352
and then we say set and we give the column
11

11

00:00:26,352  -->  00:00:28,272
and the value we want to end up with.
12

12

00:00:28,272  -->  00:00:31,216
So here we're going to essentially update the people table,
13

13

00:00:31,216  -->  00:00:34,883
setting the name column to be equal to Jose.
14

14

00:00:36,284  -->  00:00:39,101
I hope you realise what this is going to do,
15

15

00:00:39,101  -->  00:00:40,961
but if you don't, that's totally okay.
16

16

00:00:40,961  -->  00:00:44,651
We're not telling it to update any given row.
17

17

00:00:44,651  -->  00:00:47,036
We've just said update the whole table
18

18

00:00:47,036  -->  00:00:49,041
and set the name column to Jose.
19

19

00:00:49,041  -->  00:00:52,103
So, of course, it's going to do just that.
20

20

00:00:52,103  -->  00:00:54,311
Notice how in our results,
21

21

00:00:54,311  -->  00:00:57,144
all the rows now have a name Jose.
22

22

00:00:59,156  -->  00:01:01,321
It's a good name, but you probably don't want to change
23

23

00:01:01,321  -->  00:01:03,506
all your customers or all your people in your table
24

24

00:01:03,506  -->  00:01:05,006
to have this name.
25

25

00:01:05,892  -->  00:01:10,124
It would get a bit boring, so this is not a good thing.
26

26

00:01:10,124  -->  00:01:12,780
What we've done here is we've said update the people table
27

27

00:01:12,780  -->  00:01:14,435
and set the name to something,
28

28

00:01:14,435  -->  00:01:15,633
but, of course, we've not told it
29

29

00:01:15,633  -->  00:01:18,083
what we want to update specifically
30

30

00:01:18,083  -->  00:01:20,887
so it's just gone and done everything.
31

31

00:01:20,887  -->  00:01:24,423
Here's another example: delete from people.
32

32

00:01:24,423  -->  00:01:27,484
This is a delete statement, allows us to delete a row,
33

33

00:01:27,484  -->  00:01:29,359
or multiple rows in this case,
34

34

00:01:29,359  -->  00:01:34,109
and again we've not told it what to delete so, of course,
35

35

00:01:34,955  -->  00:01:37,474
it's all going to go,
36

36

00:01:37,474  -->  00:01:40,106
and we'll end up with an empty table.
37

37

00:01:40,106  -->  00:01:42,410
This is why we need filtering.
38

38

00:01:42,410  -->  00:01:45,152
We need to be able to say delete from people
39

39

00:01:45,152  -->  00:01:47,674
but only these specific rows.
40

40

00:01:47,674  -->  00:01:51,185
Otherwise, we'll end up with everything deleted,
41

41

00:01:51,185  -->  00:01:54,572
and, trust me, you don't want to do this.
42

42

00:01:54,572  -->  00:01:58,397
This happens a lot, it happens to everyone eventually,
43

43

00:01:58,397  -->  00:02:01,877
that you forget to put in a filtering statement in there,
44

44

00:02:01,877  -->  00:02:03,643
and it is a dangerous thing to do,
45

45

00:02:03,643  -->  00:02:05,077
so you don't want to do this.
46

46

00:02:05,077  -->  00:02:06,728
Let's look in the very next video
47

47

00:02:06,728  -->  00:02:08,749
at how to use filtering to make sure
48

48

00:02:08,749  -->  00:02:10,494
that this problem doesn't happen.
49

49

00:02:10,494  -->  00:02:12,077
I'll see you there.
