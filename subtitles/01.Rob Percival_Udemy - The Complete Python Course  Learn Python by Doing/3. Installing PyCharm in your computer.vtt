<v ->Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.386  -->  00:00:04.423
In this video, we're going to be installing PyCharm.
3

3

00:00:04.423  -->  00:00:07.293
PyCharm is a Python editor.
4

4

00:00:07.293  -->  00:00:10.203
It's a programme that lets us write our Python code
5

5

00:00:10.203  -->  00:00:13.919
and run it and add other files to a project
6

6

00:00:13.919  -->  00:00:16.643
and, you know, do a bunch of stuff.
7

7

00:00:16.643  -->  00:00:18.223
But it's just an editor.
8

8

00:00:18.223  -->  00:00:20.455
It just lets us write the code
9

9

00:00:20.455  -->  00:00:23.334
and gives us a few more pieces of functionality.
10

10

00:00:23.334  -->  00:00:26.151
You don't have to use PyCharm if you don't want.
11

11

00:00:26.151  -->  00:00:29.408
You can use any text editor, it's just Notepad
12

12

00:00:29.408  -->  00:00:33.030
on Windows or Notepad++ if you have installed that.
13

13

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:35.566
You can use Atom or Visual Studio Code,
14

14

00:00:35.566  -->  00:00:38.019
you can use Sublime Text, you can use TextMate.
15

15

00:00:38.019  -->  00:00:40.299
There's a lot of editors you can use out there
16

16

00:00:40.299  -->  00:00:44.024
if for some reason you don't want to use PyCharm.
17

17

00:00:44.024  -->  00:00:47.584
However, I'm assuming you're a beginner in Python,
18

18

00:00:47.584  -->  00:00:52.119
and if so, I really recommend that you go for PyCharm.
19

19

00:00:52.119  -->  00:00:55.538
It is the best editor for starting up with.
20

20

00:00:55.538  -->  00:00:57.626
It gives you a lot of bang for your buck,
21

21

00:00:57.626  -->  00:01:00.658
it does a lot of stuff for you and it's really helpful.
22

22

00:01:00.658  -->  00:01:01.961
So I definitely recommend that.
23

23

00:01:01.961  -->  00:01:04.159
And also, as you get better at Python,
24

24

00:01:04.159  -->  00:01:06.018
you'll discover that PyCharm does more and more things
25

25

00:01:06.018  -->  00:01:07.708
that you didn't know about before
26

26

00:01:07.708  -->  00:01:09.296
that will keep making your life easy.
27

27

00:01:09.296  -->  00:01:12.528
I use PyCharm at work and I recommend it for you too.
28

28

00:01:12.528  -->  00:01:14.591
Anyway, that's enough of the sales pitch.
29

29

00:01:14.591  -->  00:01:16.426
Don't worry, this thing is free
30

30

00:01:16.426  -->  00:01:18.400
so you don't have to pay anything.
31

31

00:01:18.400  -->  00:01:20.983
Go over to "www.jetbrains.com"
32

32

00:01:22.138  -->  00:01:27.098
and then lets go over to Tools and find PyCharm here.
33

33

00:01:27.098  -->  00:01:29.252
And notice how JetBrains has a bunch of other IDEs
34

34

00:01:29.252  -->  00:01:31.198
for different programming languages.
35

35

00:01:31.198  -->  00:01:32.793
You don't want to instal any of them
36

36

00:01:32.793  -->  00:01:35.160
other than PyCharm, unless of course you are
37

37

00:01:35.160  -->  00:01:38.090
doing some work in other languages as well.
38

38

00:01:38.090  -->  00:01:40.576
So let's go into the PyCharm page
39

39

00:01:40.576  -->  00:01:43.552
and then you'll be greeted with two options.
40

40

00:01:43.552  -->  00:01:47.104
When you, well, first of all, press "Download Now" here,
41

41

00:01:47.104  -->  00:01:49.892
and now you are greeted with two options,
42

42

00:01:49.892  -->  00:01:52.059
Professional or Community.
43

43

00:01:53.599  -->  00:01:56.624
Now, select the operating system that you want.
44

44

00:01:56.624  -->  00:01:58.521
If you are using Windows, then go for Windows.
45

45

00:01:58.521  -->  00:02:02.914
And otherwise select the other operating systems there.
46

46

00:02:02.914  -->  00:02:06.157
And then make sure you go for Community edition.
47

47

00:02:06.157  -->  00:02:09.171
Okay, this is free, completely free software,
48

48

00:02:09.171  -->  00:02:11.766
as in you don't have to pay anything for it.
49

49

00:02:11.766  -->  00:02:14.734
If you use the Professional edition, that's a free trial.
50

50

00:02:14.734  -->  00:02:17.818
So after a month, I think, you'll be asked to pay.
51

51

00:02:17.818  -->  00:02:19.901
So go and download the Community edition,
52

52

00:02:19.901  -->  00:02:22.767
that's the version we're using in this course.
53

53

00:02:22.767  -->  00:02:26.252
Of course if you're working for a company and they pay,
54

54

00:02:26.252  -->  00:02:27.871
I recommend you use the Professional edition.
55

55

00:02:27.871  -->  00:02:30.152
It does give you a few more things,
56

56

00:02:30.152  -->  00:02:32.447
particularly as you go into web development
57

57

00:02:32.447  -->  00:02:34.682
which is a key use case for Python.
58

58

00:02:34.682  -->  00:02:36.853
And we'll look at that later on in the course.
59

59

00:02:36.853  -->  00:02:39.251
But for now, download the Community edition,
60

60

00:02:39.251  -->  00:02:41.842
instal it like any good old normal programme,
61

61

00:02:41.842  -->  00:02:44.328
and then you'll be able to launch it.
62

62

00:02:44.328  -->  00:02:47.396
Now, in the next video, we'll launch PyCharm
63

63

00:02:47.396  -->  00:02:49.456
and we're going to look at joining PyCharm
64

64

00:02:49.456  -->  00:02:53.311
with the Python version we've just installed, Python 3.6.
65

65

00:02:53.311  -->  00:02:56.023
So let's go on to the next video and look at that.
