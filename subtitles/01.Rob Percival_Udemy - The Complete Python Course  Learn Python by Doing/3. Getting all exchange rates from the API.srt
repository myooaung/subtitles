00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:02,410
<v ->In this video, we're going to be creating</v>
2

2

00:00:02,410  -->  00:00:05,592
our first programme that interacts with an API.
3

3

00:00:05,592  -->  00:00:10,150
We're gonna need to instal the requests package,
4

4

00:00:10,150  -->  00:00:12,470
so go over to your project interpreter
5

5

00:00:12,470  -->  00:00:13,720
and press the plus icon
6

6

00:00:13,720  -->  00:00:15,880
and instal the requests package.
7

7

00:00:15,880  -->  00:00:17,100
If you've got it installed already,
8

8

00:00:17,100  -->  00:00:18,880
because we used it in the past,
9

9

00:00:18,880  -->  00:00:21,130
then that's fine, you can just keep that one
10

10

00:00:21,130  -->  00:00:22,850
but I have created a new project,
11

11

00:00:22,850  -->  00:00:24,793
so I have to instal it again.
12

12

00:00:26,350  -->  00:00:27,290
Once that's installed,
13

13

00:00:27,290  -->  00:00:29,170
just close that and press OK
14

14

00:00:29,170  -->  00:00:31,890
and that's everything we'll need for this section.
15

15

00:00:31,890  -->  00:00:36,080
So, let's go over and create our new file
16

16

00:00:36,080  -->  00:00:39,586
which is gonna be called app.py as usual.
17

17

00:00:39,586  -->  00:00:42,870
Now, we're going to need to import requests
18

18

00:00:42,870  -->  00:00:47,050
and we will need to get our APP_ID in here,
19

19

00:00:47,050  -->  00:00:49,390
so just copy what you had in your dashboard
20

20

00:00:49,390  -->  00:00:51,160
in open exchange rates.
21

21

00:00:51,160  -->  00:00:53,460
Next up, we need to go and look
22

22

00:00:53,460  -->  00:00:55,840
at the open exchange rates documentation
23

23

00:00:55,840  -->  00:00:57,970
to see what they can give us,
24

24

00:00:57,970  -->  00:01:00,840
so if you go over to openexchangerates.org
25

25

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:03,320
and click on the documentation,
26

26

00:01:03,320  -->  00:01:06,180
you will see the different parts of the API
27

27

00:01:06,180  -->  00:01:07,750
that you can access.
28

28

00:01:07,750  -->  00:01:08,740
You can read through this
29

29

00:01:08,740  -->  00:01:10,750
and it's actually quite good documentation
30

30

00:01:10,750  -->  00:01:11,820
but normally what you'll see
31

31

00:01:11,820  -->  00:01:15,100
is a section called API endpoints.
32

32

00:01:15,100  -->  00:01:17,290
So, these are the different things that you can access
33

33

00:01:17,290  -->  00:01:19,110
in this API.
34

34

00:01:19,110  -->  00:01:21,150
Essentially this is the data
35

35

00:01:21,150  -->  00:01:23,150
that the API needs from you
36

36

00:01:23,150  -->  00:01:26,180
in order to know what to give you back.
37

37

00:01:26,180  -->  00:01:30,287
If we make a request to this address here,
38

38

00:01:30,287  -->  00:01:32,460
then the API will know
39

39

00:01:32,460  -->  00:01:36,530
that what we want is the latest exchange rates available
40

40

00:01:36,530  -->  00:01:38,000
from the API.
41

41

00:01:38,000  -->  00:01:41,860
So, it will return you those latest exchange rates.
42

42

00:01:41,860  -->  00:01:44,776
This is what an API is.
43

43

00:01:44,776  -->  00:01:47,250
It has a definition of what it accepts,
44

44

00:01:47,250  -->  00:01:49,550
in this case, a request on this endpoint
45

45

00:01:49,550  -->  00:01:51,710
and a definition on what it responds with.
46

46

00:01:51,710  -->  00:01:53,750
And that is really what an API is.
47

47

00:01:53,750  -->  00:01:56,440
So, if you make a request like this
48

48

00:01:56,440  -->  00:01:59,660
to /api/latest.json,
49

49

00:01:59,660  -->  00:02:02,930
then it will give you a few different fields
50

50

00:02:02,930  -->  00:02:07,023
and all the rates that it currently has.
51

51

00:02:07,970  -->  00:02:10,180
The base rate is always United States dollars,
52

52

00:02:10,180  -->  00:02:12,530
at least in the free plan,
53

53

00:02:12,530  -->  00:02:15,963
so you'll get all the rates parting from USD.
54

54

00:02:16,820  -->  00:02:20,240
This ?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID
55

55

00:02:20,240  -->  00:02:22,710
is called a query string parameter.
56

56

00:02:22,710  -->  00:02:25,300
This is how we sent extra information
57

57

00:02:25,300  -->  00:02:28,410
to APIs and to websites over the internet.
58

58

00:02:28,410  -->  00:02:29,660
Just put a question mark
59

59

00:02:29,660  -->  00:02:32,420
and then the key which is app_id
60

60

00:02:32,420  -->  00:02:34,660
equal and then the value which is the value
61

61

00:02:34,660  -->  00:02:37,570
of your app ID, so knowing this,
62

62

00:02:37,570  -->  00:02:39,830
let's copy all of that here
63

63

00:02:39,830  -->  00:02:40,960
and go back to PyCharm
64

64

00:02:42,410  -->  00:02:45,903
and we're gonna say that the ENDPOINT is this one there.
65

65

00:02:47,150  -->  00:02:48,870
Now we're gonna make a request,
66

66

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:53,240
so we'll say response equals requests.get
67

67

00:02:53,240  -->  00:02:56,577
and we will go for the ENDPOINT ?app_id=APP_ID
68

68

00:02:59,720  -->  00:03:02,820
and this builds out the address like we had
69

69

00:03:02,820  -->  00:03:06,880
on the documentation and then the exchange_rates
70

70

00:03:08,670  -->  00:03:10,290
will be the response.json
71

71

00:03:12,090  -->  00:03:16,820
and we will access the rates value inside this dictionary.
72

72

00:03:16,820  -->  00:03:19,420
Response.json gives us a Python dictionary
73

73

00:03:19,420  -->  00:03:21,610
containing the response
74

74

00:03:21,610  -->  00:03:24,670
and as you can see from here,
75

75

00:03:24,670  -->  00:03:28,410
this dictionary has a key called rates.
76

76

00:03:28,410  -->  00:03:33,033
So, we're accessing the rates key inside that response.
77

77

00:03:34,650  -->  00:03:39,577
Next, let's try to convert $1,000 into pounds.
78

78

00:03:41,520  -->  00:03:43,860
So, we will say the usd_amount
79

79

00:03:43,860  -->  00:03:48,510
multiplied by the exchange_rates GBP.
80

80

00:03:48,510  -->  00:03:51,330
Remember that the base rate of this response
81

81

00:03:51,330  -->  00:03:53,080
is United States dollars
82

82

00:03:53,080  -->  00:03:55,660
and that means that the GBP rates
83

83

00:03:55,660  -->  00:03:58,582
inside this response is the equivalent
84

84

00:03:58,582  -->  00:04:03,582
of $1, so by multiplying $1,000 by the rate,
85

85

00:04:03,590  -->  00:04:06,430
you get something like 800 something pounds
86

86

00:04:06,430  -->  00:04:09,750
and then we can print that USD usd_amount
87

87

00:04:12,290  -->  00:04:14,583
is GBP gbp_amount.
88

88

00:04:16,240  -->  00:04:18,133
Let's right click that and run it.
89

89

00:04:19,410  -->  00:04:20,380
And you see down here
90

90

00:04:20,380  -->  00:04:22,283
that you get USD1000 is GBP791.2.
91

91

00:04:26,640  -->  00:04:28,670
Sometimes this number can get really long
92

92

00:04:28,670  -->  00:04:31,450
depending on the division and how Python does it.
93

93

00:04:31,450  -->  00:04:32,380
Don't worry too much about it,
94

94

00:04:32,380  -->  00:04:34,660
we'll learn how to format this
95

95

00:04:34,660  -->  00:04:36,430
to a certain number of decimal places
96

96

00:04:36,430  -->  00:04:37,970
in a later video.
97

97

00:04:37,970  -->  00:04:42,170
So, this is how you interact with an API.
98

98

00:04:42,170  -->  00:04:44,640
Usually the API requires some form
99

99

00:04:44,640  -->  00:04:47,290
of authentication or authorization.
100

100

00:04:47,290  -->  00:04:51,250
In this case, the APP_ID is our form of authorization,
101

101

00:04:51,250  -->  00:04:53,000
it's just a string that we include
102

102

00:04:53,000  -->  00:04:55,890
and that tells the API that we are a valid user
103

103

00:04:55,890  -->  00:04:57,003
when they receive it.
104

104

00:04:57,900  -->  00:05:00,980
Then it also have a set of data that it requires.
105

105

00:05:00,980  -->  00:05:03,050
In this case, all the data it requires
106

106

00:05:03,050  -->  00:05:05,450
is the endpoint that we wanna access
107

107

00:05:05,450  -->  00:05:07,050
and the app_id
108

108

00:05:07,050  -->  00:05:08,700
and then it gives us back some data
109

109

00:05:08,700  -->  00:05:10,180
that is already predetermined
110

110

00:05:10,180  -->  00:05:12,560
and is always in the documentation or should be
111

111

00:05:12,560  -->  00:05:15,780
in the documentation and that is the rates.
112

112

00:05:15,780  -->  00:05:16,980
So, once you have the rates,
113

113

00:05:16,980  -->  00:05:19,730
you can multiple the usd_amount by that
114

114

00:05:19,730  -->  00:05:22,733
and get a pound amount or indeed, any other currency.
115

115

00:05:24,090  -->  00:05:25,470
Thanks for joining me in this video,
116

116

00:05:25,470  -->  00:05:26,920
I'll see you in the next one.
