00:00:00.350  -->  00:00:02.210
<v Jose>Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.210  -->  00:00:04.090
In this video we're going to start learning
3

3

00:00:04.090  -->  00:00:09.090
about TkInter by building a simple Hello World app.
4

4

00:00:09.180  -->  00:00:11.090
What to do is right click your folder
5

5

00:00:11.090  -->  00:00:12.670
and create a new Python file
6

6

00:00:12.670  -->  00:00:14.950
I'm gonna call it app.py as I usually do
7

7

00:00:14.950  -->  00:00:16.870
for these smaller apps
8

8

00:00:16.870  -->  00:00:21.030
and we're going to do import TkInter as tk.
9

9

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:23.340
This is a alias import
10

10

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:25.210
it's essentially the same thing as we did last time
11

11

00:00:25.210  -->  00:00:28.270
only now instead of TkInter dot stuff
12

12

00:00:28.270  -->  00:00:30.683
We're gonna do tk dot stuff.
13

13

00:00:31.540  -->  00:00:34.700
And so this just renames TkInter into tk
14

14

00:00:34.700  -->  00:00:36.220
so it's a little bit easier to use
15

15

00:00:36.220  -->  00:00:38.370
and this is something that you'll encounter
16

16

00:00:38.370  -->  00:00:41.250
in TkInter code all the time.
17

17

00:00:41.250  -->  00:00:45.000
However, we're also going to use a sub module of TkInter
18

18

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:48.850
so frequently that we want to import it separately as well.
19

19

00:00:48.850  -->  00:00:52.580
So we will do from TkInter import ttk
20

20

00:00:53.660  -->  00:00:57.470
Now, TkInter has had a bad rep in the Python community
21

21

00:00:57.470  -->  00:01:01.500
and generally in everybody's minds for a long time
22

22

00:01:01.500  -->  00:01:05.830
because it has been not the prettiest to look at
23

23

00:01:05.830  -->  00:01:08.580
it is a little bit confusing
24

24

00:01:08.580  -->  00:01:12.720
and generally it hasn't been all that good.
25

25

00:01:12.720  -->  00:01:15.240
And over time people have migrated to other
26

26

00:01:15.240  -->  00:01:17.193
graphical user interface libraries.
27

27

00:01:18.040  -->  00:01:21.270
In the last few years TkInter has gotten much better
28

28

00:01:21.270  -->  00:01:23.620
and with the introduction of ttk
29

29

00:01:23.620  -->  00:01:25.860
as well as many other improvements
30

30

00:01:25.860  -->  00:01:28.850
it is now what I would say is the best option
31

31

00:01:28.850  -->  00:01:30.700
for learning graphical user interface
32

32

00:01:30.700  -->  00:01:33.770
and developing cross platform interfaces
33

33

00:01:33.770  -->  00:01:35.530
for your applications.
34

34

00:01:35.530  -->  00:01:37.950
In addition TkInter is very fast
35

35

00:01:37.950  -->  00:01:40.320
and it's not that difficult to learn
36

36

00:01:40.320  -->  00:01:43.140
once you've got a few fundamentals down
37

37

00:01:43.140  -->  00:01:44.210
so let's get started.
38

38

00:01:44.210  -->  00:01:47.780
We're going to create a simple function called greet
39

39

00:01:47.780  -->  00:01:50.410
and it's going to print hello world
40

40

00:01:50.410  -->  00:01:52.180
so nothing new here
41

41

00:01:52.180  -->  00:01:56.390
if we call this function in our code and we run app.py
42

42

00:01:56.390  -->  00:02:00.120
as usual you will get hello world printed down there.
43

43

00:02:00.120  -->  00:02:02.580
Now what we're gonna do is we're going to create
44

44

00:02:02.580  -->  00:02:06.350
a button inside a window and when you click the button
45

45

00:02:06.350  -->  00:02:07.800
this function will be called.
46

46

00:02:08.680  -->  00:02:10.650
So, the first thing to do is to create
47

47

00:02:10.650  -->  00:02:12.500
our TkInter application.
48

48

00:02:12.500  -->  00:02:16.120
Essentially, a container for all our other components
49

49

00:02:16.120  -->  00:02:19.030
like buttons and texts and things like that.
50

50

00:02:19.030  -->  00:02:21.193
Usually call this the root.
51

51

00:02:22.040  -->  00:02:25.770
So you define it by creating a Tk object
52

52

00:02:25.770  -->  00:02:27.773
that comes from the TkInter package.
53

53

00:02:28.680  -->  00:02:30.850
Then you can give this a title
54

54

00:02:30.850  -->  00:02:33.710
this will be the title of the window.
55

55

00:02:33.710  -->  00:02:36.340
Finally if you do root dot main loop
56

56

00:02:36.340  -->  00:02:39.300
that is going to run your window
57

57

00:02:39.300  -->  00:02:43.260
and the programme, the code will be paused in this line
58

58

00:02:43.260  -->  00:02:45.610
until the window exits.
59

59

00:02:45.610  -->  00:02:46.890
So whenever you run this
60

60

00:02:46.890  -->  00:02:49.350
your entire Python programme comes to a standstill
61

61

00:02:49.350  -->  00:02:51.330
or so it would seem
62

62

00:02:51.330  -->  00:02:55.150
while TkInter is in its event loop.
63

63

00:02:55.150  -->  00:02:58.560
Let me run this and actually I will call the greet function
64

64

00:02:58.560  -->  00:03:01.560
underneath this line as well to show you what happens.
65

65

00:03:01.560  -->  00:03:03.670
Now I'm gonna run app.py
66

66

00:03:03.670  -->  00:03:06.760
and you'll see this little window appear
67

67

00:03:06.760  -->  00:03:08.630
which doesn't contain anything
68

68

00:03:08.630  -->  00:03:10.050
the window may be different sizes
69

69

00:03:10.050  -->  00:03:12.180
depending on your screen and so on
70

70

00:03:12.180  -->  00:03:14.040
but you can see down at the bottom left
71

71

00:03:14.040  -->  00:03:17.180
that there is no hello world being printed out.
72

72

00:03:17.180  -->  00:03:19.230
That is because right now TkInter
73

73

00:03:19.230  -->  00:03:22.160
has taken control of Python.
74

74

00:03:22.160  -->  00:03:25.080
If there were buttons or labels or input fields
75

75

00:03:25.080  -->  00:03:26.400
in this application
76

76

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:28.350
they would all work because TkInter
77

77

00:03:28.350  -->  00:03:29.990
is the one controlling them
78

78

00:03:29.990  -->  00:03:32.470
but the rest of our application is stopped
79

79

00:03:32.470  -->  00:03:34.830
so we cannot run any alternate code
80

80

00:03:34.830  -->  00:03:38.350
at the same time, as we run our TkInter code.
81

81

00:03:38.350  -->  00:03:41.290
If we stop this then hello world gets printed out
82

82

00:03:41.290  -->  00:03:42.583
and our application ends.
83

83

00:03:43.620  -->  00:03:46.550
Now when we're defining TkInter applications
84

84

00:03:46.550  -->  00:03:49.180
we're going to wire the different components
85

85

00:03:49.180  -->  00:03:52.190
such as buttons to functions in our code
86

86

00:03:52.190  -->  00:03:54.760
that is how our code runs.
87

87

00:03:54.760  -->  00:03:56.330
So let's do that just now.
88

88

00:03:56.330  -->  00:03:58.130
Will we create a greet button
89

89

00:03:58.130  -->  00:04:01.120
which is a ttk dot button.
90

90

00:04:01.120  -->  00:04:04.450
Notice that this is not a traditional tk dot button
91

91

00:04:04.450  -->  00:04:08.340
it is a themed TkInter button.
92

92

00:04:08.340  -->  00:04:10.290
This is the new type of widgets
93

93

00:04:10.290  -->  00:04:12.250
that allow much more customization
94

94

00:04:12.250  -->  00:04:15.020
and is one of the reasons why TkInter is better now
95

95

00:04:15.020  -->  00:04:16.570
than it used to be in the past.
96

96

00:04:17.440  -->  00:04:19.940
The first parameter to any of these components
97

97

00:04:19.940  -->  00:04:24.940
is who the parent is or where the button will go inside of.
98

98

00:04:25.270  -->  00:04:28.020
So this button we wanna put it inside the root
99

99

00:04:28.020  -->  00:04:29.710
which is our main container.
100

100

00:04:29.710  -->  00:04:34.230
So that is the first argument to the constructor.
101

101

00:04:34.230  -->  00:04:36.400
Next up, we can give it some text
102

102

00:04:36.400  -->  00:04:39.960
which is what will be contained inside the button.
103

103

00:04:39.960  -->  00:04:42.430
And finally we can give it a command
104

104

00:04:42.430  -->  00:04:45.880
and this is a callable function that will run
105

105

00:04:45.880  -->  00:04:47.290
when the button is clicked
106

106

00:04:47.290  -->  00:04:49.970
so here we're gonna put our greet function.
107

107

00:04:49.970  -->  00:04:51.750
Make sure to not put the result
108

108

00:04:51.750  -->  00:04:53.320
of calling the greet function
109

109

00:04:53.320  -->  00:04:56.520
as then it would run immediately and you would get an error
110

110

00:04:56.520  -->  00:04:59.373
you do want the function itself in there.
111

111

00:05:00.280  -->  00:05:02.160
Now when the button is clicked
112

112

00:05:02.160  -->  00:05:04.210
this command function will be executed
113

113

00:05:04.210  -->  00:05:06.083
which will run your greet function.
114

114

00:05:07.570  -->  00:05:11.760
Next thing we're gonna put this button inside our root
115

115

00:05:11.760  -->  00:05:13.590
because if we run this just now
116

116

00:05:14.730  -->  00:05:16.980
you will see that the button is not in there.
117

117

00:05:17.860  -->  00:05:19.890
The root is the parent of the button
118

118

00:05:19.890  -->  00:05:21.660
but we've not placed it in there yet
119

119

00:05:21.660  -->  00:05:24.210
so we need to give TkInter some information
120

120

00:05:24.210  -->  00:05:26.660
as to where we want this to appear.
121

121

00:05:26.660  -->  00:05:28.350
And we're gonna tell TkInter
122

122

00:05:28.350  -->  00:05:31.420
that we just wanna put the button in the screen
123

123

00:05:31.420  -->  00:05:32.960
wherever it fits.
124

124

00:05:32.960  -->  00:05:36.890
And for that we use greet button dot pack
125

125

00:05:37.830  -->  00:05:42.687
and we are gonna give it side of left fill of x
126

126

00:05:44.020  -->  00:05:46.990
and expand equal true.
127

127

00:05:46.990  -->  00:05:49.220
Now that we've got this we can press play
128

128

00:05:49.220  -->  00:05:51.770
and you'll see the greet button appears
129

129

00:05:51.770  -->  00:05:55.020
and expands as you make the window grow
130

130

00:05:55.020  -->  00:05:57.580
that is this fill x and expand true in action.
131

131

00:05:57.580  -->  00:06:00.230
We will explain more on them later on.
132

132

00:06:00.230  -->  00:06:01.860
As you click the button
133

133

00:06:01.860  -->  00:06:04.083
Hello World appears on the bottom left.
134

134

00:06:05.320  -->  00:06:07.600
We also have this greet call down here
135

135

00:06:07.600  -->  00:06:10.230
we're gonna remove it now since we don't need it any more.
136

136

00:06:10.230  -->  00:06:12.830
Next we're going to create a quit button
137

137

00:06:12.830  -->  00:06:15.290
and this is gonna be a another ttk button
138

138

00:06:15.290  -->  00:06:16.940
also on the root.
139

139

00:06:16.940  -->  00:06:19.080
The text is going to be quit
140

140

00:06:19.080  -->  00:06:22.450
and the command is gonna be root dot destroy.
141

141

00:06:22.450  -->  00:06:26.020
Again, make sure to not call root dot destroy like that
142

142

00:06:26.020  -->  00:06:28.450
because that would actually terminate your application.
143

143

00:06:28.450  -->  00:06:30.440
Root dot destroy is the function you call
144

144

00:06:30.440  -->  00:06:33.010
when you want to preemptively destroy your application
145

145

00:06:33.010  -->  00:06:34.743
when an interaction happens.
146

146

00:06:36.230  -->  00:06:39.190
Next we also have to pack this button into our root
147

147

00:06:39.190  -->  00:06:41.960
so we will say quit button dot pack
148

148

00:06:41.960  -->  00:06:46.360
and we will say side equal left, fill equal x
149

149

00:06:46.360  -->  00:06:48.470
expand equal true.
150

150

00:06:48.470  -->  00:06:50.520
So same thing as before
151

151

00:06:50.520  -->  00:06:52.220
and now we can press play
152

152

00:06:52.220  -->  00:06:55.650
and you can see that both buttons appear here.
153

153

00:06:55.650  -->  00:06:58.460
You've got your greet button that prints hello world
154

154

00:06:58.460  -->  00:07:01.360
and your quit button that makes the application terminate.
155

155

00:07:02.420  -->  00:07:05.690
Again, I understand that pack can be a bit confusing
156

156

00:07:05.690  -->  00:07:07.420
we're going to look at it in detail
157

157

00:07:07.420  -->  00:07:09.890
in the coming videos, don't worry about it.
158

158

00:07:09.890  -->  00:07:13.040
We have created our first TkInter application
159

159

00:07:13.040  -->  00:07:14.670
where we can print hello world
160

160

00:07:14.670  -->  00:07:16.300
or we can terminate the application
161

161

00:07:16.300  -->  00:07:18.720
we have learned about creating buttons
162

162

00:07:18.720  -->  00:07:21.450
creating the main container window
163

163

00:07:21.450  -->  00:07:26.040
and linking commands or functions to our buttons.
164

164

00:07:26.040  -->  00:07:28.160
These are very important fundamentals
165

165

00:07:28.160  -->  00:07:30.880
of creating TkInter applications.
166

166

00:07:30.880  -->  00:07:32.370
Thanks for joining me in this video

167

00:07:32.370  -->  00:07:33.770
and see you on the next one.
