<v Jose>Hi, guys,nd welcome back.</v>

00:00:02,490  -->  00:00:05,680 line:15% 
In this video, I wanted to tell you about slicing.
3

3

00:00:05,680  -->  00:00:07,480
Slicing is the process of getting
4

4

00:00:07,480  -->  00:00:10,850
a part of a list or other iterable.
5

5

00:00:10,850  -->  00:00:13,120
Imagine you've got a list of your friends,
6

6

00:00:13,120  -->  00:00:14,710
and you wanted your friends
7

7

00:00:14,710  -->  00:00:17,660
between two and four.
8

8

00:00:17,660  -->  00:00:20,070
You can do print, friends,
9

9

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:21,890
and then in square brackets,
10

10

00:00:21,890  -->  00:00:23,863
2 colon 4.
11

11

00:00:24,810  -->  00:00:26,230
And what this means is
12

12

00:00:26,230  -->  00:00:28,910
you're going to get Anna and Bob.
13

13

00:00:28,910  -->  00:00:32,730
That's two, three, and stops at
14

14

00:00:32,730  -->  00:00:35,560
four so it doesn't get you four.
15

15

00:00:35,560  -->  00:00:38,540
This here is list slicing
16

16

00:00:38,540  -->  00:00:40,330
and you can do this with strings as well
17

17

00:00:40,330  -->  00:00:41,890
if you want or with tuples
18

18

00:00:41,890  -->  00:00:42,940
and what it allows you to do
19

19

00:00:42,940  -->  00:00:45,572
is to get a segment of a list
20

20

00:00:45,572  -->  00:00:47,740
or a tuple or a string.
21

21

00:00:47,740  -->  00:00:50,410
It can be really useful at times,
22

22

00:00:50,410  -->  00:00:52,430
but it is particularly useful
23

23

00:00:52,430  -->  00:00:54,290
because you can actually skip
24

24

00:00:54,290  -->  00:00:55,910
some of these numbers.
25

25

00:00:55,910  -->  00:00:58,970
For example, if you want to only get
26

26

00:00:58,970  -->  00:01:00,450
elements in the list,
27

27

00:01:00,450  -->  00:01:02,170
except the first one,
28

28

00:01:02,170  -->  00:01:05,200
you can do one colon nothing.
29

29

00:01:05,200  -->  00:01:08,250
And what that means is one to the end
30

30

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:09,290
of the list.
31

31

00:01:09,290  -->  00:01:10,950
So if you do this, you're going to get
32

32

00:01:10,950  -->  00:01:14,090
all your friends, except the first one.
33

33

00:01:14,090  -->  00:01:16,990
Similarly, if you put four in here,
34

34

00:01:16,990  -->  00:01:19,570
it will start at the very start of the list,
35

35

00:01:19,570  -->  00:01:21,973
colon, and at four.
36

36

00:01:23,610  -->  00:01:25,160
So, we will get Rolf, Charlie,
37

37

00:01:25,160  -->  00:01:26,930
Anna, and Bob, and we will skip
38

38

00:01:26,930  -->  00:01:29,510
the fourth one and any later ones as well.
39

39

00:01:29,510  -->  00:01:31,640
Now, if you remove both numbers
40

40

00:01:31,640  -->  00:01:34,340
so you just do colon inside square brackets,
41

41

00:01:34,340  -->  00:01:36,370
you'll actually get all the elements back,
42

42

00:01:36,370  -->  00:01:38,470
but with a key difference.
43

43

00:01:38,470  -->  00:01:41,200
You're not getting the same list.
44

44

00:01:41,200  -->  00:01:43,150
It is a new list that you're building.
45

45

00:01:43,150  -->  00:01:45,050
And at this point, that doesn't really matter.
46

46

00:01:45,050  -->  00:01:46,970
It doesn't have a lot of meaning to you,
47

47

00:01:46,970  -->  00:01:49,270
but it just gives you a new list, and this is
48

48

00:01:49,270  -->  00:01:50,965
the way to do that in Python. If you want
49

49

00:01:50,965  -->  00:01:53,890
a new list which contains all of the elements
50

50

00:01:53,890  -->  00:01:56,793
of the previous list, you can do this.
51

51

00:01:57,730  -->  00:01:59,980
If you just do this, you're just getting
52

52

00:01:59,980  -->  00:02:02,720
the same list. So exactly the same thing.
53

53

00:02:02,720  -->  00:02:05,030
Now with list slicing you can actually use
54

54

00:02:05,030  -->  00:02:07,510
negative numbers. For example,
55

55

00:02:07,510  -->  00:02:11,650
minus three up to the end of the list.
56

56

00:02:11,650  -->  00:02:13,200
And what this does is it starts counting
57

57

00:02:13,200  -->  00:02:17,780
from the end. So, you will get back, Anna,
58

58

00:02:17,780  -->  00:02:20,530
which is, the element starting from the end,
59

59

00:02:20,530  -->  00:02:23,240
the third one. Bob and Jen.
60

60

00:02:23,240  -->  00:02:27,250
Because again, minus three is the starting point,
61

61

00:02:27,250  -->  00:02:29,360
and when you skip the ending point,
62

62

00:02:29,360  -->  00:02:31,950
that is the end of the list.
63

63

00:02:31,950  -->  00:02:35,410
So you could do minus three to four, for example,
64

64

00:02:35,410  -->  00:02:39,360
and you get Anna and Bob because it stops at four.
65

65

00:02:39,360  -->  00:02:42,030
Or you can do minus three colon empty,
66

66

00:02:42,030  -->  00:02:44,890
and then it'll run to the end of the list.
67

67

00:02:44,890  -->  00:02:49,740
You can do this here so it will go from
68

68

00:02:49,740  -->  00:02:51,190
the start of the list
69

69

00:02:51,190  -->  00:02:53,280
because you haven't put anything in there
70

70

00:02:53,280  -->  00:02:57,660
up to the second to last element: Bob.
71

71

00:02:57,660  -->  00:03:00,910
So you get Rolf, Charlie, and Anna.
72

72

00:03:00,910  -->  00:03:03,210
This is useful if you wanted all your friends
73

73

00:03:03,210  -->  00:03:05,720
except the last two, for example.
74

74

00:03:05,720  -->  00:03:08,350
Finally, you can also do minus three,
75

75

00:03:08,350  -->  00:03:12,350
and for example minus one. And again,
76

76

00:03:12,350  -->  00:03:16,220
that gives you from the third element from the end Anna,
77

77

00:03:16,220  -->  00:03:19,360
up to the first element from the end, Jen.
78

78

00:03:19,360  -->  00:03:22,830
But, it does not include this one as always,
79

79

00:03:22,830  -->  00:03:25,450
so you just get Anna and Bob.
80

80

00:03:25,450  -->  00:03:27,980
There's a lot more stuff you can do with slices,
81

81

00:03:27,980  -->  00:03:30,600
but I just wanted to give you a very quick primer.
82

82

00:03:30,600  -->  00:03:33,440
The first number is the starting point,
83

83

00:03:33,440  -->  00:03:36,580
and the second number is the ending point.
84

84

00:03:36,580  -->  00:03:38,760
We're gonna link, in the researching section
85

85

00:03:38,760  -->  00:03:41,410
of this lecture, a few blog posts that we've written
86

86

00:03:41,410  -->  00:03:45,130
on list slicing. Some of them may be a bit advanced,
87

87

00:03:45,130  -->  00:03:47,400
but you can read them or bookmark them
88

88

00:03:47,400  -->  00:03:49,790
to come back to them in the future.
89

89

00:03:49,790  -->  00:03:51,470
And there's quite a lot of stuff you can do.
90

90

00:03:51,470  -->  00:03:54,110
They are very powerful tools in Python.
91

91

00:03:54,110  -->  00:03:55,660
Thanks for joining me in this video.
92

92

00:03:55,660  -->  00:03:57,360
I hope you've learned something, and I'll see you
93

93

00:03:57,360  -->  00:03:58,193
in the next one.
