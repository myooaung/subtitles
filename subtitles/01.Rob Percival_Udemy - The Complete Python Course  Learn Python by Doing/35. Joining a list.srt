<v ->Hi Guys, and Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,890  -->  00:00:05,340
In this video I wanted to tell you about join.
3

3

00:00:05,340  -->  00:00:09,486
Join allows you to print out your lists a bit better.
4

4

00:00:09,486  -->  00:00:11,300
Imagine you've got a list of friends
5

5

00:00:11,300  -->  00:00:13,080
and you wanna print it out in a string,
6

6

00:00:13,080  -->  00:00:14,740
you wanna say something like,
7

7

00:00:14,740  -->  00:00:18,033
my friends are friends.
8

8

00:00:19,090  -->  00:00:22,210
If we run this, you'll see that you get my friends are,
9

9

00:00:22,210  -->  00:00:24,310
and then square brackets,
10

10

00:00:24,310  -->  00:00:26,310
and then string Rolf string
11

11

00:00:26,310  -->  00:00:28,490
Anne string Charlie.
12

12

00:00:28,490  -->  00:00:30,670
Maybe you wanna print it out a bit more nicely.
13

13

00:00:30,670  -->  00:00:33,250
So what you can do create a new variable,
14

14

00:00:33,250  -->  00:00:34,760
comma_separated, for example.
15

15

00:00:34,760  -->  00:00:38,450
And then type comma space
16

16

00:00:38,450  -->  00:00:41,850
dot join friends.
17

17

00:00:41,850  -->  00:00:43,500
And what this is gonna do is
18

18

00:00:43,500  -->  00:00:47,703
it's going to get the different values in this list,
19

19

00:00:48,820  -->  00:00:51,020
and is gonna join them together
20

20

00:00:51,020  -->  00:00:53,670
using the comma as the separator.
21

21

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:55,030
So here's what you'll end up with.
22

22

00:00:55,030  -->  00:00:59,013
Let's see we print my friends are comma_separated,
23

23

00:01:01,110  -->  00:01:03,360
and then we run this, you'll see that the output
24

24

00:01:03,360  -->  00:01:04,700
is a little bit different.
25

25

00:01:04,700  -->  00:01:08,113
Now you get my friends are Rolf, Anne, Charlie.
26

26

00:01:09,020  -->  00:01:10,380
What's happened here is we've taken
27

27

00:01:10,380  -->  00:01:11,920
each of the values of the list,
28

28

00:01:11,920  -->  00:01:14,620
and we've made one long string
29

29

00:01:14,620  -->  00:01:17,240
which is all of this stuff here.
30

30

00:01:17,240  -->  00:01:20,380
The comma and the space is used as the separator
31

31

00:01:20,380  -->  00:01:22,290
between values in a list,
32

32

00:01:22,290  -->  00:01:24,590
but you can use anything else you want.
33

33

00:01:24,590  -->  00:01:26,440
Now for example, that,
34

34

00:01:26,440  -->  00:01:28,900
it won't be as nice to read, of course,
35

35

00:01:28,900  -->  00:01:32,540
but just to show you that these are how it's printed out.
36

36

00:01:32,540  -->  00:01:35,980
You can see my friends are Rolf and Anne and Charlie.
37

37

00:01:35,980  -->  00:01:37,070
If you wanted this last one
38

38

00:01:37,070  -->  00:01:39,740
to say and so that the output would be my friends
39

39

00:01:39,740  -->  00:01:42,620
are Rolf, Anne, and Charlie,
40

40

00:01:42,620  -->  00:01:44,440
you're actually gonna have to wait a little bit
41

41

00:01:44,440  -->  00:01:46,830
because we need to learn a few more things
42

42

00:01:46,830  -->  00:01:49,080
before we can do specific things
43

43

00:01:49,080  -->  00:01:51,860
just with the last element of the list.
44

44

00:01:51,860  -->  00:01:54,260
When we cover list slicing in the next section,
45

45

00:01:54,260  -->  00:01:55,560
you'll be able to do that.
46

46

00:01:56,440  -->  00:01:57,970
But for now, thanks for joining me,
47

47

00:01:57,970  -->  00:01:59,010
I hope you've learned something,
48

48

00:01:59,010  -->  00:02:00,460
I'll see you next time video.
