<v Instructor>Hi guys, and welcome back.</v>

2

00:00:01.980  -->  00:00:05.230 line:15% 
In this video, we'll finally be learning about functions.
3

3

00:00:05.230  -->  00:00:09.120
We've been using functions such as print, len, or zip,
4

4

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:11.310
but we haven't really learned how they work
5

5

00:00:11.310  -->  00:00:15.280
behind the scenes or even how we can define our own.
6

6

00:00:15.280  -->  00:00:17.470
So that's what we're gonna be looking at in this video.
7

7

00:00:17.470  -->  00:00:20.140
Let's create our first function.
8

8

00:00:20.140  -->  00:00:23.840
Functions always start with the def keyword.
9

9

00:00:23.840  -->  00:00:25.800
Just like if and for,
10

10

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:27.870
def is a Python keyword,
11

11

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:29.710
and after it you put a space,
12

12

00:00:29.710  -->  00:00:30.670
and what this tells Python
13

13

00:00:30.670  -->  00:00:34.390
is that you are about to define a function.
14

14

00:00:34.390  -->  00:00:36.800
So the next thing is the function name.
15

15

00:00:36.800  -->  00:00:39.760
For example, the print function is called print.
16

16

00:00:39.760  -->  00:00:41.620
Len function is called len.
17

17

00:00:41.620  -->  00:00:44.180
So here you can name your function whatever you want,
18

18

00:00:44.180  -->  00:00:45.753
for example, greet.
19

19

00:00:47.190  -->  00:00:50.430
Afterwards, you have to put a pair of brackets.
20

20

00:00:50.430  -->  00:00:54.090
So that's an opening bracket and a closing bracket.
21

21

00:00:54.090  -->  00:00:56.720
Inside the brackets, you can put some stuff,
22

22

00:00:56.720  -->  00:00:58.360
but we're gonna learn how to do that
23

23

00:00:58.360  -->  00:01:00.010
in a future video.
24

24

00:01:00.010  -->  00:01:03.200
After the brackets, the usual colon.
25

25

00:01:03.200  -->  00:01:07.350
And now of course, we have an indented block
26

26

00:01:07.350  -->  00:01:09.303
which will be the body of the function.
27

27

00:01:10.270  -->  00:01:11.839
Let me write some code in here and show you
28

28

00:01:11.839  -->  00:01:13.653
how functions operate.
29

29

00:01:15.700  -->  00:01:17.900
So I've written our usual code here
30

30

00:01:17.900  -->  00:01:20.360
that asks the user for their name,
31

31

00:01:20.360  -->  00:01:22.203
and then prints hello name.
32

32

00:01:23.500  -->  00:01:26.450
This is the body of the function,
33

33

00:01:26.450  -->  00:01:28.960
and the function is called greet.
34

34

00:01:28.960  -->  00:01:32.470
If we run this code such as by pressing the run button,
35

35

00:01:32.470  -->  00:01:35.130
Python would start running at line one
36

36

00:01:35.130  -->  00:01:38.150
and it would encounter this def keyword.
37

37

00:01:38.150  -->  00:01:39.900
When Python encounters a def keyword,
38

38

00:01:39.900  -->  00:01:42.170
it knows you want to define a new function,
39

39

00:01:42.170  -->  00:01:44.053
so it takes note of the name.
40

40

00:01:44.910  -->  00:01:47.440
In addition, if there was anything inside the brackets,
41

41

00:01:47.440  -->  00:01:48.960
it would also look at that,
42

42

00:01:48.960  -->  00:01:51.340
but there's nothing there for now.
43

43

00:01:51.340  -->  00:01:53.610
So Python knows the name of the new function
44

44

00:01:53.610  -->  00:01:54.790
that we've defined,
45

45

00:01:54.790  -->  00:01:58.960
and then Python instantly skips over the entire body.
46

46

00:01:58.960  -->  00:02:01.150
It does not run the body.
47

47

00:02:01.150  -->  00:02:05.230
So these lines here, if we run this programme, never execute.
48

48

00:02:05.230  -->  00:02:06.750
Nothing happens.
49

49

00:02:06.750  -->  00:02:10.690
Nothing is printed out because they are inside the function,
50

50

00:02:10.690  -->  00:02:13.080
and what we've done in this piece of code
51

51

00:02:13.080  -->  00:02:15.010
is we have defined the function.
52

52

00:02:15.010  -->  00:02:18.680
We've created it, but now we need to run it,
53

53

00:02:18.680  -->  00:02:22.900
so we will say greet just like that,
54

54

00:02:22.900  -->  00:02:25.120
and that runs your function.
55

55

00:02:25.120  -->  00:02:26.860
So if we press play,
56

56

00:02:26.860  -->  00:02:28.510
you'll now see enter your name,
57

57

00:02:28.510  -->  00:02:30.410
and we can enter anything we want,
58

58

00:02:30.410  -->  00:02:32.693
and then the print statement as well.
59

59

00:02:33.790  -->  00:02:35.380
You can put as much or as little code
60

60

00:02:35.380  -->  00:02:37.670
as you want inside a function,
61

61

00:02:37.670  -->  00:02:41.800
but you should prefer shorter functions over longer ones.
62

62

00:02:41.800  -->  00:02:44.290
That's because the longer your functions get,
63

63

00:02:44.290  -->  00:02:46.980
the more jumping around you're gonna see in your programmes,
64

64

00:02:46.980  -->  00:02:49.100
and it's gonna be a bit more difficult to read.
65

65

00:02:49.100  -->  00:02:51.910
And remember, you can always create more functions.
66

66

00:02:51.910  -->  00:02:55.900
Just make sure to un-indent and put another def statement
67

67

00:02:55.900  -->  00:02:58.530
if you want to create another function.
68

68

00:02:58.530  -->  00:03:00.710
Functions can call other functions.
69

69

00:03:00.710  -->  00:03:02.500
Calling is the same as executing,
70

70

00:03:02.500  -->  00:03:06.200
so you can always define a function and call it from here,
71

71

00:03:06.200  -->  00:03:07.510
and then you can define another one
72

72

00:03:07.510  -->  00:03:09.360
and call it somewhere else and so on.
73

73

00:03:10.430  -->  00:03:13.260
Something important is that you can only call a function
74

74

00:03:13.260  -->  00:03:15.690
after it's been defined, but not before.
75

75

00:03:15.690  -->  00:03:19.490
So if I move the greet to line one say,
76

76

00:03:19.490  -->  00:03:21.910
now we will get an error because it doesn't know
77

77

00:03:21.910  -->  00:03:26.570
what greet is until after it's run the def statement.
78

78

00:03:26.570  -->  00:03:30.090
Finally, if you try to do something like print name
79

79

00:03:30.090  -->  00:03:33.070
which is the variable that we defined inside the function,
80

80

00:03:33.070  -->  00:03:34.540
you will get an error.
81

81

00:03:34.540  -->  00:03:35.823
So let's try that out.
82

82

00:03:37.340  -->  00:03:40.430
You get an error that says that the name name,
83

83

00:03:40.430  -->  00:03:42.940
which is our variable, is not defined.
84

84

00:03:42.940  -->  00:03:45.000
Although it was defined inside the function,
85

85

00:03:45.000  -->  00:03:47.740
and we actually ran the function,
86

86

00:03:47.740  -->  00:03:50.100
variables created inside a function die
87

87

00:03:50.100  -->  00:03:52.020
when they reach the end of the function.
88

88

00:03:52.020  -->  00:03:54.010
So you can create variables in here
89

89

00:03:54.010  -->  00:03:57.580
that will only be used within the function itself.
90

90

00:03:57.580  -->  00:03:58.930
All right, that's everything for now.
91

91

00:03:58.930  -->  00:04:00.440
Thank you for joining me in this video.
92

92

00:04:00.440  -->  00:04:01.550
I hope you've learned something,
93

93

00:04:01.550  -->  00:04:02.890
and I'll see you in the next one.
94

94

00:04:02.890  -->  00:04:03.723
We're going to be using functions
95

95

00:04:03.723  -->  00:04:05.673 line:15% 
a lot throughout this course.
