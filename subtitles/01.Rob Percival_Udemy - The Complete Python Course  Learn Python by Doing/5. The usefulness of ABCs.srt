<v Instructor>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,620  -->  00:00:04,170
In this video, we're going to briefly talk a bit more
3

3

00:00:04,170  -->  00:00:07,330
about ABCs and why it can be useful
4

4

00:00:07,330  -->  00:00:11,070
to have this functionality num_legs
5

5

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:13,200
defined in another class
6

6

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:16,510
that isn't either of your child classes.
7

7

00:00:17,800  -->  00:00:20,340
The main reason why you'd like this--
8

8

00:00:20,340  -->  00:00:21,630
Well there are two reasons.
9

9

00:00:21,630  -->  00:00:24,270
The first one is that when you read your code
10

10

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:25,270
and you see okay,
11

11

00:00:25,270  -->  00:00:27,900
dog is an animal, monkey's an animal,
12

12

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:31,350
you'll know without reading all of the contents
13

13

00:00:31,350  -->  00:00:34,220
that they will have implemented num_legs.
14

14

00:00:34,220  -->  00:00:35,053
So you'll know that.
15

15

00:00:35,053  -->  00:00:36,940
Otherwise you won't be able to use them.
16

16

00:00:39,100  -->  00:00:42,940
Unless of course these are then subclassed by other things
17

17

00:00:42,940  -->  00:00:44,590
which implements the method.
18

18

00:00:44,590  -->  00:00:46,990
But generally you'll know that
19

19

00:00:46,990  -->  00:00:48,890
they must have implemented the method
20

20

00:00:48,890  -->  00:00:50,940
in order for you to be able to instantiate them,
21

21

00:00:50,940  -->  00:00:52,710
create objects.
22

22

00:00:52,710  -->  00:00:55,940
The other thing that's really useful is that
23

23

00:00:55,940  -->  00:00:57,910
if you have a list of animals,
24

24

00:00:58,800  -->  00:01:01,550
for example a dog which is Rolf
25

25

00:01:01,550  -->  00:01:04,580
and a monkey which is Bob,
26

26

00:01:05,800  -->  00:01:06,770
you can
27

27

00:01:09,030  -->  00:01:11,010
do a.numb_legs.
28

28

00:01:14,785  -->  00:01:15,618
See this?
29

29

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:19,290
This is quite a magical thing.
30

30

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:21,760
And it may not seem it just now.
31

31

00:01:21,760  -->  00:01:22,610
But what you've got here
32

32

00:01:22,610  -->  00:01:25,730
are two completely different objects in this list.
33

33

00:01:25,730  -->  00:01:28,540
But because you know they're animals,
34

34

00:01:28,540  -->  00:01:31,950
you can call a.num_legs on all of them.
35

35

00:01:33,820  -->  00:01:35,840
Okay, so let's run this again.
36

36

00:01:35,840  -->  00:01:37,170
Now you can see we get four and two
37

37

00:01:37,170  -->  00:01:38,490
which is as you'd expect.
38

38

00:01:38,490  -->  00:01:41,480
After all, all that's happening in the background is
39

39

00:01:41,480  -->  00:01:45,030
you know, A is this dog called the num_legs methods.
40

40

00:01:45,030  -->  00:01:45,890
You call this thing here,
41

41

00:01:45,890  -->  00:01:47,620
so nothing magical is going on.
42

42

00:01:47,620  -->  00:01:49,270
A is this monkey,
43

43

00:01:49,270  -->  00:01:52,140
so you call the num_legs method on that.
44

44

00:01:52,140  -->  00:01:53,250
Nothing magical,
45

45

00:01:53,250  -->  00:01:54,750
but none the less the fact that you know
46

46

00:01:54,750  -->  00:01:58,560
that these are animals means that you can do this.
47

47

00:01:59,870  -->  00:02:01,070
Furthermore,
48

48

00:02:02,250  -->  00:02:04,290
you can print whether
49

49

00:02:04,290  -->  00:02:08,070
A is an instance of animal,
50

50

00:02:10,570  -->  00:02:12,220
you should not forget the commas,
51

51

00:02:13,380  -->  00:02:15,770
and you get true every time.
52

52

00:02:15,770  -->  00:02:19,510
This is the same for all inheritance in Python,
53

53

00:02:19,510  -->  00:02:21,900
you know, A is an instance of animal,
54

54

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:25,020
but it has also been extended by the subclass.
55

55

00:02:25,020  -->  00:02:27,540
So Python says yes, this is an animal
56

56

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:31,530
in that it has all the methods and the properties
57

57

00:02:31,530  -->  00:02:32,800
of the animal,
58

58

00:02:32,800  -->  00:02:35,100
but it can also have methods and properties
59

59

00:02:35,100  -->  00:02:39,060
of whatever it is that the class they find as well.
60

60

00:02:40,720  -->  00:02:42,770
The usefulness of this is for you to say
61

61

00:02:42,770  -->  00:02:44,520
okay, these are animals,
62

62

00:02:44,520  -->  00:02:47,780
therefore I can call animal methods on all of them
63

63

00:02:47,780  -->  00:02:51,180
and I don't care whether they are more specific,
64

64

00:02:51,180  -->  00:02:54,020
whether they are dogs or monkeys or cats.
65

65

00:02:54,020  -->  00:02:54,853
Because they're animals,
66

66

00:02:54,853  -->  00:02:56,330
you can call the methods in them,
67

67

00:02:56,330  -->  00:02:59,790
and because you define this num_legs method on the animal,
68

68

00:02:59,790  -->  00:03:01,380
you know that all the subclasses
69

69

00:03:01,380  -->  00:03:03,270
must have implemented that as well
70

70

00:03:03,270  -->  00:03:04,870
so it's safe for you to call it.
71

71

00:03:07,090  -->  00:03:08,890
Now let's go back in the next video
72

72

00:03:08,890  -->  00:03:11,130
to our users and our admins
73

73

00:03:11,130  -->  00:03:12,460
and make a little bit more sense
74

74

00:03:12,460  -->  00:03:14,510
on where this can be useful.
75

75

00:03:14,510  -->  00:03:15,530
As part of that,
76

76

00:03:15,530  -->  00:03:16,740
we're also going to be talking about
77

77

00:03:16,740  -->  00:03:18,810
what an interface is.
78

78

00:03:18,810  -->  00:03:19,760
I'll see you there.
