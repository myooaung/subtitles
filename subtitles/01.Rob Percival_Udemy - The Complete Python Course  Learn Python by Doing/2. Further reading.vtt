<v Instructor>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:02.510
In this video, I just wanted to give you
3

3

00:00:02.510  -->  00:00:05.191
some further reading on type hinting.
4

4

00:00:05.191  -->  00:00:09.110
Type hinting in Python is not a very large thing.
5

5

00:00:09.110  -->  00:00:12.160
There's not a lot to read, not a lot to know.
6

6

00:00:12.160  -->  00:00:14.010
But nonetheless, a couple of sites
7

7

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:15.400
that you may wanna go and visit
8

8

00:00:15.400  -->  00:00:17.265
if you want to learn more about type hinting.
9

9

00:00:17.265  -->  00:00:19.060
First one is of course, the official
10

10

00:00:19.060  -->  00:00:22.242
Python documentation for the typing module.
11

11

00:00:22.242  -->  00:00:24.506
It has a lot of information here
12

12

00:00:24.506  -->  00:00:29.290
about what types are the most fundamental types.
13

13

00:00:29.290  -->  00:00:31.863
Any being any type, the Union that we've looked at,
14

14

00:00:31.863  -->  00:00:34.567
Tuple, Callable, TypeVar, and Generic.
15

15

00:00:34.567  -->  00:00:36.870
And you can read a bit more about them
16

16

00:00:36.870  -->  00:00:39.370
and it also gives you some code samples, for example,
17

17

00:00:39.370  -->  00:00:43.160
on how to define your own types as we saw in the last video.
18

18

00:00:43.160  -->  00:00:46.190
And how to simplify complex type signatures
19

19

00:00:46.190  -->  00:00:49.320
when you have a type that is maybe
20

20

00:00:49.320  -->  00:00:52.890
a list of Tuples, of Tuples that have dicts in them.
21

21

00:00:54.010  -->  00:00:56.070
It tells you a bit about how to simplify them.
22

22

00:00:56.070  -->  00:00:58.430
It talks about new types, it talks about generics
23

23

00:00:58.430  -->  00:01:00.440
and how you can achieve them.
24

24

00:01:00.440  -->  00:01:05.156
Generally, more advanced things, but a useful thing to read.
25

25

00:01:05.156  -->  00:01:09.950
If you want to go in a bit more basic,
26

26

00:01:09.950  -->  00:01:11.912
not certainly more basic, mind you,
27

27

00:01:11.912  -->  00:01:14.740
you can go and read PEP 483.
28

28

00:01:14.740  -->  00:01:17.230
PEP 483 is the theory of type hints.
29

29

00:01:17.230  -->  00:01:20.110
It's meant to be a slightly more beginner-friendly
30

30

00:01:20.110  -->  00:01:24.220
intro to type hinting, but it is not terribly simple,
31

31

00:01:24.220  -->  00:01:26.210
so you still need some focus in here
32

32

00:01:26.210  -->  00:01:28.560
and some time to truly understand it.
33

33

00:01:28.560  -->  00:01:31.370
But essentially, it says why type hinting
34

34

00:01:31.370  -->  00:01:33.710
was added to Python and it gives you a bit
35

35

00:01:33.710  -->  00:01:36.110
of information on how to go about it.
36

36

00:01:36.110  -->  00:01:38.300
So these two are linked in the resources section
37

37

00:01:38.300  -->  00:01:40.184
for this lecture, feel free to have a read through them
38

38

00:01:40.184  -->  00:01:42.780
and ask any questions if you have any.
39

39

00:01:42.780  -->  00:01:44.320
I'll see you on the next video.
