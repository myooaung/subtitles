00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:03,380
<v Jose>Hi and welcome to the curriculum overview.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,380  -->  00:00:04,640
Just a quick video to show you
3

3

00:00:04,640  -->  00:00:07,240
what we're gonna be building in this course.
4

4

00:00:07,240  -->  00:00:08,920
We're gonna build projects
5

5

00:00:08,920  -->  00:00:11,430
and we're always going to be working with a project.
6

6

00:00:11,430  -->  00:00:14,600
The first project we'll build is a movie collection system
7

7

00:00:14,600  -->  00:00:16,670
to manage your movies.
8

8

00:00:16,670  -->  00:00:18,430
We'll learn about Python basics,
9

9

00:00:18,430  -->  00:00:19,910
how to interact with users
10

10

00:00:19,910  -->  00:00:22,530
and send them data and get data back.
11

11

00:00:22,530  -->  00:00:24,690
We'll also learn about if statements to control
12

12

00:00:24,690  -->  00:00:29,440
the flow of our programs and also about functions and loops.
13

13

00:00:29,440  -->  00:00:31,200
Functions would allow us to structure
14

14

00:00:31,200  -->  00:00:34,010
our programs nicer and loops will allow us
15

15

00:00:34,010  -->  00:00:37,330
to repeat things over and over again.
16

16

00:00:37,330  -->  00:00:38,990
Then we move on to project number two,
17

17

00:00:38,990  -->  00:00:41,410
which is gonna be a library manager.
18

18

00:00:41,410  -->  00:00:43,900
Here, we'll learn about object oriented programming,
19

19

00:00:43,900  -->  00:00:47,570
which is a cornerstone of modern software development.
20

20

00:00:47,570  -->  00:00:49,100
We're going to learn about errors
21

21

00:00:49,100  -->  00:00:51,360
and how to handle them in Python
22

22

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:55,740
and also, how Python does flow control using errors,
23

23

00:00:55,740  -->  00:00:58,800
as well as if statements as we learned earlier on.
24

24

00:00:58,800  -->  00:01:01,430
We'll learn about files and how to store things
25

25

00:01:01,430  -->  00:01:03,480
and we'll also learn about relative imports
26

26

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:04,723
and import errors.
27

27

00:01:05,630  -->  00:01:07,603
Then we do an extension to this project
28

28

00:01:07,603  -->  00:01:11,820
that will include database interactions, context managers
29

29

00:01:11,820  -->  00:01:14,773
and type hinting, which is a new feature in Python 3.6.
30

30

00:01:16,706  -->  00:01:19,920
Now after this project, we move onto web scraping.
31

31

00:01:19,920  -->  00:01:23,180
Web scraping is just extracting data from websites
32

32

00:01:23,180  -->  00:01:26,070
so that we can use it in our own programs
33

33

00:01:26,070  -->  00:01:27,720
and we're gonna learn a bunch of these skills
34

34

00:01:27,720  -->  00:01:29,170
in order to do that.
35

35

00:01:29,170  -->  00:01:32,440
We're gonna look at built-in functions, generators,
36

36

00:01:32,440  -->  00:01:35,710
regular expressions, working with date and time,
37

37

00:01:35,710  -->  00:01:37,500
advanced data manipulation,
38

38

00:01:37,500  -->  00:01:39,350
as well as some external libraries
39

39

00:01:39,350  -->  00:01:42,560
that we'll need in order to perform web scraping.
40

40

00:01:42,560  -->  00:01:43,760
Throughout the entire course,
41

41

00:01:43,760  -->  00:01:45,100
as well as building these projects,
42

42

00:01:45,100  -->  00:01:48,560
we'll also be learning a lot of advanced Python knowledge.
43

43

00:01:48,560  -->  00:01:50,580
One of the topics you need to this course
44

44

00:01:50,580  -->  00:01:51,500
is that we'll be covering
45

45

00:01:51,500  -->  00:01:54,290
how to do asynchronous Python development,
46

46

00:01:54,290  -->  00:01:56,570
which is usually a very confusing topic
47

47

00:01:56,570  -->  00:01:58,290
that we will cover in depth.
48

48

00:01:58,290  -->  00:02:00,940
We'll learn about how to use Python in the wild,
49

49

00:02:00,940  -->  00:02:02,980
how to manage your projects with Python,
50

50

00:02:02,980  -->  00:02:04,770
how to do web development using
51

51

00:02:04,770  -->  00:02:07,270
a very popular library called Flask
52

52

00:02:07,270  -->  00:02:10,260
and we'll also learn about algorithms and data structures
53

53

00:02:10,260  -->  00:02:12,360
on how to implement those with Python.
54

54

00:02:12,360  -->  00:02:14,960
This is very useful for interviews, for example.
55

55

00:02:14,960  -->  00:02:17,110
There's also a bunch of popular Python libraries
56

56

00:02:17,110  -->  00:02:20,000
that you can use to do a whole host of other things
57

57

00:02:20,000  -->  00:02:21,780
and we're going to look at some of those
58

58

00:02:21,780  -->  00:02:25,700
so that you know more about what you can do with Python.
59

59

00:02:25,700  -->  00:02:29,020
This is the most complete Python course available today.
60

60

00:02:29,020  -->  00:02:30,720
We're gonna do concise explanations
61

61

00:02:30,720  -->  00:02:31,980
with a little bit of theory,
62

62

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:34,410
then we're gonna give you a whole bunch of examples
63

63

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:35,380
and finally, you're gonna apply
64

64

00:02:35,380  -->  00:02:37,400
your knowledge by building a project
65

65

00:02:37,400  -->  00:02:39,610
and we're gonna do this over and over again
66

66

00:02:39,610  -->  00:02:43,393
so you're always getting practical, up to date knowledge.
67

67

00:02:44,260  -->  00:02:45,780
Thanks for joining me in this video.
68

68

00:02:45,780  -->  00:02:47,230
I'll see you on the next one.
