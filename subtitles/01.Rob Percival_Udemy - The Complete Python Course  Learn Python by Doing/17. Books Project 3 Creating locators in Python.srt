<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,491  -->  00:00:02,933
In this video we're going to start
3

3

00:00:02,933  -->  00:00:05,581
with our book-scraping project.
4

4

00:00:05,581  -->  00:00:07,356
It is going to be set-up very similarly
5

5

00:00:07,356  -->  00:00:09,359
to our quote-scraping project,
6

6

00:00:09,359  -->  00:00:11,894
just so you fully understand how I
7

7

00:00:11,894  -->  00:00:14,364
recommend setting up the scraping projects.
8

8

00:00:14,364  -->  00:00:17,526
So, once again let's create our files.
9

9

00:00:17,526  -->  00:00:22,097
We've got app.py and for this project app.py is going
10

10

00:00:22,097  -->  00:00:24,897
to be a sort of test file type thing
11

11

00:00:24,897  -->  00:00:26,584
where we're going to be running some
12

12

00:00:26,584  -->  00:00:29,943
of the commands written in our other files.
13

13

00:00:29,943  -->  00:00:32,378
Then, we're going to have a few Python packages.
14

14

00:00:32,378  -->  00:00:34,031
Locators is going to be one of them
15

15

00:00:34,031  -->  00:00:34,864
and that's the one we're going
16

16

00:00:34,864  -->  00:00:37,051
to be working on in this video.
17

17

00:00:37,051  -->  00:00:38,776
We are also gonna have pages,
18

18

00:00:38,776  -->  00:00:40,667
of course, for the different pages
19

19

00:00:40,667  -->  00:00:42,500
we'll have and parsers
20

20

00:00:44,424  -->  00:00:47,679
which are for specific sections of the page
21

21

00:00:47,679  -->  00:00:50,131
that we want to extract data from.
22

22

00:00:50,131  -->  00:00:51,865
So, pages and parsers pretty similar.
23

23

00:00:51,865  -->  00:00:54,750
Think of it as sort of containers and components
24

24

00:00:54,750  -->  00:00:57,984
if you've ever done any component development.
25

25

00:00:57,984  -->  00:01:01,029
Or, just as, you know, whole pages
26

26

00:01:01,029  -->  00:01:03,963
that interact with parsers to extract information.
27

27

00:01:03,963  -->  00:01:07,691
In the locators, we're gonna add two files for now.
28

28

00:01:07,691  -->  00:01:10,318
The old books page, which is going
29

29

00:01:10,318  -->  00:01:13,693
to be that page we've already seen, and we're also going
30

30

00:01:13,693  -->  00:01:17,276
to add books locators, book locators. Okay?
31

31

00:01:24,048  -->  00:01:26,347
Inside the book locators we are going
32

32

00:01:26,347  -->  00:01:28,309
to create a class BookLocators:
33

33

00:01:28,309  -->  00:01:31,172
And, in here, we are going to put in the locators
34

34

00:01:31,172  -->  00:01:33,599
that we came up with earlier
35

35

00:01:33,599  -->  00:01:35,089
that I showed you in the previous video
36

36

00:01:35,089  -->  00:01:36,356
in that presentation.
37

37

00:01:36,356  -->  00:01:39,302
We're gonna have a NAME_LOCATOR
38

38

00:01:39,302  -->  00:01:43,385
and this is going to be article.product_pod h3 a'
39

39

00:01:44,408  -->  00:01:46,838
And, we're gonna press command d or control d
40

40

00:01:46,838  -->  00:01:48,038
if you're on Windows.
41

41

00:01:48,038  -->  00:01:49,448
Just duplicate this and we're gonna
42

42

00:01:49,448  -->  00:01:51,814
name this Link_Locator.
43

43

00:01:51,814  -->  00:01:53,974
Notice how these two are the same for now?
44

44

00:01:53,974  -->  00:01:55,866
But, I'm keeping them as a separate locators
45

45

00:01:55,866  -->  00:01:59,098
just in case the website decides to change later on.
46

46

00:01:59,098  -->  00:02:00,298
This is going to make my programme
47

47

00:02:00,298  -->  00:02:02,371
a little bit more resilient.
48

48

00:02:02,371  -->  00:02:04,156
Then, we're gonna have a PRICE_LOCATOR
49

49

00:02:04,156  -->  00:02:07,279
which is going to be used to get that p tag
50

50

00:02:07,279  -->  00:02:08,995
that contains the price.
51

51

00:02:08,995  -->  00:02:12,662
So, again article.product_pod p.price_color'
52

52

00:02:14,313  -->  00:02:17,734
It's interesting that it's got this class here price colour.
53

53

00:02:17,734  -->  00:02:21,494
That's just because the price of the item has a colour,
54

54

00:02:21,494  -->  00:02:23,336
so that's what the website's decided to go for
55

55

00:02:23,336  -->  00:02:26,395
in terms of the class name and but depending on the website,
56

56

00:02:26,395  -->  00:02:28,748
it may be different.
57

57

00:02:28,748  -->  00:02:30,125
Finally, we've got a RATING_LOCATOR
58

58

00:02:30,125  -->  00:02:34,042
Which again, article.product_pod p.star-rating'
59

59

00:02:35,380  -->  00:02:36,840
If you make any typos on this,
60

60

00:02:36,840  -->  00:02:38,777
you'll get some errors later on.
61

61

00:02:38,777  -->  00:02:40,726
So, just make sure that these are correct.
62

62

00:02:40,726  -->  00:02:43,057
All of them have a article.product.pod to start
63

63

00:02:43,057  -->  00:02:48,057
because the entire book is enclosed in this article tag.
64

64

00:02:48,502  -->  00:02:50,529
And, then we are looking for a h3
65

65

00:02:50,529  -->  00:02:53,220
within that article anywhere inside it.
66

66

00:02:53,220  -->  00:02:56,394
And, then a that should be within this h3.
67

67

00:02:56,394  -->  00:02:59,465
Similarly here and same with these.
68

68

00:02:59,465  -->  00:03:03,183
Now, let's go over to our page locators.
69

69

00:03:03,183  -->  00:03:06,850
We're gonna have class AllBooksPageLocators:
70

70

00:03:08,540  -->  00:03:10,809
And, here we're going to just have one thing for now.
71

71

00:03:10,809  -->  00:03:12,930
We're going to add more later.
72

72

00:03:12,930  -->  00:03:16,558
And, this is going to allow us to find all of the books.
73

73

00:03:16,558  -->  00:03:20,618
So, the locator that we place here should be able to find
74

74

00:03:20,618  -->  00:03:23,618
each list item that contains a book.
75

75

00:03:24,587  -->  00:03:27,177
The contents of that list item we're then gonna pass
76

76

00:03:27,177  -->  00:03:30,500
to the book parser which is going to use these locators
77

77

00:03:30,500  -->  00:03:33,343
to locate exact information.
78

78

00:03:33,343  -->  00:03:34,208
So, here we're gonna go
79

79

00:03:34,208  -->  00:03:37,458
for div.page_inner section li.col-xs-6'
80

80

00:03:43,177  -->  00:03:45,341
If you want to be more explicit and you want
81

81

00:03:45,341  -->  00:03:50,168
to add all of the classes inside this li tag you can do that
82

82

00:03:50,168  -->  00:03:53,751
by just doing .col-sm-4.col-md-3.col-lg-3'.
83

83

00:03:57,615  -->  00:03:59,540
So, I'm gonna leave it as this.
84

84

00:03:59,540  -->  00:04:01,805
Feel free to skip on these classes,
85

85

00:04:01,805  -->  00:04:03,490
or maybe just include one of them.
86

86

00:04:03,490  -->  00:04:05,119
But, I'd recommend including at least one class.
87

87

00:04:05,119  -->  00:04:06,708
Just in case there are other list items
88

88

00:04:06,708  -->  00:04:08,710
elsewhere on the page.
89

89

00:04:08,710  -->  00:04:10,557
Well, elsewhere inside this section,
90

90

00:04:10,557  -->  00:04:12,690
that people may get confused.
91

91

00:04:12,690  -->  00:04:14,241
So, make sure to include at least one
92

92

00:04:14,241  -->  00:04:17,375
of the classes just to be sure.
93

93

00:04:17,375  -->  00:04:19,354
Now, with these locators we are ready now
94

94

00:04:19,354  -->  00:04:21,539
to move on to the next video.
95

95

00:04:21,539  -->  00:04:24,650
We're going to be using them to extract information.
96

96

00:04:24,650  -->  00:04:25,841
I'll see you there.
