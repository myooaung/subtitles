<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,840  -->  00:00:04,780
Thank you for joining me in this section.
3

3

00:00:04,780  -->  00:00:07,040
I hope you've learned something and I hope you will be
4

4

00:00:07,040  -->  00:00:10,150
testing your applications as you go along.
5

5

00:00:10,150  -->  00:00:12,120
Remember you can use this testing knowledge
6

6

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:13,480
everywhere else in the course.
7

7

00:00:13,480  -->  00:00:15,880
So if you've got already some Python code
8

8

00:00:15,880  -->  00:00:19,000
you can write some tests for it to learn more.
9

9

00:00:19,000  -->  00:00:21,970
Also, the official documentation while a bit lengthy
10

10

00:00:21,970  -->  00:00:24,800
and can be a bit confusing is really good.
11

11

00:00:24,800  -->  00:00:26,573
So I would recommend reading it.
12

12

00:00:27,500  -->  00:00:29,660
Finally, just some parting words.
13

13

00:00:29,660  -->  00:00:32,600
Try to write simple code.
14

14

00:00:32,600  -->  00:00:35,340
It's often much easier to over-complicate code
15

15

00:00:35,340  -->  00:00:39,560
than to write simple code, but simple code is much simpler
16

16

00:00:39,560  -->  00:00:43,540
to test and much simpler to maintain longer term,
17

17

00:00:43,540  -->  00:00:46,330
especially if you're working in a team with other people,
18

18

00:00:46,330  -->  00:00:49,210
focusing on writing clean, simple code
19

19

00:00:49,210  -->  00:00:51,020
will really help you, especially if you're wanting
20

20

00:00:51,020  -->  00:00:53,563
to take that next step in your career.
21

21

00:00:54,890  -->  00:00:56,410
Thanks for joining me in this section.
22

22

00:00:56,410  -->  00:00:57,823
I'll see you next time.
