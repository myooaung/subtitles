<v Jose>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,292  -->  00:00:03,650
In this video I just wanted to guide you through
3

3

00:00:03,650  -->  00:00:07,222
exactly what we're going to be getting from our html
4

4

00:00:07,222  -->  00:00:11,739
and the path or the locators that we're going to be getting,
5

5

00:00:11,739  -->  00:00:13,197
just because I know it's not so easy
6

6

00:00:13,197  -->  00:00:16,092
to look at in the browser.
7

7

00:00:16,092  -->  00:00:18,797
So this is our site, as you know.
8

8

00:00:18,797  -->  00:00:21,609
And we're going to start crafting
9

9

00:00:21,609  -->  00:00:24,439
our locators for the books.
10

10

00:00:24,439  -->  00:00:26,843
So we're going to retrieve each book as an entity
11

11

00:00:26,843  -->  00:00:30,030
and we're going to feed that to our book parser.
12

12

00:00:30,030  -->  00:00:32,863
So this is the div dot page inner.
13

13

00:00:34,139  -->  00:00:35,903
It contains essentially all of the page content
14

14

00:00:35,903  -->  00:00:37,510
except the header.
15

15

00:00:37,510  -->  00:00:39,598
The only reason why you might want to scrape the header
16

16

00:00:39,598  -->  00:00:42,518
is if you don't know the title of your site.
17

17

00:00:42,518  -->  00:00:44,936
But because we know that, we can start here
18

18

00:00:44,936  -->  00:00:47,941
at the div dot page underscore inner.
19

19

00:00:47,941  -->  00:00:52,774
Inside that we have a section which contains this content,
20

20

00:00:53,775  -->  00:00:56,470
so as soon as we start narrowing down our locator
21

21

00:00:56,470  -->  00:01:00,470
into the section, it loses context of the topics
22

22

00:01:01,404  -->  00:01:03,030
at the site and the breadcrumbs
23

23

00:01:03,030  -->  00:01:05,628
and the number of results and things like that.
24

24

00:01:05,628  -->  00:01:09,907
And finally each individual book is a list item.
25

25

00:01:09,907  -->  00:01:13,958
And list items on this website are each individual book
26

26

00:01:13,958  -->  00:01:18,958
and they also have a few classes in them, like col xs 6.
27

27

00:01:19,213  -->  00:01:22,046
These columns are used for sizing,
28

28

00:01:23,198  -->  00:01:25,871
and so at this point in time the website has decided
29

29

00:01:25,871  -->  00:01:28,525
to use these sizes for the columns
30

30

00:01:28,525  -->  00:01:31,323
but they may change in the future
31

31

00:01:31,323  -->  00:01:34,015
so just keep and eye out in case it's not exactly
32

32

00:01:34,015  -->  00:01:38,852
this col xs 6 class, in case it's a bit different.
33

33

00:01:38,852  -->  00:01:42,165
Okay, so when we use this locator and we ask
34

34

00:01:42,165  -->  00:01:45,680
BeautifulSoup to you know select all of the elements,
35

35

00:01:45,680  -->  00:01:48,770
it's gonna give us a bunch of tags,
36

36

00:01:48,770  -->  00:01:52,009
which are gonna be these li tags that it has found
37

37

00:01:52,009  -->  00:01:55,700
and each tag contains the info for a single book
38

38

00:01:55,700  -->  00:01:59,668
but we must still go deeper and get that information out
39

39

00:01:59,668  -->  00:02:02,076
so we need some deeper locators.
40

40

00:02:02,076  -->  00:02:03,908
The locators I'm about to show you
41

41

00:02:03,908  -->  00:02:07,075
are those that are inside this li tag.
42

42

00:02:08,653  -->  00:02:12,712
So for example, the title or the name of the book,
43

43

00:02:12,712  -->  00:02:15,552
we can extract from that element there in the green,
44

44

00:02:15,552  -->  00:02:19,702
and that will be article dot product pod h3 a.
45

45

00:02:19,702  -->  00:02:23,356
So inside the article dot product pod tag,
46

46

00:02:23,356  -->  00:02:25,750
which is essentially the entire book as well,
47

47

00:02:25,750  -->  00:02:28,395
there is an h3 tag, a heading tag,
48

48

00:02:28,395  -->  00:02:32,635
and inside that h3 there's an a tag, which is a link.
49

49

00:02:32,635  -->  00:02:36,694
And alight in the dot dot dot is the text content
50

50

00:02:36,694  -->  00:02:38,425
inside that tag.
51

51

00:02:38,425  -->  00:02:41,717
But also the tag has a couple other properties,
52

52

00:02:41,717  -->  00:02:44,228
and we can extract the book's title
53

53

00:02:44,228  -->  00:02:47,083
from those properties as well.
54

54

00:02:47,083  -->  00:02:50,761
If we wanted the link and, for example if we wanted to
55

55

00:02:50,761  -->  00:02:53,946
click through and go to the book page,
56

56

00:02:53,946  -->  00:02:58,329
not the whole set of books but just the individual book
57

57

00:02:58,329  -->  00:02:59,400
in case we wanted to, sort of,
58

58

00:02:59,400  -->  00:03:00,803
read some more information about the book
59

59

00:03:00,803  -->  00:03:02,842
or scrape some more information about the book,
60

60

00:03:02,842  -->  00:03:05,971
there is a link in that title that you can click and
61

61

00:03:05,971  -->  00:03:09,609
go to the other page and of course the selector or
62

62

00:03:09,609  -->  00:03:11,038
the locator is gonna be the same
63

63

00:03:11,038  -->  00:03:13,652
if we wanna extract the link, only we're gonna have to
64

64

00:03:13,652  -->  00:03:16,402
access the href property of that.
65

65

00:03:18,263  -->  00:03:20,469
If you wanted to get the price out,
66

66

00:03:20,469  -->  00:03:23,596
that element down there, you will be looking for
67

67

00:03:23,596  -->  00:03:26,017
article dot product pod and the name site
68

68

00:03:26,017  -->  00:03:29,997
that there's a p tag which has a class price colour.
69

69

00:03:29,997  -->  00:03:33,594
So we can use that tag to extract the price
70

70

00:03:33,594  -->  00:03:35,974
and then you'll be using regular expressions
71

71

00:03:35,974  -->  00:03:38,815
to actually get the price out as a number.
72

72

00:03:38,815  -->  00:03:40,032
We've looked at that in the past
73

73

00:03:40,032  -->  00:03:42,482
in the regular special section how to do that.
74

74

00:03:42,482  -->  00:03:45,567
We're gonna go over it again in this section.
75

75

00:03:45,567  -->  00:03:47,877
Finally we're gonna look at the rating.
76

76

00:03:47,877  -->  00:03:50,223
This book has three stars and if we wanted
77

77

00:03:50,223  -->  00:03:52,436
to get the star rating, we are looking for
78

78

00:03:52,436  -->  00:03:57,123
article dot product pod and then p dot star dash rating.
79

79

00:03:57,123  -->  00:03:59,318
Notice the dash is not an underscore,
80

80

00:03:59,318  -->  00:04:01,885
just one of the quirks of this website.
81

81

00:04:01,885  -->  00:04:05,469
We'll also find that the number of stars
82

82

00:04:05,469  -->  00:04:10,158
that we can see is not what we're gonna be scraping
83

83

00:04:10,158  -->  00:04:13,607
so this p tag here, this p dot star rating,
84

84

00:04:13,607  -->  00:04:17,186
actually has a property that contains the rating
85

85

00:04:17,186  -->  00:04:18,870
so we're gonna be using that instead of
86

86

00:04:18,870  -->  00:04:21,064
looking at the number of stars that are filled.
87

87

00:04:21,064  -->  00:04:23,278
That's just a bit more difficult.
88

88

00:04:23,278  -->  00:04:27,278
Okay so just to recap, each book is that li tag.
89

89

00:04:28,440  -->  00:04:31,709
The name of the book which is inside the li tag
90

90

00:04:31,709  -->  00:04:34,577
is the article dot product pod h3 a.
91

91

00:04:34,577  -->  00:04:36,648
The link is also in that same tag.
92

92

00:04:36,648  -->  00:04:39,322
The price is inside p dot price colour.
93

93

00:04:39,322  -->  00:04:42,335
And the rating is inside p dot star dash rating.
94

94

00:04:42,335  -->  00:04:46,824
So with this we can construct our locator files.
95

95

00:04:46,824  -->  00:04:49,491
Let's do that in the next video.
