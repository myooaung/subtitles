<v ->Hi guys and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,140  -->  00:00:03,970
In this video I wanted to talk with you briefly
3

3

00:00:03,970  -->  00:00:05,890
about the project we're gonna be building in
4

4

00:00:05,890  -->  00:00:07,160
the next few videos.
5

5

00:00:07,160  -->  00:00:09,630
And it is this text editor you see here.
6

6

00:00:09,630  -->  00:00:14,500
In this text editor we can type, we can see the saved
7

7

00:00:14,500  -->  00:00:18,090
or unsaved status of any element,
8

8

00:00:18,090  -->  00:00:23,090
we can create new elements using that or a keyboard shortcut
9

9

00:00:23,549  -->  00:00:28,130
and of course we can save files and they get written to
10

10

00:00:28,130  -->  00:00:32,813
the disc and we can also open files so that we can
11

11

00:00:32,813  -->  00:00:35,760
edit them with our text editor.
12

12

00:00:35,760  -->  00:00:38,830
It may look complicated but there's actually a lot
13

13

00:00:38,830  -->  00:00:41,395
of different inter components here working together
14

14

00:00:41,395  -->  00:00:43,504
that make developing something like this fairly
15

15

00:00:43,504  -->  00:00:45,402
straight forward.
16

16

00:00:45,402  -->  00:00:47,956
We're gonna develop it in just a few videos
17

17

00:00:47,956  -->  00:00:51,060
so let's get started in the very next one.
18

18

00:00:51,060  -->  00:00:52,093
I'll see you there.
