00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:01.184
<v Narrator>Hi there,</v>
1

2
00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:04.739
and welcome to your second milestone project.
2

3
00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:06.830
This project is going to be pretty cool.
3

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.268
It's going to allow us to store the books
4

5
00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:11.141
we're reading and then go back
5

6
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:12.397
and mark them as read.
6

7
00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:13.529
So, for example, we can keep track
7

8
00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.665
of everything we've read so far
8

9
00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.464
and what we want to read in the future.
9

10
00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:19.232
The most exciting part about this project though,
10

11
00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.724
is the way we're going to build it.
11

12
00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:26.172
We're going to start by using an in memory database,
12

13
00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:28.976
which is just a Python list.
13

14
00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:31.000
Then we're going to extend it,
14

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.726
so that instead of saving things in a list,
15

16
00:00:32.726 --> 00:00:35.167
it saves them in a file.
16

17
00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.579
And afterwards, we're going to extend it further still,
17

18
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.912
like saving things to a SQL database.
18

19
00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.712
Building the project in these three distinct steps
19

20
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:46.278
is going to help us really understand
20

21
00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:47.796
what's going on behind the scenes.
21

22
00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:50.437
So please bear with me as we go through this.
22

23
00:00:50.437 --> 00:00:52.138
We're going to have some coding sessions,
23

24
00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:54.570
like the one you see in your video right now
24

25
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.565
interspersed with some slightly more
25

26
00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:59.249
theoretical sessions where we'll talk about
26

27
00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:00.822
databases and how they work,
27

28
00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:03.067
and also how to use them.
28

29
00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:05.493
If you don't know what a database is, don't worry.
29

30
00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:07.190
Through this section, you're going
30

31
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.839
to understand exactly what goes on
31

32
00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:12.672
inside a database and why we want to use them.
32

33
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.674
Your milestone project, though,
33

34
00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.924
is going to be a book list.
34

35
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:20.517
So in the next lecture,
35

36
00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:22.687
you're going to have a brief explaining exactly
36

37
00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:25.926
what I want you to do for this project.
37

38
00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:27.971
But I also wanted to give you some
38

39
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:29.979
brief instructions in this video,
39

40
00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.283
just to help you along your way.
40

41
00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:35.999
Our project is going to have two files.
41

42
00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:38.582
It's going to have an app file,
42

43
00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:41.386
and it's also going to have a package,
43

44
00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:43.719
which is going to be called utils.
44

45
00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.052
Not ITOs, utils.
45

46
00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:47.853
And inside utils, we're going to have another
46

47
00:01:47.853 --> 00:01:51.436
file which we're going to call database.py.
47

48
00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.691
This database.py is going to be
48

49
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.774
concerned with storing and retrieving
49

50
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.520
books from a list.
50

51
00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:03.590
Okay, so it's not really going to be
51

52
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.476
a SQL database just now it's going to be
52

53
00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:07.387
an in memory database.
53

54
00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:09.877
And we're going to have a books list,
54

55
00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:13.372
which is going to be an empty list to begin with.
55

56
00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:15.122
And we're also going to have some functions here
56

57
00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:16.918
to add a new book to our list,
57

58
00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:19.088
to retrieve the books from our list,
58

59
00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:20.069
and so forth.
59

60
00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.600
The brief is going to have a lot more information
60

61
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.606
on exactly the layout of this file
61

62
00:02:23.606 --> 00:02:26.751
and how it's going to be used.
62

63
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:30.351
In app.py, we're going to have our user menu.
63

64
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:31.308
Of course, this is going to be
64

65
00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:32.894
a text based application,
65

66
00:02:32.894 --> 00:02:35.732
we haven't looked at making graphical interfaces just yet.
66

67
00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:39.227
So we're going to do everything via text.
67

68
00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:42.727
For that, we are going to have two things.
68

69
00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:46.800
First one is we are going to import database
69

70
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.116
in order that we can deal with saving things
70

71
00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:51.487
to our books list and so forth.
71

72
00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:54.795
And we're also going to have a user choice.
72

73
00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:56.467
And this is going to be a multi-line string,
73

74
00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:58.587
which is going to describe to the user
74

75
00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:00.385
what they can do.
75

76
00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:03.166
So I am going to just copy it from my notes here.
76

77
00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.666
And like so, your choice here.
77

78
00:03:09.912 --> 00:03:10.899
So the user choice is what we're
78

79
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.350
going to print out for the user
79

80
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.670
to know what sort of things they can type.
80

81
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.503
And that's going to be
81

82
00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:18.544
'a' to add a new book, 'l' to list all books,
82

83
00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:22.275
'r' to mark a book as read, 'd' to delete a book,
83

84
00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:24.047
and 'q' to quit.
84

85
00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:25.400
We've already created a menu
85

86
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.918
for our last milestone project,
86

87
00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:28.998
so you know how this goes.
87

88
00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:31.472
We're going to have a menu here.
88

89
00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:33.231
And then we are going to sort of
89

90
00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:34.814
get the user input.
90

91
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.929
And then we're going to have a user input
91

92
00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.853
is not 'q', y loop.
92

93
00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.916
And here we're going to ask the user stuff.
93

94
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.115
Sorry, not going to ask the user stuff,
94

95
00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:46.948
but we're going to actually
95

96
00:03:46.948 --> 00:03:48.096
deal with the user's inputs.
96

97
00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:49.849
So if they enter 'a', we're going to call
97

98
00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.868
a function that adds a book.
98

99
00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:52.983
If they enter 'l',
99

100
00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:55.464
we're going to call a function that lists all books,
100

101
00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:56.566
and so forth.
101

102
00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:59.626
So down here, you'll probably have
102

103
00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:03.557
something that looks like prompt_add_book.
103

104
00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:05.140
And def list_books.
104

105
00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:08.289
And def prompt_read_book.
105

106
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.060
And def prompt_delete_book.
106

107
00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:14.249
Like so.
107

108
00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.778
So each of these functions should do something.
108

109
00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:19.102
This one's probably going to ask for
109

110
00:04:19.102 --> 00:04:20.852
book name and author.
110

111
00:04:22.744 --> 00:04:26.518
This one's gonna show all the books in our list.
111

112
00:04:26.518 --> 00:04:29.313
This one's probably ask for book name
112

113
00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:32.313
and change it to 'read' in our list.
113

114
00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:37.466
And this one's going to remove book from list.
114

115
00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:40.554
Ask for book name and remove book from list.
115

116
00:04:40.554 --> 00:04:44.052
So these are probably going to be your functions.
116

117
00:04:44.052 --> 00:04:45.691
In the prompt add book,
117

118
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:48.302
you're going to be interacting with the database file
118

119
00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:51.135
to add a new book to our database.
119

120
00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:53.836
What I'm thinking is a database file
120

121
00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:56.191
will have something like add_book.
121

122
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.292
And that's going to take the book name and author.
122

123
00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:00.992
And there's probably going to do something
123

124
00:05:00.992 --> 00:05:03.492
like books_append name is name
124

125
00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:09.446
and author is author, and read is false.
125

126
00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:13.869
Because it's not been read at the start.
126

127
00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:14.702
Okay.
127

128
00:05:15.546 --> 00:05:17.107
Now you'll have to create other functions here
128

129
00:05:17.107 --> 00:05:18.994
to do something like retrieve all
129

130
00:05:18.994 --> 00:05:20.968
the books from our list.
130

131
00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:22.202
You're going to have to add something
131

132
00:05:22.202 --> 00:05:25.675
to modify a book so it is now read,
132

133
00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:27.888
and of course, delete a book.
133

134
00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:28.919
And also you'll have to implement
134

135
00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.169
this menu here and all these functions.
135

136
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:34.708
Read the brief in the very next lecture.
136

137
00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:35.849
It's got a bunch more information
137

138
00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.544
on exactly the motivation behind this project
138

139
00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:42.354
and also some hints and tips to help you
139

140
00:05:42.354 --> 00:05:43.428
along your way.
140

141
00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:46.079
But please do attempt this on your own
141

142
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:49.123
before moving onto the next programming video
142

143
00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:51.119
where we'll be implementing this.
143

144
00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:52.702
I'll see you soon.
