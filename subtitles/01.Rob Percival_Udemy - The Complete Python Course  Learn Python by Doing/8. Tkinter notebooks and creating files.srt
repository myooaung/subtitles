<v ->Hi, guys, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,030  -->  00:00:05,550
In this video we're going to be creating our notebook,
3

3

00:00:05,550  -->  00:00:09,210
and this is the start of our text editor.
4

4

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:10,740
Let's create our notebook.
5

5

00:00:10,740  -->  00:00:14,188
So we'll say notebook equal ttk.notebook
6

6

00:00:14,188  -->  00:00:17,750
and put it inside main.
7

7

00:00:17,750  -->  00:00:21,040
Next up, let's say notebook.pack,
8

8

00:00:21,040  -->  00:00:24,970
and we're gonna type fill for both and expand equal true.
9

9

00:00:24,970  -->  00:00:27,900
What this is gonna mean since this is the only element
10

10

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:30,200
inside our main frame,
11

11

00:00:30,200  -->  00:00:33,450
and the frame is also doing fill both and expand true,
12

12

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:34,640
it means that this notebook is going to
13

13

00:00:34,640  -->  00:00:36,330
take up the entire window.
14

14

00:00:36,330  -->  00:00:37,163
By the way, notice that
15

15

00:00:37,163  -->  00:00:40,140
these pack methods don't have a side.
16

16

00:00:40,140  -->  00:00:43,230
That means side top by default.
17

17

00:00:43,230  -->  00:00:46,110
So let's press play in our app, and you'll see
18

18

00:00:47,510  -->  00:00:49,750
something that seems like nothing.
19

19

00:00:49,750  -->  00:00:52,080
That is because we have created a notebook,
20

20

00:00:52,080  -->  00:00:56,810
but we haven't created any files inside the notebook.
21

21

00:00:56,810  -->  00:00:58,033
Let's do that now.
22

22

00:01:00,330  -->  00:01:03,670
We'll say text_area equal tk.text,
23

23

00:01:03,670  -->  00:01:06,170
and we will put it inside the notebook.
24

24

00:01:06,170  -->  00:01:09,890
Text is different from entry in that text is a text area,
25

25

00:01:09,890  -->  00:01:12,320
so it takes up more room.
26

26

00:01:12,320  -->  00:01:15,450
It takes up some vertical space as well as horizontal space.
27

27

00:01:15,450  -->  00:01:18,550
Notice that the entry fields are just one liners.
28

28

00:01:18,550  -->  00:01:20,193
Text are multi-line.
29

29

00:01:21,120  -->  00:01:24,060
Then we will pack it with again
30

30

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:28,398
fill both and expand equal true,
31

31

00:01:28,398  -->  00:01:33,398
and we will say notebook.add text area,
32

32

00:01:33,800  -->  00:01:37,213
and the title is going to be untitled for now.
33

33

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:40,930
All right, let's press play.
34

34

00:01:40,930  -->  00:01:42,900
And you'll see that we are here.
35

35

00:01:42,900  -->  00:01:47,900
We have created our text area, and we have now a full width,
36

36

00:01:48,150  -->  00:01:49,963
full height element.
37

37

00:01:50,800  -->  00:01:53,780
Padx of one means that there is one element of padding
38

38

00:01:53,780  -->  00:01:55,390
on the left and the right.
39

39

00:01:55,390  -->  00:01:57,630
Pady of four comma zero
40

40

00:01:57,630  -->  00:01:59,920
means that is four of padding on the top
41

41

00:01:59,920  -->  00:02:01,370
and none on the bottom.
42

42

00:02:01,370  -->  00:02:03,273
You can get rid of those if you like.
43

43

00:02:04,810  -->  00:02:09,780
Next up, what we're gonna do is notebook.select text area,
44

44

00:02:09,780  -->  00:02:12,017
and what that's gonna do is as soon as you press play,
45

45

00:02:12,017  -->  00:02:15,950
that is going to be selected, which is the same as before;
46

46

00:02:15,950  -->  00:02:19,290
however, when you create multiple of these,
47

47

00:02:19,290  -->  00:02:22,750
you want to select the latest one you created.
48

48

00:02:22,750  -->  00:02:25,890
So what we'll do is we're going to put all of this here
49

49

00:02:25,890  -->  00:02:30,113
inside a function, which I'm going to call create file.
50

50

00:02:31,760  -->  00:02:35,780
Now, we can run create file down here,
51

51

00:02:35,780  -->  00:02:40,250
and it will create the same thing that we had before.
52

52

00:02:40,250  -->  00:02:44,300
But if we run create file multiple times,
53

53

00:02:44,300  -->  00:02:48,200
then we will always have the last one selected.
54

54

00:02:48,200  -->  00:02:50,840
This is going to be useful because when we create a new file
55

55

00:02:50,840  -->  00:02:53,150
using our menu or something like that,
56

56

00:02:53,150  -->  00:02:56,470
we do want to select the file that we've just created.
57

57

00:02:56,470  -->  00:02:57,670
That's why that's there.
58

58

00:02:58,770  -->  00:03:01,110
All right, so this is how you create a notebook,
59

59

00:03:01,110  -->  00:03:02,730
which is a collection of tabs
60

60

00:03:02,730  -->  00:03:05,050
with different elements inside it,
61

61

00:03:05,050  -->  00:03:06,920
and how you create text areas
62

62

00:03:06,920  -->  00:03:09,130
to put inside each of the tabs.
63

63

00:03:09,130  -->  00:03:11,010
Notice that you don't have to put text areas
64

64

00:03:11,010  -->  00:03:11,990
inside these tabs.
65

65

00:03:11,990  -->  00:03:13,740
You can put whatever you want in them,
66

66

00:03:13,740  -->  00:03:16,010
and so potentially, this could be a way of creating
67

67

00:03:16,010  -->  00:03:18,233
a tabbed menu if you wanted.
68

68

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:20,660
That's everything for this video.
69

69

00:03:20,660  -->  00:03:21,590
Thank you for joining me.
70

70

00:03:21,590  -->  00:03:22,970
Now let's move on to the next one
71

71

00:03:22,970  -->  00:03:24,930
where we're going to be adding a menu
72

72

00:03:24,930  -->  00:03:27,000
so that we can create more files.
73

73

00:03:27,000  -->  00:03:28,050
I will see you there.
