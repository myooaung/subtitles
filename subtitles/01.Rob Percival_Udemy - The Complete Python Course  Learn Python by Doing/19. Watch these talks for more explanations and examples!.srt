<v Instructor>Hi, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,490  -->  00:00:05,230 line:15% 
In this video I wanted to encourage you to watch the talks.
3

3

00:00:05,230  -->  00:00:07,790
I've linked them as resources through this lecture.
4

4

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:11,970
Now that we've explained a lot of how concurrency,
5

5

00:00:11,970  -->  00:00:14,180
doing multiple things at the same time
6

6

00:00:14,180  -->  00:00:16,530
works behind the scenes,
7

7

00:00:16,530  -->  00:00:17,950
I think it's time for someone to walk you
8

8

00:00:17,950  -->  00:00:19,120
through a couple examples,
9

9

00:00:19,120  -->  00:00:22,331
and the reason I've picked these guys and these talks
10

10

00:00:22,331  -->  00:00:24,717
instead of just doing it myself
11

11

00:00:24,717  -->  00:00:28,359
is because these two guys actually developed
12

12

00:00:28,359  -->  00:00:30,520
asynchronous development in Python.
13

13

00:00:30,520  -->  00:00:34,300
They are Python, the creators of the Python language
14

14

00:00:34,300  -->  00:00:36,710
or they help create the Python language,
15

15

00:00:36,710  -->  00:00:40,320
so they really poise to guide you perfectly
16

16

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:41,890
through these examples
17

17

00:00:41,890  -->  00:00:46,610
without misguiding or doing anything incorrectly.
18

18

00:00:47,630  -->  00:00:49,530
Doesn't mean they're perfect by any means,
19

19

00:00:49,530  -->  00:00:51,460
but it is a really complicated topic
20

20

00:00:51,460  -->  00:00:53,930
when you start getting into the depths
21

21

00:00:53,930  -->  00:00:56,360
of how everything works behind the scenes,
22

22

00:00:56,360  -->  00:00:57,500
so I think we've done a pretty good job
23

23

00:00:57,500  -->  00:00:59,610
of explaining what's going on.
24

24

00:00:59,610  -->  00:01:02,970
These guys are gonna take you that one step further,
25

25

00:01:02,970  -->  00:01:05,250
and that's gonna be the case with any course you take
26

26

00:01:05,250  -->  00:01:06,310
or anything you do.
27

27

00:01:06,310  -->  00:01:08,740
There's always going to be more research,
28

28

00:01:08,740  -->  00:01:10,100
more things to learn.
29

29

00:01:10,100  -->  00:01:13,020
And by going to conferences and listening to talks
30

30

00:01:13,020  -->  00:01:15,220
like these ones that I link you now,
31

31

00:01:15,220  -->  00:01:16,640
is a great way to do that.
32

32

00:01:17,970  -->  00:01:20,410
However, of course, the purpose of this course
33

33

00:01:20,410  -->  00:01:23,310
is for you to learn the most you can,
34

34

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:26,130
and as such, come back to me with any questions you have
35

35

00:01:26,130  -->  00:01:27,640
after watching the talks,
36

36

00:01:27,640  -->  00:01:30,010
and I'll be more than happy to help you out
37

37

00:01:30,010  -->  00:01:31,350
and answer any questions.
38

38

00:01:32,270  -->  00:01:34,810
Again, watching conference talks and going to conferences
39

39

00:01:34,810  -->  00:01:37,620
is a great way to learn more about obscure
40

40

00:01:37,620  -->  00:01:41,120
and complicated topics like asynchronous programming.
41

41

00:01:41,120  -->  00:01:42,760
And of course working with it,
42

42

00:01:42,760  -->  00:01:44,420
doing some programming with it,
43

43

00:01:44,420  -->  00:01:45,870
is a fantastic way as well.
44

44

00:01:46,900  -->  00:01:48,350
So watch the talks
45

45

00:01:48,350  -->  00:01:50,670 line:15% 
and then come back to me with any questions.
46

46

00:01:50,670  -->  00:01:51,620 line:15% 
I'll see you there.
