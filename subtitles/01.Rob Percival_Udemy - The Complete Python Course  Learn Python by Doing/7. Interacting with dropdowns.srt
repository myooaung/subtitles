<v ->Hi guys</v>
2

2

00:00:00,923  -->  00:00:01,756
and welcome back.
3

3

00:00:01,756  -->  00:00:03,100
In this video, we're going to be
4

4

00:00:03,100  -->  00:00:05,760
interacting with our first drop down.
5

5

00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:08,730
And in Selenium, they're called selects.
6

6

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:11,160
Let's go over to our quotes page
7

7

00:00:11,160  -->  00:00:12,670
and add a couple of imports.
8

8

00:00:12,670  -->  00:00:15,740
The first one is gonna be just from the typing module,
9

9

00:00:15,740  -->  00:00:20,740
and the second one is from Selenium web driver support UI.
10

10

00:00:20,830  -->  00:00:22,480
And we're going to import select.
11

11

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:27,250
The typing one is just so that we can do this
12

12

00:00:28,370  -->  00:00:30,600
in there, which was missing.
13

13

00:00:30,600  -->  00:00:32,650
And then we're gonna add another property
14

14

00:00:33,670  -->  00:00:36,790
which is for the author dropdown.
15

15

00:00:36,790  -->  00:00:41,790
And this is going to return a Select Object from Selenium.
16

16

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:43,130
And what it's gonna do is
17

17

00:00:43,130  -->  00:00:44,430
it's going to first of all find this.
18

18

00:00:44,430  -->  00:00:45,653
So self dot browser,
19

19

00:00:46,760  -->  00:00:49,280
dot find element by CSS selector,
20

20

00:00:49,280  -->  00:00:54,120
and this is the quotes page locators dot author drop down.
21

21

00:00:54,120  -->  00:00:55,390
And then we're just going to return
22

22

00:00:55,390  -->  00:00:57,980
a Select of that element.
23

23

00:00:57,980  -->  00:00:59,720
What that does in Selenium terms,
24

24

00:00:59,720  -->  00:01:02,450
is it takes whatever arbitrary
25

25

00:01:02,450  -->  00:01:04,810
or generic Selenium element you've got,
26

26

00:01:04,810  -->  00:01:08,430
and it tries to put it inside a select wrapper.
27

27

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:11,120
And what that does is it gives that element,
28

28

00:01:11,120  -->  00:01:14,760
some methods that we can use to interact with a Select.
29

29

00:01:14,760  -->  00:01:15,700
Now, you better hope
30

30

00:01:15,700  -->  00:01:18,780
that the element you're passing into this is a drop down.
31

31

00:01:18,780  -->  00:01:20,950
If it's not, you're gonna have some problems.
32

32

00:01:20,950  -->  00:01:22,990
And so now that we have the element there,
33

33

00:01:22,990  -->  00:01:26,300
that lets us create something like select author.
34

34

00:01:26,300  -->  00:01:27,930
And that takes in an author name,
35

35

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:29,520
which is going to be a string,
36

36

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:32,363
and that is going to do self dot author dropdown,
37

37

00:01:33,560  -->  00:01:35,860
which is these property here.
38

38

00:01:35,860  -->  00:01:39,810
Don't select by visible text.
39

39

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:41,860
This is one of these methods that you get
40

40

00:01:41,860  -->  00:01:43,690
when you make a select
41

41

00:01:43,690  -->  00:01:47,280
and select by visible text is going to be author name.
42

42

00:01:47,280  -->  00:01:48,980
What that does in Selenium terms is
43

43

00:01:48,980  -->  00:01:51,470
it opens the drop down, sees what's there
44

44

00:01:51,470  -->  00:01:52,950
and then selects the one that
45

45

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:55,380
matches this string if it's there.
46

46

00:01:55,380  -->  00:01:56,890
So that is how we're going to
47

47

00:01:56,890  -->  00:01:59,520
select an author from the drop down.
48

48

00:01:59,520  -->  00:02:01,090
Let's go over to App dot py
49

49

00:02:01,090  -->  00:02:03,740
and modify this code so that it actually does that.
50

50

00:02:03,740  -->  00:02:06,880
So let's first of all ask the user
51

51

00:02:08,270  -->  00:02:10,180
what author they want.
52

52

00:02:10,180  -->  00:02:13,750
Enter the author you'd like quotes from.
53

53

00:02:13,750  -->  00:02:16,950
And then we're going to do page dot select author,
54

54

00:02:16,950  -->  00:02:17,903
with that author.
55

55

00:02:18,840  -->  00:02:21,580
All right, so making sure that we've got everything there.
56

56

00:02:21,580  -->  00:02:23,810
And it seems like we do.
57

57

00:02:23,810  -->  00:02:24,643
Go ahead
58

58

00:02:24,643  -->  00:02:25,730
and run this.
59

59

00:02:25,730  -->  00:02:27,380
And chrome will open first because
60

60

00:02:27,380  -->  00:02:29,430
that's that line five there.
61

61

00:02:29,430  -->  00:02:31,280
Then we get asked what author we'd like
62

62

00:02:31,280  -->  00:02:33,750
so we're going to say something like Bob Marley
63

63

00:02:33,750  -->  00:02:35,790
just because his name is quite short.
64

64

00:02:35,790  -->  00:02:37,913
And then we have our first bug.
65

65

00:02:38,870  -->  00:02:40,530
You can see that the error
66

66

00:02:40,530  -->  00:02:44,610
says attribute error this object has no attribute tack name.
67

67

00:02:44,610  -->  00:02:47,640
That suggests that we've tried to do something on an object,
68

68

00:02:47,640  -->  00:02:50,290
but that thing was a list instead of
69

69

00:02:50,290  -->  00:02:51,810
whatever we were expecting.
70

70

00:02:51,810  -->  00:02:53,410
So something comes to mind immediately
71

71

00:02:53,410  -->  00:02:54,950
when something like this happens.
72

72

00:02:54,950  -->  00:02:59,610
And that is that we use the wrong method.
73

73

00:02:59,610  -->  00:03:01,940
And indeed we did for the author drop down,
74

74

00:03:01,940  -->  00:03:05,840
we said self dot browser dot find elements by CSS selector,
75

75

00:03:05,840  -->  00:03:08,490
you want find elements because there's only going to be one
76

76

00:03:08,490  -->  00:03:10,900
and you want just a single element,
77

77

00:03:10,900  -->  00:03:12,680
so that you can make a select out of it.
78

78

00:03:12,680  -->  00:03:14,530
You don't want multiple elements,
79

79

00:03:14,530  -->  00:03:16,590
or at least offer one element,
80

80

00:03:16,590  -->  00:03:18,880
because then it will be very confused.
81

81

00:03:18,880  -->  00:03:20,963
Okay, let's run app dot py again.
82

82

00:03:21,830  -->  00:03:24,870
Notice that this launches a completely new chrome instance
83

83

00:03:24,870  -->  00:03:25,920
when you do that,
84

84

00:03:25,920  -->  00:03:28,923
so you can end up with a bunch of different Chrome's.
85

85

00:03:31,330  -->  00:03:32,323
There you have it.
86

86

00:03:33,410  -->  00:03:36,680
And Bob Marley has been selected in our drop down.
87

87

00:03:36,680  -->  00:03:37,960
If you read the error messages you can
88

88

00:03:37,960  -->  00:03:42,000
try to glean something about Selenium's internal workings.
89

89

00:03:42,000  -->  00:03:42,900
But it can be tricky.
90

90

00:03:42,900  -->  00:03:45,830
If you do have any problems, ask away in the course Q&amp;A
91

91

00:03:45,830  -->  00:03:47,940
or in the Slack channel, we'll be more than happy to help.
92

92

00:03:47,940  -->  00:03:49,430
Just make sure you give us your code
93

93

00:03:49,430  -->  00:03:51,550
and you know, as much information as you can,
94

94

00:03:51,550  -->  00:03:53,810
so that we can help you better.
95

95

00:03:53,810  -->  00:03:57,390
That's how you interact with one select or one drop down.
96

96

00:03:57,390  -->  00:04:00,030
I'm sure you can do the same for the tag name,
97

97

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:02,150
but we're going to do that in the next video.
98

98

00:04:02,150  -->  00:04:03,100
I'll see you there.
