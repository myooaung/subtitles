<v ->Hi guys, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,880  -->  00:00:04,390
In this video, we're going to be taking the contents
3

3

00:00:04,390  -->  00:00:07,380
of one of our text areas and we're going to be saving them,
4

4

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:10,410
and putting them into a file in our system.
5

5

00:00:10,410  -->  00:00:13,270
Let's start by creating a function that will do that.
6

6

00:00:13,270  -->  00:00:15,060
So I'm gonna call this save_file(),
7

7

00:00:16,190  -->  00:00:20,410
and what we have to do here is we have to ask the user
8

8

00:00:20,410  -->  00:00:23,360
where in the system they want to save the file.
9

9

00:00:23,360  -->  00:00:25,230
We're gonna do this first of all,
10

10

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:28,440
so that we know that they actually want to save it,
11

11

00:00:28,440  -->  00:00:30,240
because they can always press cancel,
12

12

00:00:30,240  -->  00:00:32,370
and so we know where the file is gonna go.
13

13

00:00:32,370  -->  00:00:34,370
So we'll say file_path equal,
14

14

00:00:34,370  -->  00:00:39,300
file dialogue dot ask save as file name, all one word,
15

15

00:00:39,300  -->  00:00:42,330
which is not very nice and but nonetheless that's how it is,
16

16

00:00:42,330  -->  00:00:47,040
and make sure that from tkinter you import file dialogue.
17

17

00:00:47,040  -->  00:00:50,000
This file dialogue here is going to ask the user,
18

18

00:00:50,000  -->  00:00:52,900
using the system dialogues,
19

19

00:00:52,900  -->  00:00:56,080
where to save the thing that you wanna save.
20

20

00:00:56,080  -->  00:00:59,660
So let's go ahead and before continuing with this,
21

21

00:00:59,660  -->  00:01:01,062
just to show you what it looks like,
22

22

00:01:01,062  -->  00:01:05,270
add an element to the menu that will call this function.
23

23

00:01:05,270  -->  00:01:08,840
So down here in the file_menu dot add_command,
24

24

00:01:08,840  -->  00:01:10,330
we're going to copy that,
25

25

00:01:10,330  -->  00:01:12,657
but instead of "New" we're gonna call this "Save",
26

26

00:01:12,657  -->  00:01:14,910
and the command is gonna be save_file,
27

27

00:01:14,910  -->  00:01:17,313
and again, make sure to not call the function.
28

28

00:01:18,240  -->  00:01:20,140
Let me run this app here,
29

29

00:01:20,140  -->  00:01:24,563
and I'll type "Hello world" and I'm gonna go and save,
30

30

00:01:26,870  -->  00:01:30,550
and notice that we get a few things going on.
31

31

00:01:30,550  -->  00:01:33,540
First thing that we got was an error,
32

32

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:35,330
or seemingly something that looks like an error,
33

33

00:01:35,330  -->  00:01:36,690
it's actually a warning,
34

34

00:01:36,690  -->  00:01:38,670
and what it says is that somewhere in your system,
35

35

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:42,590
there is an ambiguous way of calling this dialogue.
36

36

00:01:42,590  -->  00:01:44,510
So you don't have to worry about that at all.
37

37

00:01:44,510  -->  00:01:46,420
That's just a problem in my system.
38

38

00:01:46,420  -->  00:01:48,410
You may not even encounter this issue,
39

39

00:01:48,410  -->  00:01:51,150
and the second thing is that you get this dialogue.
40

40

00:01:51,150  -->  00:01:53,200
This is a Mac dialogue,
41

41

00:01:53,200  -->  00:01:55,350
and in Windows and in Linux it'll look different,
42

42

00:01:55,350  -->  00:01:58,780
and here you can save as a specific name,
43

43

00:01:58,780  -->  00:02:01,030
and you can give it tags as it's just a Mac thing,
44

44

00:02:01,030  -->  00:02:02,980
and you can decide where you wanna save it.
45

45

00:02:02,980  -->  00:02:05,920
Now, I'm gonna press cancel and that's it.
46

46

00:02:05,920  -->  00:02:09,800
So this is what our save file function does for now,
47

47

00:02:09,800  -->  00:02:12,310
but note that it only asks the user
48

48

00:02:12,310  -->  00:02:15,000
for the file name and the location.
49

49

00:02:15,000  -->  00:02:17,110
It doesn't actually perform the saving,
50

50

00:02:17,110  -->  00:02:19,000
which we do have to do.
51

51

00:02:19,000  -->  00:02:23,902
So we're going to go ahead and import os at the top,
52

52

00:02:23,902  -->  00:02:27,270
and then we're going to try to get the file name
53

53

00:02:27,270  -->  00:02:28,340
from the file path.
54

54

00:02:28,340  -->  00:02:30,950
So we do os dot path dot base name,
55

55

00:02:30,950  -->  00:02:33,097
and we will pass in the file_path.
56

56

00:02:34,210  -->  00:02:36,881
Given a path such as for example,
57

57

00:02:36,881  -->  00:02:41,320
slash users slash jose slash file dot txt,
58

58

00:02:41,320  -->  00:02:45,000
os_path based name will give you file dot txt.
59

59

00:02:45,000  -->  00:02:47,040
If you're using a Windows style path,
60

60

00:02:47,040  -->  00:02:48,560
it'll also work with that.
61

61

00:02:48,560  -->  00:02:51,210
So this is a great way of ensuring
62

62

00:02:51,210  -->  00:02:53,280
Cross-Platform Compatibility.
63

63

00:02:53,280  -->  00:02:54,810
Next up, we're going to get
64

64

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:58,140
the currently selected text widget.
65

65

00:02:58,140  -->  00:03:02,150
Remember that we can have multiple tabs in our system,
66

66

00:03:02,150  -->  00:03:04,200
so by selecting the current one,
67

67

00:03:04,200  -->  00:03:06,110
that is the one that we've just tried
68

68

00:03:06,110  -->  00:03:08,120
to save to our computer.
69

69

00:03:08,120  -->  00:03:10,690
So let's say that text_widget is equal to,
70

70

00:03:10,690  -->  00:03:15,690
root dot name to widget, notebook dot select.
71

71

00:03:15,730  -->  00:03:17,570
Now this does a few things.
72

72

00:03:17,570  -->  00:03:22,570
First of all, the select in the notebook is
73

73

00:03:23,240  -->  00:03:25,590
Something that returns the widget name
74

74

00:03:25,590  -->  00:03:27,733
of the currently selected pane.
75

75

00:03:28,670  -->  00:03:30,600
Now, you can pass in a tab ID,
76

76

00:03:30,600  -->  00:03:31,480
and then what it does is,
77

77

00:03:31,480  -->  00:03:34,470
it actually goes and selects a particular tab,
78

78

00:03:34,470  -->  00:03:36,270
but if you don't pass in a tab ID,
79

79

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:37,400
which we'll not doing,
80

80

00:03:37,400  -->  00:03:39,763
then it's gonna give us the name of the widget.
81

81

00:03:40,660  -->  00:03:44,400
In tkinter, names can be used
82

82

00:03:44,400  -->  00:03:46,970
to uniquely identify particular widgets,
83

83

00:03:46,970  -->  00:03:51,040
such as text_areas, notebooks, frames and so on.
84

84

00:03:51,040  -->  00:03:55,200
So by getting the currently selected widget,
85

85

00:03:55,200  -->  00:03:57,180
we're then going to use the root,
86

86

00:03:57,180  -->  00:04:01,240
which is the main window to turn that name into a widget.
87

87

00:04:01,240  -->  00:04:04,270
This has to be called on the container of
88

88

00:04:04,270  -->  00:04:06,893
whatever widget name you are getting.
89

89

00:04:08,840  -->  00:04:13,030
Then we're going to perform some pretty ugly black magic.
90

90

00:04:13,030  -->  00:04:15,730
We're gonna say that the content of the text widget
91

91

00:04:15,730  -->  00:04:18,840
is text underscore widget dot get,
92

92

00:04:18,840  -->  00:04:20,480
and we're gonna go
93

93

00:04:20,480  -->  00:04:24,250
from the first line and the first character,
94

94

00:04:24,250  -->  00:04:27,400
so this is the first line starts at one,
95

95

00:04:27,400  -->  00:04:29,910
and the zeroth character, which is the first one.
96

96

00:04:29,910  -->  00:04:31,570
So just before the first character,
97

97

00:04:31,570  -->  00:04:33,830
we're gonna go until the end
98

98

00:04:35,190  -->  00:04:38,170
of the content in the widget;
99

99

00:04:38,170  -->  00:04:42,610
however, due to the way that text areas work in tkinter,
100

100

00:04:42,610  -->  00:04:45,130
if you do from 1.0 to end,
101

101

00:04:45,130  -->  00:04:45,963
then you're gonna end up with
102

102

00:04:45,963  -->  00:04:48,500
an extra new line character at the end.
103

103

00:04:48,500  -->  00:04:52,230
just because, that's always there in these widgets.
104

104

00:04:52,230  -->  00:04:54,660
There's always an empty new line character at the end.
105

105

00:04:54,660  -->  00:04:56,424
So what you wanna do, is you wanna go to the end,
106

106

00:04:56,424  -->  00:04:58,810
except for the very last character,
107

107

00:04:58,810  -->  00:05:01,290
which is always this new line character,
108

108

00:05:01,290  -->  00:05:03,320
that you didn't add yourself.
109

109

00:05:03,320  -->  00:05:07,150
So we do end minus 1c for end,
110

110

00:05:07,150  -->  00:05:08,993
except the last character.
111

111

00:05:10,890  -->  00:05:12,740
All right, so now that's out of the way,
112

112

00:05:12,740  -->  00:05:16,300
you can go ahead and actually open the file path,
113

113

00:05:16,300  -->  00:05:20,093
and we're going to open for writing,
114

114

00:05:21,260  -->  00:05:26,193
as file and then we will do file dot write content.
115

115

00:05:27,350  -->  00:05:30,950
Okay, next up, we're going to add an except,
116

116

00:05:30,950  -->  00:05:32,390
and we're gonna except for AttributeError,
117

117

00:05:32,390  -->  00:05:35,010
and FileNotFoundError,
118

118

00:05:35,010  -->  00:05:36,807
and we're gonna just print an error message,
119

119

00:05:36,807  -->  00:05:39,570
"Save operation cancelled",
120

120

00:05:39,570  -->  00:05:41,370
and then we're going to return.
121

121

00:05:41,370  -->  00:05:45,350
So if we close the window or we didn't get a file name,
122

122

00:05:45,350  -->  00:05:48,030
or the file was not found in the system,
123

123

00:05:48,030  -->  00:05:51,669
then we are going to print "Save operation cancelled",
124

124

00:05:51,669  -->  00:05:52,870
and we're gonna return;
125

125

00:05:52,870  -->  00:05:54,690
Otherwise, we're going to of course,
126

126

00:05:54,690  -->  00:05:57,470
save the file into our disc,
127

127

00:05:57,470  -->  00:06:01,083
and then we're also going to say, notebook dot tab,
128

128

00:06:02,140  -->  00:06:04,750
and we're gonna pass in a tab ID,
129

129

00:06:04,750  -->  00:06:07,480
but there is a special tab ID in notebook tabs,
130

130

00:06:07,480  -->  00:06:09,250
which is "current",
131

131

00:06:09,250  -->  00:06:12,340
and that selects the currently selected tab,
132

132

00:06:12,340  -->  00:06:15,850
and here we're gonna pass in a text of file name,
133

133

00:06:15,850  -->  00:06:18,350
and this file name here is what we extracted earlier,
134

134

00:06:18,350  -->  00:06:20,570
and what this is going to do as you might imagine,
135

135

00:06:20,570  -->  00:06:23,250
it is going to rename the current tab,
136

136

00:06:23,250  -->  00:06:28,083
so that the name of the tab will henceforth be filename.
137

137

00:06:29,380  -->  00:06:30,770
Let me run app dot pv,
138

138

00:06:30,770  -->  00:06:33,360
just to show you everything we've done in this video.
139

139

00:06:33,360  -->  00:06:36,970
And here we have our first empty file,
140

140

00:06:36,970  -->  00:06:39,500
that we created using the create file function.
141

141

00:06:39,500  -->  00:06:42,757
I'm gonna call it "Welcome to our text editor",
142

142

00:06:44,010  -->  00:06:46,400
Then I'm gonna go ahead and save this,
143

143

00:06:46,400  -->  00:06:48,730
and what's happening when we do this is,
144

144

00:06:48,730  -->  00:06:51,450
first of all, we ask where we wanna save.
145

145

00:06:51,450  -->  00:06:55,403
So I'm gonna save it as test dot txt in my desktop,
146

146

00:06:56,350  -->  00:06:59,550
and then a bunch of things happened all in one place.
147

147

00:06:59,550  -->  00:07:01,540
First, we got the file name,
148

148

00:07:01,540  -->  00:07:04,080
which is test dot txt from the path,
149

149

00:07:04,080  -->  00:07:06,720
that the dialogue gave us back.
150

150

00:07:06,720  -->  00:07:08,570
Then we got the current widget,
151

151

00:07:08,570  -->  00:07:10,030
which is the one that we have selected
152

152

00:07:10,030  -->  00:07:11,610
at the time of saving.
153

153

00:07:11,610  -->  00:07:13,110
We got all the content.
154

154

00:07:13,110  -->  00:07:16,270
We opened the file using just good old Python,
155

155

00:07:16,270  -->  00:07:19,410
and we wrote the contents into the disc,
156

156

00:07:19,410  -->  00:07:22,740
and then at the end, we renamed the current tab,
157

157

00:07:22,740  -->  00:07:25,410
so that it is now no longer called Untitled,
158

158

00:07:25,410  -->  00:07:27,293
It is called test dot txt.
159

159

00:07:28,340  -->  00:07:30,020
So, hopefully that makes sense.
160

160

00:07:30,020  -->  00:07:32,810
We have done quite a lot of work in this video,
161

161

00:07:32,810  -->  00:07:36,200
but most of it is just normal Python,
162

162

00:07:36,200  -->  00:07:39,330
and there is a few tkinter use cases,
163

163

00:07:39,330  -->  00:07:43,320
like asking for a file name, getting a particular widget,
164

164

00:07:43,320  -->  00:07:46,980
this piece of beautiful code that gets you the content,
165

165

00:07:46,980  -->  00:07:50,480
and then of course renaming a tab.
166

166

00:07:50,480  -->  00:07:52,340
So thank you for joining me in this video.
167

167

00:07:52,340  -->  00:07:53,580
I hope you've learned something.
168

168

00:07:53,580  -->  00:07:55,053
I'll see you in the next one.
