<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,420  -->  00:00:05,000
In this video, we are going to look at sending emails.
3

3

00:00:05,000  -->  00:00:08,240
Sending emails with Python can be done in multiple ways.
4

4

00:00:08,240  -->  00:00:11,050
The simplest way, though, is you can send the email
5

5

00:00:11,050  -->  00:00:13,230
by using your personal email account.
6

6

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:15,360
For example, if you have a gmail account,
7

7

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:18,123
you can send emails using that account and Python.
8

8

00:00:19,030  -->  00:00:22,750
Something you may not know is that emails all go,
9

9

00:00:22,750  -->  00:00:26,280
or the majority of them go through something called smtp.
10

10

00:00:26,280  -->  00:00:30,980
Smtp is a protocol, very much like http is,
11

11

00:00:30,980  -->  00:00:33,720
used to communicate between two different things.
12

12

00:00:33,720  -->  00:00:36,520
In this case, we're gonna use smtp to communicate
13

13

00:00:36,520  -->  00:00:40,570
between our Python code and the gmail servers,
14

14

00:00:40,570  -->  00:00:43,530
and we're gonna tell gmail servers to login using our
15

15

00:00:43,530  -->  00:00:45,823
gmail account and send an email.
16

16

00:00:47,320  -->  00:00:50,803
So let's create a new Python file that I'm going to call
17

17

00:00:50,803  -->  00:00:54,261
email_smtplib.py,
18

18

00:00:54,261  -->  00:00:56,590
and we're going to start sending email.
19

19

00:00:56,590  -->  00:01:00,290
It's actually really straightforward when you have all
20

20

00:01:00,290  -->  00:01:01,123
the code together.
21

21

00:01:01,123  -->  00:01:02,520
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to
22

22

00:01:02,520  -->  00:01:03,813
import smtplib.
23

23

00:01:04,710  -->  00:01:08,859
Smtplib comes with Python and it's used to talk to
24

24

00:01:08,859  -->  00:01:10,913
an smtp server.
25

25

00:01:11,770  -->  00:01:16,010
Gmail servers are smtp servers and you can communicate
26

26

00:01:16,010  -->  00:01:20,033
with them directly by using this library, okay?
27

27

00:01:21,400  -->  00:01:24,940
So, what we're gonna do is we are going to start off
28

28

00:01:24,940  -->  00:01:29,080
by connecting to the smtp server.
29

29

00:01:29,080  -->  00:01:32,518
What we're gonna do, is we're gonna do smtp_connector
30

30

00:01:32,518  -->  00:01:37,518
is smtplib.SMTP, and in here we're gonna pass in
31

31

00:01:38,430  -->  00:01:41,910
a host name that is going to be smtp.gmail.com
32

32

00:01:41,910  -->  00:01:43,670
for the gmail servers.
33

33

00:01:43,670  -->  00:01:47,640
If you're using a different server, like Hotmail or Yahoo,
34

34

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:51,471
or anything else, make sure to figure out the smtp server
35

35

00:01:51,471  -->  00:01:55,930
and also the port name, that for gmail is 587.
36

36

00:01:55,930  -->  00:02:00,000
Okay, this is normally the port for smtp servers, 587.
37

37

00:02:00,000  -->  00:02:03,140
So make sure to figure out what the host name is,
38

38

00:02:03,140  -->  00:02:05,300
and what the port is.
39

39

00:02:05,300  -->  00:02:10,010
Then we're gonna do smtp_connector.starttls,
40

40

00:02:10,010  -->  00:02:12,480
and this just starts a secure connection to it.
41

41

00:02:12,480  -->  00:02:15,910
In some cases, tls won't be required to connect
42

42

00:02:15,910  -->  00:02:19,730
to your smtp server, so in those cases you won't
43

43

00:02:19,730  -->  00:02:24,210
have to do this and then smtp_connector.login,
44

44

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:26,370
and we're gonna give him our email account,
45

45

00:02:26,370  -->  00:02:29,992
you@gmail.com, and our password.
46

46

00:02:29,992  -->  00:02:31,990
Of course, I'm not gonna type out
47

47

00:02:31,990  -->  00:02:34,270
my email and password here.
48

48

00:02:34,270  -->  00:02:36,220
I hope you understand that,
49

49

00:02:36,220  -->  00:02:39,820
but nonetheless that is all you have to do.
50

50

00:02:39,820  -->  00:02:43,640
Now it is possible that when you press play,
51

51

00:02:43,640  -->  00:02:45,590
for example if we press play right now,
52

52

00:02:47,170  -->  00:02:48,820
we will of course get an error.
53

53

00:02:48,820  -->  00:02:51,930
In this case, username and password not accepted.
54

54

00:02:51,930  -->  00:02:55,260
If you type in your username, email account and your
55

55

00:02:55,260  -->  00:02:59,520
password correctly, you may still get an error,
56

56

00:02:59,520  -->  00:03:01,760
and that will happen of course if you're using
57

57

00:03:01,760  -->  00:03:03,513
two-factor authentication.
58

58

00:03:04,420  -->  00:03:06,560
If you're using two-factor authentication,
59

59

00:03:06,560  -->  00:03:10,880
you'll need to get a special type of password that your
60

60

00:03:10,880  -->  00:03:14,620
provider will give you, which is an app password normally,
61

61

00:03:14,620  -->  00:03:16,630
so I'm going to add a we don't string here at the top
62

62

00:03:16,630  -->  00:03:19,270
of the file to say that, okay?
63

63

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:20,790
So if you get...
64

64

00:03:22,917  -->  00:03:25,999
"An SMTPAuthenticationError even when
65

65

00:03:25,999  -->  00:03:27,027
"your password is correct, it's possible that
66

66

00:03:27,027  -->  00:03:29,427
"you have 2-factor authentication enabled.
67

67

00:03:29,427  -->  00:03:31,797
"You'll need to use an App Password to log in
68

68

00:03:31,797  -->  00:03:33,627
"instead of your normal password."
69

69

00:03:34,490  -->  00:03:36,650
Now, particularly in the case of gmail,
70

70

00:03:36,650  -->  00:03:39,187
there is something else, that if you don't have
71

71

00:03:39,187  -->  00:03:41,080
two factor authentication enabled,
72

72

00:03:41,080  -->  00:03:45,194
you'll have to allow access by less secure apps in gmail.
73

73

00:03:45,194  -->  00:03:48,040
You're app here, that logs in with your
74

74

00:03:48,040  -->  00:03:50,800
username and password directly, is what gmail classifies
75

75

00:03:50,800  -->  00:03:53,310
as a less secure app.
76

76

00:03:53,310  -->  00:03:55,530
So through your gmail security preferences,
77

77

00:03:55,530  -->  00:03:59,410
you can enable less secure apps so that you can test this
78

78

00:03:59,410  -->  00:04:02,540
out, and of course remember to deactivate less secure apps
79

79

00:04:02,540  -->  00:04:05,883
once you finish learning about sending our email, okay?
80

80

00:04:06,870  -->  00:04:11,170
If you use an app password or you enable less secure apps,
81

81

00:04:11,170  -->  00:04:13,890
and you don't have 2FA enabled, this should work
82

82

00:04:13,890  -->  00:04:16,220
and you shouldn't get any errors.
83

83

00:04:16,220  -->  00:04:19,140
But of course we don't have an email that we're sending yet.
84

84

00:04:19,140  -->  00:04:21,810
We haven't written anything to send.
85

85

00:04:21,810  -->  00:04:23,710
So we can do that.
86

86

00:04:23,710  -->  00:04:26,030
We're gonna use the email module that is present in
87

87

00:04:26,030  -->  00:04:26,863
Python 3.
88

88

00:04:26,863  -->  00:04:31,097
We're gonna say from email.message import EmailMessage.
89

89

00:04:32,195  -->  00:04:35,590
This EmailMessage class is a way of constructing
90

90

00:04:35,590  -->  00:04:38,740
an email message very easily, so what we'll do
91

91

00:04:38,740  -->  00:04:41,200
is we'll create a new EmailMessage object,
92

92

00:04:41,200  -->  00:04:43,710
and then we'll just set the subject
93

93

00:04:46,970  -->  00:04:49,230
to be something like Test email.
94

94

00:04:49,230  -->  00:04:54,230
The from to be your email, you@gmail.com
95

95

00:04:58,440  -->  00:05:01,860
And the to, to be whoever you wanna send an email to.
96

96

00:05:01,860  -->  00:05:06,140
This email will actually go to someone, so feel free to
97

97

00:05:06,140  -->  00:05:07,920
send that email to someone you know.
98

98

00:05:07,920  -->  00:05:09,470
Preferably don't send them to me.
99

99

00:05:09,470  -->  00:05:11,830
I could get quite a lot of emails if we do that,
100

100

00:05:11,830  -->  00:05:13,680
but you can send them to someone else,
101

101

00:05:13,680  -->  00:05:18,680
someoneelse@gmail.com, okay?
102

102

00:05:18,960  -->  00:05:21,573
Then you're gonna do email.set_content,
103

103

00:05:23,310  -->  00:05:26,310
and here you can type in some text content
104

104

00:05:26,310  -->  00:05:28,430
that the email will contain.
105

105

00:05:28,430  -->  00:05:30,680
What you'll normally do in these cases, when you want
106

106

00:05:30,680  -->  00:05:33,450
to set the content of an email, if it's, you know,
107

107

00:05:33,450  -->  00:05:37,369
simple content, you will at some point here,
108

108

00:05:37,369  -->  00:05:40,157
create something called email_content
109

109

00:05:41,570  -->  00:05:44,313
and use a multi line string to say something like,
110

110

00:05:44,313  -->  00:05:46,683
"Dear Sir/Madam,
111

111

00:05:47,537  -->  00:05:50,727
"I am sending you an e-mail with Python.
112

112

00:05:50,727  -->  00:05:51,843
"I hope you like it.
113

113

00:05:53,174  -->  00:05:55,587
"Kind regards, me."
114

114

00:05:56,480  -->  00:06:00,973
And then you can just set the email content like that.
115

115

00:06:02,410  -->  00:06:05,130
Now that you've got your email and you've got
116

116

00:06:05,130  -->  00:06:08,450
your connection to the smtp server, all you have to do
117

117

00:06:08,450  -->  00:06:09,983
is say smtp_connector.send_message,
118

118

00:06:11,697  -->  00:06:15,663
and you're email object that we created up here,
119

119

00:06:15,663  -->  00:06:19,790
and that has all our headers, subject, from, and to,
120

120

00:06:19,790  -->  00:06:23,243
and the content, and then remember to quit
121

121

00:06:23,243  -->  00:06:25,510
the smtp_connector as well.
122

122

00:06:25,510  -->  00:06:28,060
That closes the connection to your account,
123

123

00:06:28,060  -->  00:06:29,313
and all is good.
124

124

00:06:30,780  -->  00:06:32,777
This is all you need to send an email, using your
125

125

00:06:32,777  -->  00:06:36,060
personal account as well as taking care of the security
126

126

00:06:36,060  -->  00:06:39,290
concerns of your email provider.
127

127

00:06:39,290  -->  00:06:42,170
Of course, for many apps, as soon as you release them,
128

128

00:06:42,170  -->  00:06:43,910
and you sort of put them out there, give them to your
129

129

00:06:43,910  -->  00:06:48,350
users to use, you don't really want to be sending email
130

130

00:06:49,202  -->  00:06:51,440
with your personal account, so a stop cap
131

131

00:06:51,440  -->  00:06:54,410
can be to create another gmail account that is
132

132

00:06:54,410  -->  00:06:58,910
for your business, but gmail doesn't really like that,
133

133

00:06:58,910  -->  00:07:02,410
so what we normally do, instead of using smtplib,
134

134

00:07:02,410  -->  00:07:05,253
which is a way to send, you know, a few emails.
135

135

00:07:06,250  -->  00:07:08,070
What we do instead normally, if we want to send a lot
136

136

00:07:08,070  -->  00:07:11,330
of emails, is we use an email sending service.
137

137

00:07:11,330  -->  00:07:15,080
There are a couple of them like Mailgun or SendGrid,
138

138

00:07:15,080  -->  00:07:17,610
and in this course, we're going to be looking at Mailgun
139

139

00:07:17,610  -->  00:07:19,717
in order to be sending email to
140

140

00:07:19,717  -->  00:07:22,793
a larger scale of users.
141

141

00:07:23,640  -->  00:07:25,575
So this is how you can send email with smtplib
142

142

00:07:25,575  -->  00:07:28,080
to send small amounts of emails,
143

143

00:07:28,080  -->  00:07:29,700
using your personal account.
144

144

00:07:29,700  -->  00:07:32,730
In the next video, we're going to look at using Mailgun.
145

145

00:07:32,730  -->  00:07:33,680
I'll see you there.
