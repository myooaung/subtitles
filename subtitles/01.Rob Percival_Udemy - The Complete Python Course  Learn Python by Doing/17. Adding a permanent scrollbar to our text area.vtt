00:00:00.580  -->  00:00:02.440
<v Narrator>Hi guys and welcome back,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.440  -->  00:00:04.850
one more improvement to our application.
3

3

00:00:04.850  -->  00:00:07.650
At the moment, we've got this whole area
4

4

00:00:07.650  -->  00:00:09.870
in which we can write text.
5

5

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:14.870
However, as we start going over this available space
6

6

00:00:15.830  -->  00:00:19.190
you can see that we can scroll.
7

7

00:00:19.190  -->  00:00:21.340
But we cannot see a scroll bar
8

8

00:00:21.340  -->  00:00:23.580
so we have to add it ourselves.
9

9

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:27.460
Fortunately, adding a scroll bar is really straightforward.
10

10

00:00:27.460  -->  00:00:29.090
What we have to do is go ahead
11

11

00:00:29.090  -->  00:00:33.100
into the create file function here
12

12

00:00:33.100  -->  00:00:35.510
and instead of creating a text area
13

13

00:00:35.510  -->  00:00:37.120
and putting it in the notebook
14

14

00:00:37.120  -->  00:00:39.180
we are going to create a frame.
15

15

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:42.480
So we will do container equals ttk dot frame
16

16

00:00:42.480  -->  00:00:47.010
and we will make that a child of the notebook.
17

17

00:00:47.010  -->  00:00:49.840
Then we will say container dot pack.
18

18

00:00:49.840  -->  00:00:53.340
Next up, we will put the text area inside this container
19

19

00:00:53.340  -->  00:00:55.139
and we will tell the text area that
20

20

00:00:55.139  -->  00:00:58.010
the side is going to be left.
21

21

00:00:58.010  -->  00:01:01.930
That is so that it takes up all of the vertical space
22

22

00:01:01.930  -->  00:01:05.120
and gets joined to the container on the left,
23

23

00:01:05.120  -->  00:01:08.258
because the scroll bar is going to go on the right.
24

24

00:01:08.258  -->  00:01:11.220
Next up, we're going to say notebook dot add
25

25

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:13.650
and we will add the container
26

26

00:01:13.650  -->  00:01:17.260
and notebook select and we will select the container.
27

27

00:01:17.260  -->  00:01:21.070
Then down here, we will do text scroll
28

28

00:01:21.070  -->  00:01:24.800
and that is going to be a ttk dot scroll bar.
29

29

00:01:24.800  -->  00:01:28.950
For this container, the orientation
30

30

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:30.540
is going to be vertical
31

31

00:01:31.450  -->  00:01:32.910
and the command, and this is
32

32

00:01:32.910  -->  00:01:36.553
the important part, is text area dot yview.
33

33

00:01:38.304  -->  00:01:40.745
Make sure to not call the yview function,
34

34

00:01:40.745  -->  00:01:44.157
as that is what you can use to modify
35

35

00:01:44.157  -->  00:01:46.407
the y-delta of a container.
36

36

00:01:48.880  -->  00:01:50.920
So now that we have our scroll bar there
37

37

00:01:50.920  -->  00:01:54.450
what we have to do is say text scroll dot pack
38

38

00:01:54.450  -->  00:01:56.800
and the side is going to be right
39

39

00:01:56.800  -->  00:01:58.840
and the fill is going to be wide.
40

40

00:01:58.840  -->  00:02:00.210
We want the text area to take up
41

41

00:02:00.210  -->  00:02:02.840
the entire vertical space.
42

42

00:02:02.840  -->  00:02:04.580
Finally, we will say text area
43

43

00:02:05.462  -->  00:02:08.790
yscrollcommand, make sure to spell this right
44

44

00:02:10.030  -->  00:02:13.750
is equal to text underscroll dot set.
45

45

00:02:13.750  -->  00:02:18.040
So what happens when you scroll the text area yourself
46

46

00:02:18.040  -->  00:02:21.100
is that is going to move the scroll bar.
47

47

00:02:21.100  -->  00:02:23.950
And similarly, when you move the scroll bar
48

48

00:02:23.950  -->  00:02:25.990
that is going to move the text area.
49

49

00:02:25.990  -->  00:02:27.415
So these two lines here
50

50

00:02:27.415  -->  00:02:30.670
make each component affect the other.
51

51

00:02:30.670  -->  00:02:32.850
Now doing this means that we've got
52

52

00:02:32.850  -->  00:02:35.000
a couple of bugs in our programme now,
53

53

00:02:35.000  -->  00:02:38.090
because the text area is no longer
54

54

00:02:38.090  -->  00:02:41.260
the sole child of the notebook tab.
55

55

00:02:41.260  -->  00:02:44.100
Now we've got a container that has two elements,
56

56

00:02:44.100  -->  00:02:47.190
the text area and the scroll bar.
57

57

00:02:47.190  -->  00:02:50.044
So in our get text widget function,
58

58

00:02:50.044  -->  00:02:52.370
we actually have to make a couple of changes.
59

59

00:02:52.370  -->  00:02:54.320
This is going to be called tab widget
60

60

00:02:55.190  -->  00:02:58.360
and it is going to then do
61

61

00:02:58.360  -->  00:03:01.730
text widget equal to tab widget
62

62

00:03:01.730  -->  00:03:05.360
dot winfo underscroll children...
63

63

00:03:06.280  -->  00:03:07.113
zero.
64

64

00:03:08.200  -->  00:03:11.410
All right, so this is another excellent name here.
65

65

00:03:11.410  -->  00:03:12.610
What this does is that it goes
66

66

00:03:12.610  -->  00:03:15.363
into the tab widget, which is this frame,
67

67

00:03:16.310  -->  00:03:19.750
and it gets the widget information
68

68

00:03:19.750  -->  00:03:22.420
and it gets the children of the widget.
69

69

00:03:22.420  -->  00:03:24.210
That is the frame, sorry,
70

70

00:03:24.210  -->  00:03:27.470
that is the the text area and scroll bar
71

71

00:03:27.470  -->  00:03:29.973
and it gets the first one, which is the text area.
72

72

00:03:30.810  -->  00:03:33.120
Then down here, when we do confirm quit,
73

73

00:03:33.120  -->  00:03:34.580
we have to do the same thing,
74

74

00:03:34.580  -->  00:03:37.250
so we will rename this to tab widget
75

75

00:03:37.250  -->  00:03:41.143
and we will do text widget equal tab widget
76

76

00:03:41.143  -->  00:03:44.250
winfo underscore children zero
77

77

00:03:44.250  -->  00:03:47.670
to get the actual text widget as opposed to the frame.
78

78

00:03:47.670  -->  00:03:50.770
<v ->All right, now that we've got that, we can press play</v>
79

79

00:03:50.770  -->  00:03:52.630
and you will see a slight difference.
80

80

00:03:52.630  -->  00:03:55.670
We do have the scroll bar here on the right,
81

81

00:03:55.670  -->  00:03:58.630
and as we do type "Hello World"
82

82

00:03:58.630  -->  00:03:59.463
and we
83

83

00:04:00.510  -->  00:04:02.490
make it scroll
84

84

00:04:02.490  -->  00:04:05.373
you can see that a scroll bar appears down here.
85

85

00:04:07.310  -->  00:04:10.430
Scrolling with the scroll bar moves the text area
86

86

00:04:10.430  -->  00:04:14.070
and scrolling the text area moves the scroll bar as well.
87

87

00:04:14.070  -->  00:04:16.510
That's it for this video, thank you for joining me
88

88

00:04:16.510  -->  00:04:17.960
and I will see you next time.
