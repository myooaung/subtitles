<v Instructor>Hi, welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.800  -->  00:00:03.620
Just a small aside actually,
3

3

00:00:03.620  -->  00:00:06.200
before we move on to anything else.
4

4

00:00:06.200  -->  00:00:08.390
I wanted to show you a slightly more efficient way
5

5

00:00:08.390  -->  00:00:10.550
of creating your menus.
6

6

00:00:10.550  -->  00:00:12.437
Instead of having all these if statements,
7

7

00:00:12.437  -->  00:00:15.030
you could just put the user choices
8

8

00:00:16.810  -->  00:00:18.260
into a dictionary,
9

9

00:00:19.440  -->  00:00:22.720
where B is assigned to print best books,
10

10

00:00:22.720  -->  00:00:25.190
the function, not the result.
11

11

00:00:28.010  -->  00:00:30.080
C to print cheapest books.
12

12

00:00:33.220  -->  00:00:36.760
And N to get next book.
13

13

00:00:38.580  -->  00:00:42.440
Once you've got this, you can essentially get rid of
14

14

00:00:42.440  -->  00:00:44.860
all of these statements here.
15

15

00:00:44.860  -->  00:00:46.880
Instead of user input equal B,
16

16

00:00:46.880  -->  00:00:51.880
we can say user input in B, C, N.
17

17

00:00:52.311  -->  00:00:54.040
So this is going to give us true
18

18

00:00:54.040  -->  00:00:56.510
if the user input is one of these things.
19

19

00:00:58.050  -->  00:01:03.050
And if it is, we can just do user choices, user input.
20

20

00:01:03.940  -->  00:01:05.850
This is going to give us the function
21

21

00:01:05.850  -->  00:01:09.000
that is associated with the input inside this dictionary,
22

22

00:01:10.570  -->  00:01:11.570
and we can run that.
23

23

00:01:12.620  -->  00:01:15.320
It is a much more efficient way of doing the same thing.
24

24

00:01:15.320  -->  00:01:16.830
Essentially, you get to type less code,
25

25

00:01:16.830  -->  00:01:18.610
it does the same thing.
26

26

00:01:18.610  -->  00:01:19.830
Okay, that's it for this video.
27

27

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:21.470
Just wanted to show you this because you're going
28

28

00:01:21.470  -->  00:01:23.080
to be writing menus quite often,
29

29

00:01:23.080  -->  00:01:26.420
might as well know the best way of doing them.
30

30

00:01:26.420  -->  00:01:27.920
Now see you on the next video.
