00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
It will also help us better understand which route we are currently on.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.025
Vue routes also add some classes to the active link.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:09.810
Just before we see this in action,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.255
let's go over to the app.vue and quickly remove our unused params from this account link.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:19.400
We don't need this post since we removed this in the last video,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.660
and now if we go over to the browser and go into

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.900
the developer tools, right-click Inspect.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.645
We need to open up this in nav section.

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:30.550
This contains all of our links about the very top,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.700
and if we click on the Home link,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.745
you'll see this class will appear of router-link-active

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:39.285
and also router-link-exact-active too.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:44.145
Let's try the about and these class is now moved to the about link.

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:47.375
The account, this also gets it too.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:51.290
But if we click on the "Update Profile," we

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.430
still see our two classes are being added to our Update Profile link,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.800
but the account link still has this router-link-active class.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.685
The same if we go to previous orders,

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:05.660
our two classes are now on our previous orders,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.875
but the router link active is still on our account link,

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.440
even though we have not clicked on this link.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.270
This is because this router-link-active will always apply even on a partial match.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.285
Currently, we're on /account,

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.215
the user ID, and then /orders.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:27.740
But since the account link also begins with /account too,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.430
this will also be considered a match.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.955
Router-link-exact-active though is more specific and it must

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:39.355
match the exact path which we're on for this class to apply.

00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:42.270
If we close this down and head over to the app.vue,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.970
when we also setup the viewRouter,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.130
it also added some classes inside of here too.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.915
We have some classes for our navigation, and also,

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:56.780
this class for router-link-exact-active setting the color of our link.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.990
This is why when we click on any of these links up at the top,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.385
we see this green color,

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:03.350
even though we didn't set this ourselves,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.545
inside of the style sheets,

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:07.670
since this is the exact class,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.330
you will only set the green color when there is an exact match.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.055
If we were, however, to change this, the router-link-active,

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.130
since our current path begins with /account,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.695
this will also match this account link too.

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:24.095
Also the same if we click on previous orders,

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:28.020
we see our two links are active. We're going to do this.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.540
The style will now only apply to the exact route which we're on.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.420
So this is just something to be aware of and it gives us

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.300
fine control over the styling of our links.
