00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.070
In the project we've been working with so far,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.720
we've used a CDN link to access the Vue JS features.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.030
The setup is fine for smaller projects or when just working with a part of our website.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.640
For larger projects though,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.840
we often need a better setup with more features and tools.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.480
To help with this, there is the Vue CLI,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.540
which is available at cli.vuejs.org,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.100
which has plugins for many popular tools,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.110
which has TypeScript, Babel,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.520
Testing, and also to easily add packages which we may need such as the Vue router.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.315
Even if you don't plan on using many of the features or plugins,

00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:43.880
you will be likely to want a setup like this that allow us to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.070
use components more easily and also build for production.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.165
It also includes tooling such as Webpack so we can bundle

00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:57.155
together all of our files and assets to create these single page applications.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:01.735
The CLI is created and maintained by the Vue JS core team.

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:06.680
Although we know it's not required since we've already built a Vue JS project without it,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.229
it is generally accepted as the standard way to create Vue JS projects.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.680
If we scroll down, there is a Getting Started section

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.010
at the bottom to set us up inside the terminal.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.580
One thing to note here is that Node.js is required before we go ahead and do this.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.960
If you don't have Node.js already installed,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.860
if you'd head over to nodejs.org,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.330
and then click on the current version to download for your operating system.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.345
Also, if it has been a while since you have updated,

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.450
it may also be worth going through the installation process.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.015
It is just a case of a few clicks.

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:48.100
Node.js is a way for us to run JavaScript on the server.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.600
We won't be writing any Node.js code or in fact any server related code.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.385
This is just a requirement behind the scenes for the Vue CLI.

00:01:57.385 --> 00:01:59.060
Once this has downloaded,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.750
we just need to unzip the package and then it continue

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.650
through the installation process for your particular operating system.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.820
All done. We can now close down this window.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.590
Installing Node like this will also install npm,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.855
which is the Node's package manager,

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:27.020
which we'll use to install both the Vue CLI and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.349
also any additional packages we need for our projects.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.360
To go ahead with the installation,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.880
you will need to head over to the terminal.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.064
You can use any terminal for this such as the built-in Mac Terminal,

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:41.104
you can use Windows PowerShell,

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:44.435
and there is also one built into Visual Studio Code.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:51.245
If you open up, select the terminal option,

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:52.850
and then go to "New Terminal",

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.305
which will open this up at the bottom of our text editor.

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:59.650
Over, I'm going to be using iTerm for this project.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.470
The first thing to do is to check the both npm and Node are both correctly installed.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.850
First we can type in node and then dash

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.720
v. This will return to us the current version of nodes which is installed.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.470
Next, npm -v, which then returns the installed version of npm.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.500
Both of these commands should return the version number,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.120
but if you do see an error,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.780
you will need to correctly install Node and npm before continuing any further.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.530
Back over to the Vue CLI homepage,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.520
we have this installation section down at the bottom.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.240
We can either use npm or the Yarn package manager.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.370
Either way is completely fine.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.635
If you don't currently have Yarn setup on your machine,

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:49.145
I would recommend using the npm command

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.390
since this doesn't need any additional installation.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.660
Let's copy and paste this is over,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.270
hit "Enter", and this will go through the installation process for the CLI.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.365
If you are a Mac user and hitting any installation errors relating to permissions,

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:11.510
you may also need to add the pseudo prefix before this npm install,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.590
then you'll need to enter the password when prompted.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.570
Or even better, you could also fix

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.970
the permissions which are blocking you from installing.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.295
Once you've done this, we can then use the Vue create command,

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.575
followed by the name of our project.

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:30.520
But first, we're going to use the cd command to change

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.565
into our directory where we want to install our project.

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:39.060
I'm going to change into the desktop, hit "Enter".

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.090
Well, you could place this anywhere which you want.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.580
We can then use Vue create and the name of the project which I'm

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.315
going to call the CLI demo, hit "Enter".

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:51.535
At the time of recording this,

00:04:51.535 --> 00:04:56.855
the Vue CLI gives us the option of either Vue version 2 or Vue 3,

00:04:56.855 --> 00:05:01.515
which also comes with the Babel and also ESLint setup for us.

00:05:01.515 --> 00:05:05.050
Select "Vue 3". Also, remember that in the future,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.540
the option for Vue 2 may not be there.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.530
Sometimes the options do change,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.170
but it is usually pretty self-explanatory.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:24.635
It should now leave us with our demo project on the desktop.

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:28.415
Now we need to change into this demo directory.

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:34.675
Like it says, Babel can use cd to change directory into our CLI demo.

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:36.420
Now we are inside of this demo,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.825
we can then run our development server.

00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:43.580
If you use an npm, we can type in npm serve, hit "Enter".

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.925
In fact this is npm run serve, hit "Enter".

00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:50.645
This will now set up our development server.

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:55.025
Once this is done, it will give us a link which you can now open inside the browser.

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:58.165
See the starter project all setup.

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:01.340
All we need to now do to edit this is to open up

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.310
this project inside of our text editor so we can plug this over.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.335
Now we're good to go write in our Vue JS code.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:15.095
This project, however, looks a little different to the previous project structure.

00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:20.640
Next we'll take an overview of exactly what's included with this project setup.
