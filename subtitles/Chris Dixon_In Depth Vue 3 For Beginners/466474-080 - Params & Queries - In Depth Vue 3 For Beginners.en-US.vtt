00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.365
The router package has more to offer than just switching between components.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:11.790
It can also be used to pass data in the form of params and also a query string too.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.755
First, let's take a look at params or parameters,

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:19.255
which are variables for a given route in the router link,

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:20.805
which we have just here.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:24.190
We can add our params inside of this two object.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.015
So just after our name separated by a comma, add in our params.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:33.235
Inside of this object, we can add in as many parameters as we want.

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:37.230
But now I'm just going to add in a user ID, which is the name.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.454
The value is going to be equal to user.id,

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.530
which we can get from our data.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.720
Here we're dealing with this homepage.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.155
Let's go over to the Vue and then into the home.vue components.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:54.665
Inside here we have multiple ways to access our routers data.

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.660
Inside of the double curly braces,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.915
we can output this with the dollar symbol router.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:02.280
Over to the home link.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.535
This now gives us a lot of information about the router.

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:10.555
We can actually see this a little bit easier if we go into the developer tools.

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:12.340
So go into Inspect,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.525
open up this home components,

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:18.580
and this now shows all of our routing information a little bit more structured.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.440
We have access to things such as the current route.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.890
We can see any queries or any parameters,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.300
such as the user ID which we just added.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.815
If we scroll down,

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:31.050
we have lots more information available for this router,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.629
such as any options.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:36.685
We can also see all of the routes which we have set in our router file.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:40.520
We have the home component which is the path of forward slash.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.400
Then we have this about one just below two.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.705
So this is how we can access all of the routers information.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:50.855
We could also use this to access the [inaudible] params,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:54.050
or instead we could use the dollar symbol route,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.960
which will filter out a lot of this information and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.335
just give us access to the current route information.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:02.975
We can already see this is a lot more simpler.

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:06.715
We can see on this object we have access to our params.

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:10.855
Inside here we can access dot params. Save this.

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:13.625
Now have access to our user ID.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:18.920
If we just wanted to access this value directly or if you had multiple params,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.110
we can also access them by their name too.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.990
Now this user ID would just give us access to the value.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.490
The router can also handle query strings too.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.230
If you've not used a query string in the past,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.165
they're a way of providing some additional information inside of a URL.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.770
You may have seen a URL which looks something like this.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.420
We have a question mark,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.955
which is used to separate the query from the URL.

00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:49.190
Then we'll have our names and our values just like this.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.150
Now the user, which is equal to any value.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.345
This is one section. We can also use the ampersand to attend multiple query parameters.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:05.000
These query strings can be accessed locally or we can also send them to the server too.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.510
A typical use case for a query string is when used with a HTML form.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.700
We can see this if we add a simple forms or template.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.780
We'll just keep it simple at a name input.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.670
Then the name attribute is important.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.095
We're going to call this user.

00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:28.160
This name attribute is the one which is shown in the query string.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.810
We'll see this in just a second.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.050
We'll also add a location.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.400
Again, an input with the type of text.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.009
This one can have the name of location.

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:46.040
A button to submit this with the type of submit.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.480
Now over to the browser, if we add in any name inside here,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.965
a location, we can send.

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:58.900
This is now added to the URL as a query string.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.710
We see the user is equal to Chris and also the location to

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.845
both this user and also this location is covered from all form from these name attribute.

00:04:10.845 --> 00:04:15.325
All of it's information will be sent to the server with our form.

00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:18.200
Let's remove this and all of these query strings were

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.200
added automatically or may submitted as form.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.010
But we can also add them in manually too.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.270
If we go to our app.vue and then into our router link,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.655
is a setup just like our params, we can add a comma.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.050
Inside of our object,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.320
setup our query, where we can add in as many query strings as we would like.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.785
For example, we could add a token with this about link, save this.

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:49.805
Click on the about link, and this is then added to the end of our URL.

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:53.719
If we also wanted to access any of this information,

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.340
we could access it directly from our template too.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.445
Back to our home components and still on this route object,

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:03.500
instead of accessing our params,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.680
all you need to do is to access our query, refresh.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.715
We don't see anything inside here since we added this to the about link.

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:20.100
We can cut this out over to the about at this end and that is our query.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.575
We can also add in multiple queries too and then access them by their name,

00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:26.470
such as this token.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.230
This is how we can access parameters and our query strings.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.730
In the upcoming video,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.700
we'll take a look at how we can match dynamic routes.
