00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.700
In the slides a little earlier,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.160
we discovered we can pass data to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.965
a child component by passing it in between the components,

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.290
opening and closing tags.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.600
This method is called slots,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.020
and we're now going to setup some slot content.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.470
The page we currently have set inside of here is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.185
this overview which we registered in the App.vue.

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:27.090
This page will now display our three components of bestseller,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.740
the item sold, and also the total sales too.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.425
Just like here in the final version.

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:39.965
Although this, we first need to register these inside of our overview.vue file.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:44.120
We will head into here and to do this we will create our script section,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.245
then register our three components.

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:52.090
The first import is going to be for items sold.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.310
This is going to be from the location which is../components,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.280
and then into the items sold components, which changes.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.550
Also, we can replace this with the @ symbol,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.835
and this is a shortcut to the source folder.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.715
We need to duplicate this two more times.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:20.650
The second one is for the sales total, change the file path.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:30.750
The third one is the bestseller. Down to export.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.340
The first thing is to create a name for this component,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.575
and mine is going to be the overview.

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:41.720
Then register our three components so we can use them inside of our template.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.610
We have items sold,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.615
the sales total, and also the bestseller.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:52.625
To display these, we'll create a new section just below our title.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.100
This section is then going to display

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.120
our three components and then we'll nest in-between our slot content.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.940
The first one is items sold and also closes off.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:13.120
The second one is for the sales total, and then the bestseller.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.514
Save this and we see the titles for all three of our components,

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:21.415
which will start inside of our level 4 heading.

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:26.015
Now, we're going to pass our slot contents in between each one of these elements.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:27.890
Just like we see on the final version,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.470
we have the items sold, the sales total,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.695
and also the top selling item,

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.570
but now this is just going to be some static data.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.700
But very soon, we're going to grab all of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.390
these values which is contained in our orders.js file.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.750
Back to our overview and in between the items sold elements,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.955
we're going to pass our slot data.

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:52.210
This can be anything such as regular text.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.205
We can pass it in HTML elements and also view js data between double curly braces too.

00:02:58.205 --> 00:03:00.780
I'm just going to output the span,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.015
and the span is also going to have a class.

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:05.755
So we can apply some styling,

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:12.790
often light-text, place in any value inside here and copy this.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.910
The next one is for our sales total,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.995
place in any currency symbol and also any money value too.

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.690
Finally, the bestseller.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.130
Any product for now is fine,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.125
I'm going to place in the Vue hoodie in size medium.

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:35.225
Save this, and at the moment we don't see anything inside the browser.

00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:40.370
This is because we first need to tell Vue.js exactly where we want

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.320
this content to appear in our components. This is pretty easy to do.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.020
All we need to do is to go over to our components and then add in the slot elements.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.669
This is basically an outlook for the content which we pass through this component.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.830
We can go anywhere inside here.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.935
But I'm going to place this below the level 4 heading,

00:04:00.935 --> 00:04:06.570
the same for the sales total, as in our slot.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.140
We see the values that appear in it below each one of our titles, a bestseller.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.690
Other slots in here too,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.965
and this now appears on the page.

00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:21.800
Good. Now let's add a little style in over in the overview page.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.585
In the beginning, remember,

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:27.820
all three of these sections were surrounded inside of this section wrapper.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.920
Let's make these go across the page, just like we see here,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.710
we will target this section and set the display type to be flex.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.645
To do this we'll need a style section.

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:43.080
This can also be scoped, so only applies to this component.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.510
[inaudible] section and set the display to be flex.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.970
Some spacing, we can also take advantage of justified content

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.815
and distribute all of the available space to be between these three elements.

00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:04.230
Also place a border around all three of these sections,

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.780
add a target, these individual headings and slot contents.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.595
We are now going to go over to the App.vue.

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:15.640
This style section is not scoped so all of these styles will apply to any components,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.650
including all three of these sections.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.095
Begin our level 4 heading,

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:24.650
which is the title for all three of our components.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.690
We will remove any default margin by setting this to be zero,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.895
and then add some padding to the bottom of

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:35.180
this title to give us more spacing from our slot content.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.780
This slot contents also had a class.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.690
If we go to the overview page and up to the templates,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.970
this had the class of light-text.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.850
Let's grab this. All we're going to do in this section is to

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.570
reduce the font-weight to be a value of 300.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.370
To apply the border around each one of these items,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.334
if we go into the component,

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:07.080
each one of these articles have the class of stats.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.345
Inside here, we'll set the border to be the weight of one pixel,

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:19.870
a solid line, and a light gray color, which is ddd.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.055
The border-radius of five pixels.

00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:28.570
Then some internal space in with the padding value,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.570
which will be one 1rem.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.775
Good. Let's have our components now styled.

00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:36.430
Just to work with this header section,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.590
I'm going to reduce down the level 1 heading.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.310
This is a little bit too big,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.780
so we'll tag the header H1,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.475
and then reduce the font size.

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:50.700
Let's try 1.4 rems, and that looks better.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.410
I can also play around with the font-family too,

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.105
I'm going to remove this and change it to be Avenir,

00:06:57.105 --> 00:06:59.885
but you can also change it to suit your style.

00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:03.320
This is how we can use slots at a very basic level.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.475
In the next video,

00:07:04.475 --> 00:07:06.800
we're going to take a look at the scope of slots,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.930
and also how to pass dynamic data.
