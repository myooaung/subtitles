00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.675
For this project, I have provided a starter template

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:07.170
which is available to download from the GitHub repository.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.525
Early on, when we downloaded the full repository,

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:14.185
mine saved on the desktop as a vue-3-course-master.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:17.280
Inside here, you will see a lot more folders.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.105
For the one you were interested in is a vue-countdown- starter.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:24.705
Let's drag this over into Visual Studio code.

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.375
I'm going to begin to work with our new project.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:32.085
Using the starter project is exactly the same as the vue-CLI-setup,

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:34.315
which we looked at in the previous section.

00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:38.925
But using a starter project means we all on the same version numbers.

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:42.130
I will also update this when it's safe to do so.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.000
Inside a Visual Studio code,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.695
you will see all the familiar files and folders from the previous demo.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:52.025
The only difference is if we go to the App.vue file.

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:56.035
Inside of our script, we have this event data array.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:58.640
This is an array of objects which we're

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.400
going to use as a starting point for this project.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.910
This is just going to, say, I was typing out some different events,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.330
so we can see this information in the browser.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.540
But very soon, we will create these events.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.310
We'll update them and also remove them from our projects.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.805
If you want, you can also change any of this event information,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:18.485
such as the event names,

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:21.110
the details, all the background colors.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.945
But one thing to note is these dates.

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:28.775
Very soon, we're going to need some event date which in the past or have expired.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.980
We're going to need some in the future and we're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.655
going to need some for the present day too.

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:37.140
This will just allow us to test things out when we get to that stage,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.640
but we'll come back to this very soon.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.950
Also to keep the download size down,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.910
I've also removed the node modules.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.920
We'll need to go over to the terminal and also install this too.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.970
If you use any built-in at terminal inside a Visual Studio code,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.550
you'd go to Terminal, New Terminal,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.840
and this would be opened up inside of your project folder.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.770
If you use any separate terminal,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.915
you will need to use the CD command,

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:06.275
which is going to navigate to our project directory.

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:08.845
Mine is saved on the desktop.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.650
To begin it, let's CD into the repository folder,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.665
which is the vue-3-course-master.

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:20.710
Then from here, you will CD into the view Countdown Starter.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.700
Make sure you are in the correct folder.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.155
Then we're going to install the node modules with npm i. Npm i is short for installed.

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:35.550
This will pull in all of the packages which we need for this project.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.220
Once this is done, we can start up the development server with npm run serve.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.540
then this is going to open up our project on local-host.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.760
If we Command or Control click,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.690
this will open this up inside of the browser.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.390
While developing this project.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.930
We can leave this development server running.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.790
But if we want to close this down,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.790
all we need to do is to press Control-C,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.335
which will close down our development server so we can no longer access our site.

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.090
Then to restart things,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.815
we then run npm run serve once again.

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:31.590
We can now access our project once again in the browser.
