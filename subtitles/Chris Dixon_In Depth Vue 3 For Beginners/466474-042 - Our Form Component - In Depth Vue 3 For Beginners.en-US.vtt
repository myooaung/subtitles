00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.805
Since Vue.js has this idea of creating templates in our single file components,

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:10.080
creating a form is generally the same as with regular HTML.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.080
We need a form which is going to allow us to both add

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.265
a new event and also edit any existing events too.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.370
We could either create two forms of this,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.175
or both of these operations can make use of the same form components if we wanted to.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.620
First of all, let's create a component.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.310
So I'll open up the source folder into the components,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.970
and then our new file is going to be called the AddUpdateForm;

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.180
again with the.vue extension.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.220
Now we can go over to the App.vue and then we can register this file so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.585
we can use it instead of this form which we created inside of the script.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:55.185
Below our object we can create a new import,

00:00:55.185 --> 00:01:00.720
but this time our import is going to be importing our AddUpdateForm.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.270
Just like the event above, this is./ components.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.750
Then if we go into this,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.670
we have the AddUpdateForm.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.090
Don't forget to also register this inside of the components.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.045
Then up to the teleport at the very top of our template,

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.505
so we're going to replace this form section.

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:24.725
Remember this has the v-if section,

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:27.490
so we can toggle this components on an off.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.830
We also need to bring this over to our new component,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.910
so I'll place all components inside of the modal which is also going

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.780
to include the v-if conditional statements of show form.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.500
With this now in place,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.160
we no longer need this form section just above.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.480
We'll add all of the form inputs inside of our new components.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.599
Then we can start as usual with the template for our HTML,

00:01:53.599 --> 00:02:00.990
and then nest it inside a div section which is going to have the class of form_ wrapper.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.125
We can then place our form, nest it inside.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:10.310
The reason we have this form_ wrapper surrounding

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.160
our form is because it's going to help us out later on when we style this modal.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.010
We're going to have this form rapper as a darker background,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.020
so it covers all the rest of the content when this modal is active.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.385
Then this form section will have a lighter background so this will overlay this div.

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:31.400
The first section is going to be surrounded in a div,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.355
and this is going to be for our form input of name.

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:37.600
This will be the event name such as graduation.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.235
First of all, the label which is going to be for the name section,

00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:45.180
and this will have the label of name.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.230
The input, the type of text.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.040
The ID for this is going to be name which matches our four attributes.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.140
The next one, if we check out our object,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.600
this one is going to be for the details and we need one for

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.965
the date and then one for the background color.

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:05.990
Let's copy this div section since

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.425
this next one is also going to be the input with the type of text,

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:13.140
but this time this is going to be for the details;

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.000
the label too of details and also the matching ID.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.580
Onto the browser we can check this is working by clicking on our button and scroll down,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.875
and we have our two form inputs.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:31.580
The next one just below this is going to be for our date service,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.505
we'll have the input with the type of date.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:38.585
This will give us a date picker to select the date of the event.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.760
This label is also date too,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.710
and also the text for the label too.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.380
Now this just leaves the background color,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.680
and for this we have six different options for our six example events.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.045
I'm going to make use of the same six colors which we have used inside of here.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:01.190
To choose between any of these,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.725
we're going to use a select input.

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:08.000
This will also have a div wrapper to keep the styling consistent,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.400
also the label for the background.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.410
But this time this will have the HTML select inputs.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.755
Select has a opening and a closing tag so we can add

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:24.905
all of the options which we need to select in-between.

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:28.920
It's ID is so much is the label of background,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.200
and then we have our six different options which we are going to include and

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.855
the first value is the hex color of F34949.

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.890
This is for our red option.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.945
The second option was for our pink color and this has the hex value of F07949,

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:50.955
and the text of pink.

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:54.590
The third option is going to be for the purple value,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.920
which has the hex color of 997AF0.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.060
For the blue, this is 7AD3F0.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.370
Next we'll add a green option,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.555
and the green color I'm going to use is 68EE94.

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:20.240
The option for the yellow,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.300
this is going to be a value of F9F970.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.040
Finally, we'll also add an option for the orange color,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.215
and this hex value is going to be EB980F;

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:38.915
any text of orange.

00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:43.400
This is now all of the options which we need and to finish off all

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.330
form we'll just place a div at the bottom with the button,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.130
so we can add a new event.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.160
But now this button isn't going to do anything,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.080
we'll just add the text of add.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.990
We can go over to the browser and check this is all working, so I will toggle this on.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.610
We've got our text inputs,

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.730
the date picker, so we can select a date for the event.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.420
I have the Select option with all of our different color values,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.555
and finally the button at the bottom.

00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:14.000
Very soon we'll take a look at how we can extract the values from

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.465
this form input and place this into our data.

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:20.780
But next we're going to come back to this form and add some styling,

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.910
and turn it into a popup modal.
