00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.225
In the last video, we setup this button to add a new text section to any of our pages,

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:07.770
and in this upcoming video,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.720
we're going to setup a button to remove any one of the sections too.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.630
Removing a section will be a little simpler than adding

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.255
them since if we take a look at our data,

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:20.295
inside of any of our pages,

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.025
these sections are placed inside of an array.

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:26.310
This particular one just has a single section of text,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.865
but we could have up to four sections inside of here.

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:31.890
To remove them, we'll just need to know

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.205
the index number of the section we want to remove.

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:39.020
This, we are going to create a function in useCurrentCard.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.690
So let's go down to the bottom and create our function called removeSection.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.845
As we just mentioned, the removeSection will also need to take

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:56.875
in the sectionIndex when we call this function.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.420
So just like above when we added a new section,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.925
we also need to grab the selected card,

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:03.620
go into the current page,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.005
and then into the sections array.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.410
So we're going to move this over.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.230
But this time, rather than pushing a new item to the array,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.670
we want to make use of the JavaScript splice method.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.370
With splice, we need to pass in it two values.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.830
The first one is going to be the position inside of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.950
the array of the item that we want to remove,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.030
and this will be from the sectionIndex,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.310
separated by a comma, the number of items we want to remove.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.950
We just want to remove the single section.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.900
Okay. Then return this function.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.145
This function is going to be called from the text input component.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:47.780
Our composable has already been imported,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.990
so all we need to do is to import or extract our function, which is removeSection.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.440
Also, return is so we can use this inside of our template.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.400
RemoveSection, as we've just seen also,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.640
requires the sectionIndex when we call this function.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.400
This component already has this available inside of props.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.140
So now we can go up to the very top of our template and just above the text area,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.570
create a new section which is going to wrap our button to remove the section.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.810
For styling, place in the class, text-input-header.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.595
Then inside here we're going to place in a button.

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.740
Alongside this remove button,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.055
we'll also add some of the other buttons later on too.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:40.700
But now, we just need the single button with an x,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.580
which is going to listen out for a click.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.230
Then trigger our function.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.715
Pass in the sectionIndex, which is our prop.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.640
Go to the browser and test this out.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.625
Click on the X. This is now removed.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:03.395
Let's go to a different card and remove the middle one.

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.630
Since everything is reactive,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.840
removing these will also update the preview too.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.900
Also just as a side note before we wrap this video up,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.790
if we go into the console,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.275
we see we are currently being yelled at by the view library because we're using

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:24.110
a watch function and this is just because of the way we've structured this watcher.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.635
If we go down, this watcher is expecting a callback function as the second value.

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:31.500
So to remove this one,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.625
what we need to do is to remove this function directly.

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.985
Create a new updateCard function below.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:45.290
Pass this in. Then we can simply call this update as a callback.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.295
Go into the browser. Open up the developer tools,

00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:55.680
into the console, and this now gets rid of our error message.
