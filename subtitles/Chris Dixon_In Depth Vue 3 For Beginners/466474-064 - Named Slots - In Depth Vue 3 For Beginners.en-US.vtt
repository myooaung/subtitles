00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.545
Here in our overview page over on the left,

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.485
inside of each one of these three components,

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.190
currently we are only passing one single element.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.810
This is completely fine,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.045
but for more complex situations,

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:20.730
passing a lot more content into one single slot may not be ideal.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.210
For this use case, we have what is called name slot.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.605
This is a way to distribute this slot content

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:31.585
into different locations in the child components.

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:35.105
We could have multiple lines of codes and then place them

00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:39.140
over in our components into different locations.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.830
The first step to do this is to basically group

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.660
together our content inside of the template element.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.880
For this, we're going to create our first template.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.905
This is going to pass down an icon to all three of these child components.

00:00:54.905 --> 00:01:03.025
We'll have our first template and we'll also add in a second group inside the template 2.

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:07.100
What we're going to do here inside of the second template,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.040
is to grab our original span elements and move this up into the second section.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.700
The first section we're going to add in our icon,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.710
and this will also be a span element.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.165
The HTML entity for this icon is going to be the ampersand,

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:28.965
the hash and then 128200 followed by this semicolon.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.250
Since these are going to be name slots,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.505
we need to give each one of these templates a unique name.

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:37.810
We can do this with v slot.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.345
V slot is also a directive.

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:43.040
I'm going to call the first one the icon.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.530
Then down to the second template,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.615
again adding v slot.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:51.210
This one is going to be for the quantity.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.830
So I'll give this a save, and we're in-between the items sold sections,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.845
so if we'll go over to these components,

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:02.990
we now need to provide our two locations where we want these to display.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.330
To begin with, the the icon is going to a place alongside our level 4 head in.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.815
Adding our slot, and then figure which content we want to be placed inside here,

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:18.090
we add the name attributes.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.800
This will be for the icon section and the second one was for the quantity.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.960
Close the browser and we see our icon and also our quantity too.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.480
If we wanted too, we could also omit one of these slot names,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760
and use this as the default.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.550
This is only leaving up one of our slots with a name,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.665
and this is going to be for the default content.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:48.385
The way we set this is to go back to our template,

00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:54.255
set this as the default location and it still works exactly the same too.

00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:59.645
Let's now go down and do the same for our sales total and the bestseller too.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:02.580
These need a template

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.115
and we can bring up this total sales value

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:13.675
and then place our icon inside of the first section.

00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:15.810
This will also be a span,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.500
if only if this one is the ampersand, the harsh 128176.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.630
Add to our template,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.160
adding the v slot directive and this one is for the icon 2.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.530
The second one placed in the v slot directive,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.250
and this one can remain as

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.170
the default location down to the bestseller and this would be exactly the same.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.950
The templates and we'll place in the v slot,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.310
is fun elements for the actual icon and the entity for this is

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.095
the ampersand, the hash 128293.

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:57.390
The final one is our default slots.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.195
We will have a span and also give this the name,

00:04:02.195 --> 00:04:05.010
which is going to be default.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.315
Okay, then we can find our outlets and the first one was for the sales total.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:17.695
Into this component place in the slot for our icon location.

00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:21.010
It has the name of icon.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.750
Then we can leave our second slot for the default location.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.130
Finally, the bestseller opponents will do the same as the last two components.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.500
Adding our slots, placing our name of icon and again,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.065
this is the default content 2.

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:42.470
Good. We can see in the browser we have all of our three icons

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.695
and we still have the content which is passed down.

00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:48.635
The final thing to look at is a shorthand,

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:51.965
which we can place on our v slot directive.

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:54.335
If we go back to the overview,

00:04:54.335 --> 00:05:00.575
all we need to do to shorten this is to replace v slots with the harsh.

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:04.975
We can do this for our icon and also the default slot 2,

00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:08.530
replace all six of these.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.900
Save our file, and everything still works as before.
