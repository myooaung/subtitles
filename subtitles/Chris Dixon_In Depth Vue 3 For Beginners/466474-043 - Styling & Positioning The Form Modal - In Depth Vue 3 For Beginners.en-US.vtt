00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
As former created in the last video,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.030
now needs some style into not only make it look a bit nicer,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.005
but to also make this overlay all of the rest of the content.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.460
Remember, in the last video,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.780
We created this form.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.570
We also added this div as a wrapper.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.470
This is going to allow us to create a modal effect and this wrapper

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.175
will stretch the full height on the full width of the page.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:25.395
It will have a darker background color,

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:30.000
which is going to give us the effect of a popping up over the rest of the content.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.280
And then on top of this dark section,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.230
we'll then embed our form,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.920
which is going to be centered in the page and also

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.120
have a lighter background color to make it stand out.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.030
To do this down at the bottom,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.830
we'll go blow our template,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.585
create our style section.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:51.085
It can also be scoped to the styles only applied to this particular component.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:55.140
So first of all, we'll target the Form Wrapper,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.650
which is surrounding all of our form and we'll give it this darker background color.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.110
So to give it this darker background color,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.935
were going to add a RGBA value.

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:11.315
This is going to first allow us to create the dark color of 000.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:12.710
And then the fourth channel,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.060
which is the alpha,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.135
will allow us to add the opacity value of 0.7,

00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:20.990
this is similar to 70 percent capacity.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.715
And this is going to make sure that our background is going to be slightly transparent.

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:27.890
Now this will be a darker background color,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.015
but we can still see the content in the background.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:34.280
Next, we're going to do some positioning so we can lay

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.970
this out to be the full width and the full height of the page.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.910
First, we'll pull this out of the flow of the rest of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.100
the content by certainly position value to be absolute.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.930
Then we can use the four values of top,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.580
right, bottom, and left,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.845
which is going to stretch our form components to the four sides of the page.

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:58.145
We can do this with the top value of zero,

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:00.320
the right value of zero,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.940
and then also the same for the bottom and also the left.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.290
Now if we go over and open up our model,

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.830
we see the darker background color has been set,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.270
but it's slightly transparent.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.950
This also stretches to all four sides of the browser.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.320
Currently though all forms placed in the top left-hand corner.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.660
To move this into the center of the page,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.630
we're going to make use of the CSS flexbox.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.155
So we'll begin with the display type of flex,

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:34.730
and then we can set the justify content to be in the center,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.775
which will give us the alignment across the page.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:42.230
Now we can set the vertical alignment with align items.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.640
This is now as doing it with the Form Wrapper and now we can

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.240
move down to styling the actual form section.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.025
To make this standout,

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.230
we'll give this a white background color.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.170
And also make this a little bit wider and also taller.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.590
So we'll set the minimum width be 60 percent of the viewport width with 60 vw.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.545
Then also the minimum height of 40 percent of the viewport height.

00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:14.780
Some padding to add some space in,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.225
inside of the form.

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:23.430
Let's go forward to Rems and then round off the corners with some border-radius.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.925
Good. This is now going somewhere.

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:30.350
Next we'll move on to each one of these form inputs.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.950
Remember from above when we created any one of these inputs,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.270
they were all surrounded in a div section.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.715
So we'll first select our form and then we'll target any div which immediately follows.

00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:47.165
These will have the display type of flex.

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:48.800
So if stacked vertically,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.775
they'll have the flex direction of column spaces.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.340
We can apply some margin on the top and bottom of one Rem

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.610
and keep the value of margin on the left and right at zero.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:11.180
Next the font size of 1.6 Rems and then moving further inside of this form section,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.145
if we go into our divs,

00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:16.175
we'll then have the input style inside of here.

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:19.585
So let's go down to the bottom of our style section.

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:25.260
We'll target all of the form section and any input which is inside.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.155
First, let's add some margin onto the top and bottom of this inputs,

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:33.520
which is going to space these out from the label

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.155
0.6 Rems on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:41.675
So I'm padding value again,

00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:44.630
0.6 Rems on the top and bottom.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.215
Then one Rem on the left and right.

00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:49.440
The value of one Rem on the left and right,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.115
will give us some spacing when we type into the input.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:55.475
This is the spacing we see over on the left-hand side.

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:59.555
The borders for our form inputs we'll set them to be one pixel,

00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:04.065
like gray and a solid line.

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:06.290
To match the outside Form Wrapper.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.790
We'll also set the border radius to be 0.3 Rems too.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.520
This is going to apply to our free form inputs.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.290
To also keep this consistent,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.815
we can also apply this to our select input too,

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:22.820
and we'll do this by adding it for the same section,

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.140
separated by a comma.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.540
Finally, we have the form button at the bottom.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.000
So first the background color,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.180
which will be RGB, and the red value of one,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.430
two, three, the green value of one,

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.220
nine four, and the blue value of one, two, three.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.325
The width, I'm going to set this to be 100 Pixels.

00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:56.740
Remove the border, add some internal space in with the padding of 0.6 Rems,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.205
a matching boarder radius of 0.3.

00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:07.820
Then finally, we'll also set the font size to be 16 Pixels.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.680
Let's also tone down the black color OC for the label,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.275
and we can do this just at the bottom and the background color for this.

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:23.815
So the text color, let's start with a black color and then we can select

00:06:23.815 --> 00:06:26.215
a lighter color by hovering over this

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:29.315
and choose an enlightened value from the color picker.

00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:32.940
Once you have a color which you are happy with, give this file a save.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.980
Now if we go over to the browser,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.285
our styling is now complete.

00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:41.395
You can also play around with this if you want and change the styling of the layout.

00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:43.265
That's completely fine too.

00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:46.360
But one thing to note here is if we try to

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.345
now click on this toggle button at the very top,

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:51.755
our form will now not close.

00:06:51.755 --> 00:06:53.700
This happens because our modal,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.460
or in particular, our modal wrapper,

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.830
which we have just here,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.060
is now taken up or covering the full width and height of the page,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.020
which is now covering up the rest of the content.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.340
To fix this, next, we will add a closed button inside of

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.910
the modal and look at how we can do this with custom events.
