00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.965
Let's now move on to the menu for each one of these text input.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:06.690
We've already setup a hover,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.490
which then displays our menu,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.115
and now we're going to add some options to this menu.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.010
This was a div which we created in the last video.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.630
Surrounded inside of this div,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.225
we're going to place in three new sections.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:22.630
The first one will be a div with the class of menu top,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.300
the second one, menu middle,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.520
and the third one, menu bottom.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.330
There will be quite a few different options we'll add to this menu.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.210
In this video, we're going to focus on this menu top.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.440
Menu top will be the top row of our options and will contain the font family.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.840
The user can change the font size,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.690
the font color, and also the bold and italic options too.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.100
First we pass in our select option,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.630
which is going to group together all of our font families.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.660
All we need to do as an attribute is to pass in v-model,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.720
which is going to link to our current section.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.130
Then the font family.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.840
The first option. Then inside the values we need to write in the font family in

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.930
the exact same way you would be in

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.640
CSS because this is going to be pushed to our card object.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.690
Just like in our data,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.475
if we look for the font family,

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:31.880
this will be the final values we see here.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.010
The first one, I'm going to go for Times New Roman.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.910
You can change these to be any font family you'd like.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.235
Also the display text, duplicate this.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:48.820
The second one of Georgia.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.040
Number three will be Arial.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.310
Let's go a bit crazy and add in Comic Sans.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.304
Again place this in exactly the same as you would do with CSS.

00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:12.320
The Verdana font family for number five.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.400
Then the last one I'm going to place in Courier New.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.765
Okay. Let's try this out, refresh the browser.

00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:29.005
There's our select with all of our font families.

00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:31.150
Next, just after this select,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.460
we place in a new select group.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.110
This one is going to be for our font size.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.790
Again, this needs to v-model so we have all the data to push to our card object.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.515
We'll select the current section,

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.910
then this time the font size.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.490
The first option of 1.6 rems.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.920
Then the text of normal.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.185
Next, the text of big with a value of two rems.

00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:04.590
The next one will go for 2.5 rems.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.300
The text all bigger.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.560
Then biggest, which is going to be three rems.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.720
Okay, let's try this.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.360
Good. The third input is going to be an input with the type of color.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.280
V-model this to the current section and select the color.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.290
Okay. So this and then we go.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.140
This just now leaves us with the italics and the bold elections.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.735
First we'll add in a label.

00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:48.205
This one is going to be a checkbox nested inside for our bold selection.

00:03:48.205 --> 00:03:54.880
Parsing the input, the type of checkbox, V-model.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.780
For these next two, we have the is bold and italic options,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.340
which are just build on values.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.550
What we're going to do for these is add an input alongside an image.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.500
Now, the reason we're doing this is because the image is going to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.650
be one of the icons which you have in the assets folder.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.065
But we still also want to keep this inputs alongside for accessibility reasons.

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:29.195
This means it can be read by screen readers and also keep the keyboard interactions too.

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:31.700
But in the CSS in just a bit,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.380
we'll hide this input.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.750
We only see this icon just below.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.970
For the source added into the assets, and so icons.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:49.905
We have a provided icon which is called bold.svg and the alt text bold icon.

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:52.960
Next, we also have a checkbox for the is italic.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.550
To speed things up,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.365
we can copy this section,

00:04:56.365 --> 00:04:59.765
then change is bold to be is italic.

00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:06.340
The italic.svg, and also the alt text too.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.035
Save this. Let's see where this leaves us.

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:12.370
Okay. So it looks pretty horrible at the minute,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.380
but we'll fix this with CSS.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.380
There's our check boxes alongside our icons.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.060
But like I mentioned before, we will hide this checkbox later on.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.965
Something to note here is,

00:05:22.965 --> 00:05:24.370
especially when using Chrome,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.425
it may not be the same in different browsers.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.180
I believe it's not with Firefox,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.120
but when using the Chrome browser if we click on

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.535
this color picker and then try to select on the colors,

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.220
the whole menu will disappear.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.225
Now Chrome holds a huge market share for the browser market,

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:44.305
so this is obviously something we want to fix.

00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:50.315
What is happening here when we move from this color input to the actual color selector?

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.390
The selector is a separate section.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.805
Moving to this new section means we're leaving this main wrapper,

00:05:57.805 --> 00:06:00.515
this then triggers the mouse out event,

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:02.705
and then hides have options.

00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:07.850
Workaround for this is to watch for the mouse leaving this menu top section.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.720
Then once again, set any Mouse options to be true.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.360
Add a mouse, leave events inside here.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.855
We will set the Show options V equal to true.

00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:24.885
Save and test this out.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:28.925
Click on the input. Now we will move away from this top section.

00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:31.610
The Show Options is still set to true,

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.090
meaning we can still see our color inputs. We have this now fixed.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.390
The final thing we need to do is to check if

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.670
our current section is being updated with any of these inputs.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.150
I'll place this inside the double curly braces in the template.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.030
All we need to do is to amend our text.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.295
We see the user inputs is changed.

00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:57.780
Click on this bold, and this will toggle this just here italic.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.970
The font family, this changes to Arial.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.460
Finally, the font-size.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.665
This all seems to be working,

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:12.720
and in the upcoming video we'll add the rest of our menu options.
