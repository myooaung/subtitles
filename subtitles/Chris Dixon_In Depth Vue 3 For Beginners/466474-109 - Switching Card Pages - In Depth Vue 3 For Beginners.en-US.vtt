00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.360
We now know from the last video that we can retrieve

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.315
the correct page we need from the URL.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:11.340
Now we're going to setup some buttons to switch between these four pages.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.260
This, a new component,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.985
a new components folder,

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:17.250
and then into the card folder.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.440
This one is going to be called switch page.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.300
Setup the templates that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.675
you're just going to [inaudible] link so we can pass in the nav element,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:38.190
the unordered list, and then our list items are going to be wrappers for the router link.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.770
Each one of these router links is going to link to the four pages of our card.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.755
Pass in the to prop.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.485
This is going to link to front,

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:52.510
and we'll take a look at this in just a second.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.090
But now a class of page select is relatively equal half to the text to the front,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.235
alongside a icon to.

00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:04.850
This icon has been provided with this course

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.435
and you can access this from the assets folder.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:14.890
First, the text inside the span of runs,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.150
and then display the icon with the image.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.240
This one doesn't need to be dynamic,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.830
we just need to go into the assets, into the icons.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.890
The same icon is going to be used on the front and the back of the card,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.270
so this one is called front-back.svg.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.700
Place in some alt text and we can now duplicate this for all the three remaining links.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.605
Copy and paste the full list item.

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:47.560
This next list item is for the inside left.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.170
The icon name is inside left.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.240
The alt text, copy this one,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.300
then change all of these occurrences to inside right.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.010
We have the router link,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.920
we have the text,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.915
the image source, the alt text.

00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:19.120
We can also fix this typo too.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.745
Finally, paste in the last one and this is for the back of the card.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:31.170
We know what to do now, the router link, the text.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.920
Remember, this one shares the same icon as the front,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.975
so this name was front-back.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:43.330
Then wrap up this last link with the alt text.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.780
Save this file and this component is going to be placed inside of

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.805
the create.view. First import this.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:54.765
Once you duplicate the CardEdit,

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:57.910
this one is for SwitchPage.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.180
There's the path and also import this into our components object.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.940
Place this at the very top.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.745
Over to the browser at the front, inside left.

00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:19.755
This is also changing the URL,

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:22.335
the inside right, the back too.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:28.115
Notice how each one of these links is just replacing the end section of our URL.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:31.430
This is because when we added the router link,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.425
we have not used a forward slash before any of these routes.

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:37.535
If we did use a forward slash,

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:41.070
just like this, click on the back.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.130
This will then replace our full URL.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.890
But leaving this out will only replace the section which we're currently on.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.940
Another thing to note here is when we click on any of these links,

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.360
the selected page is not being updated.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.540
The reason why this doesn't update is the same reason as

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.035
earlier when we tried to upgrade these three category links.

00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:06.845
This is because we are still on the same create components,

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.380
so when we just switched the parameters like we are here,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.455
no update will occur.

00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:13.850
We can also fix this with the same solution,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.940
which is to add a watcher,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.860
or to useCurrentCard at the very top.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.410
Import watch and we can watch for a change of parameters.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.350
First pass in a getter function which is going to watch

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.519
for any changes to all router parameters,

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.250
and in particular, our page.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.810
Next, a callback function,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.020
which is going to run each time there is a change,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.720
and its function is already setup just above.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.120
This, and add a semicolon just after our watcher.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.990
Keep this separate from the below expression and then over to the browser.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.950
Refresh. We see the front because we're only front URL.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.845
Inside, left, inside right,

00:05:04.845 --> 00:05:08.320
and also, the back is working too.
