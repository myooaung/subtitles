00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
Hey, welcome to this images section.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:04.440
In these upcoming videos,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.530
we're going to look at how we can allow the user to upload

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.430
a new image to any one of our four card pages.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.010
This image will be a background just like the ones we've seen on the sample cards.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.590
These images will be uploaded,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.450
we'll read the file contents,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.415
we'll save them to Cloudinary,

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.499
we'll update our card preview,

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.130
and alongside all of this we'll also look at how we can remove

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.500
existing images and also reposition them too. I'll see you in there.
