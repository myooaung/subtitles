00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
Welcome, you've made it to the composition API section.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:08.910
This composition API is a view version-free feature and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.160
something which is probably the most eagerly awaited part of this new library.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.660
We'll take a look at composition from the beginning using sets of functions,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
we'll also integrate it into our creative cards application.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.900
We'll look at all of the new features which provides how

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.205
we can split up our code into composable files,

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.515
how we can import and reuse it.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:35.535
Also, we'll look at how we can integrate some of the things we already know,

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.320
such as: different methods,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.030
how we can create functions,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.010
how we can create computed properties, watchers,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.160
and also some of the new features such as watch effects,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.935
and how to add reactivity too.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm looking forward to this section and I will see you in the next video.
