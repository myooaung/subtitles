Hey, welcome to this course.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.585
This course is going to teach you everything you need to know to get started with

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:17.290
Vue.js and also all of the new and improved features with Vue version 3.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.140
You will build these four projects while learning from

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.830
over 130 clear and organized HD video lessons,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.700
each one supplied with captions and also the source code for each project stage.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.310
So you shouldn't have any problems if you get stuck.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.525
Who am I? My name is Chris and I'm a web developer from the UK.

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:32.285
I built my first ever website over 20 years ago.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.980
The web has changed quite a lot during this time,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.565
but my passion for learning and also teaching of this still remains.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:43.665
I've also used Vue.js from the early days,

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:46.090
so I've got lots of experience both using for

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.215
my own websites and also with teaching of this too.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.265
I'm excited for this one,

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:54.930
and I will see you in the class.
