00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.790
I hope that went well for you,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.910
and I'm now going to complete this challenge and show you my solution.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.680
Starting with number 1,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.220
which was to create an object containing all of our links,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.900
just like we did with the blog post.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.160
Outside of Vue instance,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.165
our constant for our links which is going to be an array of objects.

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:26.405
The first one is the ID of 1,

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.290
the name which is going to be our home.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.985
The third property is going to be for our URL,

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.480
this is going to be the location where we're going to link to.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.055
The home link is going to be the index.html separated by a comma.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.065
We need two more links,

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:53.545
the ID of 2 and this one is going to link to our portfolio,

00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:58.950
and the URL is going to be portfolio.html.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.140
As mentioned in the last video,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.945
it doesn't matter if this page has been created or not,

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:06.760
all we are we interested in at this stage is to create a dynamic link.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.360
The third one is for contact me in the contact.html.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.630
Remove the array from our data property and we can either set

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.235
this via links or we can you see the ES6 shorthand.

00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:25.690
Since both of these words are the same,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.120
this takes care of step one and step 2,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.435
and for step 3, we need to loop for these links and I'll put them in our HTML.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:39.315
Over in our Index page we already have the for loop setup,

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:41.240
so this is taken care of.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.105
The next step is to add eight dynamic key,

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:48.900
which is going to be link.id.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.210
Since link is now an object,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.180
we also need to pass in the name and it should all now still work in the browser.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.525
Finally, step 4 is to use the <a> element to create a dynamic href.

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.990
First of all the v-bind directive,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.805
or we can once again use the shorthand which is e colon,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:09.920
and then rather than the forward slash,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.430
we can access the link.url.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.605
I can try out all links in the browser,

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:21.260
home link will still link to this current page, the portfolio.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.800
This links to forward slash

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.875
portfolio.html and the forward slash contact me is working too.

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:31.640
Again, don't worry if this is linking to a file which we haven't created,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.920
all that matters is our links are now working.
