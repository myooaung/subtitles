00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.630
This video is going to focus on finishing off some of

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.335
the CSS touches which we need to add to our project,

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:11.175
starting with the font over in the app.vue.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.115
Currently, we have this font that's just here,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.350
and you're free to use this one if you prefer,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.660
or any other font family.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.685
With the start project,

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.475
if we go into the index.html,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:24.930
inside the header section,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.275
we have this link to two different font families.

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:31.890
This Merriweather is the one I'm going to place inside the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.290
app.vue and we already used this overblown early on inside of the header.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.680
We can see this if we go into the app header.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.785
This is the font which we set for this section.

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.200
But let's go back over to the app.view.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.840
Let's place in the Merriweather font,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.280
with a Serif fallback,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.105
just in case there's any issues loading this font.

00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:01.320
Also, we'll add this font to the input,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.705
and also the text area too. Just copy this.

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.215
The reason we do this is because by default,

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:13.160
the inputs do not inherit the fonts automatically.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.265
So we also need to set them just like this.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:21.420
Let's save this. This new font has now taken effect.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.370
Inside of this create view,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.420
which you can see just here, we also have some issues to resolve.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.320
We have these huge page buttons which need to line up across the top,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.750
and also shrink down the size too.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.420
We also have some spacing between each one of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.505
these text sections and this also results in the sections being pushed off the page,

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:44.310
over to the text output component.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.305
We'll first deal with these text sections by removing

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:53.185
any default margins and taking advantage of the box-sizing too.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:57.640
The start section is all wrapped in the p element.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.770
The default margin will set back to be zero.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.430
Save this and check it's working.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.260
Each one of these p sections is also surrounded in the border.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.665
Remember when we add a border to any HTML element,

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:15.460
it will also add it to the overall size.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.575
To prevent this, we can set the box-sizing to be border-box.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:27.670
The next thing to do is to take out of these four buttons to switch the pages.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.540
This has its own component,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.200
which is the SwitchPage.vue.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.755
We'll have a pretty standard unordered list.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:42.060
We can make use of the CSS flexbox inside of the Style section.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.260
There's our links placed across the page because the default flex direction is

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.730
row and I think we just need to move these links just outside the card section.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.130
We can see these have this gray background color.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.490
But we're just going to go to the Create section,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.080
which is in the vues.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.635
I think we'll just lift this switch page components to be outside the wrapper.

00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:12.730
This will be placed just above all of the cards sections.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.960
If I go over to the style in inside of the switch page component,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.000
continue to work with the unordered list by adding some margin on the top and bottom,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.930
of 1.6 grams, and then zero on the left and right.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.870
The next thing we need to do is to reduce the size of each one of

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.275
these icons and also align the text to the center of this icon.

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:39.910
Each one of these links had the class of page select,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.030
and we can use this class to reduce this icon size.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.030
First of all, the alignments will make use of the flexbox,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.700
and then set the vertical alignment with line items into the center.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.740
There's our vertical alignment, and next,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.770
some margin on the right-hand side of 10 pixels.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.590
This is going to give us some spacing on the right-hand side of each one of

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.005
these links. Next, the image.

00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:18.855
The maximum width of this icon of this image is going to be 30 pixels.

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:22.055
It should reduce the size of our icons down.

00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:24.440
Also, if we add some margin onto the left,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.430
this we'll add a little bit of space in between the image and also the text.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.050
Good. This project now looks a little bit better,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.140
and you are also free to go ahead and change any styles which you would

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.655
like to just some base styles to improve the overall look and feel.

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:46.280
Just before we wrap up this section,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.960
we're next going to look at using provide and inject with the composition API.
