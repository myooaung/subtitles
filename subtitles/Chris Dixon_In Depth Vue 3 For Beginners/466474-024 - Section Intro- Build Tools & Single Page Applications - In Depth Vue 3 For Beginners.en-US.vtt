00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
Importing Vue.js as a CDN link is

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:07.500
really useful for simple projects or for getting started,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.415
learning all about Vue.

00:00:09.415 --> 00:00:12.840
But for bigger or more real-world applications,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.410
we generally want to use a more sophisticated setup.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.900
This will allow us to break down our applications into reusable components,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.270
place them into separate files,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.585
and create things like single-page applications.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:34.150
To do this, the upcoming videos are going to focus on a tool called the Vue CLI.
