00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
The last thing to do with our images is to remove them from this card.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.780
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.195
All we need to do is to set it by function,

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:13.365
which is going to select the background and set this to be an empty string.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.240
As with the rest of the update,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.990
head over to the useCurrentCard where we can setup a function.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.915
RemoveImage. This will be very similar to the updateImage,

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:31.395
so we can copy this line of code, paste this in.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.440
But this time instead of setting the URL,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.630
this is going to be an empty string.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.570
That's all we need to do. Return this function.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.269
Then we can place this in the imageUpload component,

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.010
save this as a constant.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.850
With this function, we could also return this part from

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.750
our setup and call this directly from our remove button.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.560
But instead what we're going to do is set up a new function called

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.400
remove and this is because not only do we want to call this function,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.740
we will also need to clear the image preview too.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.660
Set this up. The function called remove.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.885
First we'll access our state and the imagePreview and reset this to be an empty string.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:25.385
This will remove the smaller preview image we see inside of the edit screen.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.390
Then we can call our imported function.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.840
Return this back from our setup.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.210
We already have a remove_btn setup inside the template.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.460
We can [inaudible] @click,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.280
which is going to call this function.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.430
I'm going to give this a try over in the browser.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.040
Click on "remove." Our image is gone.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.780
We'll try and upload an image.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.925
Click on "remove." This will still delete the image,

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:04.080
leaving our image functionality all now complete.
