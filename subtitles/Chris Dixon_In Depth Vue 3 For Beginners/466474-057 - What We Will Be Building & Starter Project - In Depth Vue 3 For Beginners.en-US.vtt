00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.490
In the upcoming sections,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.900
we are going to be taking a look at

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.430
some different ways of parsing around data between our components.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.460
The section will be focused on slots.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.665
Then in the following section,

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:16.890
we'll take a look at something called Provide and Inject.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.670
To do this, we have a fresh project to begin working with.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.745
This is a dashboard which you can see just here.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.460
We'll be building this throughout this section.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.175
To begin, we have a overview section,

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:31.590
which we're going to click on from this left menu.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.395
This will then give us access to our data

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:38.130
which is going to be separated between our three components.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.705
We'll have the item sold where we'll parse down the data,

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.090
the sales total, and also,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.380
we'll filter by the top selling item too.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.310
The next link is for our orders.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.600
This is going to loop through all of our orders and display them on

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.335
this page along with our total sales components.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:00.820
This will be re-used from our overview section.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.415
As well as, this will also have our bestsellers page.

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:07.460
This will again loop through all of our orders.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.730
We'll then extract all of the sold products and then

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.485
we'll total them up in order of the quantity sold.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:20.225
This project will allow us to get a deeper understanding of how slots work in Vue.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.190
As with the previous projects,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.890
if you go to the GitHub repository.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.780
Inside of the downloads,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.230
you have a dashboard's data.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.435
This is just like the previous projects where we have a minimal Vue CLI setup.

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.730
Pretty much the only difference is in the source,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.310
we've removed the Hello World examples.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.940
Also, we have this orders. js file.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.875
This is an array of objects and this is just some sample data,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.320
some sample orders to get us started working with our data.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.465
All it contains is a ord number or an order ID.

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:02.515
Then, we have a array of items which have been sold for this order.

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:06.405
To get started, once you have downloaded the starter,

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.760
drag this over into your text editor.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.620
Then, we can run NPM install.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.300
Go ahead into the project directory and then install the modules with NPM install.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.240
Then, a server will run NPM run serve to start our development server.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.620
Then, open this up in the browser.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.350
Next, we'll set up the components and pages which we're going to need for this project.pa
