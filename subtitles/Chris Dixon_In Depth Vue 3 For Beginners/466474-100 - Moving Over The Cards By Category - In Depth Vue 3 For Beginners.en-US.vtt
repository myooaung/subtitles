00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.195
Let's now run through moving over the category related code from this category dotVue.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:08.910
If you are confident that yours are working

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.450
correctly and you completed it successfully in the last video,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.730
you can skip this video.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.215
To begin, we need this category constants and also our computed section too.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:29.295
Cut this out, go to the useCategory, paste this in.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.850
Then we also need to return the cardsByCategory,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.650
so I'm going to use this in over files.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.360
This is also making use of computed,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.080
so we also need to import this, only Vue library.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.760
Save this file, and back over to the category,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.755
we now need to clean up all of the unused code.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:53.695
We don't need the allCards,

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:55.500
we don't need the data,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.660
we can also remove our Vue library import and replace this with our useCategory.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.135
The @ symbol for the source folder,

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:13.125
composables, useCategory down through the setup.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.810
All this inside of a constant,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.815
and remember over in the useCategory we can now return in our cardsByCategory,

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:24.570
so we can import this inside the curly braces.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.220
We're importing missed from our function which was useCategory.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.725
We're still returning this cardsByCategory and using this up in a template.

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:39.810
Let's save this file and try this out.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.860
When we click through any of these categories,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.290
we see the category heading is changing.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.725
Currently, we still only have the same cards for each one,

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:52.180
because we've set this as the category in our composable.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.685
But this is something which we will address in the next video,

00:01:55.685 --> 00:02:00.990
where we take a look at how we can access a router inside of these files.
