00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.155
I like to give my courses very hands-on and practical.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.165
In this upcoming section,

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.910
we're going to put all of the composition knowledge which we've

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.330
learned into our creative cards projects.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.110
We will be pushing on by grabbing the selected card,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.430
which the user clicks on.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.185
We'll retrieve the pages.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.885
We'll switch between the different pages for the cards.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.495
We'll add our text inputs for our sections,

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.360
our text outputs so the user can preview them.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.730
We'll allow the sections to be updated,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.225
rearranged, edited, and so much more.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:35.850
This will be a good chance to reinforce

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
our composition knowledge alongside building our project.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.040
I'll see you in there.
