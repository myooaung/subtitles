00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.800
Inside of Vue.createApp, so far we've only been working inside of this data section.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, we are going to add a new section which is going to be for our methods.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.200
This will allow us to do lots of cool things such as changing our data,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.385
and generally making our apps a lot more interactive and useful.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.700
If you are familiar with functions in JavaScript,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.605
methods do the same thing.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.600
For instance, they have the name method because they're part of this object.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.355
Whereas our data section was set up as a function,

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:39.430
our method to setup as an object because we're going to call them manually.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.145
Make sure we are outside of our data section.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:46.930
Let's scroll down to the closing curly brace.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.590
Then after this we're going to set up our methods, use it as an object.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.065
The first method which we're going to use is going to be to toggle our dark mode.

00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:03.020
This is because we don't want too much JavaScript logic replaced in our HTML file.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.715
We're going to abstract the toggling of our color scheme into this method.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:12.800
Let's cut this out and paste this inside of our method.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.335
Then we need to change dark mode set to be this.darkModeSet.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:22.655
The reason we're using this, this keyword is because both the data section

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:27.550
and also the method section is part of what is called the options API.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.845
The sections amongst others which we'll look at soon,

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:35.800
have access to each Vue properties by using this keyword.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.110
For example, our methods can access anything from

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.440
the data section as long as we use this keyword,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.750
so could access this.name,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.695
this.links and also in return the data section can call our method,

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:52.530
or we could say this.togglemode.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.810
Now all that's left to do is to call this method from our index page.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.810
Passing it toggle mode, refresh the browser,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.750
and now we can still switch between

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.430
our two color versions for this time by extracting all code into a method.
