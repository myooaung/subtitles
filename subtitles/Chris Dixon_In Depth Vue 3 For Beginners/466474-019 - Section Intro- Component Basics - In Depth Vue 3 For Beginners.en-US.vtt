When working with front-end frameworks or libraries like Vue.js,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
one of the most important concepts to learn is components.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.220
In the upcoming videos, we're going to discover how

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.055
Vue.js uses components, what they are,

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.035
the different component types,

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.760
and then we can look at things such as how we can pass data between these components.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.040
