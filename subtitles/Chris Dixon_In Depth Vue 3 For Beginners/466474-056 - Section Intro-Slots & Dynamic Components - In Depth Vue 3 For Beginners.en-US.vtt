00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.355
So far, we've looked at various different ways of passing data between our components.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:09.765
We've looked at how we can pass props from a parent down to a child component,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.645
and how we can omit custom events backup.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.030
But next in this section,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.520
we're going to take a look at something called slots,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.215
which is a really flexible way of passing data between our components.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:27.255
But also, we'll have a new project to style which is a dashboard application.

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:31.780
Next, we'll take a look at how we can download this and get started.
