00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
We now have two links at the top of the page.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.875
We have the Home which links to forward slash.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.215
Then also the About Us page too.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:11.870
This is in much need two routes which we've seen in the router file just here,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.270
and then mapping to our components.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.970
The Vue CLI is automatically added in these two routes photos.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.955
But generally, we need to add these in our cells.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:23.280
Also, these links which you see here,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.250
if we go over to our App.vue,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.925
the CLI has already added these two links in photos using the router link.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:37.055
Router link is a component which accepts the two prop as an attribute.

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:41.165
It's inside here where we pass in the route which we want to navigate to.

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:45.650
We can place these router links in any components or any page which we want to.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.470
Using this router link is also preferred over using

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.595
the regular HTML a elements for various reasons.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:56.555
If we take a look at the outputs of any browser developer tools,

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:01.235
right-click "Inspect", open up the body section,

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:05.095
and take a look for the app in navigation.

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:07.280
We see in place of our router link,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.665
we have this a element,

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.885
our Home, and also the About link.

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:16.220
There is however, a difference between the a element which has been added automatically,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.524
among which we add ourselves.

00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:20.420
When we have history mode set,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.040
which we'll take a look at soon,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.370
this link which has been added in will intercept any clicks and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.395
prevent the browser from refreshing the page automatically.

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:32.225
Do try to use a router link where possible,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.110
rather than a HTML link element.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.720
Also, if you have used the router in Vue version 2,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.050
you may have also used the Tag prompt just like this.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.350
This allowed us to change the element which wrapped our link,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.225
any other HTML element such as a list item.

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:54.215
However, do be aware that this is not available in the latest version of the router,

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.085
so you will need to remove this if you have it on any existent projects.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:01.970
We're not just limited to passing in a static string like this,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.915
about two prop, we can also pass in dynamic data too.

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:08.930
For example, we may have a user just like this.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.090
Let's create a script section with our export default,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.750
with our data section,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.995
and then we're going to return a user.

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:27.870
This user can be an object with the name and also a user ID.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.645
We can then make this dynamic with the colon and then pass in

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:36.740
a template string inside of the [inaudible].

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.910
We may want to go to a route,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.665
which is forward slash user,

00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:42.240
and then the user's ID.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.305
Give this a save, refresh,

00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:48.090
and now if we click on "About",

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.740
this sends us to user/12345,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.950
and this gives us an ID of the flexibility which we have when selecting new routes.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.095
We can also extend even further by passing in an object.

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:03.860
Rather than our path just like this,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.660
we can pass in our object.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.460
It's more simple, we can pass in a path which we want to navigate to.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.575
Again, we can pass in a dynamic path or we can just add in a regular string.

00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:17.390
This will also need to be dynamic,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.250
so we add the binding.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.050
Same for our second link,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.130
we can add in the path.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.000
Now, since we have an object,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.060
we can also add additional properties too.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.180
For now, give this a save and we can refresh the browser,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.600
link to our Home and also the About Us page too, or alternatively,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.625
instead of referencing a path just like this,

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:44.435
we can also go off the router and into the index or js,

00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:48.085
and then use the name which we've already provided inside here.

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:51.960
We have the Home and also the About Us names,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.110
either one of these can now be used over in our router link.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.435
Inside of our object, we can replace our path with the name property.

00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:02.025
On the first one was Home,

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.930
and the second one was About.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.605
Let's test this out, refresh.

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.965
It still navigates to our two pages.

00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:17.870
Just bellow our links, we can see the page content just below.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.090
The reason we can see this is because of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.465
this router view which has been placed under our links.

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:27.020
This acts as an [inaudible] for the components which we are currently viewing.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.900
We can place this anywhere inside of our template.
