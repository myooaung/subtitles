00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.890
At the moment, when we click on any of these links just here,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.560
we're taken through to the category page,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650
but we still see the same cards for each one.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.100
So this children category will still show anniversary one.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.635
Go to travel, we'll see the same cards.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.470
This is because over in our use category.Js,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.510
where you set the category,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.840
if it is fixed value, this fixed category means

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.515
that the values is always the same regardless of the category we click on.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.680
In this video though, we are going to replace this and make it more

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.445
dynamic by accessing it, the URL parameters.

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:38.945
So currently, we have this travel parameter.

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:40.310
We click on any of these.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.705
These will always appear inside of the URL.

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:46.130
So what we're going to do now is to grab

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.675
this parameter and then provide this to our computed section.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:56.675
Where we're going to do this is by accessing the router over in the category.vue.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:59.450
So each time we call caused by category,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.360
we'll pass in a parameter to this function,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.609
and then we can use this inside of here,

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:06.860
instead of this hard-coded value.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.685
So let's get to work with passing our router to this function.

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.150
With the Options API, we could do something like this.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.575
We could access this.router.params,

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:21.750
and this will work perfect defined with the Options API.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.130
When using the composition however,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.665
this keyword is not available.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:30.525
So we need to access the router in a different way.

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:33.515
For this, the view relative package

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:37.010
allows us to import functions from the router package.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.960
We can access useRouter

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.530
fully full router object or useRoute for the current router information.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.680
First, we need to import this from the view router package.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.230
So the first one was useRoute,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.050
and the second one was useRouter,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.485
and this is from the vueRouter package.

00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:03.750
To access both of these in a setup,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.575
we'll then install these inside of consonants.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:10.670
So the first one is the router,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.235
which is equal to useRouter.

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:15.590
This is a function so it needs to call it.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.080
The second one is the individual route and most of that is equal to useRoute.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.280
These two constants will now work just like earlier when

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.400
accessed $Router for the full router package and the $Route,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.100
which is the current route we're on, therefore,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.085
we still have access to all of these same things such as router.push,

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.725
where we can navigate through a new page.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.050
Well, this is where we only need access to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.155
the current route since we want to, select the parameters.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:49.705
So we can remove the router and also the import too,

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:54.065
and we can check we have all the information we need with console.log.

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:58.240
Pass in the route.params.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.795
Refresh and open up the developer tools, into the console.

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:06.945
Have the birthday, which we see just here,

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:09.570
and also the wedding too.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.585
So now we can make use of this with the console.log,

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:15.730
and we can now pass this to our function when we call it.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.340
So the route.params, and we want to access the category parameter.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.560
Now, let's head over to use category where we can now pass this into our function.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.570
Since we've named this category,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.555
we can also remove our category constant from below,

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:34.490
and now in place of this computed section,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.535
we'll use the category which is passed to this function.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:40.855
Let's test this out. Over to the browser.

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:44.640
Let's go for wife. We'll see the one which we had just before.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.780
Celebrate. All. Travel. So these are all currently working,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.290
but if we click on our free links about the top,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.965
click through all of these and our cards stay exactly the same.

00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:00.770
So currently, these three navigation links don't work,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.200
but this is something which we're going to fix very soon.
