00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.105
We've now converted our overview page to use provide and inject.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.120
What I would like you to do now as a challenge is to go

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.530
ahead and do the same for the orders and the best sellers pages.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.600
Now in the App.vue,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.415
we still have commented out

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:23.970
our bestseller section and scrolling up we also have this orders section here too.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.195
We've already done the overview so we can ignore this.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.755
What I would like you to do is to move over all of the slot contents,

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:33.480
which we have for each page,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.925
into the individual components,

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.490
just like we did with the overview where we extracted

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.475
all the contents into the individual components.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:47.075
Then fill any sections which have dynamic data such as this path,

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.480
set up by provide inside of this App.vue and then

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.415
inject the data into the required components of ages.

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:58.890
They'll give us a go and next I'll walk through how I did it.
