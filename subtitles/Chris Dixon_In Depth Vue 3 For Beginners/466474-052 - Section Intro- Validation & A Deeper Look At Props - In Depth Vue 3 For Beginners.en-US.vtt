00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.365
We don't just want to throw any old data into old components.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:07.350
We want to be more specific about the type of data we're

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.620
going to receive and the formats which it's in.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.105
Otherwise, we may get errors and we don't want those in our application.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.045
We're going to take a look at this in the next video,

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:22.290
and then we'll follow up with taking a look at something called non-prop attributes,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.340
which is a different way of passing data between our components.
