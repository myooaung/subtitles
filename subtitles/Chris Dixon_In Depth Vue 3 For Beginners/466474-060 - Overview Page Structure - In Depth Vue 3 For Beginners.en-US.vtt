00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.350
You see these slots in action inside of our project.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.165
We first need some content to work with.

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:11.640
Currently, we have all of our views and our components setup,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.285
but we don't have anything registered on the page just yet.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.765
To do this, we're going to go over to our App.vue.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.755
Inside here we have this div with the class of app_wrapper.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:26.160
This class just simply points to some styles which is going to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.075
set the font family and also the base font color.

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:33.660
What we're going to do is to add some structure to this app,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.525
and also import and register our first page which is the overview.view.

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:43.940
To do this, we'll import this just like any regular components.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.410
The name is Overview and this is from./.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.420
This is in our Views folder,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.425
and then component name is Overview.

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.920
Setup our components section.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.970
Inside here we only have one component for now, so pass it in.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.310
We see an error because we've not used this just yet,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.800
but we'll first add our structure inside of our app_wrapper.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.130
The first thing we're going to do is to create a header section,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.650
and this is going to contain a level one title with the text of Chris's Dashboard.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.810
This header section a div with the class of content,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.280
and this section is going to contain two nested sections.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.075
The first one is the sidebar with links to our free pages,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:38.074
and then on the right-hand side we'll have some content,

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:41.660
which is for each one of these pages which we've clicked on.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.655
First of all, the aside element.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:48.615
Then after this, the main.

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:53.900
The aside section for now is just going to contain three different links.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.270
We don't need href because we're going to control it using view.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.075
The first link is Overview.

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:03.660
I have two more pages,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.255
the second one is Orders,

00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:09.760
and the third one is Best Sellers.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.495
That's it for the aside bar.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:18.005
Then into the main section what we're going to do is, first of all,

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.690
pass in inside of these small tags,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.840
and inside of here we're going to pass in some breadcrumbs

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.440
to let the user know exactly where they are on our site.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.800
This would say, something just like dashboard/overview.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.765
We'll change this section depending on which page we are currently on.

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:42.950
To style this I'm also going to cut out the dashboard section and add a span element.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.619
So we'll give this a different color inside of our CSS.

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.160
After this, the actual page content,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.690
and for now we only have one component to display.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.780
This is the overview,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.060
we will post some data to this overview very soon.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.775
But for now, let's go down to the style sheets.

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:04.585
We're going to begin with our header section.

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:08.030
The header section is going to have a white background color.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.750
It's also going to make use of the css flexbox too.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.675
Firstly, background which is a white color.

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:18.970
Then add a border on the top and also the bottom.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.670
This will be one pixel,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.735
a solid line, and then the color of ddd.

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:28.500
This Chris's gray line on the very top,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.390
we'll also add one on the bottom,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.065
and then soon we'll also add a vertical line which is going to

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:36.870
separate our sidebar only page content.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.910
Duplicate this. I will also add one on the bottom.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.350
After our header section,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.600
we have our content section,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.640
which is the div surrounding both the aside and also the main section.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.985
This is basically all the content below our header.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.310
To style this and position this,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.680
we'll set the display time to be flex.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.770
The default flex direction is raw when using flexbox.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.395
Now these two sections will now appear side-by-side.

00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:13.400
To set the width of each, one,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.620
we're going to use the flexbox fonts again,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.785
and the aside section can have the flex value of 1,

00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:22.045
and then the main section will have the flex value of 3.

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:27.000
This means, the main section will take up three times the width of the sidebar,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.880
over the aside bar the flex value of 1.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.180
But also a much in boarder,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.325
but this time this is going to be vertical.

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:39.370
Then we need to place this border onto the right,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.720
and that's our line just there,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.385
and we need to make sure that this line is the full height of the page.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.300
What we're going to do for this section is set

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.685
the minimum height be 100 percent of the viewport.

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:54.980
This line now goes right down to the very bottom.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.905
Now over to our main section of on the right,

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.370
it has the main wrapper.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.690
The flex value of 3, so this takes

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.885
about three times the available space from the sidebar,

00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:08.840
and then a padding value of 1ram.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.670
Last thing to do in this section is also to change the color of our breadcrumbs.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.590
So we're now going surrounded the dashboard with this class of blue.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.960
We can now use this to set the color.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.320
The text color will have a RGB value

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.440
of 25, 149 and 243.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.730
We can also space out inside of this folder /2 of

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.690
HTML all we need to do is to add a space just before and after and there we go.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.880
This now gives us a base to begin to explore our slots in the upcoming video.
