00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.250
This upcoming section will be focused on the card images.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.760
Each page, we place an image components over on

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
the edit side and this is going to sit just above our text input components.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.650
We'll have this at the top, and this will mean we can upload

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.995
a new image to any one of these pages.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.960
If we already have an image just like we have on the front cover here,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.610
we can also replace this image too.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.710
This image of low component is going to send the image of the Cloudinary.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.295
We're also going to display a little preview image once we selected this,

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:38.865
and also this will be updated in the card Vue 2.

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:42.320
To get going, we need a component of this to

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.620
the card folder and then we'll call this the image upload.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.900
Setup the templates.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.350
This whole component will be surrounded in

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.440
the div with the class of image upload wrapper.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.485
Inside this div, a level forehead in with the text of image,

00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:10.290
and then with that, we're using all the recommended image size.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.540
We'll keep to be 450 pixels by 600 pixels so this fits nicely on the card.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.210
Next, an input and the type for this input needs to be filed so the user can

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.000
select any image file from their own computer and image elements.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.590
But now this is going to be empty,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.240
we don't need a source.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.025
The source will be set very soon from the file which the user uploads.

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:41.800
This is going to be a small preview image,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.920
so it will give us the class of preview image,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.410
a div with the class of image patterns,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.130
this is a wrapper for a series of buttons which we'll go into

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.130
how to reposition the images to the top,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.870
the middle, and the bottom of the card,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.745
and also a button to remove these two.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:05.650
The top, the middle, and the bottom buttons are going to be grouped into

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.355
a div right in the first button and each one of these buttons is going to have an icon.

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:15.200
So we can go into the assets,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.760
into the icons folder.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.315
This one is the top.svg,

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:24.910
the whole text of image top selector,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.175
and then we'll do this two more times.

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:32.705
The icon for this,

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:36.855
again in the assets, into the icons.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:40.690
This one is the middle.svg.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.790
The final button is for the bottom.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.480
The icon for this is the bottom.svg,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.830
the last alt text is the image bottom.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.850
All three of these buttons are grouped together inside this div.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.320
If we go just below this,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.305
we'll add one fourth and final button which will be to remove the selected image.

00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:21.120
The class of remove_btn.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.670
I want to set this up to trigger a function later on in this section.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.640
But now, this is all of the templates action we need to display on

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.080
the screen and we want

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.640
this image upload component to display at the top of this edit section.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.920
So go over to the CardEdit.vue,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.670
import our component with the name of image upload.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.050
The file path is into the components,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.205
this was stored in the card folder,

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:59.050
and select our image upload,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.340
place this inside of the components object,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.070
and then render this at the top of our template.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.605
Over to the browser, there's our image, upload components,

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:20.185
and they should display for each one of all pages.

00:04:20.185 --> 00:04:22.790
This of course also needs some styling too.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.150
We need to align all of this content and also reduce the size of these buttons too.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.520
We also want this to blend in with the text inputs just

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.080
below so that we'll add some common shared styles to both of these sections.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.585
The image upload that we just created have this class of image upload wrapper,

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:47.990
and the text inputs which are just below has this class of text input wrapper.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.410
We can now apply some shared styles over in the app.vue to both of these sections.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.670
So down to the bottom of the style section,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.350
the first one is the image upload wrapper,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.730
and then also select the text input wrapper too.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.785
So for this, we're going to place some padding inside of the element,

00:05:11.785 --> 00:05:15.610
some spacing on the bottom of each one o0f these elements with a margin,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.265
a box shadow, and we'll also round the corners too.

00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:23.585
First, 10 pixels apart into all four sides.

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:29.800
So margin, which is only going to apply to the bottom of 10 pixels,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.565
a box shadow of one pixel,

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:40.090
one pixel, two, two.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.250
The color which is DDD,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.870
which will be a gray color,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.760
and I want this box shadow to be on the inside so we'll set this to be inset.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.080
This gives us this effect of the one pixel shadow on the right and also

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.725
the bottom and this also blends to two pixels on the top on the left.

00:05:57.725 --> 00:06:01.780
We'll run these corners off with the border radius.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.105
Just a small one will be fine, all three pixels.

00:06:06.105 --> 00:06:10.000
This now gives us the effect that these are all separate sections.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.050
Now, we're going to go back over to our image upload component and

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.669
apply some styles which now only apply to this image of low component.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.910
So the style which is also going to be scoped.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.830
First of all, push all the content over to the left by selecting the wrapper,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.750
which was image upload wrapper.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.240
Extra line off left,and then next,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.590
we're going to add some space in between all three of

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.235
these buttons and also reduce the icon size down to,

00:06:48.235 --> 00:06:50.760
we'll go up to the template.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.950
All of these four buttons are surrounded in this image buttons class.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.050
So if we set this Cluster B,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.745
a display type of flex,

00:06:58.745 --> 00:07:03.420
this group of buttons will appear alongside our Remove button.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.370
The class of image buttons,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.970
the display type of flex,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:18.310
and then spaces out with justify content and place the space between,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.730
as our button now alongside all three of these icons.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.685
Next, we'll reduce down the size of all three of these images.

00:07:27.685 --> 00:07:31.325
These were in the same wrapper which is the image buttons,

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:35.520
but we'll only apply this to the images.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.230
The width of 30 pixels.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.290
This is now a little bit smaller onto the level four heading which is the image text.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.795
The font weight of 300,

00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:55.930
and we'll just reduce down the size of this so we can see this better.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.100
This will just give us the lighter text.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.660
Also some margin of 10 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.970
and zero on the left and right.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.210
Moving down, we also need some space between this file input and our free images.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:20.300
So select our input and then we can place in the type which is equal to file,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.960
and the styling will only apply to any file inputs.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.800
Paste in some margin of zero on the top,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.235
zero on the right, 10 pixels on the bottom,

00:08:32.235 --> 00:08:34.515
and then zero on the left,

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:37.965
then some space between these buttons,

00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:40.860
grab all of our button elements,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.895
and then some margin on the right of five pixels.

00:08:45.895 --> 00:08:50.720
Good. The next thing we're going to do is to change the color of this Remove button and

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.510
also the hover color to at the bottom of all styles.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.810
These are the class of remove_btn.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.280
The only property we need to add inside of here is the color,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.570
add an RGB value of 208, 90,

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.240
and 90 for the blue,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.990
which gives us the red color we see here.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.875
Then finally, the hover state.

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:17.990
So I'm going to duplicate this, but this time,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.629
target the hover state and amend the RGB color to be 123,

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:27.560
44, and 44,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.300
which is just a slightly darker red color which we can see if we hover over this button.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.335
That's it now for the visuals of our image upload component.

00:09:36.335 --> 00:09:41.065
Next we need somewhere to actually store these images which the user uploads.

00:09:41.065 --> 00:09:45.590
For this, we're going to take a look at a service called Cloudinary.
