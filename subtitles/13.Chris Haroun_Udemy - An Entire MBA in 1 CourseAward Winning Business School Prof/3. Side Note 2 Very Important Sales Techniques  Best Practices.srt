00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,469
Two big sales techniques that I've learned from dealing with some of

2

00:00:04,469  -->  00:00:08,846
the most successful CEOs in the world is they do this.

3

00:00:08,846  -->  00:00:13,789
They stop talking once they sense the sale is done.

4

00:00:13,789  -->  00:00:16,010
Okay. Once they've sensed that their customer

5

00:00:16,010  -->  00:00:18,430
actually wants the product or service they're trying to sell,

6

00:00:18,430  -->  00:00:21,699
they actually shut up. They stop talking.

7

00:00:21,699  -->  00:00:26,754
Why? Because what happens is if you keep selling past the close,

8

00:00:26,754  -->  00:00:29,980
then people are going to sense desperation and think that there's

9

00:00:29,980  -->  00:00:33,575
something wrong here and that you might be overselling your product or service.

10

00:00:33,575  -->  00:00:38,079
So you want to stop speaking once you sense that the sale's been made.

11

00:00:38,079  -->  00:00:42,810
OK? And the second thing is â€” keep selling

12

00:00:42,810  -->  00:00:48,119
until you're convinced that they're not interested.

13

00:00:48,119  -->  00:00:50,274
OK? So if they're interested, stop talking.

14

00:00:50,274  -->  00:00:51,619
But if you're not sure if they're interested,

15

00:00:51,619  -->  00:00:52,683
you keep going man.

16

00:00:52,683  -->  00:00:55,256
You've got to be a pit bull on a pork chop,

17

00:00:55,256  -->  00:00:57,299
so to speak. Awful analogy, sorry.

18

00:00:57,299  -->  00:01:00,770
But, you want to keep selling until you hear the word "no".

19

00:01:00,770  -->  00:01:03,259
And so, quite often when I'm selling,

20

00:01:03,259  -->  00:01:05,245
I'll tell myself in my head,

21

00:01:05,245  -->  00:01:10,000
"All I heard was not 'no'." You gotta be relentless.
