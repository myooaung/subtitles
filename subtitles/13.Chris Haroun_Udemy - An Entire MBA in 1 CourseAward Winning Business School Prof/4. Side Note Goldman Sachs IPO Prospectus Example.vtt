00:00:00.619  -->  00:00:04.444
What is an IPO prospectus? What does it look like?

2

00:00:04.444  -->  00:00:07.080
Well, when I worked at Goldman Sachs,

3

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:12.554
this was the prospectus that the company used when they wanted to go public.

4

00:00:12.554  -->  00:00:17.460
And so, on the cover you can see you've got the name of the lead investment banker,

5

00:00:17.460  -->  00:00:20.775
which in this case is Goldman â€“ of course they chose themselves.

6

00:00:20.775  -->  00:00:22.500
Then you've got the other firms,

7

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:23.579
you've got Bear Stearns,

8

00:00:23.579  -->  00:00:25.170
which no longer exists; Lehman,

9

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:28.050
which no longer exists, wow; Morgan Stanley,

10

00:00:28.050  -->  00:00:29.219
which is great; Credit Suisse,

11

00:00:29.219  -->  00:00:31.789
which is awesome; and a bunch of other firms as well.

12

00:00:31.789  -->  00:00:36.070
And it has the number of shares on the top here.

13

00:00:36.070  -->  00:00:38.352
And then when you open it up,

14

00:00:38.352  -->  00:00:40.829
you get the use of proceeds,

15

00:00:40.829  -->  00:00:45.000
meaning what are they gonna use the money for that they raised in the IPO.

16

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:48.439
And part of it is for general business purposes,

17

00:00:48.439  -->  00:00:53.634
maybe acquiring other companies to grow or opening new offices or hiring more people.

18

00:00:53.634  -->  00:00:58.520
And the other part of it is actually to pay their employees, a lot of employees, right?

19

00:00:58.520  -->  00:01:00.710
Goldman for a long time, say, oh, that paid very well.

20

00:01:00.710  -->  00:01:01.789
I didn't get any shares.

21

00:01:01.789  -->  00:01:03.679
I was a little bit too late to that.

22

00:01:03.679  -->  00:01:06.844
I blame my parents. If they had me five years earlier, I'd have money.

23

00:01:06.844  -->  00:01:12.170
Just kidding. OK. You've got just a little bit more information on the company.

24

00:01:12.170  -->  00:01:16.640
You've got every risk you can possibly imagine as well listed in here.

25

00:01:16.640  -->  00:01:18.290
Anyway, this is what it looks like,

26

00:01:18.290  -->  00:01:21.685
and this is also referred to as an S-1, OK?

27

00:01:21.685  -->  00:01:28.129
So, you can go to sec.gov and do a search on S-1 for any company,

28

00:01:28.129  -->  00:01:29.790
really. So check out Facebook.

29

00:01:29.790  -->  00:01:34.300
Go to sec.gov, the ticker on Facebook is FB,

30

00:01:34.300  -->  00:01:36.185
and then try to find the S-1.

31

00:01:36.185  -->  00:01:39.349
And it has every bit of information you need to know about making

32

00:01:39.349  -->  00:01:45.000
an informed decision before deciding whether or not to participate in an IPO.
