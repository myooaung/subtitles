00:00:00.380  -->  00:00:03.720
Hiring and letting people go.

2

00:00:03.720  -->  00:00:08.605
Take a long time to hire and let people go if you have to quickly.

3

00:00:08.605  -->  00:00:13.195
They say it's harsh, but hire slowly, fire quickly.

4

00:00:13.195  -->  00:00:16.545
And if you have somebody that works with you

5

00:00:16.545  -->  00:00:21.300
that has a really bad attitude or is not adding value,

6

00:00:21.300  -->  00:00:24.980
that bad apple can destroy the whole culture of a company.

7

00:00:24.980  -->  00:00:28.791
So you've got to be careful and make sure you hire the right people.

8

00:00:28.791  -->  00:00:30.899
And when you're interviewing somebody,

9

00:00:30.899  -->  00:00:33.115
you want to interview them in several settings.

10

00:00:33.115  -->  00:00:35.155
You know, one is at the office obviously with everybody,

11

00:00:35.155  -->  00:00:37.049
one on one and in group settings.

12

00:00:37.049  -->  00:00:41.755
Another one could be at dinner to see what they're like outside of work.

13

00:00:41.755  -->  00:00:43.590
And then when it comes to references,

14

00:00:43.590  -->  00:00:48.899
you want to make sure that you don't call the references they provide to you.

15

00:00:48.899  -->  00:00:50.946
Obviously, they are only going to give you

16

00:00:50.946  -->  00:00:53.310
references for people that will say great stuff about them.

17

00:00:53.310  -->  00:00:57.179
So leverage LinkedIn as much as you can and try to see if you

18

00:00:57.179  -->  00:01:01.780
can find people you have in common with them and get references from them.

19

00:01:01.780  -->  00:01:03.674
Just give them a call.

20

00:01:03.674  -->  00:01:06.730
And so that's, that's how I approach hiring.
