00:00:00.900  -->  00:00:03.970
How to avoid burnout.

2

00:00:03.970  -->  00:00:07.179
Probably, the best lessons I got in my career early on when I worked at

3

00:00:07.179  -->  00:00:11.515
Goldman Sachs was: there was a client that worked at Manulife,

4

00:00:11.515  -->  00:00:13.881
which is a big insurance company based out of Toronto,

5

00:00:13.881  -->  00:00:16.929
and her name was Rhonda Chang and she was the best client ever.

6

00:00:16.929  -->  00:00:19.644
She is awesome. And she told me, Chris,

7

00:00:19.644  -->  00:00:24.557
when you return from vacation the first thing you want to do is open up your calendar,

8

00:00:24.557  -->  00:00:25.855
look six months out,

9

00:00:25.855  -->  00:00:27.855
and book you next vacation.

10

00:00:27.855  -->  00:00:30.129
And I said, oh, that's great feedback.

11

00:00:30.129  -->  00:00:31.809
That's a great idea. Of course, I never follow through.

12

00:00:31.809  -->  00:00:33.399
I was just a young guy.

13

00:00:33.399  -->  00:00:35.399
I thought I had too much energy, whatever.

14

00:00:35.399  -->  00:00:37.265
Whatever I burned out, I burned up.

15

00:00:37.265  -->  00:00:39.207
And the amount of time that you burn out,

16

00:00:39.207  -->  00:00:41.619
let's say you work five weeks at a hundred hours a week,

17

00:00:41.619  -->  00:00:43.954
okay, without a break.

18

00:00:43.954  -->  00:00:45.924
That amount of time, that five weeks,

19

00:00:45.924  -->  00:00:47.950
is how much time it can take you to unburn out.

20

00:00:47.950  -->  00:00:50.160
So it's gonna take you at least five weeks to unburnout,

21

00:00:50.160  -->  00:00:51.850
so be careful, be careful.

22

00:00:51.850  -->  00:00:53.789
Book that vacation, always,

23

00:00:53.789  -->  00:00:56.015
you know, six months out.

24

00:00:56.015  -->  00:00:59.259
And also another thing I want to say is that since the beginning of

25

00:00:59.259  -->  00:01:05.209
time we have always been told that the seventh day is a day of rest.

26

00:01:05.209  -->  00:01:08.049
I'm not going to get all religious on you but I

27

00:01:08.049  -->  00:01:10.954
think it's very smart not to work on Sundays.

28

00:01:10.954  -->  00:01:12.879
In fact in my house, we have a policy called

29

00:01:12.879  -->  00:01:18.430
Screen-Free Sundays and if my kids see me working on Sunday they give me heck for it.

30

00:01:18.430  -->  00:01:20.805
They're like dad, dad, you're not supposed to be working.

31

00:01:20.805  -->  00:01:22.719
And so you need to take your breaks.

32

00:01:22.719  -->  00:01:26.000
You need to take your breaks. Otherwise, otherwise, you'll burn out.
