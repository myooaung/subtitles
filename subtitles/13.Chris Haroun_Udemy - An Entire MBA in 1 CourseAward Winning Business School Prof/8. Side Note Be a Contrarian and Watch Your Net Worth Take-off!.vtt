00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:05.655
Be a contrarian and watch your career and your net worth take off.

2

00:00:05.655  -->  00:00:08.855
There's that old cliche — you want to buy low, sell high.

3

00:00:08.855  -->  00:00:12.625
But Warren Buffett really summarized it beautifully when he said,

4

00:00:12.625  -->  00:00:17.076
"You want to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."

5

00:00:17.076  -->  00:00:20.140
Basically, do the opposite in many situations.

6

00:00:20.140  -->  00:00:22.795
And so, if everybody is buying a stock,

7

00:00:22.795  -->  00:00:27.065
don't buy that stock along with them because who's the incremental buyer after you?

8

00:00:27.065  -->  00:00:28.479
There's not that many people.

9

00:00:28.479  -->  00:00:30.374
You want to be long-term focused.

10

00:00:30.374  -->  00:00:32.219
Number one, Warren Buffett said, "The longer the view,

11

00:00:32.219  -->  00:00:33.875
the wiser the intention."

12

00:00:33.875  -->  00:00:36.280
And remember that quote from him.

13

00:00:36.280  -->  00:00:38.140
He said that the New York Stock Exchange is

14

00:00:38.140  -->  00:00:41.825
the only store where consumers sell stuff when it goes on sale.

15

00:00:41.825  -->  00:00:43.509
And so you want to be contrarian — you want to,

16

00:00:43.509  -->  00:00:48.520
you want to buy stuff that nobody wants and you want to sell stuff that everybody wants.

17

00:00:48.520  -->  00:00:52.494
I know it sounds simplistic but if you're a contrarian in business and life,

18

00:00:52.494  -->  00:00:55.000
you'll be very successful in the long run.
