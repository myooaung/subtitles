1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,850
Touch hand only once.

2

00:00:02,850  -->  00:00:04,995
You know, when I started working in consulting,

3

00:00:04,995  -->  00:00:07,644
my boss told me that the second an

4

00:00:07,644  -->  00:00:10,330
interoffice envelope or piece of paper touches your hand,

5

00:00:10,330  -->  00:00:12,734
deal with it right away, right away.

6

00:00:12,734  -->  00:00:17,269
And the most successful people are the most busy people. They can accomplish a lot.

7

00:00:17,269  -->  00:00:18,989
And in this day and age,

8

00:00:18,989  -->  00:00:20,814
in a digital setting,

9

00:00:20,814  -->  00:00:22,620
when you see an email, deal with it right away,

10

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:25,350
right away, right away if you can or flag it and deal with it

11

00:00:25,350  -->  00:00:28,949
later that night if it's something that's gonna take you hours to complete.

12

00:00:28,949  -->  00:00:30,774
But you want to touch hand only once.

13

00:00:30,774  -->  00:00:32,124
You always want to tell yourself, "I do it now,

14

00:00:32,124  -->  00:00:33,869
I do it now, I do it now."

15

00:00:33,869  -->  00:00:36,299
And you'll be much more productive in business and

16

00:00:36,299  -->  00:00:40,000
life if you follow that methodology of touch hand only once.
