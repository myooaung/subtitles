00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.525
When you're managing people you always want to praise in public and criticize in private.

2

00:00:06.525  -->  00:00:10.169
Okay? There's nothing more demeaning than

3

00:00:10.169  -->  00:00:15.005
being criticized by your boss in front of your coworkers.

4

00:00:15.005  -->  00:00:17.039
It's happened to me multiple times in the past,

5

00:00:17.039  -->  00:00:20.635
and so I've learned a lot how not to manage by working for the wrong people.

6

00:00:20.635  -->  00:00:22.635
And I've worked for the right people more often than not.

7

00:00:22.635  -->  00:00:27.585
But you always want to praise in public and criticize in private.

8

00:00:27.585  -->  00:00:30.809
And you always want to approach your boss and

9

00:00:30.809  -->  00:00:33.924
ask her or him for feedback every three months or so.

10

00:00:33.924  -->  00:00:35.800
How am I doing? How am I doing?

11

00:00:35.800  -->  00:00:40.865
In that way you won't wake up one day and get let go.

12

00:00:40.865  -->  00:00:42.659
For example, if you always know where you stand,

13

00:00:42.659  -->  00:00:44.100
you always ask for feedback,

14

00:00:44.100  -->  00:00:46.149
then you're always on the right track.

15

00:00:46.149  -->  00:00:47.649
And what I've done often is,

16

00:00:47.649  -->  00:00:50.560
you'll never get promoted unless you ask to be promoted.

17

00:00:50.560  -->  00:00:52.465
You'll never get a raise, unless you ask get a raise.

18

00:00:52.465  -->  00:00:55.067
Remember the "Steve Jobs Ask" video?

19

00:00:55.067  -->  00:00:58.865
So, you have to ask to get promoted and how do you do this?

20

00:00:58.865  -->  00:01:01.890
Well, you sit down with your boss and you ask her or him,

21

00:01:01.890  -->  00:01:06.765
"What do I need to be considered for promotion or the next level?"

22

00:01:06.765  -->  00:01:09.079
And they'll tell you.

23

00:01:09.079  -->  00:01:12.349
And you create a list of those items and once you achieve them,

24

00:01:12.349  -->  00:01:14.629
just very politely sit down with them and say,

25

00:01:14.629  -->  00:01:18.019
"I've achieved all these milestones that we spoke about.

26

00:01:18.019  -->  00:01:20.524
Can I please get a promotion or can I please get a raise".

27

00:01:20.524  -->  00:01:22.459
Because I promise you, if you don't ask for

28

00:01:22.459  -->  00:01:26.269
a raise or you don't ask for a promotion - you'll never get it.
