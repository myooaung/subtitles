00:00:00,650  -->  00:00:03,450
Many years ago my dad gave me some advice.

2

00:00:03,450  -->  00:00:06,990
He said you want to keep that letter in your drawer and mail it the

3

00:00:06,990  -->  00:00:10,644
next day and I know that sounds antiquated because we don't use real letters anymore.

4

00:00:10,644  -->  00:00:14,685
But what he was telling me was if you write a letter to somebody or

5

00:00:14,685  -->  00:00:19,890
an email and your tone is slightly negative in that email,

6

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:23,460
don't send it right away because that might ruin

7

00:00:23,460  -->  00:00:25,379
your career or your reputation or

8

00:00:25,379  -->  00:00:27,898
your relationship with customers or partners or coworkers.

9

00:00:27,898  -->  00:00:32,764
Instead, save it as a draft and then send it the next day.

10

00:00:32,764  -->  00:00:34,170
And I often have my wife,

11

00:00:34,170  -->  00:00:36,059
who's one of my awesome mentors,

12

00:00:36,059  -->  00:00:38,520
she's amazing, I have her read my e-mails,

13

00:00:38,520  -->  00:00:40,380
too, if I'm not sure as well.

14

00:00:40,380  -->  00:00:42,475
And I'm also very careful with tone in e-mails.

15

00:00:42,475  -->  00:00:45,119
I try to include the word please and thank you because

16

00:00:45,119  -->  00:00:48,420
in every e-mail if you don't include please and thank you, and you don't overdo it,

17

00:00:48,420  -->  00:00:51,090
but if you don't come across as very

18

00:00:51,090  -->  00:00:55,015
polite then somebody could read the e-mail out of context.

19

00:00:55,015  -->  00:00:56,640
And so, keep that letter in

20

00:00:56,640  -->  00:00:59,789
your drawer until the next morning and if you still feel like you

21

00:00:59,789  -->  00:01:01,770
want to mail that letter or send that e-mail

22

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:05,669
then open up your drawer or go to your draft emails and send it.
