00:00:00.479  -->  00:00:03.555
Nobody is smarter than you.

2

00:00:03.555  -->  00:00:05.134
I'm not telling you to be arrogant,

3

00:00:05.134  -->  00:00:06.924
I'm just telling you to be confident because

4

00:00:06.924  -->  00:00:09.500
with confident comes the ability to sell an idea,

5

00:00:09.500  -->  00:00:13.304
raise money, get a job, close deals.

6

00:00:13.304  -->  00:00:15.474
And I want you to stop this recording,

7

00:00:15.474  -->  00:00:17.137
this video right now, please,

8

00:00:17.137  -->  00:00:19.390
and go to YouTube and watch this video.

9

00:00:19.390  -->  00:00:21.730
And I mentioned it before but it's very important. I watched it multiple times.

10

00:00:21.730  -->  00:00:24.114
And it's a Steve Jobs video.

11

00:00:24.114  -->  00:00:26.050
So I want you to search on this in YouTube,

12

00:00:26.050  -->  00:00:31.570
"Steve Jobs nobody is smarter than you" or "Steve Jobs smarter than you".

13

00:00:31.570  -->  00:00:35.429
And once you realize that everything

14

00:00:35.429  -->  00:00:40.045
around you was created by people that are no smarter than you, you'll never be the same.

15

00:00:40.045  -->  00:00:41.412
So watch that video.

16

00:00:41.412  -->  00:00:45.000
It's very touching and motivating and inspiring as well.
