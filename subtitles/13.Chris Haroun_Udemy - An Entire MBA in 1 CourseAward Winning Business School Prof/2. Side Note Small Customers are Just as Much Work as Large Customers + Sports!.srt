1

00:00:00,920  -->  00:00:05,009
Small clients are just as much work as big clients.

2

00:00:05,009  -->  00:00:10,945
Small customers are just as much work and sometimes more work than big customers.

3

00:00:10,945  -->  00:00:15,900
The reason is smaller customers might not be as sophisticated when it comes to

4

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:18,329
buying your product or service or they have

5

00:00:18,329  -->  00:00:21,379
a larger portion of their net worth tied up in,

6

00:00:21,379  -->  00:00:23,699
in your company, in your product or service.

7

00:00:23,699  -->  00:00:27,839
So, I've kind of learned the hard way not to deal with small customers,

8

00:00:27,839  -->  00:00:29,579
if you can avoid it.

9

00:00:29,579  -->  00:00:33,210
If you have no alternative customers then obviously you have to.

10

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:38,070
But if you can try to deal with larger customers only

11

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:44,905
as there's much less customer support required when dealing with them.

12

00:00:44,905  -->  00:00:55,060
All right. Number four.

13

00:00:55,060  -->  00:00:59,000
Sports is actually very crucial boardroom talk.

14

00:00:59,000  -->  00:01:02,259
I know it sounds funny but I've

15

00:01:02,259  -->  00:01:06,189
found that every person I've met with in business in the United States,

16

00:01:06,189  -->  00:01:08,079
at least, wherever they're from in

17

00:01:08,079  -->  00:01:10,659
the country I always ask them about their baseball team.

18

00:01:10,659  -->  00:01:12,674
I'm a huge baseball fan.

19

00:01:12,674  -->  00:01:14,944
I'm from Toronto, I love the Toronto Blue Jays.

20

00:01:14,944  -->  00:01:17,824
I'm so passionate about baseball. I love it!

21

00:01:17,824  -->  00:01:19,659
And so, if I meet somebody from Kansas,

22

00:01:19,659  -->  00:01:22,734
for example, I'll ask about George Brett,

23

00:01:22,734  -->  00:01:25,019
who is the best player ever played on that team.

24

00:01:25,019  -->  00:01:27,219
Or if I meet somebody from Miami, of course,

25

00:01:27,219  -->  00:01:28,644
I'll ask him about Giancarlo Stanton,

26

00:01:28,644  -->  00:01:30,959
who's I think the best player in the game today.

27

00:01:30,959  -->  00:01:32,890
So, sports is very,

28

00:01:32,890  -->  00:01:37,540
very important boardroom talk and actually golf is very important as well.

29

00:01:37,540  -->  00:01:40,189
You don't see very good at it because I absolutely suck at it.

30

00:01:40,189  -->  00:01:43,219
But, I love doing a lot of business on the golf course.

31

00:01:43,219  -->  00:01:44,635
You're there with your partners,

32

00:01:44,635  -->  00:01:47,269
your customers, your prospective customers.

33

00:01:47,269  -->  00:01:49,715
And you're very relaxed, it's a very social game as well.

34

00:01:49,715  -->  00:01:55,626
So, sports is very important boardroom talk and golf often if you can.

35

00:01:55,626  -->  00:01:57,000
You don't have to be good 'cause I'm bad at it.
