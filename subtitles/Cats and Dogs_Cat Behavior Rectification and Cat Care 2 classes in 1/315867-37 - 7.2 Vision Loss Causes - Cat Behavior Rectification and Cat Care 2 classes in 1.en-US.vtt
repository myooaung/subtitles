saline Hypertension is one of the most common reasons for blindness and catch.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.450
High blood pressure damages the blood vessels in ready no,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.360
leading to retinal detachment from its underlying tissue on eventually blindness in case of

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.260
cataracts,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.670
let's turn cloudy,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.160
leading to partial or complete blindness.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.910
This cloud earlier is often Impenetrable.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.710
This preventing light from entering the I glaucoma is a painful condition in which fluid

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.370
pressure inside ice increases those damaging retina.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.440
And optic knows it is one of the most common conditions which lead to blindness.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.050
Influence in case of progressive retinal,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.450
a trophy that's not issues get deteriorated.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.550
This leading to improper functioning off the retina.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.950
Generally,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.920
this is a gradual process,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.450
but can eventually to total blindness.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.750
This condition is generally not painful for the carts on because of its low action.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.250
Can't get enough time to adjust to the blindness caused with this condition?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.960
Drama Inflammation What tumors in the brain can lead to inability of the brain to process

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.850
stimuli received from the I and thus leading to blindness,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.780
viral,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.110
bacterial and fungal infection.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.650
Injury and eyes on dry eyes can also lead to a visual impairment in cats
