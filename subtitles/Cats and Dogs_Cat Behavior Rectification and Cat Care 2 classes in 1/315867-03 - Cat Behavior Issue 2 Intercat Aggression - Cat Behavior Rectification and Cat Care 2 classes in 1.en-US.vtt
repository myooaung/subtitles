territorial behavior off cats who is a great problem for their owners,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.550

a territory is being getting in 80.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.660

gets who have learned the socialization skills when they were young get acclimatized with

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.150

The serious problem of aggression focus when cats are nor socialized to their own species

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.130
and do not understand feline communication in such a situation that carrots are likely to

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.480
have intense and inappropriate response.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.400

Your old cat is not so simple and easy,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.950
even if he's well socialized.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.810
This is because can extend believing in solar social groups and do not readily accept

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.740
strangers the most important thing you should keep in mind by introducing a new cat in your

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.550
home is to never put both the catch together in the same place.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.210
The new cat should be kept in a confined room with her own food bowl affordable.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.750
Let the books and toys.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.070
During the initial face.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.550
The cat should only be allowed to hear each other from the closed door.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.250
This will acclimatize them to the sound of the other cat.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.250
After a few days,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.900
allow board the cats to be in the same room.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.750
take them to the respective places.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.900
They did this for a few days at any point of time.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.850
This interaction shouldn't be forced.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.090
It is important to allow the checks to choose when they want to interact with each other.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.350
The next step is to place the cats in the opposite corners off the same room.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.850
They may see or smell each other,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.080
but can interact with each other,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.050
feed them treats so they can associate it with the presence of the other cat.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.950
If they don't it move them farther apart.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.260
In the successive sessions that cats should be gradually moved closer on.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.450
Do they're allowed to directly interact with each other?

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.530
Increase the distance among cats.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.050
If you observe any kind of aggression among them,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.490
it is crucial.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.840
Would never put your hand or any other body part to stop the fight between cats as this

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.370
must see this.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.310
Linda you barriers such as cardboard panels can be useful to separate that message.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.030
It's some of the other reasons were intricate aggression are as following environmental is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.650
at home.

So there's movie or rearranging home for nature.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.150
Their bags or other stuff can also cause fights further and it ending the day Little T

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.980
believe the cat stressed,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.950
and they may take it out on each other.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.350
If there is insufficient space for damaged home,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.870
it can lead to a territorial dispute among the caps or if they feel insecure about the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.450
territory.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.840
That may also lead revelation through a working ticket aggression.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.950
In such cases,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.550
you can increase their territorial space and dust cup.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.860
The reasons to fight further increase the number of toys,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.870
cat trees,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.980
litter boxes and food bowls so that there are enough to satisfy each care sick.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.310

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.150
between you gets.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.050
Have a separate scratch post for each of you kids.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.000
Avoid revolting,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.110
aggressive behavior.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.160
Giving food or attention to the aggressive kept me calm her in the short term,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.850
but it rewards the aggression.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.530
If you observe aggression in you get started her by escorting border from a spray bottle

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.150
but by a blast from the can off compressed air to district,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.870
then redirect her focus to a toy.

Don't treat help with her favorite food or do it during the control and interactive

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.950
meetings.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.460
Engaged them with treats and toys.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.280
They in turn,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.050
we learned to associate each other with fun and positive rewards.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.100
It is suggested.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.210
Never physically punish a cat for aggressive behavior as this paperwork for the regulation

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.650
