00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
loss of hearing occurs primarily,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.890
it sounds sort of sound.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.200
Waves from answering moment to in a year off from inebriated brain is impeded.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.740
Several situations leading to hearing loss can be avoided by taking proper precautions on

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.950
care off your cat.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.700
But this can only be achieved if you're a fear of the underlying causes.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.850
For this condition,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:30.100
the most common reason for hearing loss and senior cats is no regeneration similar to what

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.150
the humans face in our old age.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.320
The function of these knows is to transfer the sound waves from here to bring so any damage

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.320
.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.990
Injury,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.730
inflammation or degeneration of these knows can lead to a poor transmission or no

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.450
transmission to the brain does leading to hearing impairment.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.470
The galaxy jumped chickens with each do do,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.190
which transmission off sound vibrations to the inner year gets impeded does hampering the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.150
hearing ability.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.460
Sometimes surplus fix gets accumulated in the U because of the excessive oil situations

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.580
from your glands,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.950
which blocks the transmission of sound signals leading to hearing loss.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.110
But this condition is temporary and can be reversed if treated properly.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.480
Do you must in the year and infection by mites,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.260
bacteria,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.950
etcetera can also be the cause of hearing loss and cats.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.750
Any injury in the year or in the brain can also lead to a state of deafness as it impacts

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.450
the transmission and reception of sound signals.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.660
Occasionally,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.270
this condition also results from the side effects off certain drugs on diuretics that your

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.050
cat has taken in the past,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.540
or it can be due to exposure to certain hazardous heavy metals like lead,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.150
arsenic and mercury.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.200
So it is always recommended to keep powerful items containing these metals like pains.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.350
Plumbing material goal full,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.750
etcetera out of reach off your pits.
