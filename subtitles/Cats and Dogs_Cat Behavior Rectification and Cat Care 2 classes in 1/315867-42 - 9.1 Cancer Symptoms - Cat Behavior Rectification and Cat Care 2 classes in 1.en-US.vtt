Normally,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.970
the cell division is tightly regulated,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.250
but when the cells continue to divide and grow without control,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.850
it results in cancel.

Because of the aggressive and invasive nature off malignant tumors.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.970
These tumors are more dangerous than the benign two months on,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.590
therefore,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.550
more difficult to treat us in.
