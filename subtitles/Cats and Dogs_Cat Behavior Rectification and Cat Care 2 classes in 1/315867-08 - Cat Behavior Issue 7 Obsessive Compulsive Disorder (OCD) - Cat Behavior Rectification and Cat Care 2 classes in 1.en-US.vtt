The exact cause for feline obsessive compulsive behavior is still not known.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.850
But stress and anxiety seemed to be the main trigger for this behavior in caps.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.090
Your new furniture layout or shifting to a new place or introduction off a new pad at your

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120
home can make us test,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.550
which in turn can lead to such unwanted behavior issues.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.620

Obsessive compulsive disorder may perform,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.330

Grooming herself in case she's suffering from this disorder,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.110
you will find a licking her skin excessively,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.750
which can cause here discoloration and bald patches on the skin.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.370
This can even make us a come to skin diseases,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.050
infections and allergies.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.220
If you observe that took,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.880
it is overwhelming herself.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.950
Consult your vet to rule out any skin related issue.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.450

She may even bite it.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490
Her tail may get seriously injured.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.050
Because of this act offers,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.910
many canceled or city may have a tendency to do an eight known edible items like fabrics.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.760
This may occur,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.450
especially in those cats who were being from their mothers at a very early age.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.930
Therefore,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.250
when they grow older,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.150
they redirected nursing behavior onto other items.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.770
This can even occur when the cats are living in a special environment and do not receive

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.850
adequate mental and physical stimulation.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.520
Another Orting that human observing cats,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.600
a frequent porosity,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.140
is abnormal running or PC they will run.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.850

This behavior is also triggered that they desist the opportunity.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.910
Vocalization is also because of your silly in cats.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.350
Anxiety is one of the major causes for this behavior by the opportunity vocalization.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.050
She tries to grab your attention.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.560
Now let's discuss how this possibly behaviors can be treated concerned.

You what if you observe any or city behavior in you get provide her some anti anxiety drugs

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.050
along with behavior modification.

attention to that behavior.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.520
So when she practices or silly behavior,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.950
try to ignore her and don't pay any heed to her ex.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.410
To further,

the Stryker started had by a blast of compressed air poem again or squirt water from a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.160
spray bottle.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.770
Once she gets distracted,

start playing with her to further divert her attention from the obsessive compulsive

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.760
behavior.

Punishment is often that remind Bill in such cases as that further increased the anxiety.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.490
Therefore,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.480

from our daily schedule so as to avoid confusion and keepers testy if our stresses,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.760

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.360
try to spend more time cuddling and playing with her this act of yours will provide her the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.140
required comfort and will help reduce her anxiety.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.850

You can and be Takacs environment so that your baby can keep herself engaged while you're

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.350

curious creatures and loveless for their surroundings.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.590
So provided opportunities for claiming and exploding.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.750

Provide her with a comfortable seat near the window where she can both birds and export

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.640
outside.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.090

these environmental enrichments will keep her engaged,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.890
