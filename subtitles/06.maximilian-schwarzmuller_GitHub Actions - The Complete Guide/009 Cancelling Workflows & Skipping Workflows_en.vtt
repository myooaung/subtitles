00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.140
So that was a lot of information

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.220
about events that can trigger and start workflows.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.680
Let's also briefly talk about canceling

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.000
and skipping workflow runs, because that's also a thing.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.360
And if we start with canceling it is of course worth noting

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.690
that by default workflows get canceled automatically

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.110
if jobs fail, though, you will later learn

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.070
that you can also, for example add certain rules

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.920
that subsequent jobs still execute

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.530
even if earlier jobs failed.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.300
But by default, if a job fails

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.923
the workflow gets canceled.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.640
And a job fails, if at least one step fails

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.943
though that can also be changed as you will learn later.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.783
But you can also cancel workflows manually.

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.460
And to briefly show you how that would work

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.890
I will change something,

18
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.020
for example, add a comment here,

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.820
my tests

20
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.850
and create a new commit in the main branch

21
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.550
added comment

22
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.600
and push this

23
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.970
and here I'm doing this as the owner

24
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.473
of this repository, again, as the original creator.

25
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
With that, we got a new workflow running here

26
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.730
and if we click on that, we can always cancel this workflow

27
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.280
by clicking on this cancel workflow button here.

28
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.803
And that does just what the name suggests.

29
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.430
So that's how you can manually cancel a workflow

30
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.510
and that can be useful if you have some error in your code

31
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.200
or your workflow that would cost the workflow to run

32
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.610
for a very long time.

33
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.300
Or if you identify an error right after pushing

34
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
and you know that the workflow will fail anyways

35
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.520
and you don't wanna waste the time waiting

36
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.860
until it fails automatically.

37
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.143
So that's how you can cancel it manually.

38
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.230
Now, besides canceling a workflow

39
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.720
you can also skip a workflow.

40
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.540
And skipping simply means that you do something

41
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.360
that would normally trigger the workflow.

42
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.270
So for example, you push to the main branch

43
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.540
but you want to skip this execution.

44
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.120
You want to make sure that this push does not

45
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.493
trigger the workflow, for example,

46
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.780
because by default all matching events start a workflow.

47
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.320
But if you want to skip a workflow execution

48
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.220
there are exceptions for push and pull request event types

49
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.830
that can be specified by you.

50
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.470
To be precise, you can skip a workflow run

51
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.080
that would normally be triggered by adding

52
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.760
a proper commit message or message to your poll request.

53
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.000
To show you what I mean, here's a another example.

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.600
Let's say I add yet another comment,

55
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.700
and of course if I add comments like this,

56
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.220
I might not wanna run my workflow

57
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.670
because I know that these comments don't change my code.

58
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.640
There is no reason to run my tests or redeploy.

59
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.130
I just wanted to add a comment.

60
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.520
So therefore, of course I still create a commit maybe

61
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.583
because I want to save these comments in a new commit.

62
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.090
But now I can skip a workflow run that would normally

63
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.760
be triggered by pushing this to the main branch

64
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.230
on the remote repository by adding my message

65
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.330
which could be added comments.

66
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.820
And then thereafter, in square brackets, skip ci

67
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.500
or skip actions or a couple of other keywords

68
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.980
which you of course find in the official documentation.

69
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.020
If you add one of these messages

70
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.520
to your commit message

71
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.920
or to the latest commit of a pull request,

72
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.820
that pull request or push will not trigger a workflow

73
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.743
that would otherwise be triggered.

74
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.250
So now here, if I now push this

75
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.340
to the main branch

76
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.900
because this is on the main branch

77
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.120
if I push this to my repository,

78
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.320
you will see under actions here

79
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.493
that no new workflow was started.

80
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.240
I have that one workflow here, which I canceled before

81
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.910
but no new workflow run was triggered

82
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.450
because my latest commit had this special message,

83
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.213
this special annotation with skip ci.

84
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.500
And that can also be useful because sometimes you know

85
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.890
that it doesn't make sense to trigger your workflow

86
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.010
and in order to save time and possibly also cost

87
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.360
if you're paying for it

88
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.393
you then might want to add an annotation like this.
