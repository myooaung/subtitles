00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.220
So we did now build and use composite

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.990
and JavaScript actions,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.200
let's now do the same for a Docker action.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.500
And for this, I'm back in that same demo project as before,

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.710
but I'll add a new folder in this actions folder,

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.440
and I'll name it deploy-s3-docker,

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.900
because I'm still going to build the action

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.780
that will upload the website code to S3,

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.100
but we're now going to do this

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.700
with a different programming language than JavaScript,

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.040
and therefore, we'll use a Docker container

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.200
to set up an environment that supports

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.790
that programming language,

14
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.010
because GitHub Actions out of the box

15
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.860
only supports JavaScript and Docker,

16
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.560
and that's why we're using it now, because with Docker,

17
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.640
you can build a container

18
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.100
with any environment your code needs,

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.020
including an environment that supports

20
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.570
the programming language you want.

21
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.630
Now, since this is no Docker and no Python course,

22
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.790
and we already spend some time writing code here

23
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.930
with JavaScript, I provide the files that are needed

24
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.490
for this action for you,

25
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.033
at least all the files except for the action.yml file.

26
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.340
You'll find them attached,

27
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.930
and you should paste them into this deploy-s3-docker file.

28
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.630
Here, you get a deployment.py file,

29
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.700
which contains the actual Python code

30
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.120
for getting all the files that should be uploaded

31
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.850
and for then uploading those files,

32
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
and this code uses a package called Boto3,

33
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.010
which is provided by AWS,

34
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.030
which is the AWS SDK for Python to be precise,

35
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.030
which gives us methods for uploading files to S3,

36
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.520
this upload_file method here most importantly.

37
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.120
So this method will upload files to an S3 bucket,

38
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.970
and the rest of the code will simply identify the files

39
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.580
that should be uploaded and then upload them,

40
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.870
and then I'm still generating a website URL here.

41
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.880
I'm also setting it as an output,

42
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.500
but I'll get back to this later,

43
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.600
and I'm also extracting some inputs here,

44
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.940
but I'll get back to this later as well.

45
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.470
For the moment, it's enough to know

46
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.800
that this is all the Python code that's needed,

47
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.650
and the Docker file simply creates an environment

48
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.420
where this code will run.

49
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.470
It creates a new container based on some Python based image,

50
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.980
which gives us an environment where Python is installed,

51
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.263
Python version 3 to be precise,

52
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.240
then I copy this requirements text file into this container,

53
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.790
and this simply specifies some packages

54
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.980
that should be installed into the environment

55
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.140
for the Python code to work,

56
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140
and that most importantly is this Boto3 package

57
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.100
and some extra dependencies, so that is copied over,

58
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.840
and then this command installs

59
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.870
all the dependencies mentioned in this file.

60
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.870
And then here, we also copy over the deployment.python file,

61
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.300
and execute it whenever a container is started based

62
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.440
on this image.

63
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.118
This is what this Docker file does,

64
00:02:57.118 --> 00:02:59.820
this is what the requirements text file does,

65
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.090
and then we get this deployment.py file.

66
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.610
Again, I'll get back to some lines of code in there,

67
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.193
but for the moment, this is the base setup we need.
