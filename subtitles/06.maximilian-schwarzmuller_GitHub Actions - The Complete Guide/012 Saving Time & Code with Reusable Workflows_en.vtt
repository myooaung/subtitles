00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.000
Now using a matrix to control

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.580
which versions of a job are executed

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.860
and to easily use multiple configurations

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.730
in one and the same job, can also be a very useful feature.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.710
To conclude this core section,

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.350
we'll dive into a never very useful feature

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.260
and that would be a reusable workflows.

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.660
The idea here is that you could have a workflow

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.340
with a job and some steps,

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.950
or also with multiple jobs of course,

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.159
that you might wanna reuse in other workflows.

12
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.620
For example, one workflow could be uploading

13
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.570
the website code to a hosting server.

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.150
And that such a common task that you want to use

15
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.050
that same workflow in other workflows that might in addition

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.740
also do some testing or building or whatever.

17
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.160
So you have one workflow that just uploads the code

18
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.940
and then other workflows that also do additional work.

19
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.580
But you now wanna use that one workflow

20
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.700
inside of a job of that other workflow.

21
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.790
And that is indeed something that's possible with help

22
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.723
of GitHub Actions because it supports reusable workflows.

23
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.950
Now to show you this reusable workflow feature,

24
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.950
I'll add a new workflow file, reusable.yml.

25
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.540
Which will be used to define the workflow

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.120
that should be reusable.

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.210
In here we'll give this a name,

28
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.493
reusable deploy for example,

29
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.900
and I'll add the trigger a little bit later.

30
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.690
For the moment I'll just add my jobs.

31
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.390
And here I'll keep this very simple.

32
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.360
I'll add a simple dummy deploy job

33
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.890
where I say runs on Ubuntu latest.

34
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.340
And where in my steps I add one step

35
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.170
where I say output information.

36
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
And then here I just say deploying

37
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.193
and uploading or anything like that.

38
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.610
So it's just a dummy workflow.

39
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.640
We'll add more to it later but for the moment that's all.

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.440
And I'll get back to this on trigger

41
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.180
in a couple of seconds as well.

42
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.253
But that's now the reusable workflow.

43
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.080
Now to make it reusable, it must be callable

44
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.970
by other workflows.

45
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.520
And that's where the on trigger

46
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.070
the on field becomes important.

47
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.530
Because here we don't wanna run this workflow

48
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
whenever we push or when a poll request is opened

49
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.120
or anything like this.

50
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.130
Instead, we wanna run this workflow

51
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.350
from inside other workflows.

52
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.010
That's the idea behind a reusable workflow.

53
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.430
And for that, GitHub Actions gives us a special event,

54
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.123
the workflow call event.

55
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.110
Not workflow dispatch that was used

56
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.450
for manually running a workflow,

57
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.880
but instead workflow call.

58
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.443
This allows this workflow to be called from other workflows.

59
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.860
And that's there for the other part now.

60
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.800
I'll copy the execution flow yml file

61
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.560
and name it use reuse yml using reusable workflow

62
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.610
could be the name we assign here

63
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.030
so that we can easily identify it once it's running.

64
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.210
And here we're still reacting to a push

65
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.270
to the main branch and we still might be linting

66
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.760
and we have all the conditional code in there.

67
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.550
We could also remove it, it does not matter.

68
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.730
But then here for the deployment step,

69
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.560
I want to change things in this use reuse yml file.

70
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.290
Instead of running my own steps here

71
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.190
or doing my own work here, I will remove them.

72
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.560
I will also remove runs on

73
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.473
and instead we can use the uses key here.

74
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.560
Now, we already know the uses key

75
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.560
from steps that use actions.

76
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.560
And actions also are kind of reusable scripts you could say.

77
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.810
Later in the course we will also learn

78
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.060
how we can write our own actions.

79
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.670
But actions are used in steps.

80
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.190
Now we want to use an entire workflow

81
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.870
which is a combination of steps

82
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.780
or even a combination of jobs if we want to.

83
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.899
And we wanna use that predefined workflow

84
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.800
which we defined here for this deploy job.

85
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.860
For that we can add the user's key right to the job.

86
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.650
And then here we don't reference an action

87
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.933
but instead an entire workflow.

88
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.590
We do that by providing a full path

89
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.050
to the workflow file seen relative

90
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.600
from the route project folder.

91
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.570
So we dive into the /.GitHub folder

92
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.390
into the workflows folder.

93
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.290
And then here it's the reusable.yml file

94
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.143
that defines the workflow which I wanna reuse.

95
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.610
This could also be a path to a workflow

96
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.680
defined in another repository.

97
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.400
But here it is a relative path to a workflow defined

98
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.873
in the same repository.

99
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.770
So now with that we're using this workflow

100
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.570
when this job runs.

101
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.450
So therefore, because we added workflow call

102
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.900
as an event here, this workflow will be kicked off

103
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.473
by GitHub Actions whenever this job starts.

104
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.460
Now, there's more we can do with reusable workflows

105
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.310
but let's first of all run this simple example

106
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.060
by creating a new commit

107
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.373
and pushing this.

108
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.310
So that's the first step.

109
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.850
And now under actions we see that we got this

110
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.150
using reusable workflow here,

111
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.800
we also got reusable deploy.

112
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.190
This is not started because that is the reusable workflow

113
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.620
which has not started itself when we push.

114
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.500
Instead using reusable workflow is started.

115
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.163
And that's the workflow that uses the reusable workflow.

116
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.110
And in here we see that in this deploy step here,

117
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.510
we'll use our reusable workflow.

118
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.700
Now I just realized that we won't get there

119
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.710
because my tests are still failing.

120
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.880
So let's quickly fix this by reading that A here

121
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.710
in that failing test in maincontent.test.jsx.

122
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.160
And let's add a new commit where we fix this,

123
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.710
fixed failing test.

124
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.590
And then push this so that we can actually see

125
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.290
the reusable workflow in action.

126
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.560
Because at the moment we are not even reaching it.

127
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.303
So now with this fixed,

128
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.160
here we triggered another workflow run

129
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.280
and now we will make it to this deploy step.

130
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.090
And there this reusable workflow will then be used.

131
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.043
So let's wait until we get there.

132
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.570
Here we go, it's starting to execute.

133
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.090
So this job that uses the reusable workflow

134
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.713
is starting to execute.

135
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.970
And what you see here is that the output information step

136
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.113
was executed and there we see deploying and uploading.

137
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.400
And that's exactly what our reusable workflow does.

138
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.670
Here, we're outputting, deploying and uploading

139
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.090
and that's the only part where we're outputting this.

140
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.750
So indeed, our reusable workflow was executed here

141
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.653
and that's how we generally can use reusable workflows.
