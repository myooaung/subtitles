00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.900
Now before diving into

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.450
setting up OpenID Connect with AWS,

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.610
there's one thing I wanna do first.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.190
I'll create a website hosting bucket again

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.670
so that this example which I wanna show you will work again,

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.670
and here I'll give it a name, gha-security-hosting-demo,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.980
anything like this, must be a unique bucket name

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.770
as mentioned in a previous course section.

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.960
Region is us-east-1 let's say.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840
We have to turn on Block All Public Access

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.300
and check this box down here,

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.060
and with that we can create this bucket,

13
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.740
and once the bucket was created

14
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.030
we can click into it.

15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.290
Under Properties, we can enable Static Website Hosting,

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.290
set the Index Document to index.html and save that,

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.880
and under Permissions,

18
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.820
we now must add a bucket policy.

19
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.010
For that we can go to Policy Examples

20
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.190
and pick the example regarding the read-only permissions

21
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.200
for an anonymous user,

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.850
copy that policy and paste it in here.

23
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.560
Make sure there's no white space

24
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.720
in front of the opening curly brace,

25
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.130
and then use our bucket name, gha-security-hosting-demo

26
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
in my case, and use that down here.

27
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
Insert this, make sure you have no typo,

28
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.760
and then save this bucket policy.

29
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.470
And now we could upload files here

30
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.460
which would then be hosted or served as a website.

31
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.870
So that's the prerequisite.

32
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.280
Now in the next lecture,

33
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.833
we'll enable OpenID Connect with AWS and GitHub Actions.
