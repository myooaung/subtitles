00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.250
Now that's it for this course section.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.370
In this section you learned about these core components

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.370
that make up GitHub Actions.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.830
And there it all starts with Workflows,

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.170
which are attached to GitHub Repositories

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.990
and where you define for which event,

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.950
for which trigger, which Jobs should be executed.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.890
And one Workflow can have one or more Jobs.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.380
And Jobs are the next important building block

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.253
you must know.

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.850
With Jobs, you define the environment

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.250
in which your work will be executed,

13
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.920
so the server on which it will be executed

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.040
and the Steps that will be executed in order.

15
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
And these Steps are the things that do the actual work.

16
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.550
There you execute command line commands

17
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.480
or you use predefined Actions, as you learned.

18
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.820
And for the Jobs you can run them in parallel

19
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.393
which is the default or sequential, after another.

20
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.770
Now these events and triggers are also very important.

21
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.160
As you learned, there is a broad variety of events available

22
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.370
and these events are either Repository related,

23
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.050
for example that you pushed

24
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.390
and you commit to the Repository.

25
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.550
But there also are some other events,

26
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.270
for example that you manually started a Workflow.

27
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.400
And Workflows have at least one event

28
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.430
but they can have more than one event.

29
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.010
Now when it comes to defining Workflows,

30
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.010
you do that in .GitHub/Workflows/ some YAML file.

31
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.480
And that file can either be created directly on GitHub,

32
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.190
as we did it for the first Workflow, or typically locally,

33
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.620
that's what you do in most cases.

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.860
But it has to be a file in that Workflow's folder

35
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.690
in that .GitHub folder.

36
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.390
And in that file you have to follow

37
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.210
the GitHub Actions syntax.

38
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.480
So the keywords GitHub Actions knows

39
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.150
and you saw some of the most important keywords

40
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.880
and Action in this section already.

41
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.160
Now as mentioned, your Jobs and the Steps

42
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.610
of these Jobs then execute on so-called runners

43
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.229
which are simply the servers,

44
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.690
the machines that execute the Jobs.

45
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.110
In there you got various predefined runners

46
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.790
provided by GitHub,

47
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.420
which run in their data centers, so to say.

48
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.490
And GitHub offers different runners

49
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.680
with different operating systems.

50
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.320
They do support Linux, Windows, and macOS.

51
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.800
And then depending on which operating system you chose

52
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.143
you got different hardware profiles.

53
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.220
If you're not happy with those predefined runners

54
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.930
you can also bring your own,

55
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.460
but that's something we didn't do

56
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.560
in this course section.

57
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.690
Now, regarding the Workflow execution,

58
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.760
they are of course executed

59
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.610
whenever their connected event is triggered,

60
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.070
and then you can follow their execution

61
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.930
and get detailed insights

62
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.290
and logs directly on the GitHub page,

63
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.350
as you saw multiple times throughout this section

64
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.983
when we inspected the logs shown by a Workflow.

65
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.020
Now I also mentioned it before that for your Workflows,

66
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.660
for the Steps you execute in your Jobs

67
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.240
you can also use Actions.

68
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.760
Because you can run your own shell commands

69
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.260
with this run key.

70
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.093
And that's what we did

71
00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:22.980
in most cases throughout this section.

72
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.640
But for more advanced and typically repeated tasks

73
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.160
you can also use Actions.

74
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.380
Either official Actions provided

75
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.860
by GitHub itself or Actions by other communities,

76
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.850
or the community or your own custom built Actions.

77
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.020
And we'll build our own Actions later in the course.

78
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.660
But with that, you get these essentials

79
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.450
which you need in order to work with GitHub Actions.

80
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.883
And we're now ready to dive in deeper.
