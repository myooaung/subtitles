00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Congratulations, you finished this course,

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.910
and you learned a lot about GitHub Actions therefore.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.680
Now, my recommendation for you,

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.570
even though it might sound obvious,

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.080
is that you now take what you learned and you practice it.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.660
You practice it at some dummy projects,

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.730
some demo projects which you build.

8
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.340
You can take the course projects and build up on those,

9
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.740
and build your own workflows.

10
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.910
Try out different things, be creative and experiment

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.350
because that's the best way

12
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.040
of learning something and of mastering something.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.320
And of course, feel free to dive back

14
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.660
into some course videos or sections,

15
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.620
if something's not entirely clear yet, that's totally fine

16
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.710
and the big advantage of a video on-demand course.

17
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.010
But definitely practice, practice and practice

18
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.140
because as with everything else in life

19
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.953
practice makes perfect also when it comes to GitHub Actions.
