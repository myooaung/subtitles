00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.400
Actions are another key building block,

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
or component of GitHub Actions.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.260
And actually, when we got started

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.621
with GitHub Actions and our first Workflows,

5
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:16.971
I often said that we're creating an Action.

6
00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.880
But what I actually meant was that we created a Workflow,

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.100
because technically there is a difference,

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.060
and an Action is a separate feature offered

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.680
by GitHub Actions.

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.240
and an Action,

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.130
in the context of GitHub Actions,

12
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.130
is simply a custom or third-party application

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
that performs a typically complex, frequently repeated task.

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.800
Like for example,

15
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.041
fetching the code from a GitHub Repository,

16
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:49.323
and downloading it onto such a runner machine.

17
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.539
Now, the alternative to such an Action

18
00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.077
is a command that's defined with help of the

19
00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:59.190
"run" keyword in your YAML file.

20
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.860
And that's what we saw before, and what we used before,

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.900
in this first Action.

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.060
With this "run" command

23
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.470
we simply execute typically simple shell commands

24
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.210
on that runner machine,

25
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.860
and these commands are, well,

26
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.440
written down and defined by us.

27
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.270
Now, of course, these commands could

28
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.141
in theory also get more complex.

29
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:23.130
You could also run more complex scripts

30
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.690
with help of these commands.

31
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.020
So it's not always necessarily a simple process

32
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.390
that's started with such a command,

33
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
but it will be a command, written by you, in your YAML file.

34
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.450
Now, Actions on the other hand,

35
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.240
are these predefined applications,

36
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.490
which actually also can be distributed

37
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.350
through a marketplace,

38
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.600
because you can build your own Actions,

39
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.610
and will do that later in the course,

40
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.300
but you can also use official, or community Actions.

41
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.370
And now here, back in this project,

42
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.700
where we wanna download code from the Repository

43
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.930
onto this runner,

44
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.790
we can use such an Action,

45
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.800
because this is such a common task,

46
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.470
that an Action for it exists.

47
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.520
We could write our own command that uses Git

48
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.968
to clone the code from the Repository onto this machine,

49
00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:14.340
but this is simply unnecessary work,

50
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.539
because for this extremely common task,

51
00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.110
an Action has been created.

52
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.630
And you can search for GitHub Action Checkout

53
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.110
to find this official Checkout Action.

54
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.380
And this is actually a really official Action,

55
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.610
that is created and maintained by the GitHub team.

56
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.970
There also are other Actions, which are created

57
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.830
and maintained by other companies,

58
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.320
or by simple community members,

59
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.900
so, open source Actions,

60
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.910
and you could create your own Actions,

61
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.553
but this is an Action created by the GitHub team.

62
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.120
Now you see that here on this Repository,

63
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.580
I can actually view this on the Marketplace because,

64
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.330
as mentioned, there is a Marketplace for these Actions.

65
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.160
Now it's called Marketplace,

66
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.860
but these actions don't cost you money.

67
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.360
Instead, they are free,

68
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.480
but this Marketplace is a central place where

69
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.960
you can browse different Actions.

70
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.300
Now you see that here for this Checkout Action,

71
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.240
it's from a verified creator, by the GitHub team.

72
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.970
And this badge can give you some extra confidence,

73
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.630
in that this Action isn't doing anything malicious,

74
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.370
or anything like that.

75
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.990
And by the way, later in the course

76
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.470
we'll also dive into security, and GitHub Actions,

77
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.873
and certain things you should watch out for.

78
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.540
So this is a verified creator,

79
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.250
this is this Checkout Action,

80
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.080
and here we find some instructions

81
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.090
on how we can use this Action,

82
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.030
though we will use it together in a second.

83
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.339
Now, before we use it though,

84
00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.320
I wanna go to this Marketplace here.

85
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.700
Now here you find all kinds of Actions you can use.

86
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.460
Actually, you find Apps and Actions.

87
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.680
Apps are a different GitHub feature,

88
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.140
for us, Actions are interesting.

89
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.360
And here you find a broad variety

90
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.360
of Actions for all kinds of tasks you might wanna perform.

91
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.270
You can use an action to install Node.js,

92
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.840
though the runner we're using actually has it pre-installed,

93
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.580
but if you would be using a different runner,

94
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.490
without Node.js, you could use this Action

95
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.800
to install Node.js.

96
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.380
And as you can tell, there are a broad variety

97
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.603
of Actions for all kinds of things.

98
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.350
Now here, I'll search for this Checkout Action again,

99
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.570
because that's the Action we need right now.

100
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.183
And now we'll actually use that Action.
