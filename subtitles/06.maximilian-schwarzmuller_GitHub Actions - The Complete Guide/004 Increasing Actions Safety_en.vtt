1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.530
Now that was Script Injection.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.900
Another potential problem could be

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.090
Malicious Third party Actions.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.200
Therefore, it's important

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.350
that you are able to use Actions securely.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.460
And of course,

7
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.079
you got various options

8
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.540
when it comes to using Actions.

9
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.960
To have the highest degree of security,

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.480
you should only use your own Actions.

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.360
If you write all your Actions yourself,

12
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.760
or in your organization,

13
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.660
you of course

14
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.090
know what those Actions will be doing,

15
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.540
and you know that they won't contain any compromised code.

16
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.970
But of course, that's also a considerable amount

17
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.703
of effort to write all Actions on your own.

18
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.070
And just to be clear,

19
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.240
the idea here is

20
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.220
that you might want to do that

21
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.320
because then you know that your Actions

22
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.050
won't do anything you don't want them to do,

23
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.260
because Actions can perform any logic you need,

24
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.330
as you learned earlier in the course.

25
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.370
And therefore an Action could of course

26
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.710
try to steal your secrets,

27
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.480
manipulate your code base,

28
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.810
start deleting issues or do anything else.

29
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.330
So if you write all your Actions on your own,

30
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.400
you know exactly what they're doing,

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.890
but it is a lot of work.

32
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.500
Therefore, you might strongly want to consider

33
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.740
to also use Actions by verified creators.

34
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.320
And that is what we did in this course.

35
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.800
When you visit the GitHub Marketplace for Actions,

36
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.170
you find tons of Actions there,

37
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.840
and many Actions are built by the community,

38
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.150
but you also find many Actions

39
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.020
that are built by verified creators,

40
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.890
and you can tell that an Action is by a verified creator

41
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.050
by this blue check mark

42
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.650
that can be seen after the creator name.

43
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.320
For example, this upload artifact Action here,

44
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.600
which we also used throughout this course,

45
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.880
is by a verified creator.

46
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.430
This actually is by a team,

47
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.510
by GitHub even,

48
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.030
but there also are non-GitHub teams

49
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.700
that are verified creators.

50
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.760
Now if an Action is by a verified creator,

51
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.539
that means that GitHub manually approved that creator

52
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.330
and gave that batch to the creator.

53
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.490
That of course, still does not give you

54
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.450
a 100% guarantee that the Action is secure,

55
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.000
after all the account or code base

56
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.010
could still get compromised,

57
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.176
but it of course does mean

58
00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:27.780
that you generally can trust that creator,

59
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.613
and therefore also that Action.

60
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.420
But of course, you sometimes might also be facing

61
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.420
a problem that would be solved by an Action

62
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.090
that's not built by a verified creator

63
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.850
because anyone can build and publish Actions,

64
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.670
and not all creators are verified,

65
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.150
otherwise, this would be a meaningless batch.

66
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.380
And you could of course

67
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.810
consider using all public Actions,

68
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.430
because that gives you

69
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.420
access to Actions that solve all kinds of problems,

70
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.370
but it of course also means that

71
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.980
you have the lowest level of security

72
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.740
regarding the Actions you are using.

73
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.930
Because if you're using any public Action

74
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.180
by anyone who published an Action

75
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.710
to the GitHub Marketplace,

76
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.740
that Action could also be doing all kinds of things,

77
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.880
because GitHub does not monitor or validate Actions

78
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.100
when they're published to the Marketplace.

79
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.300
GitHub does not check or control such Actions.

80
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.630
Therefore, theoretically, Actions can be doing anything.

81
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.140
And if you are using an Action by someone who's not verified

82
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.310
and who you don't know, you might want to analyze the code

83
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.030
of that Action first before using it.

84
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.650
Because all these Actions,

85
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.710
no matter if they're by verified creators or not,

86
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.510
are in the end open source.

87
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.110
You can visit the GitHub Repository behind that Action

88
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.600
and dive into the Action code.

89
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.550
And that is something you might wanna do

90
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.740
to understand what this code does.

91
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.570
It is of course some work,

92
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.570
but it's absolutely something I can recommend doing,

93
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.730
especially when working with Actions

94
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.070
by people you don't know,

95
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.750
because that then allows you

96
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.270
to use more than just your own Actions,

97
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.963
and still have a relatively high level of security.
