00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.300
Now let's dive right in

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.160
and let's start with executing jobs and steps conditionally.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.970
And we have two main tools for that.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.340
For one, there is the if field

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.280
that can be added to both jobs and steps

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.310
to add a condition to a job or a step,

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.440
and only if that condition is met,

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.813
that job or step will be executed.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.100
Steps also have a second field that can be added.

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.350
The continue-on-error field,

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.030
which allows you to specify

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.310
that the other steps of the job

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.570
should still execute even if a single step fails.

14
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.850
And for both the if fields

15
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.880
as well as the continue-on-error field,

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.920
you can add your own conditions

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.690
with help of Expressions,

18
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.400
but that's exactly what we'll explore

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.683
in practice over the next lectures.
