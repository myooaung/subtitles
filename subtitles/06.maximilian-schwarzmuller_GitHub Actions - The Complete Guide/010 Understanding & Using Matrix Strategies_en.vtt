00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.880
Now that's it for if and continue on error.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.670
Now there is never feature which I also wanna explore

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.200
in this section.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.080
And that would be matrix jobs

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.990
or running jobs with help of a matrix.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.493
Now what's that about though?

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070
For that, let's quickly create a new Workflow Matrix Demo

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.713
which should be executed once we push.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
And then here I'll add one job, which I'll name build.

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.480
And this job will run on Ubuntu latest let's say,

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.880
and will then receive some steps,

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.820
and the first step will be to get the code.

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.620
So that's the name of that step.

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.070
And then here we use the checkout action

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.740
as we did before in this course.

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.050
And then thereafter we have another step

17
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.530
where I want to install nodeJS.

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.780
Now it would be pre-installed on Ubuntu,

19
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.630
but let's say we wanna use a specific version,

20
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.803
so here we can use the setup-node@ for that.

21
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.020
And then we can specify the exact node version we want

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.123
like 14 for example.

23
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.170
And then I install my dependencies,

24
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.330
and we could add caching in front of that,

25
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.230
but to keep things a bit simpler, I'll not do that here.

26
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.800
And then I will build my project.

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.190
Build project by running npm run build.

28
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.890
So that's a very simple Workflow we could execute

29
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.500
and it of course does not use any features we

30
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.973
wouldn't have used before.

31
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.210
But now I wanna run this job

32
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750
this build job with help of a matrix.

33
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.790
And the idea behind a matrix

34
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.730
simply is that you can run the same job

35
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.860
with different configurations

36
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.310
for example, on different runners or different node versions

37
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.820
or any other values you might be interested in changing

38
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.053
at the same time.

39
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.150
You do that by adding the strategy field to your job,

40
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.390
so directly to the job to which it should apply.

41
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.853
And then the matrix below it.

42
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.930
And then here under matrix,

43
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.240
you can add any keys of your choice,

44
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.340
for example, node-version,

45
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.780
but this is totally up to you.

46
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.660
It can be any value that could be changing

47
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.700
and for which you wanna run the job

48
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.250
for different values.

49
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.590
For example, here we could specify multiple node versions

50
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.150
12, 14, 16,

51
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.700
and we could also add the OS key

52
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.230
or the operating-system key, whatever you want.

53
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.260
And also specify multiple values here,

54
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.560
multiple runner values, like Ubuntu latest,

55
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400
and windows latest for example.

56
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.670
So this now specifies a couple of different values

57
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.810
for keys we're using in our configuration down there.

58
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.910
For example, for the runner,

59
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.490
we can actually turn this into a dynamic field

60
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.110
by using an expression.

61
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.890
You can use this expression syntax basically everywhere

62
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.050
in your Workflow file.

63
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.340
And here we're now using it to set the runner dynamically.

64
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.710
It's not something we did before in the course

65
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.180
but it is something we can do,

66
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.220
and it's often done in conjunction

67
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.280
with such a matrix strategy.

68
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.180
Because we can now use the special matrix context object

69
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.460
which just like the GitHub context object

70
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.020
or the steps context object is provided by GitHub Actions.

71
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.870
And then access operating-system here.

72
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.160
So this key,

73
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.550
so one of the keys we define for the matrix.

74
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.150
And what this will do is it will tell GitHub Actions

75
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.240
to run this built job multiple times,

76
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.460
once per value,

77
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.800
in that operating system array

78
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.470
in that list of operating systems.

79
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.983
And those jobs will be run in parallel by default.

80
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.400
And we can also use the node versions down here

81
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.880
to install different versions of node.

82
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.610
For that, we can use the expression index here,

83
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.940
and access the same matrix context object,

84
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.043
and now the node version key.

85
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.300
Now it's a matrix because now actually this job will run

86
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.510
for all combinations of these values.

87
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.860
So it will run for Ubuntu latest and versions 12, 14, 16,

88
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.970
and Windows latest and versions 12, 14, 16.

89
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.490
And therefore this matrix feature allows you

90
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.050
to quickly run the same job with different configurations.

91
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.230
And again, you could use any values anywhere

92
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.020
in your steps or in your job configuration.

93
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.110
Again, your imagination is the limit.

94
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.760
And this feature can be useful

95
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.650
because sometimes you have for example

96
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.930
a testing process that should run

97
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.120
on different operating systems,

98
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.970
or you wanna build your application

99
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.830
against the different versions of node,

100
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.210
as we're doing it here.

101
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.820
Here it's technically just a dummy example

102
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.040
but still it is a feature you could need

103
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.710
for the exact problem you are trying to solve,

104
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.390
in your work.

105
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.890
So now therefore here,

106
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.190
we added this matrix,

107
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.060
and with that we can push this to the Repository.

108
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.700
And what you'll see there under actions is

109
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.220
that because of this added matrix,

110
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.820
our Matrix Demo Workflow runs of course.

111
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.170
And now you see here

112
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.070
that it's actually executing six jobs in parallel.

113
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.960
And we can view all these jobs,

114
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.060
and you see they run in parallel

115
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.040
for these different combinations.

116
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.520
So node version 12 on Ubuntu and Windows,

117
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.400
node version 14 on Ubuntu and Windows,

118
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.990
and so on.

119
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.490
And you will also see by the way

120
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.800
that for some combinations it will fail

121
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.320
because node version 12 actually

122
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.750
doesn't support all features needed

123
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.300
by the project I provided to you.

124
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.970
And therefore other jobs are also skipped

125
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.400
because we have one failing job.

126
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.940
But you see that some combinations also succeeded.

127
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.250
And that's by the way also something to be aware of.

128
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.440
When using this matrix strategy,

129
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.360
if one job fails, the other jobs are canceled and skipped.

130
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.340
If you don't want that behavior,

131
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.080
you can use continue-on-error on job level,

132
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.463
and set this to true.

133
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.220
Because continue-on-error on job level tells GitHub Actions

134
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.750
to continue executing jobs that are related to this matrix

135
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.903
even if some jobs for some combinations failed.

136
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.820
So here, therefore now I can create a new commit,

137
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.900
added continue-on-error,

138
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.720
and push this to the Repository.

139
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.000
And now with that change made,

140
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.650
you will see that again Matrix Demo will run this Workflow,

141
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.890
and all these jobs are running in parallel.

142
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.340
But now you will see that the version 12 jobs,

143
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.950
so the first two jobs will still fail,

144
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.380
but the other jobs will not be canceled

145
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.150
just because they failed.

146
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.100
Instead they will continue running

147
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.210
because we added continue-on-error on job level.

148
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.283
So let's wait for that to finish here.

149
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.793
Here we go.

150
00:07:19.793 --> 00:07:22.170
As you can see, the first two jobs failed,

151
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.920
but the other jobs still continued and actually succeeded,

152
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.390
they were not canceled

153
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.660
because we added continue-on-error to this job

154
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.743
with a matrix.
