00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.280
Now in this brand new action.yml file

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.170
we start by adding another name.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.450
So this field is the same as before

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.490
for the composite action.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.810
And here the name could be 'deploy to AWS S3'

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.940
because that's what this action will do.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.450
It will deploy the website files to that service

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.920
so that we actually have a life website in the internet

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.860
and we add a description where we could say,

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.720
'Deploy a static website via AWS S3.'

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.380
Now the next step is to again add the runs key

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.350
as we also did it for the composite action.

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.300
There we also added runs.

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.930
We're also adding it here for the JavaScript action.

15
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.060
And we also added the using key

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.040
but this is now not set to composite, but instead to node

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.470
and then one of the main versions of node.

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.500
At the point of time I'm recording this node16

19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.140
is the version that should be used here,

20
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.620
as always the official documentation is the place to go

21
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.020
to learn about the latest version you should set

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.530
or in general about the versions that are supported.

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.150
At the point of time I'm recording this

24
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.910
I could set it to node12 or 16

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.220
but this might change when you are viewing this.

26
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.160
The code will still work though.

27
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.730
So in my case here it's node16 and this tells,

28
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.480
get up actions that this is a custom JavaScript action

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.700
because we're using the node runtime

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.863
which is a JavaScript runtime.

31
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.730
Now, as soon as you're using a JavaScript action

32
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.240
you also have to add a main field here.

33
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.980
And that's now of course different

34
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.180
from the composite action where we instead added steps.

35
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.310
Now we're adding main instead.

36
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.690
And as a value for main, we specified the name of the file

37
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.503
that should be executed for this custom action.

38
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.920
And in my case here, I'll add a new file

39
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.490
called main.js though that name is up to you.

40
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.230
It does not have to be main, but here I'll name it main.js.

41
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.919
And in the action.yml file for this main field

42
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.690
we now specify that file name or that path to that file.

43
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.850
In this case, the file is in the same folder

44
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.470
as the action.yml file, hence just the file name suffices.

45
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.990
So the file name is all we need.

46
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.480
So we add the file name like this here,

47
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.760
and this is the bare minimum we need

48
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.090
to define a custom JavaScript action.

49
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.170
And what GitHub Actions will do then is it will execute

50
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.830
that main.js file and therefore execute all the logic

51
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.280
that might be in that file whenever this custom action

52
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.443
is used in a Workflow step.

53
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.650
Now there are more fields you could add.

54
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.670
For example, all the pre and post next to main.

55
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.470
And this would allow you to point

56
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.030
at extra JavaScript files that should be executed before

57
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.650
or after this main JavaScript file executed.

58
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.190
In some situations, you might need to perform extra setup

59
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.070
or clean up work, and in those cases

60
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.460
pre and post can be useful.

61
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.960
Here for this example

62
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.050
we don't need any extra scripts to be executed

63
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.330
before or after this main script

64
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.930
and therefore this main script is all I need here.

65
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.023
And with that, we can now start writing some logic here.
