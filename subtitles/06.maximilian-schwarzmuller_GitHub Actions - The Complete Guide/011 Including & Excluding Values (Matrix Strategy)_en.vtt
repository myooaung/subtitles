00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.770
Now there also are two other features related

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.610
to this matrix configuration, which I also wanna mention.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.690
And the first feature

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.330
is that you can add the special include key

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.400
here under matrix.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.620
In general, these keys are up to you

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.660
and you can add any keys you want

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.050
and use them in your job and step configuration thereafter.

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.380
But the include key is a reserved key.

10
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.230
This allows you to add a list with dashes

11
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.530
of key values that should be included

12
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.770
without adding a bunch of new combinations.

13
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.610
For example here,

14
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.600
we could add one combination where node-version is 18

15
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.550
and operating system is ubuntu-latest.

16
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.100
Of course, I could have just added 18 here

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.540
to this list up there,

18
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.870
but that would've added two new combinations

19
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.500
where version 18 would've been used on ubuntu-latest

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.690
and windows-latest.

21
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.270
Now, if I know that I want to have all these combinations

22
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.630
but then this additional single combination

23
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.050
where I use node-version 18 on ubuntu-latest

24
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.340
I can add this single combination with the include key.

25
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.970
So include allows you to add standalone combinations

26
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.760
and you can even add brand new keys here

27
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.310
which weren't specified up here.

28
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.730
So this can be used to add single combinations.

29
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.180
Similarly, you can also add the exclude key

30
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.730
to exclude some combinations.

31
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.600
If I, for example,

32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.060
know that I don't wanna use node-version 12

33
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.470
on windows-latest,

34
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.290
but I wanna construct all these other combinations,

35
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
I could either add ubuntu-latest with node 12

36
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.800
as a standalone combination with help of include

37
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.020
or I set it up as I did up here

38
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.840
and I add an excluded combination

39
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.110
where I exclude node version 12

40
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.107
on operating system windows-latest.

41
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.900
So now this combination would be excluded

42
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.450
from the generated matrix.

43
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.560
So with this is made, we can create a new commit,

44
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.419
add it include and exclude

45
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
and push this and you will now see that for matrix demo.

46
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.170
This of course again runs,

47
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.010
and you see that now the version 12 Windows

48
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.480
combination is missing.

49
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.870
There's only one version 12 combination on Ubuntu.

50
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.800
But on the other hand, we do have version 18 on Ubuntu.

51
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.840
So that's the included combination.

52
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.850
And the missing version 12

53
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.990
on Windows combination is the one we removed with exclude.

54
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.600
So that's how you can also use include and exclude

55
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.213
to add or remove combinations.
