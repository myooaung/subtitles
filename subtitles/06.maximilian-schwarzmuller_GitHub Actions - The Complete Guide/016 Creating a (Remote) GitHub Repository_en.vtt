00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.680
So we want to create a Repository,

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.140
and we can do that here from that starting page

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.910
all by clicking this button

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.250
or by clicking on our profile picture

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.730
in the top right corner and going to your repositories

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.070
and then there we can also create a new one.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.863
So there are many ways of creating such a Repository.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.170
When you create it,

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.480
you have to choose a Repository name

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.080
and every Repository name in your account must be unique.

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
Here, I'll name it GitHub Crash course

12
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.633
but the name is up to you.

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.840
You can then also add a description

14
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.400
and then you have to choose

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.310
whoever it should be public or private.

16
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.750
And I explained before that

17
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.530
this controls who can see your Repository.

18
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.220
It also says here that you still choose who can commit,

19
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.260
so who can edit the code.

20
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.850
So even if you choose public,

21
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.090
this does not mean that everyone can edit it.

22
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.770
Here, I will pick public,

23
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.080
since this will simplify a couple of other things

24
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.573
I want to show you later in this section here.

25
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.620
Now, if this would be a brand new Repository

26
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.853
which doesn't exist locally yet, then you could also choose

27
00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:14.100
whether you wanna initialize it with a Git ignore file

28
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.030
which we did add in earlier videos manually.

29
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.160
You could choose to add a read me file

30
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.670
which explains extra information about your project

31
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.370
and your Repository and this can be useful

32
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.320
if you do wanna share it with people

33
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
from all over the world and those people should understand

34
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.720
what your project is all about.

35
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.200
And you can add a license where you essentially define

36
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.990
how your code may be used by others.

37
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.730
Here, I'll choose none of that

38
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.240
because we already do have a local Git Repository,

39
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.410
which I want to connect

40
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.130
to this newly created cloud Repository here.

41
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.090
Therefore, I'll just click create Repository like this.

42
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.670
And that's how you do create such a cloud

43
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.070
such a GitHub Repository.

44
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.570
How can this now be connected

45
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.913
to your local Git Repository though?
