00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.370
Now for the next course lectures,

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.310
I will use AWS S3.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.820
I will use AWS S3 as a hosting provider

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.373
for this demo static website.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.630
Now you can follow along by creating an AWS account

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.820
but of course you can all suggest follow along

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.140
by watching the videos.

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.270
This course is not about AWS

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.660
and it will still show you all the steps that must be taken

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.840
in your action code and your action configuration

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.940
and you can follow along with that

12
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.223
even without an AWS account.

13
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.630
But you can of course also create a new AWS account

14
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.840
or use an existing account if you want to.

15
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.170
And here I'm in my AWS account.

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.530
And there you can search for the S3 service.

17
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.050
And what we will do here can be done for free,

18
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.240
if you're within the first 12 months

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.613
after creating your AWS account.

20
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.600
And there you will need to create a new bucket

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.330
which is simply a folder in the cloud you could say,

22
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.420
a directory to store files in, in the cloud,

23
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.040
in the AWS cloud, because AWS is a cloud services provider

24
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.050
allowing you to store data files

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.440
and processes in data centers.

26
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.780
And then you have to give this bucket a name

27
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.610
which must be globally unique.

28
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.320
Therefore, here I'll choose something

29
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.320
like gha custom action hosting, something like this.

30
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.970
You might need to try a couple of combinations

31
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.760
to find a bucket name that has not been used

32
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.113
by any other users.

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.570
Next, you have to choose a region

34
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.480
which basically defines which data center will be used

35
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.690
for storing your data and I'll stick to the default.

36
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.790
You can keep all the other default settings

37
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.550
but you should uncheck this box here

38
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.770
and check this box instead.

39
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.250
So that we do allow public access to this bucket

40
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.160
because we will use it for hosting a website,

41
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.250
hence public access must be granted.

42
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.760
And with this, this bucket can be created.

43
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.703
And thereafter we can click into this bucket.

44
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.500
And under properties, at the bottom of this page,

45
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.180
we enable static website hosting

46
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.950
and specify index.html as the index document

47
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.560
to make sure that this bucket acts as our website host

48
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.270
for our aesthetic website

49
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.030
which will eventually upload here.

50
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.900
And under permissions, we now also go to bucket policy,

51
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.830
click edit and then policy examples.

52
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.580
And here we grab that read only permissions

53
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.960
to anonymous user policy

54
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.480
and paste that into the policy field here

55
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.970
and replace doc example bucket

56
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.883
with our bucket name, which can be found up here.

57
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.680
So we paste that in here,

58
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.010
keeping the slash and the star thereafter.

59
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.010
And then we save this here at the bottom, save changes.

60
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.770
This makes sure that we can actually use this bucket

61
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.170
for hosting later,

62
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.140
though here I have an accidental blank at the beginning,

63
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.020
which must be removed. That's why I got an error.

64
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.060
Now let's try this again.

65
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.130
And with this we can upload files

66
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.850
into this bucket to well serve a website

67
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.980
and the files that should be uploaded here

68
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.660
are the files that are produced

69
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.960
by this project when running this build script.

70
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.050
So the files that are actually produced

71
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.900
as part of our build job.

72
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.840
These files which we upload here, these artifacts,

73
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.670
that is what we would need to put

74
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.430
into this bucket to have a website.

75
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.440
But we're not going to do this manually

76
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.120
but instead automatically

77
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.670
and we're going to write our own custom action

78
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.730
that does that because that's a great practice

79
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.090
and even though we would find actions in the marketplace

80
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.430
that help us deploy to S3,

81
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.790
writing our own action here allows us to dive deeper

82
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.173
into custom actions.
