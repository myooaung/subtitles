00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.130
Now, in our GitHub Actions workflows

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.300
in our jobs, we are not just dealing with artifacts,

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.600
which might be produced by our jobs,

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.260
but instead, we also have job outputs,

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.113
and it's important to understand the difference.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.010
Artifacts are these log files or these app binaries,

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.010
which we typically wanna share with someone or something

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.873
or which we wanna analyze.

9
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.010
However, our jobs cannot just produce such files as outputs,

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.990
which we would then treat as artifacts,

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.070
but instead, our jobs can also output simple values

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.580
that we might wanna use in subsequent jobs.

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.840
So one job might produce some output value

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.450
that should be reused by another job.

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.430
For example, we could be dealing with a file in one job

16
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.570
and the name of the file matters in another job,

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.370
and because that's the case,

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.180
we want to kind of make that file name available

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.590
as a value that can be used in the other job.

20
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.590
So it's not the file itself necessarily

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.150
that should be made available,

22
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.730
but it's the name of the file we could say.

23
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.150
And of course, this is just one simple made up example,

24
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.220
it could be any kind of value

25
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.250
that we wanna make available across jobs,

26
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.830
so values that are derived in one job

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.410
and must be available in other jobs,

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.830
that could be dates, hashes, random values,

29
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.883
anything like that.
