00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.170
Now for this section,

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.630
I got another example project for you.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.080
It's actually still the same project as before

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.400
but it comes with an example workflow already

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.610
in the .github/workflows folder,

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.710
and this is a finished workflow

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.510
that will work like that,

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.100
and that will be activated

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.620
whenever we push to the main branch,

10
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.530
but that's the workflow we'll also work on

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.103
and enhance throughout this course section.

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
Now of course we also need a GitHub repository, as always,

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.220
and therefore here I'll initialize this project here

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.210
with Git to get a local Git repository,

15
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.210
and then I'll create my initial commit here, like this,

16
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.730
and with that initial commit created here,

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.440
I'll also switch to GitHub again

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.200
to create a new repository there,

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.160
and I'll name it gh-data,

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.350
but as always the name is up to you.

21
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.270
It can be public or private.

22
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.800
Here, I'll make it private,

23
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.760
but it does not matter for this section,

24
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.120
and then with that repository created, as always,

25
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.400
we grab the URL and add it

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.930
as a remote repository here, with the origin identifier

27
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.360
and with the username added here

28
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.813
to make sure that we're using that user for authenticating,

29
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.700
and then I will push my main branch

30
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.030
after establishing the link like this,

31
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.450
and with that done, we got that GitHub repository

32
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.543
with which we'll work throughout this course section.
