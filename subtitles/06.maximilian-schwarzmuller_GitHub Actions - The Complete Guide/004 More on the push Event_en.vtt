00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.900
Now regarding the events,

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.410
we saw some events in action earlier in the course already,

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.300
and one of the most important events

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
you can add to your workflows as a trigger

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.430
is the push event.

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.130
And I will add this here again as well.

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.193
And this is how we added it thus far in the course.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.920
Now, if you have a second event

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.110
that should also trigger this workflow,

10
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.020
you can wrap push in square brackets,

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.950
and for example, also add the workflow_dispatch event

12
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.970
so that we can also manually trigger this workflow.

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.450
So that's how we can add multiple events like this.

14
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.390
But this is all just a relatively simple way

15
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.880
of assigning events to the workflow.

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.240
Often you need a bit more control than that,

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.370
because right now, any push,

18
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.280
so any commit that's pushed to any branch

19
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.780
of this GitHub repository would trigger this workflow,

20
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.300
and it's not unreasonable to expect

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.150
that not all pushes to all branches

22
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.519
should trigger this workflow.

23
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.820
Instead, you might only want to trigger this workflow

24
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.270
when push targets the main branch,

25
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.370
because if we're pushing to some other branch

26
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.670
we maybe don't wanna execute this workflow,

27
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.500
because imagine that we're really

28
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.120
deploying the website here.

29
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.190
We don't wanna deploy the website

30
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.010
if we're pushing to some development branch.

31
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.240
We only wanna deploy if the main branch is targeted.

32
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.300
And it's things like that that can be controlled

33
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.060
with additional event related features

34
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.833
offered by GitHub Actions.
