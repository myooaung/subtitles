00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.010
Now, how do we use actions and workflows?

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.650
Well, for that I'll go to my workflow file,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.360
and now here in that lint job,

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.560
I wanna replace these two steps with my custom action.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.023
To do this, I'll give it a name,

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.243
load and cache dependencies, for example.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.230
And then we use the uses key,

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.140
just as we used it for actions before as well,

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.270
there is no difference regarding that

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.430
if you're using your own custom actions,

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.040
you still use the uses key.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.020
Now, the value you define here

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
simply depends on where your custom action is stored.

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.560
If you did create your action as

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.140
a standalone GitHub Repository,

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.130
you would simply add your Repository Identifier here.

17
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.450
For example, Maxacademind1/my-action,

18
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.930
if my GitHub Repository name would be my action

19
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.330
and this would be my account name.

20
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.150
That's how I could refer to my own action

21
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.240
stored in my own GitHub Repository.

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.430
Here I have a local action though,

23
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.500
stored locally in this project,

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.780
and therefore what you pass as a value

25
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.403
to uses instead is a path to this action folder.

26
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.930
For that you start with ./ to construct a path

27
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.690
relative from the root project folder

28
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.970
and then we dive into the GitHub folder

29
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.940
and then into /actions in my case

30
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.460
since I named this folder, actions,

31
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.823
and then cached-deps is my other folder name.

32
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.570
You don't have to point at action.yml here,

33
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.300
this is not required because GitHub Actions

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.650
will automatically look for such a action.yml file.

35
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.070
As mentioned before, you must add such a action.yml file

36
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.960
to any custom action folder or repository you have.

37
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.100
And that's how we can use

38
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.430
our custom action in this workflow.

39
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.690
What's really important here

40
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.890
is that this path starts at the root level of this project,

41
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.980
It's not relative to the workflow definition file

42
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.120
as you could think,

43
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.483
instead, it's relative to the root folder of your project.

44
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.180
With that added, we should be able to create a new commit

45
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.010
where I say, added a first custom action

46
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.337
and then push this to GitHub.

47
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.600
With that, we should of course trigger a new workflow run,

48
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.650
and here we should see that in the linting job here,

49
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.470
because that's where I'm using this custom action,

50
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.060
here in the lint job.

51
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.900
That in here we are using this custom action,

52
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.970
and indeed we did.

53
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.520
Here, that is the custom action we used,

54
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.010
that step uses the custom action

55
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.770
and you see that it ran successfully

56
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.260
and it did use the cache here

57
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.230
and then therefore not install the dependencies again

58
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.290
because in custom action I have this if check

59
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.000
to only install dependencies

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.400
if they were not found in the cache yet,

61
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.870
which was not the case here,

62
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.460
here instead, the dependencies were restored from the cache.

63
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.990
But the most important thing is

64
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.860
that our custom action was used successfully.

65
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.980
With that, we can of course use that same step

66
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.140
in all the other jobs as well

67
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.910
and replace the two steps

68
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.280
where we cache and install the dependencies

69
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.920
with that one single action here.

70
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.940
And that also shows why composite actions are useful

71
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.630
because now this workflow file became simpler,

72
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.390
we got rid of some duplicate code,

73
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.120
some duplicate definition statements

74
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.020
and instead we're using this custom composite action.

75
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.310
With that, I'm going to create another commit

76
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.420
using custom action in all jobs,

77
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.000
and I will push this as well to trigger

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.670
another workflow execution, of course,

79
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.460
where now this custom action is used

80
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.010
in lint, test and build.

81
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.550
And still the overall workflow should finish successfully

82
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.090
because the custom action is used successfully.

83
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.243
Here we go, all jobs finished successfully.
