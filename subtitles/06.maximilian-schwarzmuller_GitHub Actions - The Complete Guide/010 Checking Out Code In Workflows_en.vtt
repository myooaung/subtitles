00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.700
So how can we use this checkout action?

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.039
Well, we actually find some instructions here,

3
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.930
but of course we'll also simply walk through

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.283
all the steps together.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.110
If you wanna use a action, instead of running a command,

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.210
you don't use the "run" keyword,

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.800
that's for running a command,

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.540
but instead the "uses" keyword.

9
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.023
That's the keyword you use when you want to use an action.

10
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.660
And then as a next step

11
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.990
you simply define the identifier of the action.

12
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.230
In this case here, it's actions/checkout.

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.260
And you find this identifier on the action page,

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.900
here or of course also in this example.

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.930
In the end, it's simply the GitHub internal link

16
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.663
to the Repository that holds the action code.

17
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.070
Now you also see here that you can specify a version.

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.690
And this can be very useful,

19
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.730
because the code behind these actions

20
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.860
might be updated in the future.

21
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.260
And there might be breaking changes

22
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.593
that cause the action to work slightly different.

23
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.340
To make sure that your Workflow doesn't suddenly

24
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.860
start doing things you don't want it to do,

25
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.180
or maybe breaks,

26
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.640
you should lock in a certain version,

27
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.470
to make sure that your Workflow

28
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.060
always uses that version,

29
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.923
until you're ready to update.

30
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.160
So at the point of time I'm recording this,

31
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.050
for this GitHub action,

32
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.050
the latest version we can use is this v3 version here.

33
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.040
It actually says v2 here,

34
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.370
that can be confusing, but the latest version is v3.

35
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.330
We can also see this

36
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.240
if we visit the Repository behind this action.

37
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.860
There we can see

38
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.450
that under releases,

39
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.760
version three is the latest version.

40
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.350
Now this will likely be different

41
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.730
when you are watching this.

42
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.720
To make sure

43
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.240
that your Workflow works exactly as mine,

44
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.090
I recommend that you simply all to use version three,

45
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.590
because you can even use that if it's a bit older.

46
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.610
So here I'll add @v3 to lock in that version.

47
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.973
And with that, this is all we have to do for this action.

48
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.170
Some actions require some configuration though,

49
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.080
and that could be provided with the "with" keyword,

50
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.633
which belongs to the "use" keyword in the end.

51
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.100
This "with" keyword then takes various keys

52
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.930
that configure the action.

53
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.810
And which keys are accepted under "with"?

54
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.290
So here simply depends on the action.

55
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.520
And the official documentation

56
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.050
is always the place to go

57
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.970
to learn more about that.

58
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.440
For this checkout action,

59
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.273
you also see

60
00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:35.010
that you can define various options with "with".

61
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.843
For example

62
00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:39.360
you could control which GitHub Repository will be used.

63
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.320
But by default,

64
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.690
the Repository to which the Workflow is attached

65
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.523
will be used.

66
00:02:43.523 --> 00:02:44.970
So we don't need to change this,

67
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.790
and we also don't need to change any other settings,

68
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.650
but for more advanced usage

69
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.720
you could change some settings here.

70
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.070
And throughout the course

71
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.410
we will of course also dive into some actions

72
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.693
that do always need some configuration.

73
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.690
Here we could add "with",

74
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.860
but we don't need to,

75
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.770
because we don't need to change any settings.

76
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.780
And that's now our first step.

77
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.313
We download that code.
