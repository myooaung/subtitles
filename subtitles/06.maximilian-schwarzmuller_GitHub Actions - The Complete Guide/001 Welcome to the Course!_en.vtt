Hi, and welcome to this course.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.830
My name is Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.230
and I will be your instructor in this course

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.820
on GitHub Actions.

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.250
I'm super excited that you chose this course

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.900
and that you joined this course

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.000
to learn all about GitHub Actions

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.150
because it is an amazing service and feature.

9
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.010
And in this course, you are going to learn

10
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.790
all the core essential building blocks that you must know

11
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.240
in order to work with GitHub Actions from the ground up

12
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.560
without any prior knowledge about GitHub Actions required.

13
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.750
We're going to dive into all the essentials

14
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.700
and we're then, of course, also going to dive

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.610
into the more advanced parts step by step,

16
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.180
and best of all, at some concrete examples.

17
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.600
We're not going to focus on boring theory or slides,

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.450
but instead we're going to practice all these things

19
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.270
at some realistic examples that you could encounter

20
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.490
in your day-to-day work as well.

21
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.710
And therefore, let's not waste any time,

22
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.360
instead let's dive right in

23
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.870
and let's start with the most important question first.

24
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.410
What exactly is or are GitHub Actions,

25
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.523
and what can you do with this feature or service?
