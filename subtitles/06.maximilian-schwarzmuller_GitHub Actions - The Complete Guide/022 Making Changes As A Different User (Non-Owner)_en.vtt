00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.090
So we wanna make changes

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.290
to that website code,

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.200
and keep in mind, we're a different person

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.613
on a different machine.

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.480
Now if we wanna make such a change,

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.690
then we might want to create a new branch

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.310
for the same reasons as before.

8
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
So I'll create a new branch, which I'll name feat,

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.050
and now let's say, what I wanna do

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.610
is for this website here,

11
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.690
I wanna change some styling in styles.css,

12
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.860
and in there I maybe want to change the color

13
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.260
of this title text here.

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.980
Therefore I'll name this branch feat-color.

15
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380
Name is of course up to you.

16
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.880
Now here I can simply pick a different color,

17
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.490
let's say a more orange color, doesn't matter,

18
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.980
with this hex code here,

19
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.390
and then I save this file,

20
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.990
and as before, I then stage this style.css file

21
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.540
or all files, which in this case

22
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.610
is only that style.css file,

23
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.010
since that's the only file that's changed,

24
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.777
and I create my commit where I say, "changed title color".

25
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.383
So that's all something we learned before.

26
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.690
Now of course, I wanna make sure

27
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.340
that this change is available in this remote repository,

28
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.830
and we learned before that what we can do

29
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.640
is we can run git push origin feat-color

30
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.480
to push this new branch to this remote repository.

31
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.800
The link is already set up, so this should work, right?

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.580
Well, no. If we try this, we get a permission error.

33
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.860
The permission is denied to be precise,

34
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.590
and the reason for that is that I'm on a user here

35
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.950
that does not have permission to edit this code.

36
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.363
So what can we do now?
