00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.830
And that's it for the GitHub part

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.353
and for this section in general.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.150
You now did learn a lot about Git and its key commands,

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.670
how to create commits and what commits are,

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.320
how to work with branches,

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.050
and you learned how to work with GitHub,

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.400
how to push code to it

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.980
and use it to store your code remotely,

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.300
how to get that code

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.080
and how to get updated code and how to collaborate.

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.310
These are the essentials you must know about Git and GitHub,

12
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.890
and if you do know them, as you do now,

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.490
you're well prepared to dive deeper into Git and GitHub,

14
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.533
and use it in your everyday work.
