00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.220
That's it for this course section.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.370
I did briefly reintroduce you to containers,

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.270
though, as mentioned,

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.100
I do have a complete course about that

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.193
if you would wanna dive deeper into docker end containers.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.730
In the end, containers are these packages of code

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.060
and the environment needed to execute that code

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.470
and it's a great feature

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.150
for creating reusable execution packages and environments

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.670
and for ensuring consistency.

11
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.950
For example, you could build your own image

12
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.710
and run your own containers based on that image

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.540
to use the exact same environment

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.450
for testing and production.

15
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.490
Now, when it comes to GitHub Actions,

16
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.700
you can use containers to run your jobs in containers

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.040
instead of directly on the runner.

18
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.280
That allows you to set up exactly the environment you want

19
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.630
and use it in as many jobs and workflows as you need to.

20
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.550
You can build your own container images

21
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.190
or use public images as you learned.

22
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.580
The only thing that matters is that these images are hosted

23
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.650
on some Docker registry,

24
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.590
some website that hosts those images

25
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.500
and then this can be a very useful feature provided

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.170
by GitHub Actions that's great for jobs

27
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.690
that need extra tools to be installed

28
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.420
or lots of customization.

29
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.130
Related to GitHub Actions, support for jobs in containers

30
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.640
is the feature of service containers, which you can also use

31
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.983
if your job is not running in a container.

32
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.330
The idea here is that you can spin up extra services

33
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.150
that can be used by your steps in your jobs,

34
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.140
like for example,

35
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.040
that totally isolated locally running testing database

36
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.103
which is only available whilst your Workflow is running.

37
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.640
So this service container feature can be great

38
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.440
for use cases like this

39
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.900
and you can also build those service containers

40
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
based on public images, community images

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.940
or also your own images

42
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.033
as long as they're hosted on some Docker registry.
