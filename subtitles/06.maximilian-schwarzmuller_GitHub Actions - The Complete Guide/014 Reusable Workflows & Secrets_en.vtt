00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.640
Now there's more to reusable workflows.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.860
Besides expecting and using inputs

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.790
you can also expect secrets by adding a secrets key

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.950
on the same level as you added inputs

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.379
nested below workflow_call.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.440
Now, secrets are what the name implies,

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.670
secret values that might be needed by this workflow.

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.160
Now, this workflow doesn't need any secrets

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.280
but of course you might have a reusable workflows that do

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.030
and therefore here we could have some secret.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.450
We can then specify whether it is required or not.

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.233
You can't add a default value or anything like this.

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.850
And then once you added a secret here, required or not,

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.810
you can provide it here when using that reusable workflow.

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.110
Of course, you must provide it if the secret is required.

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.783
Alternatively, you can optionally provide it.

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.440
Now, when it comes to providing a secret value

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.270
you don't do this with, with.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.973
You use that for inputs only instead.

20
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.910
But instead you use the secrets key,

21
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.960
which you add to the same job where you added uses and with

22
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.650
and you add it on the same level as you added with and uses.

23
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.420
And then under secrets you can add these secrets

24
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.600
using the same identifiers as set up here

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
and provide your secret values.

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.073
For example, by using the secrets context, some-secret.

27
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.050
Now here, I'll comment this out by adding a hash symbol

28
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.900
because I haven't added a secret with that name.

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.840
But that is how you could pass a secret

30
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.330
to your workflows.

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.340
Here again, I'll comment it all out

32
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.963
but that is how you would do it.
