00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.270
Now I did already mention what exactly Git is

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.490
in the first course section.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.880
You should definitely go through that section first

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.990
before following along with this section here.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.370
As mentioned there, Git is a version control system

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.620
and a tool you can download

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.650
and install for free on your machine,

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.740
no matter which operating system you're using.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.720
And with Git, you can control and manage your source code.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.680
Most importantly, you can create code snapshots,

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.180
so-called commits,

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.150
which allow you to go back to an older snapshot

13
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.070
in case you mess something up,

14
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.450
or if you want to take a look

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.940
at an older version of your code.

16
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.580
Another important feature would be branches,

17
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.070
which we'll also take a closer look at later

18
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.603
in this section here.

19
00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:58.620
Now in order to use Git and to work with Git,

20
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
you must install this Git tool on your system.

21
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.140
And you can simply search for Git

22
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.000
to find its official website,

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.210
which is git-scm.com.

24
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.540
And normally, you should already see a download link

25
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.040
on the starting page,

26
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.490
automatically the right link for your operating system.

27
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.070
But you can also go to Downloads here

28
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.530
and then pick your operating system

29
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.513
to download the correct version.

30
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.620
Now when picking your system here,

31
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.790
you typically have different options for installing Git.

32
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.540
For Windows and macOS, you will find installers

33
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.950
which you can use though,

34
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.530
which are simple installation wizards

35
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.290
through which you can walk to install Git.

36
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.910
And in those wizards,

37
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.580
you can simply keep all the default settings,

38
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.130
since that will give you Git in a version

39
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.813
that works just fine.

40
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.020
So make sure that you do download

41
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.600
and install Git on your system.

42
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.550
And once you did that,

43
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.940
you should open up your system terminal

44
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.130
or command prompt or shell,

45
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.983
and in there, type the command git.

46
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.620
If you now hit Enter,

47
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.020
you should see a list of commands you can use

48
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.640
in conjunction with Git.

49
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.040
If you're getting an error that tells you

50
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000
that Git is an unknown command or anything like that,

51
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.930
you should make sure

52
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.830
that you finished that installation process successfully.

53
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.990
And if you did, you should restart your system

54
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.713
to make sure that this Git tool was installed successfully.

55
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.560
Now as you can tell here,

56
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.460
you get a broad variety of commands that you can use.

57
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.620
And throughout this section,

58
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.770
we'll dive into the most important commands.

59
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.910
I'll say right away

60
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.330
that many commands here are niche commands,

61
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.130
which you don't need too often,

62
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.160
but we will of course cover all important commands,

63
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.600
just as we will cover

64
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.273
the most important GitHub features later.

65
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.620
So with Git installed, we can now use it,

66
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.190
and you do typically use it in your development projects

67
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.920
where you write code to build an app

68
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.173
or a website or a package.
