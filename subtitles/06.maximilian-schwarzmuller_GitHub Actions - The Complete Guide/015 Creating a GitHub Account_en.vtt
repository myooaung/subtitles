00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.810
Now you learned what GitHub is

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.970
and why using it could be useful,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.463
for example for backup purposes.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.150
Now, the key feature offered by GitHub

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.030
is its repositories feature.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.020
You can create those cloud storage buckets

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.490
in your GitHub account

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.850
and then connect your local Git repositories

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.600
to those GitHub repositories to back up your code

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.723
or use it across different devices and so on.

11
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.320
Now, when you create a Repository

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.190
you have the choice whether it should be public or private.

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.570
As the names indicate

14
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.690
public repositories can be viewed by everyone.

15
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.120
Private repositories can't.

16
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.930
Either way, not everyone can write to them.

17
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
So even if a repository is public, this does not mean

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
that all kinds of people can start editing your code.

19
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.420
That's not the case.

20
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.680
Instead, public and private only controls who's able to see

21
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.660
and view a repository.

22
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.240
Editing the code in a GitHub repository

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.223
is a totally different thing.

24
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.330
But before we dive deeper into GitHub repositories,

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.320
let's first explore how we can create such a repository

26
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.850
and for that, you first of all must create a GitHub account.

27
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.090
Now, for that, you can visit GitHub.com and then sign up.

28
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.700
Of course, you can skip that if you already have an account

29
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.533
and use that account instead.

30
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.730
Now, here you simply enter your email address

31
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.663
and of course, your password.

32
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.213
Then also a username,

33
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.870
which is of course up to you

34
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.540
but must be unique, so you might need to try

35
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.010
a couple of different usernames

36
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.543
before you have a fitting one.

37
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.620
Here I'll choose N for no

38
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.950
and then you might have to solve a brief puzzle

39
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.873
to prove that you're not a bot.

40
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.590
With that, the account gets created

41
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.390
and you just need to verify it

42
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.990
by entering a code that's sent to you via email.

43
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.080
Now, once you finished the account creation

44
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.070
you can choose which parts are most interesting to you

45
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.140
but you don't have to make a choice here.

46
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.920
And then you're presented with different plan options

47
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.470
because you can use GitHub for free

48
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.520
but you can also pay for it to get more features.

49
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.000
Now, to get started, the free plan has everything you need

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.310
but if you're working in bigger teams

51
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.130
and you need advanced features those paid plans

52
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.813
might be very interesting to you.

53
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.060
Here for this account,

54
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.190
I'll continue with the free plan though

55
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.570
but it is worth keeping in mind

56
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.303
that you do have those paid plans if you need them.

57
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.650
Now, once you created your account, you should be greeted

58
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.660
with a page that looks something like this.

59
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.960
Though the exact content will change over time.

60
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.180
Now GitHub offers tons of features

61
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.330
and you can dive way deeper into all these features

62
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.400
with the official documentation.

63
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.880
You can for example, create and edit your own profile page

64
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.820
which could help you apply for jobs.

65
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.150
Now, we are interested in this repository feature though,

66
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.190
and therefore the first thing we'll do

67
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.353
is we'll create a new repository.
