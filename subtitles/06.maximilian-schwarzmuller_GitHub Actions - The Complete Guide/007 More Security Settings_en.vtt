00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.200
Now on this settings page I showed you

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.280
in the previous lecture,

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.150
there are more settings that are worth a closer look.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.970
For example, you can check whether GitHub Actions

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.870
should be able to automatically create or approve

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.043
poll requests.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.450
Now, the danger with allowing GitHub Actions

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.520
and their workflows to do that,

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.200
is that of course you could accidentally

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.670
approve a poll request,

11
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.780
if you have a bug in your Workflow code for example,

12
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.790
that shouldn't have been approved.

13
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.310
So you might want to disable this

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.640
so that these are things only humans can do.

15
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.550
But if you have a highly automated Repository

16
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.430
and your confident that your Workflow instructions

17
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.600
work as intended,

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.790
you could also allow your GitHub Actions

19
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.610
to create or approve poll requests

20
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.820
and then add workflows that do exactly that,

21
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.410
that they do for example,

22
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.263
automatically approve and merge a poll request.

23
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.129
Now other things you can do regarding poll requests

24
00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.550
is that you can control whether poll requests

25
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.520
coming from Forex should require approval

26
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.370
for first time contributors who are new on GitHub,

27
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.070
so who have no history on GitHub

28
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.800
or for all outside collaborators,

29
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.560
so that you always need approval.

30
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.070
And I did talk about this early in the course already.

31
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.910
The problem with poll requests from forked repositories

32
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.030
is that anyone can fork public repositories

33
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.250
and anyone can then change that code

34
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.110
in that forked Repository

35
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.410
and open poll requests with your Repository.

36
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.710
And those poll requests could contain malicious code

37
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.710
and they offer, if your workflows ran automatically

38
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
they might do something with that malicious code.

39
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.910
Or maybe the Workflow itself was changed in a malicious way.

40
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.160
That's why it's not executing automatically

41
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.230
but requires approval instead.

42
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.200
And you can choose how restrictive you want to be

43
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.180
and which kind of workflows

44
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.453
do need approval first before they execute.

45
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.020
Last but not least, you can also control

46
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.060
which kind of actions can be used

47
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.523
in the workflows of that Repository.

48
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.100
And that's of course related

49
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.610
to the idea of Using Actions Securely.

50
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.090
You could for example, choose that you only allow the usage

51
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.360
of actions that are part of this user's account,

52
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.160
so that work created by you

53
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.430
or are stored in some Repository of that account.

54
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.677
For example, you could also disable actions altogether

55
00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:36.810
so that you don't even have access to this actions feature

56
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.060
and you can't even add workflows at all,

57
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.030
or you allow all actions and reusable workflows.

58
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.250
Then you should do your due diligence

59
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.050
as discussed before though.

60
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.450
But of course, this does give you the opportunity

61
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.370
of tapping into this huge amount

62
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.100
of useful actions that exist out there.

63
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.773
But you could be more restrictive if you wanted to.

64
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.950
So that's definitely all the settings page

65
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.240
worth taking a look at.

66
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.040
And with that, we now had a look

67
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.190
at a couple of key aspects you should be aware of,

68
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.073
when it comes to securely running your workflows.
