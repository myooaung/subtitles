00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.070
Now before diving into event filters

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.950
or activity types, let me briefly dive

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.390
into the available events in general first.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.870
And I did mention this earlier in the course already.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.330
With GitHub Actions, there is a broad variety

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
of event triggers you can add to your workflows.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.570
Most of them are Repository-related,

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.870
like for example triggering a workflow

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.380
whenever a commit is pushed to the Repository

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.240
or when some pull request-related action occurs.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.250
But there also are some events

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.640
which are not directly Repository-related.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210
For example, you can manually dispatch and trigger

14
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.140
your workflows, or you could create a schedule

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.690
so that a certain workflow is executed

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.690
every couple of hours or once a day or anything like that.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.150
And whilst we will see many key events

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.300
and triggers in action throughout this course

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.990
and in this section here, it's best to also explore

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.510
the official documentation to learn about

21
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.280
all available events and read more about them.

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.830
Here you learn more about the different events

23
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.260
that can be assigned to your workflows.

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.630
You learn more about when exactly

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.390
an event accounts asked triggered,

26
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.880
so when exactly those events occur.

27
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.380
And you'll learn more about using

28
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.300
and configuring these events,

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
though that's also something we'll take a closer look at

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.863
in this course section.
