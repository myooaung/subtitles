00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.930
At this point of the course,

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.050
we covered all essentials and core features

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.030
you must know about GitHub Actions,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.140
and you are therefore,

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.173
able to build your own GitHub Action workflows.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.730
However, one important topic is still missing,

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.620
and that would be the topic of security or permissions

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.500
And security, which is exactly what

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.933
this course section is about now.

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.540
In this course section,

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.500
we'll explore how you can secure your workflows,

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.140
and which kind of things should be

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.160
on your agenda when it comes to securing your workflows,

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.340
which kind of problems you should think of.

15
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.580
And we'll also explore how you can configure

16
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.180
and manage permissions for your workflows.

17
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.870
We're going to explore a feature called GitHub tokens,

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.140
and learn how you can set just the right permissions

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.180
for your workflows.

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.670
And we'll explore how you can manage permissions

21
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
for working with third party platforms or sites,

22
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.960
because sometimes workflows must reach out

23
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.170
to other websites or services,

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.050
and managing those permissions securely

25
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.570
is another topic you should be aware of

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.193
and you should be able to do.
