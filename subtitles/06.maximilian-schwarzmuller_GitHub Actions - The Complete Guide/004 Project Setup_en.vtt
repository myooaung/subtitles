00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.080
Now since you use Git

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.470
to manage your source code for an application

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.900
or website or anything like that,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.763
we need some source code in order to play around with Git.

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.750
That's why, attached to this video,

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.840
you'll find an index.html file

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.120
which is a file that would display

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.200
a very simple website which we will use as a project

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.873
and as a starting point to dive into Git.

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.580
You find this file attached and you should move that file

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.310
into a folder somewhere on your system,

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.320
which you then open as a project

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.170
with your favorite code editor.

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.040
Here, in my case, I'm using Visual Studio Code,

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.230
which is an amazing, very fast,

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920
and totally free code editor and IDE,

17
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.090
which you can download from code.visualstudio.com.

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.940
It's a very powerful IDE that offers tons

19
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.670
of configuration options and extensions

20
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.489
that you can install into it, and you can download it

21
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.790
for all operating systems on that website.

22
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.890
However, it's not a must use.

23
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.650
You can use any IDE for this course

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.620
since this is also not a coding or development course.

25
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.220
But instead, we'll focus on GitHub Actions later.

26
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.200
Now, once you did open the folder

27
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.420
that contains this index.html file

28
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110
with your favorite editor, you're ready to go.

29
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.040
By the way, here I also got a .vscode folder

30
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.300
that holds some project-specific editor settings,

31
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.580
for example, the zoomLevel I set here.

32
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.460
You don't need that folder or these settings.

33
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.813
I did only add these settings for recording purposes here.

34
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.530
So here we got this index.html file.

35
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.210
We got our starting project.

36
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.493
How can we now use Git with that?
