00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.510
So now that we know

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.470
what exactly GitHub Actions is or are,

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.530
it's almost time to dive into GitHub Actions

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.860
and the core building blocks that make up GitHub Actions.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.290
But before we do that, I wanna make sure

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.080
that you get the most out of this course.

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.250
And this course,

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.100
as mentioned before will teach you GitHub Actions

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.320
from the ground up step by step,

10
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.820
and we're gradually going

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.340
to dive deeper throughout the course.

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.880
Now this course is of course a video based course

13
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.460
with video based explanations and therefore

14
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.830
in order to get the most out of the course,

15
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.260
you should watch those videos,

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.050
but you should of course watch them at your pace.

17
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.960
Use these video controls to speed me up

18
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
if I'm going too slow or slow me down if I'm going too fast.

19
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.210
Also feel free to skip videos or jump around

20
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.370
but I do actually recommend

21
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.610
that you do watch all the videos in the provided order

22
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.230
since I did order them such

23
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.730
that they build up on each other

24
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.500
and the different concepts taught

25
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.990
in those videos built up on each other.

26
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.660
But if you are a more experienced user

27
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.210
or if you learned about GitHub Actions

28
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
in the past and you just wanna refresh your knowledge

29
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.180
you can definitely also use that curriculum to jump

30
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.770
to exactly that section

31
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.250
or those videos that are most interesting to you.

32
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.230
And speaking of jumping around

33
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.630
and watching videos at your pace,

34
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.830
of course feel free to watch the same video multiple times.

35
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.740
Sometimes a certain explanation only clicks

36
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.270
after the third time

37
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.360
and sometimes you might want to repeat a certain example

38
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.350
or explanation to make sure that you fully understand it.

39
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.930
And kind of related to that,

40
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.350
you should also try to practice what you learned

41
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.430
and experiment with that knowledge you gain in this course.

42
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.280
Throughout this course, we're going to see many examples

43
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.710
and I can only recommend and suggest

44
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.650
that you do pause the videos from time to time

45
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.950
and you practice what you learned on your own.

46
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.830
Try to implement a certain solution

47
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.350
before we do it together in the course

48
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.070
and also do it without me prompting you to do it.

49
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.620
Instead, use the knowledge you gain in this course

50
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.020
and in this videos to then experiment

51
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.440
with that knowledge and practice on your own.

52
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.680
Build up on the examples provided in this course

53
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.930
and feel free to experiment with them.

54
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.630
Change some aspects of those examples

55
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.030
and see how the result changes.

56
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.863
And of course,

57
00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:37.560
all to build your own demo projects and Workflow examples

58
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.290
because that's how you're going to learn the most.

59
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.940
Watching the videos is fine

60
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.820
and nice and will give you that basic knowledge,

61
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.950
but you must practice on your own

62
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.560
and use that knowledge in your own projects

63
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.400
to then really fully understand all the features related

64
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.260
to GitHub Actions.

65
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.030
Now, when taking an online course,

66
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.070
it can sometimes feel lonely,

67
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.860
and therefore I can also only recommend that you

68
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.940
try to learn and grow together with other students.

69
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.120
That begins here in the course Q and A section

70
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.860
where you can help each other

71
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.850
and which you should not just use to ask for help

72
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.640
but which you should also use to help others

73
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.760
because that's how you're going to learn even more.

74
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.310
But it continues with our free community

75
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.400
to which you find a link in the first course section,

76
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.230
which you can join for free.

77
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.000
It's Discord based.

78
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.070
And in that community you can of course

79
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.330
also discuss problems or solutions with other students

80
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.130
and therefore all the leverage

81
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.393
the advantages of a group-based education or course.
