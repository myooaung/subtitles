00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.280
So when it comes to Workflow Security,

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.420
there are,

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.189
a couple of topics

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.010
or potential problems you should be aware of,

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.070
and that's why at the end of this section,

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.630
you'll also find a lecture

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.910
with further reading materials

8
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.800
and links to the official docs,

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.330
and some blog posts,

10
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.480
where you can dive deeper into Security

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.353
and explore various key aspects you should be aware of.

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.140
But in this course section,

13
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.450
we're of course also going to dive

14
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.910
into some key Security aspects

15
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.650
or things to be aware of.

16
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.210
And we are, for example

17
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.210
going to explore the potential problem of Script Injection.

18
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.830
We're also going to explore the topic

19
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.710
of Malicious: Third-Party Actions,

20
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.700
and how you can use Actions in a secure way.

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.950
And we're going to explore Permissions

22
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.623
and issues related to Permissions.

23
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.773
Now, what are these things about though?

24
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.050
Well, Script Injection is about some value being injected

25
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.310
in your Workflow,

26
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.590
and being used in your Workflow,

27
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.810
from the outside.

28
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.870
For example, if you had a Workflow that runs whenever

29
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.790
a new issue is created,

30
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.470
and you would be using the title

31
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.930
of that issue in your Workflow,

32
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.030
then someone could create an issue

33
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.220
with a title that injects some code

34
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.570
into your Workflow,

35
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.370
that might break your Workflow

36
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.110
or do something bad.

37
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.370
And we're going to take a look

38
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.400
at a concrete example in the next lecture.

39
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.080
Now, another problem

40
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.510
or aspect to be aware of

41
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.020
are potentially Malicious Third-party Actions.

42
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.050
In this course, you of course saw many examples

43
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.930
where we added Actions to Workflows

44
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.740
to, for example, checkout code or upload artifacts.

45
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.370
And of course, we also built our own Actions.

46
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.780
Now, Actions as you learned

47
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.970
can perform any kind of logic

48
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.770
and therefore, of course they could

49
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.160
also contain code that steals your secrets

50
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.070
or does anything else that,

51
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.610
well, harms you or your code base.

52
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.930
And therefore, of course,

53
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.170
you should try to only use trusted Actions

54
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.190
or inspect the code of unknown, untrusted authors.

55
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.130
But I'll also get back to this topic a little bit later,

56
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.110
in this section.

57
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.150
And, last but not least, in this section,

58
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.420
as mentioned, we're also going to explore Permissions

59
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.730
and how you can manage Permissions

60
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.350
for your Workflows

61
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.750
because you should consider avoiding overly

62
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.000
permissive permissions so that

63
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.220
if some script is injected

64
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.580
or if something bad would be happening, you can maybe

65
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.780
still prevent it,

66
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.000
by having the right permissions assigned

67
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.560
to your Workflow.

68
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.450
For example, if you have a Workflow that

69
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.300
only checks out some code and runs some tests,

70
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.940
you probably only need read-only permissions

71
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.960
to read the code,

72
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.660
and no Permissions to added issues,

73
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.760
or anything like that.

74
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.360
And, GitHub Actions supports fine-grained permissions

75
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.740
and we'll take a look at

76
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.930
how you can control permissions later

77
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.300
in this section as well.

78
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.480
Again, these are just some aspects to be aware of.

79
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.350
As mentioned before, towards the end of this course section

80
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.150
you'll find a lecture with links

81
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.790
for further reading where you can dive

82
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.400
into other potential Security problems

83
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.463
and more official Security recommendations.
