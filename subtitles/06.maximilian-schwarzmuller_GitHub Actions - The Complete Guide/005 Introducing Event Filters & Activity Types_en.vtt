00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.220
So, as outlined in the last lecture already,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.160
there are situations where you know

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.360
that you, for example,

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.490
want to trigger a workflow

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.293
when a commit is pushed to the repository,

6
00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:17.040
but you want more control.

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.520
You want to control that this should not trigger

8
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.560
the workflow for all branches,

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.679
but instead only if the main branch is targeted.

10
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.020
So, just adding an event like push

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.350
or pull request alone isn't enough.

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.410
And GitHub actions gives you more control

13
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.380
for your event configurations.

14
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.036
For example, some events have so-called activity types,

15
00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:44.610
which allow you to specify in greater detail

16
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.930
which exact version or variation

17
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.080
of the event should trigger a workflow.

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.180
If, for example, the pull request event

19
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.220
has a couple of activity types

20
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.050
that allow you to control

21
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.170
whether all pull request related actions

22
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.970
should trigger the workflow

23
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.570
or maybe only if a pull request is opened, or closed,

24
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.533
or edited.

25
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.228
And then we also have so-called event filters

26
00:01:11.228 --> 00:01:14.359
which are supported by some events

27
00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.890
Here, we also got more control

28
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.830
over when exactly a workflow will be triggered,

29
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.810
and filters do exist for the push and pull request events

30
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.180
and a few other events.

31
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.830
And here we can, for example,

32
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.640
configure that we want to filter all push events,

33
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.380
such that only push events

34
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.240
that target the main branch

35
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.540
or any other defined branches

36
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.730
will trigger the workflow,

37
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.200
and other pushes,

38
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.000
which target other branches,

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.923
won't trigger the workflow.

40
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.810
So, activity types and event filters are key features

41
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.370
that give us more control

42
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.143
over which event exactly will trigger our workflow.
