00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.440
So let's start building custom actions,

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.710
and for that I'm going to start with Composite Actions,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.670
since that's the easiest kind of action to get started with.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.080
But before we do that,

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.379
please note that attached to find the starting project

6
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.130
for this course section, it is a simple react app

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.740
as we had it multiple times throughout this course,

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.050
and it comes with a workflow file

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.300
in the .github/workflows folder,

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.440
but in that file right now, no new features are being used.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.090
Instead, this might look familiar

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.833
from other course sections.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500
Now what I'm going to do here, of course

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
is I'm going to initialize this repository

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.560
and create my initial commit

16
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.070
as I did it in all the other course sections as well,

17
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.420
and with that done, I'm going to create a new repository,

18
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.640
named like this, for example.

19
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.580
It could be public or private. That does not matter.

20
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.350
Here, I'll choose private

21
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.540
and I'll create that repository

22
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.690
and link it to my local Git repository

23
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.243
as I always did it throughout this course.

24
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.310
After this was linked, I'll push

25
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.750
and establish this connection

26
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.840
between my local and the remote main branches,

27
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.820
and with that, this was pushed,

28
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.520
and since it includes a workflow,

29
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.950
that workflow should also get triggered

30
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.110
and it should also finish successfully,

31
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.960
but of course it won't use any actions yet.

32
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.150
Instead, that's what we're going to get started

33
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.860
with in the next lecture now.

34
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.150
We're going to get started

35
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.040
with building custom actions there,

36
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.270
and we're going to start

37
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.733
by building a custom composite action.
