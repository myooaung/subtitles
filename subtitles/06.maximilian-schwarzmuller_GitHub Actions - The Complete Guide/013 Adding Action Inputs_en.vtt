00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
So let's now start working on this JavaScript action

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.770
that will deploy the code that's produced by the Build step

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.663
in our Workflow to AWS S3, to that bucket we created.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.170
And for that in Main JS, we got a couple

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.710
of things we have to do instead of this Run function.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.740
And the first thing we'll have to do here

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.770
is that we get some input values,

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.710
because we'll actually need some information

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
about the deployment target, so about this S3 bucket,

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.630
in order to move our code here.

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.750
Of course we could write this JavaScript action

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.540
such that we hard-code all the values

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.020
for this specific use-case, and this specific bucket,

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.370
for this specific AWS account, into this action.

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.460
But that wouldn't make too much sense.

16
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.350
We typically wanna build actions that are reusable in theory

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
and that get dynamic values via inputs.

18
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.340
And therefore I'll go back to the action of YAML file,

19
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.830
and first of all, add some inputs.

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.190
Because you can do that for JavaScript actions,

21
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.080
and also for Docker actions,

22
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.790
which we'll take a look at later,

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.553
just as you can do it for composite actions.

24
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.040
And here this action needs a couple of input values.

25
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.140
For example, it needs the identifier,

26
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.980
the name of the S3 bucket to which the files

27
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.840
should be uploaded.

28
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.810
So, in our case, the name of this bucket here.

29
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.660
But again I don't wanna hard-code it into the action.

30
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.633
I wanna create an action that could be reused.

31
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.410
Therefore, I added the this bucket input here.

32
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.900
Of course, this input name is up to you.

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.970
And then we have to add a description

34
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.093
where I simply say the S3 bucket name.

35
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.620
And we have to define whether it's required or not.

36
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.240
If it's not required

37
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.880
you can again add a default value here.

38
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.490
However, I will require it because there is

39
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.430
no sensible default value we could add.

40
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.893
The bucket name, could be anything after all.

41
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.920
So that's the first input.

42
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.520
The next input is the region of the bucket,

43
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.520
because with AWS you actually deploy services in regions.

44
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.880
When we created that bucket, we had to pick a region

45
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.590
to which this bucket belongs,

46
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.760
and therefore this bucket region input is required here,

47
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.630
or is needed here, in order to move that code

48
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.540
to the right bucket in the right region.

49
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.520
Even though the bucket name must be unique,

50
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.483
we still must specify the region when uploading our code.

51
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.300
Therefore, here I'll add a description

52
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.470
where I say the region of the S3 bucket.

53
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.860
And this could be required because we need the region

54
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.360
but unlike for the bucket name, here I will set it to false,

55
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.660
because we can make a guess regarding that region

56
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.277
and set a sensible default which would be US-east-1

57
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.060
which is typically the default region selected

58
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.170
by AWS when you haven't picked any other region.

59
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.140
So it makes sense to assume this as a default.

60
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.060
Of course, it can still be overwritten

61
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.753
by users of that action inside of their Workflow files.

62
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.220
Now the last input, which I want here is the Dist folder

63
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.190
which should simply be the path to the folder

64
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.890
that contains the files that should be uploaded

65
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.120
to that bucket.

66
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.090
So the website-files in our case.

67
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.280
Therefore here I'll add another description

68
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280
which is the folder containing the deployable files.

69
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.300
And then here I set Required to true

70
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.040
because we need that folder.

71
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.490
Of course, we could set it to false and set some default

72
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.400
like Dist if we expect this kind of folder name.

73
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.623
But here I will simply require that.

74
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.620
So with that, I've got three inputs

75
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.910
which must be specified when this action is used.

76
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.760
And now we can extract those input values

77
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.563
in our JavaScript code here.
