00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.710
So now we got started with custom actions

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.550
to be precise with building custom composite actions.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.340
As you learned, that's just one kind of action

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.740
you can build though and we're now going to continue

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.760
by building a custom JavaScript action as a next step.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.550
Now, one important note about that, of course

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.750
you need JavaScript knowledge to develop JavaScript actions

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.660
but you can still follow along here in this course

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.180
if you don't have any JavaScript knowledge,

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.660
because we're not going to write a complex action

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.590
and I am going to provide the key code to you.

12
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.090
So back here in the project,

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.880
in order to get started with that next action,

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.360
I'm going to create a new folder under my actions folder

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.480
in the dot GitHub folder so it's going to be another

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.700
local action here.

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.700
And here I'll name it, deploy-S3-javascript.

18
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.640
Now what this action will do is it will take

19
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.590
the built website code and upload it to Amazon S3,

20
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.590
which is a service offered by AWS, Amazon Web Services,

21
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.410
that can be used for hosting static websites.

22
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.020
Now, this is not an AWS course.

23
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.390
I do have a separate course about that

24
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.430
if you wanna learn more about AWS

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.120
and get started with it and even get AWS certified.

26
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.660
But for this course, you don't need any AWS knowledge

27
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.970
and you also don't have to create an account

28
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.190
if you don't wanna follow along.

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.040
You're still going to learn all about GitHub actions

30
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.400
and custom JavaScript actions even without having

31
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.350
an AWS account.

32
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.960
If you do wanna follow along step-by-step though

33
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.880
you can create such an account.

34
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.610
You will need a credit card for that though.

35
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.310
And then in that account, we're soon going to create

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.130
an S3 bucket, as it will be called,

37
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.060
which will then later be used for storing the website files.

38
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.030
But this will be one of the next steps.

39
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.020
As a first step, it's just important to create this folder

40
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.300
in the actions folder and in there

41
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.139
create an action.yml file because that's always needed

42
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.723
no matter which kind of action you're building.
