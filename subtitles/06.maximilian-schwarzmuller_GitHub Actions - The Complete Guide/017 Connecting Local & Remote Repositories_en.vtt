00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.950
Once you created a GitHub repository,

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.500
no matter if it's public or private,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.150
you connect it,

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.140
so to say,

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.600
to your local Git repository

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.640
by running the git remote command,

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.220
to be precise, the git remote add command,

8
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.570
typically.

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.508
This adds a remote repository,

10
00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:23.100
like this GitHub Repository,

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.020
to your local repository.

12
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.943
It establishes a connection.

13
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.310
You can then thereafter

14
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.950
start pushing your local commits

15
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.780
to that cloud repository,

16
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.820
so that they are stored there.

17
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.050
And since these commits

18
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.390
include all the code and code changes,

19
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.270
your code is effectively stored in the cloud,

20
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.720
so on GitHub.

21
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.690
And you can download commits,

22
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.790
which you don't have on your machine yet,

23
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.080
with git pull.

24
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.150
And we'll see these commands in action

25
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.539
throughout the rest of this section here.

26
00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.310
Now I did create this repository here,

27
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.150
and at the moment,

28
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.280
it has no content.

29
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.204
I do have my local git repository here though,

30
00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:04.736
which does have code and content.

31
00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:06.345
In order to connect it,

32
00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:09.690
we must run git remote add,

33
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.090
but this alone is not enough.

34
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.200
You, first of all,

35
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.939
need to give this GitHub repository a name,

36
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.571
a local name.

37
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:19.950
Now, you can choose any name you want,

38
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.147
but a very common name is origin.

39
00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:26.760
You'll see that in almost all local Git repositories,

40
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.920
and therefore, I'll also use origin here.

41
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.770
But again, you can use any name here.

42
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.720
This is just a local identifier

43
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.403
of this remote Repository.

44
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.320
You also,

45
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.120
and that's very important now,

46
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.869
must provide a URL to that GitHub repository,

47
00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.840
or to that remote repository in general,

48
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.673
since GitHub,

49
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.506
as mentioned,

50
00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.470
isn't the only provider.

51
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.680
And that's the URL GitHub is showing to us here.

52
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.630
You can grab that URL,

53
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.100
so you can copy it.

54
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.130
And that's the URL you have to paste in here

55
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.503
for this git remote add command.

56
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.480
This command,

57
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.830
git remote add,

58
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.702
will then add a new link,

59
00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:09.150
a new connection you could say,

60
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.880
to this remote repository here.

61
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.670
And this will be the local identifier,

62
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.160
origin will be the local identifier,

63
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.933
which we need later to push our commits

64
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.890
to that remote repository.

65
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.330
And you could add connections

66
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.580
to multiple remote repositories

67
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.770
by simply using different identifiers

68
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.183
with git remote add.

69
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:32.820
Now here,

70
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.100
if I hit enter,

71
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.160
this adds this connection.

72
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.550
And now, we could try to push our local commits,

73
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.720
our local code,

74
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.430
to this remote repository.

75
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.873
We'll do that next.
