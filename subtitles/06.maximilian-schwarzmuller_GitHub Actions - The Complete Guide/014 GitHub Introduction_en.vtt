00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.530
So we used Git locally,

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.189
on our machine, and that's idea behind Git.

3
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.390
It is a tool you use locally on a machine.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.860
We created commits,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.480
worked with branches,

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.333
and now we have this history of commits here.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.190
Now, of course, if you're only working locally with Git,

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.920
that has a couple of disadvantages.

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.470
For example, if your computer crashes,

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.240
and you can't recover it,

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.720
your data, and this includes your development projects,

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.340
will be lost.

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.430
Collaborating with team members, or colleagues,

14
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.800
is also unnecessarily hard,

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.920
because you basically need to manually copy the code,

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.780
across different machines,

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.940
for example, with USB sticks,

18
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.770
or as attachments on emails,

19
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.720
or anything like that.

20
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.710
And the same is true if you ever need to switch machines.

21
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.300
If you are traveling,

22
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.220
and you have a different laptop with you,

23
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.530
than you normally use for development,

24
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.160
you don't have immediate access to your code.

25
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.143
That's why we have GitHub.

26
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.620
GitHub has the term Git in its name,

27
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.740
but the company doesn't own the Git tool.

28
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.020
Git is an independent tool,

29
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.380
and GitHub is an independent company.

30
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.040
But GitHub is a company that's built around Git,

31
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.030
you could say.

32
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.270
It offers various services related to Git,

33
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.920
and most importantly,

34
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.370
it allows you to store your Git Repositories,

35
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.560
and therefore your code,

36
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220
in the cloud, in so-called GitHub Repositories,

37
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.100
which are simply code storage buckets,

38
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.373
you could say, created in your GitHub account.

39
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.918
And if you are using GitHub,

40
00:01:47.918 --> 00:01:50.070
and those GitHub Repositories,

41
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.620
then you can store your code there,

42
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.380
and use that as a backup strategy.

43
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.590
But you can also easily share it with other users,

44
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.413
or with yourself, on a different device.

45
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.060
In addition, GitHub also offers many other services,

46
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.860
that make project management,

47
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.460
bug tracking, and automation, a breeze.

48
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.670
It's also worth noting that GitHub isn't the only company

49
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.920
providing these kinds of services.

50
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.200
There are other companies as well,

51
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.990
like GitLab, which sounds similar,

52
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.520
but is a different company.

53
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.560
But this course is about GitHub Actions,

54
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.693
and therefore we'll focus on GitHub here.
