00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.530
So I'm back in a brand new project

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.990
which you as always, find attached,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.660
and in general, the project isn't that new.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.630
It's that same react application we worked on

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.740
earlier in the course,

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.530
because again, it's not really about the application,

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.450
it's about the workflow,

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.230
and as you can see, I'm providing a starting workflow

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.670
to you here, and this workflow works as it is.

10
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.780
This workflow reacts on pushes to the main branch

11
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.660
and then simply lints the code

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.910
by running this linting script.

13
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.180
It then also runs some automated tests

14
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.730
and uploads the test reports

15
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.820
with the upload artifact action,

16
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.430
and I then also have a build step

17
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.260
where I run the build command

18
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and also upload those build files.

19
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.600
Last but not least, there is the deploy job

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.970
which doesn't really deploy anything

21
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.880
but it does download these build files

22
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.970
which would be uploaded to some hosting provider,

23
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.910
and then we're just outputting some dummy content.

24
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.240
Now, one quick note regarding the test job.

25
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.850
There, I'm uploading the test report

26
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.160
and that is something I haven't talked

27
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.960
about earlier in the course.

28
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.440
In the end, this test script just produces a report

29
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.060
in this project

30
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.300
because of the configuration I provide here

31
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.430
in this vite.config file,

32
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.720
this test.json file is generated to be precise,

33
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.300
and it's this test.json file that's uploaded

34
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.880
with help of the upload artifact action,

35
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.150
about which we learned earlier in the course already.

36
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.310
So that's this demo workflow,

37
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.280
and right now there is nothing conditional

38
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.390
in that workflow

39
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.430
because that's exactly what we'll explore

40
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.373
and add together throughout this course section.
