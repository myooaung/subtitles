00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.680
Now that we added this first step

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.380
and we downloaded this code with help of this action,

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.840
it's time for the second step of this job.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.920
Keep in mind, our goal is to run these automated tests.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.050
Now that we got the code, the next step,

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.590
is to make sure that we got Node.js installed,

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.503
and that we install all dependencies of this project.

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.830
Now, since I'm using Ubuntu-latest,

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.080
Node.js is already installed.

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.940
How do I know that it is installed?

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.240
Well, GitHub publishes a list of software

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.180
that's preinstalled on its runners.

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.520
You see that if you go to Supported Software,

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.810
here on this page,

15
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.850
under Preinstalled Software,

16
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.890
there you select your runner.

17
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.453
In my case, it's this one.

18
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.000
And then here you find a list

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.090
of preinstalled programming languages

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.040
and tools and software.

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.696
And here you actually see

22
00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:58.740
that it comes with Node.js preinstalled.

23
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.500
So since I need Node.js, this is already there

24
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.349
and I don't need to install it manually.

25
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.170
If we would need to install Node.js, though,

26
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.150
we could add a separate step

27
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.220
and use a separate action for this.

28
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.240
The Setup-node Action.

29
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.010
Again, you could find this action

30
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.160
by searching for GitHub Actions, install Node.js,

31
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.710
and you would probably find this action,

32
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
which you can add to your Install Node.js on your runner.

33
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.410
And again, you find instructions

34
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.780
on how to use this action here.

35
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.810
Now to be really clear, we don't need to do this here

36
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.270
because we got Node.js preinstalled,

37
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.520
but to practice the usage of actions

38
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.820
I will actually use this action here.

39
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.760
Also Version v3, in this case,

40
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.583
as you can see in the official docs.

41
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.050
And then here, I will add some configuration.

42
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.870
And in case of this Setup-node Action

43
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.270
one piece of configuration we can provide,

44
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.403
is the Node Version we want to install.

45
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.710
And here, I will actually pick node-version: 18

46
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.350
to make this a bit more meaningful.

47
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.850
Because my runner actually has Version 16 installed,

48
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.520
so maybe I want that latest version,

49
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.650
which at the point of time I'm recording this,

50
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.910
is Version 18,

51
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.200
and then I could indeed install Version 18, like this.

52
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.150
Again, technically that's not necessary,

53
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.010
but it also doesn't hurt.

54
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.543
So that's now my second step.
