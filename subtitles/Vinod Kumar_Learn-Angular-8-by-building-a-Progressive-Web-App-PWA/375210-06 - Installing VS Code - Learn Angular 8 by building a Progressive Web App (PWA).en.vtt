00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640
Richard Studio Court is one of the most popular i.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.030
D.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.580
E R text editors for developing applications,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.950
especially for Web applications.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.410
So to download the same goto cold dark visual studio dot com based on your operating system

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.410
,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.150
it has already chosen the appropriate build.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.830
Click on the big blue button here to download the same.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.290
Once the download is complete,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.860
you should be able tow install the same thing.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.800
So let me keep it on my downloads.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.400
So as you can see that it zip,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.620
find that we have got it.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.680
So I'm gonna unzip the same thing.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.480
In my case,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.150
it's an application itself.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.850
I just have to double click the same to run the visual studio core.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.460
Now.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.630
The good thing about this software is that it's like an evergreen application,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.020
which means that if there is a new abortion,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.460
it gets automatically updated to your existing visual studio.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.270
You don't have to actually remove the existing Washington Dendreon stop on McElroy's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.060
regionally.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.340
Keep this in the application's folder.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.830
I'm gonna drag this and drop it onto the application's folder on,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.720
but that actually installs.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.580
I already have an older Russian.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.140
I remove that Andi replace the current question.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.010
So now I have visuals to the record.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.890
Let me open the same on this is how it's gonna show when it opens.
