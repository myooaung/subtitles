X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
way.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.340
First,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.750
let's go to the command front,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.530
are terminal and then create a new component somewhere safe.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.970
NGC gendered component Components slash That's colored as movie dash details,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.960
and that's gonna create a bunch off fights.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.980
CSS html Specter tears and a competent tortillas also has updated our APP model Dirty s so

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.050
that it has become the part off our model.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.950
Let's go back to our core.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.900
The first thing that I want to do is whenever I click on any of the movie that is from the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.850
movie list,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.890
I want to go toe movie details component.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.750
First,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.750
let's go to the APP routing model.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.620
Let's go to our sidebar on Look for a protein Model where we had defined couple of routes

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.670
will also do one more road this time,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.720
which corresponds toe a hole.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.720
That means if the user is in local news for two double zero without typing anything right

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.830
now,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.060
you can see we get the head out,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.900
but we don't get any homepage,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.000
so even this should redirect me toe the home page.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.990
So to do that,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.890
we will simply add one more route,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.060
typically in the beginning.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.950
But it doesn't matter they say that the part happens to be an empty string.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.420
But if you look at this empty string is part off every single part.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.830
So to say that after local photo double zero,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.500
the only thing that existed an empty string we say here part match is full.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.970
So this means that after locals for two double zero,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.580
there is nothing other than this empty string.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.520
Then we can say Lord,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.580
the component called home component by typing component home component.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.620
Ultimately,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.500
we can say redirected toe this whole saying that hey changed the Ural from an empty string

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.380
toe home.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.100
So if I go back over here now,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.790
you can see that no matter I arrested and press enter,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.350
it will always redirect me toe slash home.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.350
So we go back here,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.070
let's have one more route.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.540
The road.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.910
This time I want to correspond to a part called movie Dash details.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.920
But let's say instead of supplying this the IMDb idea as a twisting perimeter,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.230
let's make it part of the pot,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.600
such as like,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.370
for example,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.680
more details slash one of the IMDb i d.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.230
So to send imdb idee or any additional perimeters as a part Calumet,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.140
and not as a question perimeter.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.790
You simply have to use a colon and some kind of a variable.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.290
The variable in can be anything I'm gonna take.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.800
I am Devi idee,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.790
something like this.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.260
So in the part,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.550
this part is a hardcore did constant pot.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.430
But as this is considered as a very in part,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.480
so this can be any movie I D that we want to supply.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.970
We can still access this using the activated vote.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.870
So let's put a comma and then say the component for this happens to be movie details

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.550
component.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.930
Let's go to the movie list component html Once on,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.080
then we provide a hyperlink.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080
So when we click on this,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.830
we want to go to that particular route on.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.470
Remember,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.480
the unusual movie has an IMDB idea as a property,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.400
along with the title year poster as well.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.360
So first,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.880
let's at a class card applicable.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.480
Remember,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.080
we created one CSS class after clickable that gives us a fingertip when we're moving the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.490
most on the movie,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.140
for example,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.710
let's look for a spider and pressed enter and you can see now when I move the most on this

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.250
card I get this fingertips.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.180
So when I'm outside,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.820
I don't see.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.700
But here I see that so that it gives him an indication that the user can click on this.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.020
Of course,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.460
we're not added any click event for that to do so.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.780
All I have to do is tow.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.920
Add one additional director here called out early equals stoop,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.930
and then really want to go Now,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.410
since we use the square record for rotor link,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.460
whatever is given here is an expression,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.850
and the expression is an array off part entries.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.250
So the 1st 1 I'm gonna give it as slash movie details.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.550
The 2nd 1 is m dot i am DB Ivy.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:23.170
Eventually the under part will be constructed a slash more riddles slash the value off this

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.320
variable MDR IMDb i d.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.730
So to check the same thing,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.770
let's go here and click on one of the movie.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.890
When I click on that,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.580
you will see that it says movie detail works.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.920
The component has been loaded,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.630
but it can also see that the more details slash on the I.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.810
D.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.490
Has been placed over here.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.460
So if I go back,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.510
I click on this.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.810
We see a different idea.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.130
So every time I click on that,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.270
the IMDb idea corresponding to the movie details has come up over here.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.550
The only thing that I have to do now is toe make this presentable sister.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.210
I see a poster and I see the details of that.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.770
I also should have one back,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.760
but and so that I can click that Go back to the previous page to do so.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.850
Let's go to the HTML corresponding toe our movie Detailed speech.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.450
First,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.930
let's go to the movie details ts So this is the class corresponding to your component.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.970
Here we can ask for dependency and I need to.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.290
Dependence is number one dependency to get the movie details from the remote,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.510
sir,

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.590
where we need our salaries object the movie theories on.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.390
We also need the activity wrote,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.430
because from the route we need to get this particular part so that we can send it to our

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.370
service object.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.960
So let's do that first.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.830
So we're gonna declare two variables.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.110
Private service movie service.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.230
That's number one second.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.200
Let me get it up.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.080
The sidewalk control be or command be is something that introduced,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.060
but also their private activated,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.910
wrote That's a variable on the data type is activated,

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.310
wrote it did not import.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.290
You can always stay command dot off control dot and you can see we get that import

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.520
statement and we got the import over here,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.720
So we got two variables and in the n g on in it,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.700
we have toe make use of this particular activity drought to get the parameters.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.710
And the way you do is you see here this door activated,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.900
dropped out this time.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.850
Is that parents?

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.490
Because it's a part perimeter not acquire listing perimeters.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.660
I'm gonna save bottoms,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.290
which actually is an observable.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.550
So you say here dot subscript and what you get is a bunch off all the perimeters.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.420
But in the routing model that we have,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.130
let's go up rooting model.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.000
You see that?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.240
We gave a name here called I am DB idee.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.210
So the parents here receives all the perimeters,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.500
but I'm only interested in this one.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.420
I am baby idea.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.890
So I'm gonna go and type your give me all the perimeters.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.350
That's color.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.250
That's forums.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.590
Now from that,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.550
what I'm interested in is only parents off.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.520
I am db Heidi on this is basically let's say I d equals two.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.950
So I'm gonna assigned this year variable Now,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.930
using this idea,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.030
I can now make use off my service function that we wrote in the previous lesson.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.850
So we say this start surveys don't get more illegals.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.250
I supply i d.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.260
Once again,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.180
this returns an observable observable must be subscribed in orderto consumed the later so

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.730
well said dot subscribe.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.610
Whatever the restaurants we get,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.030
we would like toa assign toe a member variable called movie.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.950
So let's take your a variable called movie off.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.680
Any said has been undefined over here.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.820
Let's just assign this dark movie equals toe the response coming from the remote server.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.850
So we do have the movie.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.790
We will see whether we got the details of the movie or not.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.310
Toe,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.040
check this out.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.650
Temporarily,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.890
we go to the HTML corresponding to this,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.450
which is here.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.900
Andi will simply display movie,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:00.600
which is the member variable there and then use something called pipe on type Jason.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.020
So in other words,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:07.570
this object passes through this pipe gets transformed into a Jason string,

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.330
So let's go and give it a try.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.420
When we go here,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.830
you can see that we are getting the movie for Spiderman two.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.750
Let's go back toe the previous request.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.030
Let's take Ireland this time and check for an island man.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.730
So there's Iron Man three here.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.790
When I click on this,

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:28.540
you'll see that we got either elementary details the entire object were able to see.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.100
All that I have to do now is toe display this in a nice fashion.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.400
So let's go back to the HTML.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.820
Get it off all these court.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.360
And now let's display the entire DDS.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.410
So what we'll do is we'll make our screen into two columns.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.920
The first column is supposed to display an image.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.200
The second column is supposed to display the rest of the Beatles in a tabular fashion.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.560
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go create a don't roll,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.560
which is gonna give me a deal Class off room consisting off a column.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.260
Let's go and say for medium device.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.430
I want four Greeks for this particular column.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.360
Plus,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.180
the remaining eight off them will be in another one.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.050
So let's type here something like this.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.710
So we got two columns.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.580
One is four groups.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.010
The other one is eight grids.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.740
Let's go and type something like an image,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.730
So I think I am g with.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.590
I am G.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.820
I am J hum day.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.250
This is going to give me an image.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.220
I need the SRC,

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.860
but the SSC comes from our movie objects.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.670
So we have something called movie Dark Forster.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.720
Remember,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.770
this is an expression.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.840
So in order to say that it's an expression we have the surroundings with a square bracket.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.590
Otherwise angular will simply think that this itself with the name of a file which is not

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.480
so I have to surrender to the square bracket on alternate takes again I wonder Title of the

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.900
movie.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.250
I can see your movie tart Tater,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.950
Let's go and check if we are able to see that you can see we got this on by slapping these

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.260
two.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.230
You can see if I cut this from here and then paste it.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.720
You'll see the image will go on to the other side.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.830
If that is okay with you,

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.100
can just leave it as it is.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.650
But I think I will undo that so that I see the image first.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.860
The details on the right side.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.980
So that's what I want this section is going to display the movie title.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:30.360
Maybe I can use something like Hits three where I can say movie thought and now the rest of

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.820
them I want in a tabular format that's at a table with a class off table,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.370
you can have additional CSS classes for table like,

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.980
for example,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.270
if you want an alternate local or combination,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.620
you can say table stripes if you want to give a Howard effect,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.440
like when you move the months on the road,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.910
you want that to be highlighted.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.860
You can say table over.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.860
You also can give a border,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:01.440
but I think that is not really required on this table is gonna have a T body so that the

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.330
body consists off multiple rows.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
Let's put around 10 off them,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.340
and if I don't want a can always do it on each row has something like TD.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.220
Let's say to off them one for the label,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.250
one for the value,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.180
so that's going press enter.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.890
This is gonna give me tea body with so many rows and columns over here.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:29.040
So let's say the 1st 1 I want to give is director on the value for that come from movie dog

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.790
director.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.920
Let's go give the next one we want to give a plot.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.750
So let's take your lot.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:44.290
This is again movie dot plot Andi Likewise,

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.450
I'm gonna give the rest of the details.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:55.050
And now that we have tied all these details,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.840
let's go and see how this is gonna look like.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.570
And now we have a movie with all the details over here,

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.200
you can see that this is striped.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.890
And when I also move the cursor,

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.550
I should say some highlighting over here.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.400
But if I don't want these special effects,

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.960
I can get it off that and simply keep this as table a school non see how it's gonna look

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.810
like on.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.430
I believe this is much better than the previous one.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.020
So let's go and check some more.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.210
So it's going type Spider first enter.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.100
So we got tests.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.970
I click on this,

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.160
details on I got the Spiderman details Also,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.530
One other thing that we also want to do is to provide the back.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:35.730
But another ways the user has to click the movie browser and Onda click your and type the

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.790
movie again and are at least you have to come here and then first enter to get the rest of

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.130
them instead,

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:47.750
what we can do is we can actually provide a button over here so that we can click on that

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.410
to go back.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.510
So to do that,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.110
let's add a button right below the table.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:13:01.370
When safe button on add two Seasons classes Bt in on Bt in primary from Busta Press.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:09.210
Enter on Let's type your back now we want toe assign a function toe this when we click on

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.100
this particular bottom.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.510
So 200 the clicky went.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.560
You simply have to write round bracket.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.320
Click equals toe.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.860
A function on one of the function I right here should exist in the corresponding DS.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.450
Let's do one thing that's college does go back.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.730
We don't have this function that's create a function in the movie details.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.890
Component es somewhere here,

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:35.190
and I'll have to do here is to simply say,

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:40.320
window dot history dot back now let's go and try the same thing.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.740
Let's go here so we take some movie Let's type your Avengers on first enter,

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.550
we got The Avengers that's click on the 1st 1 when I click on the 1st 1 You see a little

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.000
bit of late.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.280
Agency will handle that.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:52.900
Also,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.310
when I click the back button,

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.050
it takes me back right to the previous speech.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.130
We click on back,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:58.870
it's going.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.740
But if I come to the same way because this data has been cached already,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.710
it is Foster.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.230
But if I go to a new movie,

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.850
which I'm not visited yet,

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.680
you'll see that for a brief amount of time,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.530
it is actually a blank right?

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.690
So let's go back.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.600
We want to say,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.370
Here in the movie details component,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:24.650
we can say hey displayed his entire rule only if the movie object is defined on not an

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.440
undefined.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.240
So there is a director called N G if,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.640
and we use something called store N G.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.580
If equals do and the direct condition.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.140
Now,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.160
if you simply type your movie if movie is defined,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.520
that's considered as true.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.950
If movies undefined,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.420
it is.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.710
Controllers falls so initially,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.060
the movie is undefined,

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.400
and we don't see this particular road itself.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.300
Ultimately,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.720
we can answer that one more on here,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.440
I can say,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.290
for example,

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:53.980
hits three.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:02.250
Please wait while loading something like this and then you can add your star N G if and

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.380
they say when movie is not undefined.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.640
So that means that whenever movies undefined,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.740
this is goingto be false.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.860
Not off all this.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.360
True,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.670
that means when the movie's undefined,

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.150
you'll see that please wait while loading will appear.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.490
We can also give you some CSS class,

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:25.480
such as it should be in the center so I can see a class takes the center.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.810
Probably you can also say,

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.830
takes the danger takes warning,

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.540
So that's gonna change the color like this.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.540
So if I go back or here now,

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.420
let's click the back button with the movie that we haven't loaded yet.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.160
Let's click on this and you will see that it is Please wait while loading for a brief

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:43.740
moment.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.960
But after that it changes to this.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.060
Go back Go a movie that we have only visited.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.250
You can see that it's quite fast,

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.980
so you see that even for a smaller moment.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.040
But after that,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.600
it is the movie leaders being displayed over here.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.230
So let's click on this to see for a brief moment.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.550
Now,

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.730
instead of this it three.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:09.640
You can also add an animated GIF So remember,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.820
we have an assets folder over here.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.630
Andi images.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:19.790
We can copy and paste an image so you can search for a lot of images here on Google.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.040
So,

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.590
for example,

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.610
if I take images google dot com on,

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.680
then type your animated loading Jeff file,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.810
you will get lots off them.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.590
You can just say one off these to your folder.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.590
I only have that in my computer.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.890
So I'm gonna copy that from my computer.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.980
It's called loading Jif.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.400
So I'm gonna come back over here.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.570
I'm going to right click and save based Andi.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.530
That's the loading Jeff on.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.530
This is an animated GIF that show some kind of a progress.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.230
So on I have to do is instead off.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.200
This are along with this.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.240
I can also are an image.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:55.960
So what Under there,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:03.050
Get off this and then I'll type I m g s r c calls toe assets from my route off my project

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:09.170
images loading dock just And then the ultimate text probably continue to say,

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.550
loading like this.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:15.990
I don't need the warming anymore because there's no color scheme in order for this on Now.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.460
If I go back over here.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.490
Let's look for some movie which we haven't loaded yet.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.560
Let's say weed killer.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.600
We got this.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.990
I haven't loaded this movie.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.260
So when I click on this,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.290
you can see that we got the animated GIF in action.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.350
So I click on this click on another one.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.450
I get a animated GIF for the time being.
