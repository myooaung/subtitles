00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.210
given movie.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.920
If I have the A M D V I t.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.100
I can get lumps off details about the same to check the same thing.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.810
Let's visit the urine or him.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.550
Maybe a ph dot com by supplying the a p a ki and then I am deeply I d.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.630
Now we have got the IMDb i d.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.370
When we actually access the movie.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.170
For example,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.810
if I go to the developer council here and then send another request,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.670
let's do a refresh over here.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.170
You can see that for each of the movies.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.050
We got something called imdb idea also here so that I am db i d.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.560
So let's do one thing.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.610
Let's make a request using this particular key as the less this particular I am db i d.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.390
So I'm gonna go back toe my postman,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.060
which is a tool for sending its TTP request on get the response.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:06.060
So the euro is http Colon www dot full mdb ap dot com Onda We can send parameters so the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.950
question perimeter is a P I key.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.990
The value for that happens to be something that I can copy from my movie service,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.550
which is right here.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.370
So this is the one I copy that and that's the value for that.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.260
And then I equals two on imdb idea which I get this from here.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.160
So we have a small response.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.180
I'm gonna copy this,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.090
go back to postman and then paste this.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.420
So when I send this request now,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.450
I will get a single response because there is only one movie with this.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.190
I am DB i.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.500
D.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.010
And that response is an object.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.310
So you can see that it's a single object.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.020
Over here,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.000
it's crawl up.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.750
The object has lots and lots off details that I can not display.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.530
For example,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.540
that the title that year the rating released data runtime.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.750
How many minutes are there genre?

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.790
Who is the director,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.730
right Or even the plant is also there.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.710
A small paragraph off blood on a poster.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.520
I believe the poster is gonna be the same thing.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.910
So if I click on this now,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.230
I should see the same poster.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.810
Probably you can see that it's the same poster.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.170
Let's go back over here.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.000
Apart from that,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.250
we also have ratings meta schools on so many information about the movie.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.400
Now we will write a function in our salaries class where we supply and I d just like this

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.460
and then get a response,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.460
which is gonna be a single movie response.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.010
Let's call this us get movie details,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.840
which receives an I am Devi idee off type string on,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.310
then returns an observable again off any because we don't have a day today.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.380
How do you create a class representing this entire response?

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.840
We could actually say that observable Britain's an object off that data type.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.090
Generally we do that,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.120
but for this example,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.420
will not on.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.750
All I'm gonna do is tow do the same thing.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.050
Let me get it off the side.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.970
But typing control be on Windows Command.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.990
Be on Mac.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.910
So we have more space,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.950
but they're done.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.580
This Doctor Http,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.560
don't get we say base.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.770
You are all that remains the same thing which contains the a p a key.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.100
And then we have an additional parameters.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.190
We said caroms is an object where I represents the I am Libby I d.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.720
And then we have the perimeter.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.610
I am devi idea.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.890
So whatever really see here simply supplying the perimeter called i along with the A p a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.640
key which is already over here.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.370
Now that dysfunction is ready.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.830
What we'll do is we'll go and clear one more component with on clicking on a particular

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.470
movie car over here.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.390
Any off this,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.680
I have to pick the corresponding I am.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.250
Maybe I d on get the details off that particular movie in a new component.
