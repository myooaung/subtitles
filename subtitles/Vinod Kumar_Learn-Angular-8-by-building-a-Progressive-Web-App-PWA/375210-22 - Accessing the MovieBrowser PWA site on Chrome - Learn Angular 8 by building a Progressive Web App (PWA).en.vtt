00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.810
one of the characteristics off a progressive application is on Google Chrome.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.570
When you open the application or website,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.530
you would see a small plus icon here initially,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.490
lots of flash toe install.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.620
But if you click on this,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.230
you'll see that we have a dialogue box that says Install app movie pros and this is the U.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.480
N.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.550
From where it is going toe install on.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.950
When I click on Install,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.440
it is going toe.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.010
Make a copy after application as if it's a standalone application.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.720
And he conceded,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.830
also opening that application.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.190
It has been detached from Crow.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.780
Let's close this and let's close this as well.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.320
Also,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.990
if you happen,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.180
toe goto chrome colon.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.320
Perhaps you should be able to see an icon correspondent or moving closer,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.830
taking on which it will launch the actual application as an independent window.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.790
And they should work just like our application on the browser.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.750
For example,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.850
if I'm gonna search for a movie here,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.460
I should be able to get the details of that movie as well.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.110
In fact,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.640
you can close the application,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.790
close the browser,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.790
close the chrome instance itself on a macro is you can use command spaceport,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.130
lunch the spotlight and then look for the at movie.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.160
Broza and I should be able to launch that from there as well.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.520
On Windows,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.160
you can just press the start button and start typing movie browser on.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.590
You should be able to launch the application as well about from this.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.840
Let's also see some of the other Syrian features off repeatedly.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.640
Application.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.740
Let me open chrome again and then visit the N G eight movie brother 80.5 base after come

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.360
being a beautifully,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.740
our obligation should also be running offline.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.510
For example,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.240
if I kowtow my WiFi and then say tone WiFi off.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.260
If I refresh,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.230
my application is still there.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.640
There is no Adama sitting.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.810
There's no Internet connection.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.650
For example,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.050
if I opened another tab and then let's a youtube dot com,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.550
you should see that there is another seeing no Internet.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.280
But if I opened another tab and then I n g eight movie brother,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.220
don't five best after cause I am able to still see my application running.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.440
Of course,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.010
if I am searching for a movie,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.850
I may not be able to get the actual movie evidence.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.420
For example,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.290
if a type a spider and press enter.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.720
Now you see that there is no response,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.740
and that's primarily because the competent movie list has been loaded.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.550
But since there is no result were not able to see any data over here.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.960
Off course,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.580
this could be easily handled.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.450
When we're subscribing to the observable,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.590
we could say when there is an other display that you don't have an Internet connection or

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.190
some kind of a custom message.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.860
Let me put my wife I back.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.200
And if I refresh,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.880
I should be able to see the actual details off the search results.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.820
Google Chrome also comes with an audit tool.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.990
Caldas Lighthouse.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.910
Let's go and have a look at this for this.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.840
Let's open the developer consumed by pressing F one.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920
If you see there a few tabs here elements console source network.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.450
Also,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.380
if you click on this,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.300
you see other types on one off that you can see is called audit.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.260
When I click on this,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.560
you should be able to see some details as what do you want to audit?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.220
You can see.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.070
Are you interested in testing your application against the mobile or that stopped the West

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.070
?

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.150
Let's keep it as mobile.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.850
What are the artists that you want to run?

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.840
You can select performance beautifully.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.030
A best practices.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.790
Accessibility.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.220
Aceval Now,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.510
since we are only looking at the PW aspect so I can unpick each other and you can see what

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.660
kind of Internet connection you want toe simulate.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.620
It's a simulated slow 40 are applied slow for G.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.010
R.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.900
No startling.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.110
You can leave that as it is.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.370
It's also giving me an Adam,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.890
assisting that multiple times are being controlled by the same service.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.630
Worker Service worker is the component of the browser that controls the PW on Since the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.400
same service worker is controlling this time as well as this time,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.480
it's asking me toe close one off them somewhere close the other one,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.410
and I will see that is no problem.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.550
It is run audit.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.040
When I click on this,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.260
your application will be tested,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.610
whether between a progressive of application or not animal body ways.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.940
So I'm gonna click on the run Audit on this will take a while,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.920
and finally,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.310
it is giving me a result as whether the PW a features are enabled on this application or

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.780
not,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.960
as you can see that my application has passed all the requirements off a paid every

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.600
application.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.210
It is forced under level.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.240
It is.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.040
Install a bill.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.380
That's what we saw when we clicked on the plus icon.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.750
It uses the https,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.220
which is secure socket layer.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.620
Register the salaries worker that controls the page and start your own.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.750
That's what actually the service workers job is about manifest meets the install ability

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.430
requirements such as icons and sharp name,

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.750
long name etcetera,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.930
whether indisputably optimized or not.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.360
So there's a bunch of checks one off.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.760
The thing that I also see here is does not provide a valid happen.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.700
Touch icon.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.260
If you see your manifest file,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.750
we have mentioned an Apple touch icon.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.310
If you see what is the actual error,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.650
it gives me that for ideal appearance on IOS.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.070
When uses at a progressive about to the home screen,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.290
define an apple touch icon,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.610
so it must point to a non transparent 1 92 are 1 80 pixel square.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.090
PNG.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.080
We do have this.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.360
If you follow this link,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.150
it is gonna explain the same thing.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.970
However,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.670
Crume Lighthouse is unable to recognize that Let's ignore for this time And then there are

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.780
a few more details about the same.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.060
There is also another tab here called application.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.160
And if you go over there,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.950
you should be able to see details off sevens worker.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.240
Apart from sarees workers,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.100
you also see that they can story.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.960
So if you click on that,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.880
you may see a few You,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.400
Lawrence.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.240
Andi.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.220
This is where it gives you a list off all the files that have been cashed.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.700
In this case,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.970
you can see favorite on index html all the JavaScript files such as main Jace,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.490
Polypill Jay's that have been cashed as well.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.700
We haven't cashed any network a resource.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.480
But if you do,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.000
it will be available under this link,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.150
such as the Jason data corresponding to our movie details.
