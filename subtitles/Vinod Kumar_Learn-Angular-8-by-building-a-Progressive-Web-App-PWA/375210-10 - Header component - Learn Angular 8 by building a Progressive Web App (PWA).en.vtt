00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
Let's create one more component,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.720
which is going to be a header competent.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.620
So what we want is on the top here we want a header that displace our application name that

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.740
is movie browser,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.080
followed by an HTML text box,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.350
which allows us to search for any movies that we want,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.930
so to do so let's go back to the command.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.970
Prompt AMR issue a command here called n g g c g for gender,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.270
etc.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.630
For component component slash header And it's going to create a new folder called Header

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.780
Under Components,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350
which is under app with four files in it,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.450
a CSS and HTML.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.740
A test spec file on another component class file.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.790
So let's go create the same thing.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.270
This also update our at model ts.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.410
Let's go and have a look it What is the change in the act model ts first.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.360
So if I go to the app model ts,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.720
you will see that in the Declaration section.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.530
It has added the header component and the head of component of DS is just an empty classify

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.230
here and it has a selector called app Header on.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:28.300
That represents a header html over here so I can go to my ab component hte Yemen And

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.910
somewhere in the beginning I can on your app dash trader slash ab slash header on That's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.680
gonna bring the header on top off your home component.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.190
Let's go to the HTML off the same.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.330
So I'm gonna go and say Header html and you can see that I'm typing partial characters and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.970
it's actually getting the same thing.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.550
Let's get off this.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.200
Let's say we want a blue collar background for this.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.070
We can make us off something called alert Alert Dash in fourth if you want other colors

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.310
apart from in four,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.610
you have success.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.300
You have primary secondary warning on danger.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.360
Soto give different colors.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.050
You can experiment the same thing.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.100
So I'm gonna leave this as in for that.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.330
Contains another day with a class off container.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.540
Let's press enter and see what happens.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.880
So we have a deal with a container.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.030
And as you have seen in the past,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.470
containers simply adds a margin on the left and right side off.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.400
Your do so insert this I'm gonna have on a location off something like,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.350
for example,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.090
let's in my team start from here from here till yer I want toe limit myself for the header

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.310
on right next to this.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.170
I want the textbook,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.560
So probably be know that this is already agreed for here on the remaining eight.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.090
I can leave that for the text box.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.970
So to do so let's go back here and i dot rope greater than dot call.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.870
I can say e m d four and then I can add one more plus dot com dash MD dash eight.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.660
So that's gonna be a parent rodeo consisting off to child deals safe a press enter.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.450
You can see that it's gonna come like that.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.100
And the 1st 1 I'm simply going to have here just like a history.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.820
Probably.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.880
I can have one hedge to whatever I want and then take your movie,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.440
Rosa.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.240
Later,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.540
we will also add a local answer off a text.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.340
But at this time,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.650
I think this is OK.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.900
And then this is where I want to have an HTML form consisting off and it put off by text.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.300
Nothing else.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.040
You can also say that the class name your is gonna be form control.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.950
So the class name form control comes from both struck on that actually makes this text box

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.350
nice looking textbooks.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.700
So I'm gonna press enter.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.200
We have a form.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.650
Action is not required,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.810
will come back and work with a form later.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.840
But for now,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.190
we simply add a form.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.930
We have an import type physical to text.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.520
Name is letter,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.450
for example.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.440
I call it us.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.180
Say quality tone idea is not really required because we're not using any Jake worry or

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.050
anything like that.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.710
So I don't need the I D classes.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.500
Fine will also add a couple of things Like,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.220
for example,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.310
I want this to bring the cursor automatically so I can see your auto focus equals toe auto

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.310
.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.490
Focus are you can just leave it as it is because it's a pseudo attribute.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.150
One more thing will also probably is there a place holder when they such movies,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.600
Probably by title or something like that.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.260
Let's go back and see has how this application looks like.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.050
Now let's go toe here and you can see that we have a movie browser title.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.420
This is gonna be our link to home page.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.330
Eventually there's a search movies I should be able tow type in the text that I was looking

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.280
for and then press enter and we should work on chroma compressed after all macro issues.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.830
As you can press option command I to go to the developer concern on here we have the toggle

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.670
device tool,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.570
but if I kick on that,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.460
it's going to switch toe iPhone on iPhone or mobile device.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.390
This it's gonna look like some movie brother on.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.230
You can see that there is a search movies textbooks where I should be able tow type

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.640
something.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.980
Press enter on.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.660
We want the movie to be destroyed over here.
