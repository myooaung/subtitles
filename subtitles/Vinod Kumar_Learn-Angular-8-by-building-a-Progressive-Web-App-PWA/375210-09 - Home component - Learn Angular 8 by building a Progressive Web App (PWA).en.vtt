00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.220
the way the fundamental building block off any angular application is a component.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.110
For example,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.050
if I go back to my court under SRC,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.430
we have app on Under AB.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.360
You can see that there are four finds called APP component CSS at component HTML at

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.170
Component Spec on at Component TS file here.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.750
So these four friends together make up a component.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.210
But essentially the class that we have created here called AB component,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.570
is the actual component.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.400
A class with a decorator off at component becomes a component.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.750
A component must have something like a selector.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.560
When you're working with routing,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.920
you will see that this becomes optional.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.740
But at this time,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.350
this is mandatory for us.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.560
You can simply given name like app.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.440
That's route.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.320
Are they canoe?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560
Some other selectors like Hash,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.940
which represents an I.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.500
D.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.170
Oregon is a dot which corresponds to your CSS class name.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.850
You can use parent child relationships and so on and so forth.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.380
But what I would do is I would like to simply keep this back toe uproot as well as in the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.560
index HTML.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.860
I would like toa enable the tag uproot instead off the other two that we had earlier.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.420
So in the index html when uproot element is found the content off that it's gonna be a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.140
substitute.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.390
Er,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.050
with this HTML,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.010
which is denoted here with template you are but alternately you can also use an in line

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.770
template.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.440
For example,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.090
I can remove this and then put something else here,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.160
which is actually html content.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.510
Say,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.140
for example,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.460
I can say each one.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340
I say hello,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.040
angular slash H one.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
And now you should see that internal Hello world.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.600
I should see a hello angular because now the actual template,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.060
the text itself is gonna come over here most of the time.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.560
We don't use this because eventually this is going to be a lots off HTM in court,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.510
which is very difficult to write in single courts or even in the template strings itself.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.190
So we're gonna put a template,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.930
Ural,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.120
and then associate the You are,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.260
which is current folder slash ap dot component dot html.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.250
If you want to create our own component,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.820
we also have to create these four files generally.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.480
But instead of recreating them manually,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.450
our Engy tool provides a command for generating all these components.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.840
So Let's go to the command.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.680
Prompt on if you want.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.990
You can stop this terrible running are you can open a new tab or new command from window,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.650
and then you can issue the commands from your project for them.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.720
So what Under there,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.260
Keep this running as it is on.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.240
Then I'll goto shell a new tab.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.030
So when the new tab is open,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.230
I'm currently on my work directory.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.780
As you can see,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.710
it is in the movie browser directory.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.490
Make sure that you are always in the work directory Onda.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.050
Then you take N g generate are you can simply that G and then followed by component are you

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.280
can say See so little you can say N g generate component like this Oregon State N g G C on

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.980
Then type the name of the component that you are interested in creating.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.010
Now it's a general practice that you organise your components in a separate folder,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.630
compared toa other things like Syriza's our director,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.720
which then go into different folders.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.970
So I'm gonna go create a folder called Components Slash on the name of the component that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.250
we're industry to create.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.050
Now I want to create a home page component.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.090
So I'm simply going to say at home.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.140
So there is a new folder called Component Under App On inside that there'll be a folder

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.920
called Home On Inspector.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.750
There'll be four files generated,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.170
called home that component or tears home that component out.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.370
Specter tears,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.050
and there is an HTML and CSS file associated with the same thing.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.310
So when I pressed Enter,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.470
that's what you're going to see.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.200
In addition,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.710
it also is gonna update a file called APP model TS that this is very much essential.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.780
That's going Have a look in tow the change that has done in the app dot model Dirty s first

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.780
.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.050
So let's go back to all cord on.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.850
If you want to open a file in the escort vehicle type control P on Windows Command key on

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.830
Mac ways,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.550
so that will give you a dialog box.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.870
Very concerned for fights,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.590
you can simply type up module.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.790
We can see that I'm typing partial letters and wherever it is matched,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.560
it is getting me that act.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.220
Modernity is,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.190
is what I'm interested in.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.550
If I press enter,

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.400
you can see that model has been open as well in the module N G model decorator.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.810
We have a section called Declarations On In this section.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.410
We will see our home component that has been created.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.930
The home company come from slash components slash home slash home component Dark TIAs on

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.230
that is included in the Declaration section.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.320
What we're doing basically here is to say that this component is part of this model.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.960
So it's a logical grouping off on the components that are required in case if it is not

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.650
part off this than your AB component cannot make use off home component.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.610
So now that it is part,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.670
let's get it off that from here on,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.040
let's go and see what is there in ab component.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.450
And then there is a home as a sub folder.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.320
Under that,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.460
we have this home component es As you can see,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.210
it is an empty class here.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.480
There's nothing here simply says select terrorist Abd Ash home Now.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.650
One thing that you can also see is that default prefix for your selector has come with AP.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.280
However,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.050
in the angular dot Jason,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.770
we can confident that as well.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.860
So if you go to the angular Jason,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.500
you should be able to see somewhere that the prefix happens to be ab because of which you

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.460
are ABX dash route.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.300
If you go to the home component now,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.750
you should see that there is an app dash home.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.540
Ultimately,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.630
when we issued this command here,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.000
we could have given a different perfect also,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.010
by using dash dash prefix equals toe something else,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.910
for example,

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.420
for my application being a movie browser,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.320
I may use em be as perfect.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.080
However,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.030
we will keep the prefix us app itself but angular style guide suggest that you should use

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.510
some kind of prefix to differentiate between your tags as a less It's demon attacks the

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:56.430
content off AB Dash Home is gonna be replaced with home dot component of HTML with simply

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.050
safe here.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.320
Whole works,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.910
but on my browser,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.920
I don't see that.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.090
And that's because we have never used this particular element.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.570
Our time now we can't use this in the index html because if I have to use that in the index

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.190
html,

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.670
then in the app modernity is we have to save bootstrapped the home component instead of at

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.290
component.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:23.050
Now an angular application typically is a three off component which means there is gonna be

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.610
one a root element like uproot.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.710
And that contains a couple of others.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.950
Like,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.570
for example,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.140
a header,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.030
a cyber,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.540
a foot or ah,

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.750
home component on the home component may contain sub component and so on and so forth.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.680
So to understand the same,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.600
let's go back to our app component html and right below this,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.950
I'm gonna type your ab home like a tag on.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.120
Now,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.140
when I go back here,

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.940
you should see that at home will now be replaced with its corresponding HTML.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:02.410
So this is how we can say a route condense at home now at home can for their content,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.730
other components.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.760
As we go forward,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.780
we will be creating more components and,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:06.950
well,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:12.030
basically create a at three of components over here in order to make our application look

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.710
better on beautiful.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:20.550
Let's use a CSS framework are bootstrap and the boot steps official home page is called Get

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.720
pushed up that calm where you should be able tow,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.440
read a lot of documentations and help,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.660
and so on and so forth.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.420
If you want,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.620
you can download this onto your local machine using either a zip file.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.490
Or you can refer to them directly,

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.790
using something called Syrian that are quite a few options for you to work with.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.000
Like using NPM.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.730
You can do an NPM install.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.780
If there is in young,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.050
you have yon on bootstrap.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.820
But if you want a nicer Bush top team,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.470
then we visit a website called Boots.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.450
Watch dot com While you see her,

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:58.520
it's nothing but have free teams for bootstrap on the Washington Four is going to be used

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.300
over here.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.700
And if you scroll down,

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.150
you should see a lot off ninth team options.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.910
We can choose whatever that looks nice for us,

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.220
so you want a lighter one,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:09.820
a doctor,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.650
one and so on and so forth.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.830
For example,

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.700
let's say I want to use this one.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.130
You can click on the download button to download.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:23.050
The essential files are you can click on the drop down over here to see what file you want

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:23.050
.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.460
If you're using CSS,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:24.790
fine.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.460
Probably you can use this boots watched or CSS,

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.790
but I'm using a CSS now.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.970
I'm not interested in debugging this year,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.300
says so I don't need this bootstrap dot CSS,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:41.170
but I can be happy with bootstrap dharmindo CSS I'm indirectly this link here and then say

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:41.760
copy,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.780
link address.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.950
That's gonna be the actual location off this file.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:51.470
Now I come back to my application now that a couple of ways I can include this into my

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.800
application Number one.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.280
If I have downloaded that,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.470
typically we would keep them in the Assets folder and then in the angular Jason.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.660
If you go on happen,

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:00.980
toe,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.810
look at here.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:07.230
There's a set off a sex that you can mention styles you can mention over here.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.580
Like Yes,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.630
I can probably give a part from my project folder or related toe.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.210
Angular.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.840
Jason,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.900
the location off the CSS file.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.920
Since I'm copping a you are,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.690
I would not be able to copy and paste the urine over here because this is supposed to be a

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.550
physical file related to your project.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.020
Likewise,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.040
you can copy some scripts if you want,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.330
but I'm only interested in the CSS on as you can see that there is already a style start.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.790
CS is under SRC that is being used.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.320
So which is right?

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.260
Should be here on.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.950
I can now include here by using after it import.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:44.370
Ah,

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.290
you are off and then paste that you are.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:53.900
And make sure that put a semicolon over here and now I have access toe the CSS from Bush

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.450
watch.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.240
So if I go back to my act,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:04.350
component HTML and make something like H one class equals toe alert alert Dash in four.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.130
And if I come back to the browser and happened to look at this moving closer,

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:13.660
you can see now the background for grown colors off all our elements have changed on.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.740
That's because of the bootstrap that we added Just now,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.550
let's go back here to make some necessary changes.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.130
Let's get off this on our here.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.850
One container as a class them from bootstrap.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.410
And let's include this at home inside the same thing.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.000
So whatever the at home content is there?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.270
No,

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.000
it's going to be indented inside.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.690
You can see that there's a gap here on the left of the cap on the right side.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.510
If you want to check,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.930
you can just click on this at all here in the developer tool on,

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.930
then move the mouse.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.940
You can see that there's a margin on the right and left because off container.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.250
Well,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.360
it's gone at some useful stuff on the whole component.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.120
For example,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.780
I want to display a picture of mine displaying that this app is developed by me,

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.360
my contact details and so on and so forth.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.950
So let's go back over here.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.230
I'm also going to create a new folder under asset for images.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:14.940
So let's get a images border where all of our static images are going to be kept over here

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.880
and I'm gonna copy and image from one off my pictures.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.410
So I'll goto my picture here.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.820
So there is a picture we know.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.270
Six Dodge a pig.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.700
Let me make it off this.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.810
I copied this and then come back over here.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:30.900
Images are right.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.920
Click and say,

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.020
Probably based.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.030
I don't see a paste.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.040
It's disabled.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.440
So what I can do that can say here,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.980
revealing finder or revealing exploded in windows.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.710
When I click on this,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:43.400
it opens.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.850
I'm gonna pace the picture.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.970
And the picture is now inside this particular fight.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.830
So the picture is there,

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.450
right here.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.900
So I want to make it off this in my home component.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.610
Let's go to the home component.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.920
Each human Andi make some changes over here.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.480
First,

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.110
let's get rough.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:08.020
Whatever is there inside this and I want to have some image so I can say here I am G SRC

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:17.090
equals toe slash a six slash images slash We know six dot jim pick.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.810
That's the name of the file on art.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.280
Should be an alternative text.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.690
I'm gonna die pure my name.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.950
We know from our fire.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.750
If you want,

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.120
you can give some additional class names.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.800
For example,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:38.510
bootstrap provides a class called I am G Company so I can say classical toe AMG AMG company

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:38.510
.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.170
So it's gonna give you a small white barter.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:47.130
Let's give some horizontal rule will also forward something like on application.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:53.950
We did the demo application so I can see her angular p w a demo application.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:59.740
I can provide something like developed by I can get my name.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.730
We know Kamar attire.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.650
If I want this to be surrounded with hyperlink,

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.180
I can give here the anchor attack with,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.780
says https.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.510
We know that,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:09.970
Cole.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.790
That's what probably I might want to give.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.750
I can also give a link toe see my profile.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.950
Let's say that and then I face my name over day.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.390
Let me also give some basic copyright symbol.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.150
So 1% coffee semicolon that's going to give you a copyright symbol.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.750
Let's say I want to give a year.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:37.700
Let's in 19 2020 then I say all rights reserved by probably another hyperlink to go to my

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:43.240
website and then the that should contain something like my company.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:48.160
So now that we have this very basic home component Letty have,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.550
it's gonna look like on.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.510
It's very,

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.160
very big,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.020
as you can see.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.040
But I want this to be a smaller and center line and so on and so forth.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:04.620
But if you want that one way to do is we can create basically three columns and keep this

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.560
in the center column.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.690
Now let's go on do the same thing.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.870
I'm gonna cut everything from here right now,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.320
and I take your dot role,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:19.960
which is going to create a a logical roll off elements that can contain three columns.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.050
And if you wanted that columns to be off equal size,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.850
you can simply say dark call.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.680
But I want this to be more responsive,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.100
meaning on a mobile,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.980
the ways I want this column say,

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.210
is to be a little bit different than the column size for a laptop screen.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.750
So Butcher provides us four types of devices.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:46.250
Extra small corresponds to mobile devices like mobile phones.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.310
You also have sm for small devices,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.660
which is like tablets,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.300
for example,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.050
at an iPad.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.370
Then you have empty for your laptop screens.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.350
If you have a very high resolution,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.840
big screens or projectors,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.630
you also have something called LG.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:05.070
So what I want to say is that I want for a medium device like,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.860
for example,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.260
laptop screens.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.880
I want this to have four out off 12 grades,

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.710
so bootstrap has a concept off groups here.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.670
One Drew consist off 12 groups,

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.390
and I say that this column occupies four groups,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.750
so you can think off that your screen is divided into oh!

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.290
Column one off for Greg's column to off orbits Colin.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.710
Three or four grades so maximum off 12 grades are alert.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.350
Pargo.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.850
So I will say here into three.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.900
So that means I want three such columns safe.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:45.480
A press enter RIA scored automatically create a deal consisting off three deals on that

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.360
This is the first column,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:53.120
which I'm not gonna contain anything inside that there's the 2nd 1 Then there's 1/3 1 So

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.970
I'm gonna explained the 2nd 1 and based everything that I copied earlier in orderto former

00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.520
this court.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.640
You can use our shift f on there,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.630
actually nicely.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.230
Former it your It's demon another.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.330
The court is relief.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.820
Go back and have a look at that.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.920
You can see that the column number one here is four grades.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.950
Column number two is four blades column Number three is for kids,

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.500
and that's how the entire application has been created now.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.500
But if I'm going toe select a different device,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.240
you will see that automatically it changes its sites.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:26.870
For example,

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:32.990
if I select this device toolbar and say that I wanted this on a phone like,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.650
say,

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.510
iPhone 67 or eight against,

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.710
it is how it's gonna look like,

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.670
because this is not an extra small device on on extracts.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.250
Wonder is a column automatically become Strela greats.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:54.090
So which means this is as good as they call excess 12 as the less called essential.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.710
So if you don't mention that,

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.150
it's gonna be like this and because it is a 12 grid here.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.460
This is a dummy column,

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.720
and it doesn't contain anything you can think off.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.190
This is a day with zero pixel height,

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.550
which is exactly here on the top,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.640
on the bottom.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:09.760
There,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.200
this again,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.370
one on this is again another 12.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.930
So this is what makes it as responsive.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.300
If I tell you this,

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.160
you can see that there is a gap.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.690
Probably you can see on that gap is because of the padding within this particular color.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.190
But if I select a different do is like,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.030
for example,

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.760
iPad,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.680
you should not see that this is a four on under for another four.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:32.990
Of course,

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.090
if I tilt it,

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.050
you should still C four plus four plus work.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:37.750
In any case,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.800
let's switch back toe iPhone.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.790
So we want to target two devices here on mobile phone on the desktop screens.
