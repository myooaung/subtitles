00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.060
in any component.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.800
If you want toe access,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.770
the information about the parts,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.730
such as the part perimeter,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.600
are the quietest ing perimeters.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.070
We have an actual service provided by angular called Activated Route.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.800
So let's go and make use of the same in our movie list component to get this information

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.450
about what are the quietest ing perimeters we have.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.490
So let's go back to our court.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.380
It's close on the open files and then go to the movie list component here.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.960
We can say that apart from the services that we have received from movies,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.960
the risk class,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.500
we can also say we want another object off type.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.450
At first declared other private,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.090
we call it us a activated route.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.870
Variable in can be anything but the tight must be activated route.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.640
You can see that we get an auto import sedition,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.580
so let's select that on.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.320
Make sure that it is from router model.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.940
Now,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.540
using this activity drought,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
we can say,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.170
Give me the perimeter called Q.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.970
Remember,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.250
we have a perimeter here called Q.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.440
So this is what we are interested in.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.580
So to do that I have to first say here this dot activated wrote dot and then you can see

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.650
that there are few functions.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.240
One of the member here is called Problems.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.250
Problems represents the part perimeter such as,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.910
for example,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.710
if I had past something like movies slash spider as if it is part of the Ural.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.550
But in this case,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.760
I'm supplying out of the question perimeter.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.370
We have to specify something called dot quietly bottoms not quite.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.950
Abrams is an object.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.700
It represents an observable.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.200
And,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.630
as in our case,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.270
we had returned an observable from here.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.450
And then we subscribed.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.400
Likewise,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.770
This being an observable,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.990
you can subscribe here by typing dot subscript on.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.710
Then when you subscribe,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.060
you need to supply a con back on.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.300
The callback will deceive on the quietest ing perimeters,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.680
so let's right the court in the next line so we can understand it clearly.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.590
So the perimeter that we see is a bunch of questing perimeters.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.460
You can call it askew problems,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.370
for example,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.950
on inside that cube problems when we receive the Cubans,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.000
what do we want to be?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.320
One?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.720
Only the que problems off.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.340
Q.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.140
Because that's what the Quietest Inc perimeter that we want.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.870
So let's go back over here.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.240
And then we say the whole thing,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.420
I can pass it over here,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.920
Curtis and paste over here.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.620
But instead of Ireland,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.950
this is gonna be que problems off Cube.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.850
So this is the quietest ing perimeter that I'm looking for.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.770
So in other words,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.570
what we're doing is we are actually consuming on observable on when the observable starts

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.410
giving you the data.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.660
The data is nothing with the Protestant perimeters.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.480
We take this questing perimeter and then pass it on toe dysfunction.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.590
As a parameter,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.040
We were only interested in a piece off that which is called cute,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.070
and then we substrate to the same thing.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.900
So if you want to simplify that,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.770
so what we can do is we can cut this from here on an open a college bracket and say,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.620
Give me the quality string perimeter.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.040
So I want a single perimeter from there so I can see your net.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.980
Q equals toa que problems off.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.540
Q.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.300
And then I say this start service,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.970
start search movies,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.590
and then I can supply que which is the actual value,

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.860
like spider or Iran or any other value that you were given when we subscribe to this we get

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.260
the actual response.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.500
But from the response,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.180
we will use only the respite dot search,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.260
which is a key in the restaurants.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.280
So the corresponding value,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.860
which is another it's faster into this movie's.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.950
So let's go back to the browser now,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.480
since that's a spider.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.850
So we're getting the spider.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.480
I click on a movie brother to go to the homepage.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.750
Let's look for something else this time.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.880
That's a for example,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.750
Avengers.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.970
I've just enter,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.870
and now you can see that we got all the movies with the title off Rangers.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.700
It's going to try that one more time.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.220
Let's try your Phantom enter so we get on the movies where Phantom is a part of the title.
