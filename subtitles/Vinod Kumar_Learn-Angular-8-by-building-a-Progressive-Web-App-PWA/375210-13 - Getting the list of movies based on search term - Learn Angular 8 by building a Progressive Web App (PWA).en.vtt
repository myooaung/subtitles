WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.030
so we're able to supply the quiet,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.380
um,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.880
as a choir listing perimeter to the Ural part off our movie list.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.730
Component we know have to redo the same in the movie list component and then search for the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.650
movies by sending its TTP requests toe for him to be a ph dot com.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.940
While the same thing can be done in our movie list,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.070
component itself generally,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.350
it's not a good idea to do that over here,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.270
because if you do the business logic inside a component that is not reusable to put all our

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.710
business logic in one common location,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.950
we create something called services.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.110
So to create a service,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.250
let's go back to the command front and taking a command N g G four Generate s for sarees

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.400
And then we will provide a folder called Services Slash Movies.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.780
So it's gonna create a class called Movies service and a corresponding test case fight.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.590
So this time you can see that there is no update on the APP model dirty s.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.690
So let's go back to our core and see that we have something called services over here and

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.880
there.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.010
The movie starts service 30 years and there is a class created which has been decorated

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.550
with that injectable.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.060
Now the at indictable has got a provided in route.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.060
So this means that this is automatically become part of the route model,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.460
which is the only model that we have right now,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.650
just in case.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.310
If this is not present like this,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.030
then this service is not part of any more.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.590
Do Soto explicitly say that this particular services part of our app model we can go to the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.950
APP model tortillas.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460
There is a section here called Providers,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.340
and we can say that movies service is part of this.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.140
However,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.570
let's go back to our service class.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.050
Andi undo the theme so that it is automatically added to the modern that it is part off.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.610
Here.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.110
I can rate the function that actually sent its duty very questo,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.010
imdb a.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.320
B A and get their 11 to data based on our quieter.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.500
So let's create a function called search movies,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.980
which takes a search term as a perimeter off string type on returns.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.480
What's called observable now observable is an object that represents a different execution

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.480
,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.400
meaning the actual job happens later point in time.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.200
So This is one we have doing asynchronous and observable If from our ex chase.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.510
So I'm gonna say here returned It is observable.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.950
We get an auto situation here saying that after import from on its Js,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.850
that's okay.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.880
And observable is an object that eventually represents a some data type.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.050
So I'll say here that it is any because I don't know what is the structure of this

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.870
particular return time.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.260
And I can create my own class representing the movie list.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.930
But for this example,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.070
we're not going to do the same.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.050
So this is the actual function signature.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.170
Since I'm mentioning here,

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.960
the American type is observable and I'm not returning anything.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.670
I don't get a warming here saying that we're not return.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.450
Any values will just ignore that for a moment.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.020
And let's say we want to work with http requests.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.410
So to send http requests we may send it where Get request our post request put our village

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.410
,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.550
so we need some additional services.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.070
Our class,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.400
which itself is called movie sarees,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.370
depends on another surveys which exploded by angular.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.300
And this is called http client so to include the same to our application first thing we're

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:58.190
to do is tow goto at McGill dot es and say that our model depends on a http claim model so

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.590
you can go here and then put it CTB client model.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.090
And we go to the beginning and then imported manually.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:14.650
So this come from a package card at angular slash common slash http.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.410
So once this module is part of our model,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.600
we can now go to our actual service class,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.510
Andi.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.350
Then we say that our class has a dependency on hitch to depict point,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.220
so I can simply declare a variable off any name I'll call it is.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.530
It's TTP off type http client,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.030
make sure that we get that from angular common.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.030
It's TDP.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.750
That's the one that we wanted.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.930
Now we got this,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.900
Http.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.980
We can make use of that over here,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.860
provided we mark this as private public are protected.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.440
So now this is a member available now I can see here.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.210
This start,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.300
http dot You can see that there is one function for each of its TTP methods.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.980
Like get post put delete on.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.370
I want to say dark.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.680
Get get request couple of perimeters.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.170
The first perimeter happens to be a You're a very want to send the request on the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.660
additional options that you can send Such as,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.220
for example,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.370
is the require listing perimeters Are is there a header editor?

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.720
So this returns an observable.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.830
So there actually is goingto take it off this but we have to supply you are Let's call

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.670
something called base urine.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.800
So the busier there must be a variable off strengthen.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.550
Let's declare that over here is a constant.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.020
Basically,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.290
order off stream type equals two and I have to give the you are so the yodel is going to be

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:50.650
something like hits DTP colon double slash www or mdb FBI dot com slash We also have to

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.300
supply a P a key here now,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.980
while a be a key can be supplied on unusual records like this.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.850
But since it's a common factor,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.400
we can add that right here itself.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.870
So I'm gonna put a question mark and then take your A p.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.140
A ki equals two and we have to give the a P a key that we got earlier.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.660
Which is this?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.850
So we have the order in which takes the a p a ki,

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.690
but We also have to supply a search tone as a perimeter.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.170
When you're making this request,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.330
we don't have the search term here.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.270
But we have the basic model and we have to not supply the search top.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.560
So the search term if you go back,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:37.190
toe the browser and look for Oh mdb ap dot com You see that the system has to be sent as a

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.380
perimeter called s scrawled on over here.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.960
There are different parameters.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.880
This is I for I am DB i d.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.750
Whereas this is for title.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.840
So you should actually give the exact title or at least a partial datum.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.360
But there is a search option which gives me a different value.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.670
So the difference is here you get a single result as a response.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.270
But as here we get multiple,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.710
actually,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.080
with maximum off 10 we get on with the S equals two and then we have the supply.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.310
This search string.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.130
Soto,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.780
send that additional question perimeter.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.450
We use an other object over here,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.350
and the other object has something called firms.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.020
This is like a keyword for the http client a p a.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.840
And then I supply an object filled with name value pits.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.990
One of the name here is s on the value for that is the search top.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.380
So what we're doing is now we're going toe upend this s equals toe.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.760
Let's a spider as the quite distinct perimeter for this base.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.350
Your Now that our get request is ready,

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.830
all we have to do is tow Return this from the function so that whatever is the return

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.950
object from the get function will now be written as return value from the search movies to

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.710
see if this is working.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:02.770
What we will do is we will goto our movie list component TS and will say that our class

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:08.970
depends on this particular movie service as a dependency so we can come here.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:14.260
We can declare a variable and then say that this is supposed to be movies service.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.470
Did I?

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.270
And now we have a dependency injection.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.160
We can mark.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.110
This s private,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.970
so we can use that in N g.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.230
On it all.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.360
Um,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.440
Minuto is toe call this function over here,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.150
so let's get off this dummy value.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.490
What?

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:35.700
We have given a clear and then we will call this function this start service start search

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.210
movies by supplying a key work.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.530
Now the search term that's hardcore for the time being called Spider.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.680
And now if you simply leave this as it days,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.340
so we are actually calling the function.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.400
The function then will be passed on toe here and here.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.420
The get function is being called,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.300
which returns an observable.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.570
But if you go and check at this point in time,

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.330
there is no request.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.190
So let's do one thing.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.660
Let's go back to a browser.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.950
Let's close this one.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.900
Let's open the developer console.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.990
Andi,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.380
keep an eye on the network time so that we can see.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.250
Is there any request sent to the remote server?

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:22.480
So if you see that I'm selected here except chart to see only the example http requests.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.330
So if a refresh here,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.690
you'll see that there is no request in tow.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.570
Imdb ap dot com On this is primarily because when we call this function,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.990
we got an observable.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:39.100
An observable must be subscribed in order for the actual function toe.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.780
Go ahead and get executed.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:46.650
So the way you can do is you can say you're don't subscribe and when you say not subscribe

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.330
now,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.430
the actual http request will be sent on the the response.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.810
Of course,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.280
we're not dealing with the restaurants at all here.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.500
So now if I go back to the browser on if I do a refresh,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.740
you should see that there is one example http.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:07.680
Request for your mdb ap dot com So let's click on the same and see that we got some

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.450
response which consist off search as a key year with an array off,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.800
probably 10 titles.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.760
So all of this content spider in their title.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.780
So if you also happen to look at the actual request that is sent over here,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.430
there is a quite a stink perimeter sent at the bottom.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.760
You can see there is an A p a key,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.890
which is the a p key that I have got.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.730
And then there is a S colon spider that has got,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.460
Of course,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.940
it is not what actually,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.150
I'm typing over here,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.930
but at least I'm able toe send a hardcore did value,

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.240
get the response,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:48.760
and the response happens to be a object consisting off search as the key on an array off 10

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.130
different values and each of those have title year poster.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.780
In addition,

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.560
we also have the IMDb i d on type,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.420
whether it's a movie off cities.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.340
In our dummy data,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.550
we had Titan,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.260
you're and poster.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.030
Of course,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:09.060
the same thing now can be passed on toe our actual object over here,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.010
and then we should be able to see the data also.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.330
So to do that,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.980
in the substrate function,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.590
we have toe ask for the rest wants.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.610
Now the substrate function takes three callbacks as perimeter,

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:28.120
so the first callback is executive as and when there is a flow off data,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.900
the 2nd 1 is executed whenever there is an error in the stream.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.080
And the 3rd 1 is when the observable has no more subscription.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.860
So let's do one thing.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.750
Let's put the first callback.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.050
We're really seeing the actual response so I can say that we get the response.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.730
We would like to assign the response toe the movies.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.050
I can say you're distort movies equals toe response.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.050
In fact,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.050
we don't want the restaurants responses.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.250
An object consisting of a key value safe.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.490
Go back over here.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.680
You can see that the response has a key called search.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:11.870
A search is the area that we want so we can see here rest adult search as the property and

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.210
now the whole thing is a cento distort movies.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.420
So if I go back over here,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.670
you can see that I already have all the movies which have Spider as the keeper.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.090
Of course,

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.950
it is not coming from here.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.430
We still have to map this value.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.670
But if I go back over here and I let sit island and then come back over here,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.490
I should see all the movies that have island as part of their title.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.460
So if you go check it out so we get all of them,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.250
I get 10 off them by default.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:47.670
So this is how we cleared a salaries class which is injectable toe another class after the

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:52.970
component on that it still has dependency injection makers off the dependency injection,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:53.360
right?

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:59.090
Our business logic over here so that the component simply has to call that function and

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.550
subscribe to order the response that we get.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.910
So the next thing that we have to do is tow link the quiet,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:12.550
um entered in the header component and then received that Why other you are part over here

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.250
and then that our application would be complete
