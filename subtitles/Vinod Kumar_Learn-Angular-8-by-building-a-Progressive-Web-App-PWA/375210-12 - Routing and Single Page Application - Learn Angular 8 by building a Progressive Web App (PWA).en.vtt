00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.250
way have two components home component on the movie list component,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.840
but at this point in time,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.150
it is only showing the movie list component.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.100
However,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.730
what we want is when we visit the default your local host for two double zero.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.350
We want the home component to be present.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.990
But if I type your slash movies and then press enter,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.440
of course we may have to search for a particular movie by typing question.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.170
Mark something like quieting dumb equal stools.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.950
A item.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.360
When I press enter,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.360
I want this movie's listed to be displayed.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.200
So basically what we want is we want a route part here,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.350
the Ural part toe identify what component to be displayed.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.070
Now.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.950
This is what we call it as routing are voting model in angular.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.740
So if I go back to the core and have a look at the AP module docked es,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.780
you see that there is something called imports and importing.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.910
One module here,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.750
called AB routing model and the uploading model is not actually a building model like the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.410
brother modular engine model,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.420
but it's a model that has been defined in our project itself.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.740
Now this automatically came up because in the beginning,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.360
when we cleared it a new project,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.210
there were a couple of questions asked.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.070
We said yes when it asked about Do you want a routing?

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.790
So we go to the APP routing module which have opened over here.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.590
You can see her.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.690
It defines an array off what we call as the route.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.440
Well,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.450
each urine pot will be mapped to an appropriate component,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.340
and we're just exporting that particular uploading model So we can import over here and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.380
then specify that this is going to be part off your model.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.820
And all we have to do is tow.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.890
Define a bunch off route configurations.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.740
So I have toe expand this opening curly bracket to represent a single route,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.870
for example,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.510
when there is let a slash home.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.650
So we want to go to the home component.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.950
I can tell you're when the path is home.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.560
We want the compliment to mount is the form component like this.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.540
Similarly,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.680
I can always stay here that if the part is called movies,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.750
we want to go to a component called movie list component.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.950
So now if I go back to the Roeser changed the urine from the default to slash home.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.280
And if a press enter,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.540
you see that nothing happens now primarily because in the ab component,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.550
HTML were always displaying this movie list component.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.950
If I go back to the APP component HTML,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.150
you'll see that we have commended this out,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.550
and then we have added this one.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.510
So instead,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.640
whatever this location is that we want this toe dynamically display a component for this.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.160
We make it off a directive called as a out of Oakland,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.920
and the way you do that is by using a tag name called Rotor Dash Routledge on slash rotor

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.550
out lit.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.050
Now,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.320
if I go back over here,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.860
you can see slash home displays this.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.610
And if it changes toe slash movies,

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.590
you should know,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.460
See that there is a movie list.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.590
However,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.490
we don't want this to be tied to manually.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.240
What we want is when I click on this,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.880
it should be the home page,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.390
whereas when I type something over here and press enter,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.850
this should change to the movies component.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.630
Also,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.690
we want to pass on the texture that you're ender so that this movie list can be dynamically

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.260
generated.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.040
But for now,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.470
Let's go back to our application here.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.450
Goto our header component,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.840
which is right here.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.380
And this is the HTML.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.030
We have this hits three over here.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.260
We wanted hits three to look like a hyperlink so that when I click on there that should

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.490
take me toe that home component.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.850
To do that,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.140
you have to add a directive called Router Link,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.650
so that's what we'll be doing.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.230
We use a square bracket about a link on,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.150
then equals toe in double quotes.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.920
We take something,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.810
and if you remember,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.000
we used the square bracket toe indicate what they were that were given in the double ports

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.000
.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.770
Here is a expression and not a string,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.170
and this expression is an array.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.930
So we need to supply an IRA here,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.700
and our consisting off either strings are numbers a combination off values that can make up

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.950
a route part.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.640
For example,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.560
I have to say here slash form.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.320
Since I have only one I can view like this.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.980
If I have a couple of other parts,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.560
I can put a comma here and then give,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.070
for example,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.190
if a serious slash home slash a slash be like this,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.900
for example,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.540
this will be evaluated as slash home slash k slash week for no.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.890
We just want to goto this because whenever we click on this particular route,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.890
part angular is going to go into the voting model and checks.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.930
Do we have a match for this particular part?

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.150
The answer is yes.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.550
And it would take me toe that particular component.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.480
How about movies when we enter something in the text box and when we press enter,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.600
we want to take it toe the movies component.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.660
We'll do that in a minute.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.500
But if I go back over here now and if I click on this movie browser,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.650
you should see that it takes me to the home component.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.610
One more thing that we want to do is tow.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.700
Make sure that this movie brother is something that is clickable like you there should know

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.270
that it's something that you can click.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.460
So we want a pointer over here.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.700
We can add a CSS for the same thing.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.270
We go to the header component.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.020
HTML.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.170
This is the hit three.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.720
There is no class name associated over here.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.530
We can add our own class like class equals toe,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.910
say,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.050
for example at clickable,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.870
we generally added custom perfect like this so that we can differentiate between the CSS

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.100
class is coming from booster on our own seizes classes.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.330
Since we don't have the CSS class,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.630
what we can do is we can create one such class under the CSS corresponding to this

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.310
component.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.350
We started that dot and this is the name all I'm gonna do is to type cursor colon pointed.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.650
And this way you have now created a class name that is applicable only for this component.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.160
So let's go back to the browser and see.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.990
And you can see that when I move the mouse here,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.360
it shows me a hyperlink with a pointer.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.410
Ultimately,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.020
if we want this particular class them to be accessible everywhere,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.200
we can cut this from here and then goto Stein,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.480
start CSS add an entry over here.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.760
So this class now is accessible toe Any component in our application.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.070
So if you go back,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.550
I should still see that there is a fingertip on the head on over here.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.440
Now let's come back to the section where when we press enter over here.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.520
So we want toe goto our neighbor get toe a different component to do so.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.090
Let's go to the heather component.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.300
Tears over here will lead a new function called submit Handler.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.900
That is,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.740
when you submit the form,

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.700
we want to go to a different component.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.580
For this.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.480
We have to depend on a surgery exploded by angular rotor module called Rotor,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.320
so we can ask for the dependencies in the constructor.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.900
So I have to declare a variable called router or any other name is fine but off type called

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.580
Router.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.450
And you can see that there is a suggestion by the escort saying that auto imports from

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.910
angular router you can see that we caught it,

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.450
since angular is the one that instance shoots this component,

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.500
angular uses this constructor.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.650
It finds that we want a variable off this particular class.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.900
If it is already instance created,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.680
we simply get a reference to that.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.990
But if it is not insensitive at angular reliance tension rotor,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.920
if router class has a dependency on something else,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.510
if that is not available,

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.040
angular will create the object and then positive.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.950
The router constructor and eventually angular,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.700
will take care of all the dependency management for us.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.020
So we simply say,

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:13.020
Give me the router object but that rotor object we want to make yourself that over here.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.420
So whereas right now it acts like a local variable on.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.530
We have access to the only inside this to make this as a member,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.380
variable typescript has a unique way and easy way of doing it.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.570
You simply declare this as private,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.890
protected or public.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.470
Now,

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.060
this wrote,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.770
a reliable becomes a member available not just a local variable,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:38.250
so I can come here and then I can say this start route are got and then makers off its

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.260
functionalities.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.110
One of the function is called navigate and we need to supply the route part perimeters,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.180
for example.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.870
I want to go to the movies so I can see your slash movies.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.400
So this is how we will be able tow programmatically neighbor,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.900
get to a different component.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.160
So when we say this daughter don't never get toe slash movies,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.070
angular is now going to look into our app.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.580
Voting model and slash movies corresponds to movie list company,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.220
and this movie list component is going to be displayed under this router outlet.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.050
So this is how the sequence off events take place.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.120
However,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.830
we load the function right now called Submit handler.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.640
But we haven't used it anyway,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.770
So to use that,

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.390
let's go back to the header component HTML We have the form here,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.320
so whenever you press enter on this textbooks,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.370
the enter form gets submitted and when the form get submitted,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.530
if you want to capture that event typically in an HTML,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.750
we would have said on submit Exeter.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:48.610
But in angular we can assign a function to the submit event by typing in round bracket with

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.900
a submit if,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.880
as equal and dust on submit equals toe,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.440
execute this function on the function,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.270
we're gonna call this as submit handler and we can also supply the even object

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.410
corresponding toe.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.850
The in this case,

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.370
submit So with a dollar event,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.010
this is more like a keyword.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.160
So this represents that event object.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.640
Otherwise,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.070
the event object is not supplied to your function.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.180
Since I've passed and even object over here,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.810
I can come to my function and then received that as any valuable I want.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.420
Let's call it as MBT now,

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.340
The reason why I'm supplying this particular event object is toe Cancel the default

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.060
behavior off the event,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.230
which is the submitted went.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.710
Typically,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.020
when a form is submitted,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.470
it changes The Ural on then refreshes the whole closer so we don't want that to happen.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.290
So we simply say your DVD dot prevent default.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.520
And this actually insures that the form submission toe remorse,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:45.700
sir.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:45.830
Where?

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.050
Except gets canceled.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.970
But it inserts the angular to change the component.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.530
So now that we have done this,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.840
let's go back over here.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.820
I'm right now in the home component,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.690
as you can see.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.530
But if I type anything over here,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.810
it doesn't matter what I'm typing.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.550
Even if I type spider because they're not supplying this fighter anyways.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.720
When I pressed Enter,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.050
you can see that we got the movies component right here.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:08.580
Off course.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.090
If I click on this and coming back to the home component pressing,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.280
enter over here.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.750
Changes to movies component.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.010
We also want to supply the world that I've typed over here as a quite distinct perimeter

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.500
over here to do so.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.850
Let's go back over here.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.980
So the navigate function takes a second perimeter after and ari,

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.650
which is an object that this is a contradiction object so extra para meters.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:38.570
One of them happens to be something called quiet problems which takes a name value pales on

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.580
the name value pays here can be anything.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.070
Let me do que on.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.870
Then I supply something letter,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.440
for example.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.170
I type your spider just as an example.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.960
So if I go back over here Andi,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.650
let's go click on the home and then typing here anything that that Ireland doesn't matter

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.450
what I'm typing here at this time when I pressed Enter,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.240
you can see on the top here that along with the movies as the part,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.820
we have a question mark because that's what's called quite a perimeters.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.830
Q equals two.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:12.170
Spider has come because we're supplying a name value paid off Q and Spider.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.060
However,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.150
one last thing that we want here is that this is not Spider always,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.400
And this is supposed to be what is entered in the text box.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.650
So we want toe get the value off the textbooks.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.230
Now,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.710
This is where we need one more step where we want to include the forms model because we

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.830
want to work with forms so as and when I'm typing anything in this text wants,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.880
I want to access the value from here so the form handling can be done in two ways.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.350
There is something called template ruined forms.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.040
Andi.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.550
There is also something called reactive forms for this demo.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.350
Let's stick with something called template driven form.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.090
Let's go back to our APP model TS.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.290
We want to include here something called forms Modern.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:13:01.100
So I come here and then type forms Module not that were scored is not helping me out here.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.010
Toe automatically importance.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.120
So let's go back to the beginning.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.750
Some video.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:14.870
They import forms modern from at angular slash forms come back toe our component,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.930
which is the other component HTML.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.100
We now have toe I one directive.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.570
So by importing that particular module,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.740
we have access to a new directive here.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.770
And the only thing that I have to do here is to say something like scrip record.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.250
Remember,

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.180
this means that whatever we are ascending it an expression we also the round record here to

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.120
say that this is an event that even is on change event.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.790
So we take your in g modern equals toe some variable.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.070
This has to be a variable defined in the types of Plus,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.440
we don't have that yet.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.550
Someone take your something called quiet,

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.830
just like the name over here.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.260
You can give any other name you want,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.950
but I given a death squad it dumb,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.530
but in the actual class we don't have the variable.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.070
Let's define that variable right here.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.950
So we say quite a dump is a string,

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.100
but we haven't assigned any value.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.240
But as and when you start typing,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.060
quite it will automatically take up that value.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.650
And this is the variable.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.810
Now I want to supply when I type it.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.060
So I go here,

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.550
I take your distort.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.140
Quiet,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:18.570
Tom.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.060
Now our application here is complete.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.920
When I go back over here,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.450
let's say I go to the home.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.050
I type your spider and press enter.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.010
You can see now it is Spider.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.590
But if I go back home,

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.030
let's changes to say,

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.840
for example,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.820
island man press enter.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:41.820
You can see now it's supplying whatever that expression that I gave Ireland man in a Ural

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.280
in Cordage string format.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.960
So we're able to pass that no matter what I'm typing here.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.410
The actual movies are always hard coded here because in the movie list were only working

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.020
with a hard core data.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.340
So the next thing that we want do is tow.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.100
Receive this particular movie title or whatever.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.480
The search string is there here in our movie,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.850
this component on get the actual later corresponding to the quality,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.250
um
