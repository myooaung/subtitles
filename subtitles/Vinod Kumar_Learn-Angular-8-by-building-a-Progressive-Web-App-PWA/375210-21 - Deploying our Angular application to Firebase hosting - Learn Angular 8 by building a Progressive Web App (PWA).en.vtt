00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520
now that our application has been built on ready to deploy.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.780
Let's do the same.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.590
Make sure that you're issuing all these comments in your movie Brother Angular Applications

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.120
folder,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.980
where we have also initialized fire base.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.360
So the way you can deploy to your fireplace posting is very simple type firebase deployed,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.420
and it's going to take the content off this to slash movie browser and publish that to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.930
other remote hosting.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.280
When I press enter,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.250
this will take a bit off time,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.560
but eventually this will be done on.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.490
We will be able to access our application at the Ural N.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.180
G eight movie brother dot fire based app dot com.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.920
So here is the urine.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.750
It says the hosting Ural is this.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.070
If I copy this goto chrome and then open and you tab face this u R L press enter,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.020
you should see our application deployed on coming up from here.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.670
Let's if we are able toe access the actual movies,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.690
let's take iron.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.730
Best enter and obviously we did not get the output.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.170
Now let's do one thing.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.050
Let's go toe developer concern by pressing after when I pressed after all Goto console.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.520
You see that there are some others.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.740
One of the other that I can see right away is that it's a mixed to content.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.300
It's because your page is accessed from https.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.470
But as the William D.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.690
B.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.740
A.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.850
B A is not secured.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.970
So it said that you are loading an insecure AP I from a secure FBI on.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.500
This is one of the reason why we did not get this working toe solve this problem.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.710
Since we don't have any control on oil,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.010
maybe a ph dot com,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.950
but I still want to access that.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.980
We can add a meta information in our index html.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.880
So let's go to the index html.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.170
Over here we can add a meta attack to say that upgrade insecure yours.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.650
And the tag here is Metta.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.460
Http equal equals toe content.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:19.260
Security policy on the continent for this happens to be upgrade insecure requests on that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.780
this time will ensure that if it all,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.160
you're trying to make yourself an insecure http requests they will be upgraded toe a secure

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.350
requests since we made some changes over here.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.350
So we'll have to do a build on the deploy.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.470
Let's clear the stream.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.210
Let's tow n g build dash dash brought,

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.010
followed by another command fire based reply When I pressed Enter first,

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.850
enjoyable Dash Dash abroad will be executed on successful completion off that command.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.400
Five.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.440
Best reply will do the job off deploying.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.130
It deploys the content off distance slash movie ProServ folder onto our remote firebase

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.750
hosting,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.260
and it is done.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.160
Let's go back to the brother and see if we can refresh once on,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.990
then access the same thing so we're able to see the home fish.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.820
Let's look for a movie that's a spider pressed.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.670
Enter on.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.950
We should be able to see the Spider Man movies.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.180
I click on one of those vitamin movie here.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.600
I get the rest of the details for the same movie.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.970
Click the back button.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.710
I am able to never get back toe my application.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.470
Take here to go to the homepage as well,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.600
so application is now successfully running from a remote.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.660
Applications are work
