X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
way off.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.670
All the files that have generated to off them are important.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.960
Number one is the N.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.200
G s w config dot Jason.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.950
This is the angular service worker configuration.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.400
Here,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.170
you can see that it is what is a fine that needs to be cashed,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.800
which is the index average demon.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.310
What are the assets for your application that needs to be cached on these?

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.320
The files that are going to be cashed Favorite Condor.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.790
I see well that an index storage female manifest our web manifest all the CSS and

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.150
JavaScript gets cached.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.650
I think it if you want toe,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.590
add more.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.410
For example,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.140
if you want to cash the network resources such as the response of its TTP get request,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.500
you can also add that,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.660
just like the asset group,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.560
you can add one more called data groups and then at the same thing over here.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.250
The next one that you can see is under SRC,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.910
which is manifest our red manifest.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.710
And this is the fire that is used by mobile devices for adding to home screen are one of

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.700
the icons that are supposed to be specified.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.860
Now here is the name that's gonna appear when you're trying to install movie browser with

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.300
the shark name as a less the longer name on both of them.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.140
I'm gonna change this toe movie space browser.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.590
The team color.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.920
That's let's live toe default background a bit off gray here,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.510
a display standalone scope is the route starting oral slash.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.330
Everything is fine.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.060
A lot of icons over here.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.960
I think the icons that are were only interested in is the 1 92 by 1 92 3 84 by 34.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.950
Fight will buy Fight well,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.550
so not all of them are required.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.110
I believe only this on this is required.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.050
So let's see that when we gendered our own icons.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.960
But apart from that,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.670
there is nothing much that you can do over here in this particular file.
