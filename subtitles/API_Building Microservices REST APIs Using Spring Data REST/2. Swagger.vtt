00:00:02.953 --> 00:00:06.895
When creating a REST API, good documentation is instrumental,

2
00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:09.709
and keeping that documentation updated with every

3
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.719
new change is also instrumental.

4
00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.126
Accomplishing this manually is a tedious exercise,

5
00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:17.953
so automation via Swagger is a timesaver.

6
00:00:17.953 --> 00:00:22.459
Swagger is a set of open source tools built built around the open

7
00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:24.964
API specification that can help you design,

8
00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:30.660
build, document, and consume REST APIs.

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.748
There are several parts to Swagger.

10
00:00:32.748 --> 00:00:33.791
The Swagger Editor,

11
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:39.618
which is a browser-based editor where you can write open API specs,

12
00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:45.071
the Swagger UI renders open API specs as interactive API documentation,

13
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:49.538
and the Swagger Codegen which generates server stubs and

14
00:00:49.538 --> 00:00:52.591
client libraries from an open API spec.

15
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:56.890
We will look at the Swagger UI.

16
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.372
The Swagger UI defines a set of HTML, JavaScript,

17
00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:04.744
and CSS assets to dynamically generate

18
00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:08.194
documentation from a Swagger-compliant API.

19
00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.858
These files are bundled by the Swagger UI project and the

20
00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:15.656
API documentation rendered in the browser.

21
00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:17.091
Besides rendering documentation,

22
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:21.167
Swagger UI allows other API developers or consumers to

23
00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:25.544
interact with the API's resources without having any of the

24
00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:27.394
implementation logic in place.

25
00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:31.597
We will look at Swagger 2 for a REST web service,

26
00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:31.979
specifically,

27
00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.578
we will use the Springfox implementation of the Swagger 2 specification,

28
00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:41.295
and we need to include these dependencies and in the Maven pom file.

29
00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:49.000
If you are using IntelliJ, don't forget to add the libraries to the modules after modifying the pom file.
