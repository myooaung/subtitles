Hi everyone, my name is Kesha Williams, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:13,437
Building Microservices REST APIs Using Spring Data REST.

3
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:16,942
I am a software engineering manager at Chick-fil-A.

4
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:20,996
Spring Data REST is one of Spring Data's most timesaving features.

5
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:25,707
It is a module that allows application developers to quickly port an existing

6
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:30,325
Spring Data repository to the web as a RESTful microservice.

7
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:31,094
In this course,

8
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:33,659
we are going to learn how to quickly standup RESTful

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,616
microservices without any extra coding or configuration.

10
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:39,809
It is actually pretty amazing.

11
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,902
Some of the major topics that we will cover include: exposing your

12
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:46,438
application's domain model using microservices,

13
00:00:46,438 --> 00:00:50,383
designing a system using the microservices architecture,

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:55,194
modeling complex entity relationships, implementing custom search APIs,

15
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:59,816
and writing effective integration tests and generating documentation.

16
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,124
By the end of this course,

17
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:03,938
you'll have a solid foundation for developing

18
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,781
microservices using Spring Data REST,

19
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:11,660
and transitioning huge monoliths to the microservices architecture.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,882
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with Spring Data and Java.

21
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:18,956
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Spring Data REST,

22
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:29,000
with the Building Microservices REST APIs Using Spring Data REST course, at Pluralsight.
