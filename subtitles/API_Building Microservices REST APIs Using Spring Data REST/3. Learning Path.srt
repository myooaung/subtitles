1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:06,620
This course is about building microservices REST APIs using Spring Data REST,

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,622
but it is not the best starting point if you are just getting into Spring,

3
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:15,579
Spring Boot, Spring Data, and microservices.

4
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:19,753
This course assumes viewers are proficient with the use of

5
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,239
IntelliJ or another Java IDE and Java 8.

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,565
At a minimum,

7
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:28,312
you need to have a thorough understanding of Spring

8
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:33,714
Data to be successful in this course, which includes JPA.

9
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:38,430
Fortunately, the Pluralsight library has several of these courses.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,462
I would recommend the following courses for students to begin the

11
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:45,399
beginner level understanding required for this course.

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,449
Along with the basic knowledge highlighted in the learning path,

13
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:53,836
there are prerequisite tools needed on your machine: JDK 1.

14
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:58,067
8 or later, a favorite text editor or IDE,

15
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:01,554
for this course I will be using IntelliJ.

16
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:02,256
Maven 3.

17
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:02,608
0.

18
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:08,016
Maven runs in your IDE, but you can also run it from the command line,

19
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:16,000
which will require you to install Maven on your machine. Git, and Postman.
