00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.641
When using pageable, we create pageable objects with certain properties,

2
00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:11.260
and we have to specify at least the page size,

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.452
the current page number, and the sorting preference.

4
00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:18.047
If the query method has pagination capabilities indicated in

5
00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:20.739
the URI template pointing to the resource,

6
00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.010
the resource takes the following parameters.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.839
Page, which is the page number to access.

8
00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.559
Size, the page size requested, which defaults to 20.

9
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.927
Sort, a collection of sort directives.

10
00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:39.136
Let's focus on the page size and current page number first.

11
00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:41.743
Rather than return everything from a large result set,

12
00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:45.450
Spring Data REST recognizes some URL parameters that will

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.491
influence the page size and starting page number.

14
00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:54.010
If you extend PagingAndSortingRepository and access the list of all entities,

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.326
you will get links to the first 20 entities by default.

16
00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:03.020
To set the page size to any other number, add a size parameter.

17
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.585
In this example, we've added seven, meaning we want seven tickets returned.

18
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:12.073
Satisfying the HATEOAS constraint of REST means enabling the

19
00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:16.756
client of the API to discover the next and previous pages based

20
00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:19.213
on the current page in the navigation.

21
00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:26.627
Let's look at the links section, which includes the following links.

22
00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:32.115
First, self, next, and last.

23
00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:36.945
There are also previous and search links, which we will review during the demo.

24
00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:41.366
At the bottom is extra data about the page settings contained in a page element,

25
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:45.935
which includes the size of a page, the total number of elements,

26
00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:50.786
total pages, and the page number you are currently viewing.

27
00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:54.477
This extra information makes it easy for you to configure UI

28
00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:58.020
tools like sliders or indicators to reflect overall position

29
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.871
the user is in viewing the data.

30
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.298
If you are currently at the first page of results,

31
00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:12.000
no previous link will be rendered. The same is true for the last page of results, no next link will be rendered.
