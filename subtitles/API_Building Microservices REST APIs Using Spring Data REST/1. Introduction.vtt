00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.832
You will be amazed to see how easy Spring Data REST

2
00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:07.029
makes it to expose microservices.

3
00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.597
Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories and

4
00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:13.715
automatically exports them as REST resources,

5
00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:19.252
also known as endpoints, so this is something to really get excited about.

6
00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.618
Before Spring Data REST came along,

7
00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:25.583
writing REST web services for a multi-domain object system was

8
00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:29.423
tedious and resulted in a lot of boilerplate code,

9
00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:34.792
and the use of annotations like RestController and RequestMapping in

10
00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:39.635
order to create APIs for simple CRUD operations.

11
00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:46.458
I'm sure you are familiar with these, but now they are no longer necessary.

12
00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:52.377
I will explain how Spring Data REST works, the modifications needed to the pom.

13
00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:55.177
xml Maven file to support Spring Data REST,

14
00:00:55.177 --> 00:01:04.000
how to discover resources, customizing resources, and we will even test our microservices using Postman.
