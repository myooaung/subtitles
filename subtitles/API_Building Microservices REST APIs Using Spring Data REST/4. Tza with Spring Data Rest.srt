1
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:06,736
The path is derived from the uncapitalized,

2
00:00:06,736 --> 00:00:10,790
pluralized, simple class name of the domain class being managed.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,084
It also exposes an item resource for each of the

4
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:17,231
items managed by the repository.

5
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:25,410
For example, this TicketRepository interface extends the JpaRepository.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,569
For this repository,

7
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:33,502
Spring Data REST exposes a collection of resources at

8
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,617
http://localhost:8080/tickets/.

9
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,100
For the resources exposed,

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,565
we use a set of default status codes; 200 represents OK,

11
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:44,566
and it's for plain GET requests,

12
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:50,312
201 Created is for POST and PUT requests that create new resources,

13
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:52,809
204 No Content for PUT, PATCH,

14
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:58,065
and DELETE requests if the configuration is set not to return response bodies.

15
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:02,543
A core principle of Hypermedia As an Engine Of Application State,

16
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:02,882
HATEOAS,

17
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:06,043
is that resources should be discoverable through the publication

18
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:09,662
of links that point to the available resources.

19
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:15,447
There are a few competing defacto standards of how to represent links in JSON.

20
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:20,054
By default, Spring Data REST uses Hypertext Application Language,

21
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:21,970
HAL, to render responses.

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,757
HAL provides a set of conventions for expressing hyperlinks in JSON.

23
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:36,000
With Spring Data REST, the links are contained in the return document. Resource discovery starts at the top level of the application.
