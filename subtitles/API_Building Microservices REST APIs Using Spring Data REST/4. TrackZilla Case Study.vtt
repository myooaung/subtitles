00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.981
The demonstration vehicle for this course will be based on

2
00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:04.967
a use case from Keysoft Incorporated,

3
00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:08.377
a fictitious company that developed an award-winning bug

4
00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:10.551
tracking system called TrackZilla.

5
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:16.342
TrackZilla is a cloud-based web application that tracks defects and

6
00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:19.213
enhancements requests for software applications.

7
00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:24.211
TrackZilla has a global reach with millions of users around the globe.

8
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:28.018
Several users have asked for an easy way to access their data

9
00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:31.765
from the TrackZilla system so they can create custom reports

10
00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.536
using their own internal reporting tools.

11
00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:44.000
Keysoft has decided to give users what they've been asking for by enhancing TrackZilla to expose data via REST APIs.
