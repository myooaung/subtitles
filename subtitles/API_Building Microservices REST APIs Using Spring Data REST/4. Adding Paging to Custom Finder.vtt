To use paging in your own query methods,

2
00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:09.563
you need to change the methods signature to return a page rather than a list,

3
00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:13.155
and to accept an additional pageable parameter.

4
00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:17.647
For example, when you add the pageable parameter,

5
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:19.792
and return a page object,

6
00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:26.711
the following query method will be exported to an endpoint that looks like this.

7
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.412
A sample call would look like this, and remember,

8
00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:33.245
you would then traverse using the previous and next links.

9
00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:36.190
So let's look at this in action.

10
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.064
In the demo,

11
00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:39.978
I will show you how to invoke a custom finder

12
00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:41.558
method without paging for searching.

13
00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:51.000
I will show you how to update the custom finder methods to use paging, and then we will tie everything together by using sorting.
