00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:07,758
Spring Data REST is itself a Spring MVC application and is designed

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,315
in such a way that it should integrate with your existing Spring MVC

3
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,513
applications with very little effort.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,305
The simplest way to get started is if you are

5
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:18,748
building a Spring Boot application.

6
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:21,793
That's because when using Spring Boot,

7
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:24,838
Spring Data REST gets configured automatically.

8
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:31,000
For a Spring Boot project, the first step is to update your Maven Pom. xml file with a Spring Data Rest.
