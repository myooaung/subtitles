00:00:06.428 --> 00:00:10.698
An integration test is meant to test all layers.

2
00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:13.890
We will have steps for preparing the data,

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.748
executing the test, getting the response,

4
00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:18.962
and verifying the response.

5
00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:20.677
This is pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:23.249
We'll see it in action soon.

7
00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.432
If you remember,

8
00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:28.377
we added an overriding controller with a method called getApplications.

9
00:00:28.377 --> 00:00:32.175
This is the method we are going to write the unit test for.

10
00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:36.695
We will also test the CRUD methods of the applicationRepository.

11
00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:38.830
We also added the getApplicationsById,

12
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.101
where we pass in the ID for a patiricualr application.

13
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:46.641
There are a few things we need to verify in our integration test.

14
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:49.975
Our integration test is going to send a GET request with the ID

15
00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:53.389
parameter set to the employee ID we are trying to find,

16
00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:56.803
next, we are going to look at the response of the HTTPStatus,

17
00:00:56.803 --> 00:00:59.706
and then we're going to check the returned object.

18
00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:01.763
So let's see this in action.

19
00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:06.076
In our demo, we will check our project's configuration in IntelliJ,

20
00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:16.000
we will create a test case and execute for the ApplicationCatalogController, we will also test the CRUD methods for the ApplicationRepository test.
