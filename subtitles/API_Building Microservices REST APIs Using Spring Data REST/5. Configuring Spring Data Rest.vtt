00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.683
Configuring the segments of the URL path under which the

2
00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:10.554
resources of a JpaRepository are exported is simple.

3
00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:17.977
You just add an annotation at the class level, and/or at the query method level.

4
00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:23.553
In this case, we are configuring the REST URL path to be bug.

5
00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:24.897
So for this repository,

6
00:00:24.897 --> 00:00:28.472
Spring Data REST exposes a collection of resources

7
00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:30.920
at http://localhost:8080/bug/.

8
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:39.366
Using our previous example of bug, if you have query methods defined,

9
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:43.406
those also default to be exposed by their name.

10
00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:46.590
So when we add the appropriate annotation,

11
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.050
this search method will be exposed as

12
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.785
http://localhost:8080/bug/search/findByAppId.

13
00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.867
We will talk about how searching works later,

14
00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:02.467
but just know at this point that all query method resources

15
00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:05.766
are exposed under the resource search.

16
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:10.076
To change the segment of the URL under which this query method is exposed,

17
00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:13.666
use the @RestResource annotation.

18
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:17.094
So here we are customizing it to be apps.

19
00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:22.658
So it will be exposed as http://localhost:8080/bug/search/apps.

20
00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:26.719
You may not want a certain repository, query method on a repository,

21
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.937
or a field of your entity to be exposed at all.

22
00:01:29.937 --> 00:01:34.497
To tell the exporter to not export these items,

23
00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:41.695
annotate them with either @RepositoryRestResource set exported to false,

24
00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:45.549
or @RestResource and set exported to false.

25
00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.032
So at the repository level, you use @RepositoryRestResource,

26
00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:53.784
and at the method or field level, you use @RestResource.

27
00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:59.697
If you don't want to expose a save or deleted method on your CrudRepository,

28
00:01:59.697 --> 00:02:03.856
you can override and use the @RestResource annotation,

29
00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:07.087
and set exported to false,

30
00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:12.619
and override the method you want to turn off to prevent HTTP users

31
00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.801
from invoking the delete methods of a CrudRepository,

32
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:21.441
override all of them and add the annotation to the overridden methods.

33
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:25.400
It is important that you override both delete methods,

34
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.340
as the exporter currently uses a somewhat naÃ¯ve algorithm

35
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.000
for determining which CRUD method to use in the interest of faster runtime performance.
