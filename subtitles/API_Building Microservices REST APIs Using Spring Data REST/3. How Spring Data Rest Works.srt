00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:06,104
So how does Spring Data REST work?

2
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:11,502
At application startup, it finds all of the Spring Data repositories.

3
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:16,897
It then creates an endpoint that matches the entity names.

4
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:21,270
It then appends an S to the entity name and the endpoint,

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:28,562
and it exposes operations as RESTful APIs over HTTP.

6
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,393
By default,

7
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:34,246
the HTTP methods to interact with these resources map to the

8
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:37,733
corresponding methods of the CrudRepository.

9
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:42,909
GET maps to findById, POST maps to save,

10
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:50,076
PUT maps to save, DELETE maps to delete.

11
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:53,576
As a quick tip, in a recent release of Spring,

12
00:00:53,576 --> 00:01:00,799
several CRUD repository methods were renamed; findOne was renamed to findById,

13
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:08,666
save was renamed to saveAll, findAll was renamed to findAllById,

14
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:21,000
delete was renamed to deleteById, the second delete was renamed to deleteAll, exists was renamed to existsById.
