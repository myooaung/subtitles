00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:08,396
The configuration of Swagger mainly centers around the docket bean.

2
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:13,208
I've created a configuration for the docket bean in the SwaggerConfig.

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:13,645
java.

4
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:18,119
So let's look at that now in IntelliJ.

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,626
So here is the SwaggerConfig file.

6
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:25,812
Swagger 2 is enabled through the @EnableSwagger2 annotation on line 22.

7
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:29,708
This configuration is enough to integrate Swagger 2

8
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,899
into existing Spring Boot projects.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,664
For other Spring projects, some additional tuning is required,

10
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:40,881
and notice on line 23 the @import annotation imports the

11
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,904
SpringDataRestConfiguration to the API documentation,

12
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:49,585
and on line 26, this is where I configure the Docket bean.

13
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:52,174
There are some additional configurations within this

14
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:54,455
bean that we'll look at later.

15
00:00:54,455 --> 00:01:06,000
Now the docket bean must be configured for each microservice independently. I'm walking you through the ApplicationCatalog microservice configuration.
