00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:06,872
We've seen that Spring Data REST is a good way to abstract

2
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:09,138
away simple RESTful CRUD boilerplate code,

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:14,319
but sometimes you need to step in and override one of the request

4
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,644
handlers to do something slightly different.

5
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:17,884
In this case,

6
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:22,393
have the ApplicationCatalog service call the UserManagement service to get

7
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:27,976
the name and the role of the owner of the application.

8
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:31,897
The way to write a custom handler for a specific resource is to

9
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,141
use the @BasePathAwareController annotation,

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:40,733
which allows us to define a controller which takes precedence over a

11
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:47,849
repository in the event that both sit on the same path.

12
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:52,059
We are not using @RepositoryRestController to override the Spring Data

13
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:56,500
REST response handlers because this adds a new method to the repository

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:06,000
route rather than overriding an existing one. We use @BasePathAwareController to override an existing method.
