The microservices architecture provides improvements over the big monolith.

2
00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:11.623
The microservices architecture decomposes systems into discreet,

3
00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:16.639
individual, standalone components that can communicate amongst themselves,

4
00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:20.588
working together or with external systems.

5
00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:24.437
This is a look at TrackZilla using the microservices architecture.

6
00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:27.981
The data can be accessed via several different client applications

7
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:31.469
since the data is exposed through microservices.

8
00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.867
There is a ticket microservice,

9
00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:43.000
and an application microservice; all of which include a domain layer, business layer, and data access layer, and their own private databases.
