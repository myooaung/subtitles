00:01.350 --> 00:03.430
We could do more exploration.

00:03.450 --> 00:10.350
But at this point we're going to try to do our first attempt to try to solve this problem.

00:10.380 --> 00:17.610
The first thing that we're going to do is to normalize the amount range the amount can go from zero

00:17.640 --> 00:19.580
to any number.

00:19.770 --> 00:25.740
And we're going to try to get that to fit the minus 1 plus 1 range.

00:25.740 --> 00:28.260
This will be useful later on.

00:32.840 --> 00:40.730
So we just leave a comment here to see what you are doing and we will use the standard scholar from

00:40.730 --> 00:43.530
the psychic library.

00:52.820 --> 01:01.620
But we're going to create a new column called are called normalized amount

01:08.640 --> 01:19.190
and we're going to use this standard scholar which is important to fit and transform our original amount

01:19.410 --> 01:19.790
called

01:30.540 --> 01:39.570
and we're going to reshape that two feet deep minus one plus one change.

01:39.660 --> 01:50.190
We will also need to drop the genome Amount column and we're going to just use that drop function to

01:50.190 --> 02:08.630
do that.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.090
So I was missing.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.620
And yes we're going to try that again.

02:12.620 --> 02:13.500
Great.

02:13.550 --> 02:21.860
So we can now see the first columns once more and we're going to see that we don't cap the amount column

02:21.980 --> 02:24.350
any longer but we cannot normalize it.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.650
I'm on cone now.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.940
We're going to drop the time column.

02:30.050 --> 02:33.130
We're not going to use that at this moment.

02:35.340 --> 02:39.260
We're going to just call the same function as before.

02:45.430 --> 02:51.220
And so we're going to verify once more that the column is no longer there.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.260
OK.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.090
Great.

02:55.320 --> 03:04.200
Now we will have to split our data set into the X and the y into the input information that a new term

03:04.200 --> 03:05.590
section will come up.

03:05.660 --> 03:14.520
We will try to predict if it's fraudulent or not and the label that says if the transaction is fraudulent

03:14.580 --> 03:18.980
or not that information is in the plus column right

03:22.660 --> 03:27.580
so we're going to just use simple vital functions to do this

03:33.950 --> 03:34.630
cheer.

03:34.670 --> 03:46.600
We're saying that we will get every going into the X Bible from that data viable except for the column

03:46.640 --> 03:47.300
name.

03:47.390 --> 03:52.370
Last year we're just except exact opposite thing.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.550
We're going to just skip that call

04:02.050 --> 04:11.780
just verify we can see what's you know we're X viable but we can just see it before right.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.500
So we don't have the last call.

04:14.520 --> 04:19.480
And we'll also check that why you buyable and that's only the labels.
