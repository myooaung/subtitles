00:00.930 --> 00:01.980
Hello everybody.

00:01.980 --> 00:03.180
Welcome back.

00:03.180 --> 00:08.550
Today we're going to finalize that feature and you're a part of this project by applying feature engineering

00:08.640 --> 00:10.190
to the scream list.

00:10.380 --> 00:16.410
If you can remember this screen this was a comma separated string that told us which queens were visited

00:16.530 --> 00:23.210
in the 24 hour period because the way is we can now use it for a model.

00:23.430 --> 00:31.440
We need to convert it into actual format that the model can be one of them is going to be making each

00:31.440 --> 00:34.060
queen into their own calls way.

00:34.440 --> 00:42.150
But because there are so many screens this is going to blow up the amount of ALL THOSE ARE THE it.

00:42.360 --> 00:48.900
Luckily for us in this project we spoke to a fellow Annaliese and he told us what are the top screens

00:49.020 --> 00:50.720
that people use the most.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.500
So we're going to leverage that data set and we're going to apply it to the change here.

00:55.950 --> 01:04.130
So in the file that you guys have for the class you guys are given this new data set.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.770
We're going to read it.

01:06.550 --> 01:13.310
We're going to be in school to call touchscreens that CSB which is good.

01:14.460 --> 01:21.640
This is going to give us the top screens we're going to select that top squeeze column because that

01:21.660 --> 01:24.620
dataset has one column just off screens.

01:24.630 --> 01:29.930
We're going to get out so we can get an array of all the bells well really great.

01:30.330 --> 01:33.510
So let's look at here.

01:33.550 --> 01:39.930
If we run off screens we see there is a list of most popular screens.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.920
It looks good.

01:42.060 --> 01:47.250
Now we're only going to create calls for putting their screens in for the rest.

01:47.250 --> 01:50.680
We're going to create another column for this.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.020
So how are we going to do that.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.490
Well we're going to do it this way with the first map.

01:56.520 --> 02:03.540
Each of those screens by separating and from the street into their own little little bit.

02:03.810 --> 02:05.220
So screenplays

02:08.910 --> 02:16.530
which is the field that we call the screens and we begin by just simply adding a car.

02:16.800 --> 02:23.780
Now what does is called my chief You may as well it achieves is that he creates as many commerce as

02:23.850 --> 02:30.590
there are secrets because there's going to be always one less command and screen we can use the cards

02:30.590 --> 02:32.020
to count properly.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.720
So by the way this is going to make a life mission in future you guys want to see the next last one.

02:36.750 --> 02:43.700
This is it not too great a code for each of those stops screens to go on it just look.

02:43.830 --> 02:50.460
We're going to iterate over every stop screen for screaming touch screens.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.500
So far so good.

02:51.780 --> 02:56.480
And then we're going to bring a new home with the name of that screen name.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.220
And we're going to do it as follows.

02:59.240 --> 03:04.040
We're going to get the screen less so far so good.

03:04.360 --> 03:10.800
Then we're going to compare as a street which is just set up as we are.

03:10.920 --> 03:16.580
And we wanted to check if that name of screens actually contains the touch screen.

03:17.110 --> 03:22.840
So you can see what this is going to return is a Boolean turnoffs.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.550
So obviously we want to compare it to an integer.

03:26.820 --> 03:32.650
So we're going to call it as tight love it and this can make it into your winners here.

03:32.820 --> 03:39.080
They were actually going to promote the GUI from the listo screens would work.

03:39.390 --> 03:43.020
So it's quaint less we're going to edit this column.

03:43.020 --> 03:54.960
We're going to source state or set up Skree less Obamacare industry replace the display screen name

03:55.230 --> 03:58.840
and its associated comma for an empty string.

03:59.050 --> 04:04.420
It's pretty much just replaces that screen from the main list of scripts that we have.

04:04.700 --> 04:05.410
And that's it.

04:05.520 --> 04:12.770
And then we're going to run the staking second and get it finished.

04:12.890 --> 04:18.350
Now we are of course going to be left over with the screens that we're not in this list of popular top

04:18.350 --> 04:19.140
screens.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.860
So to get back you are those questions.

04:21.860 --> 04:25.370
Well we're going to get a final call a call.

04:26.580 --> 04:35.370
Well this column is going to indicate is how many is left over to get.

04:35.400 --> 04:43.000
So this is going to be split screen less shrink of course and then we're going to count how many combers

04:43.040 --> 04:49.880
are left and of course this is why we added that at the beginning so that we can Caspary easily at the

04:49.880 --> 04:50.460
end.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.400
Great.

04:51.550 --> 04:54.010
So this run is so good.

04:54.130 --> 05:02.850
So now that we have done this feature and we definitely have no need for the screenies So we're going

05:02.850 --> 05:04.990
to drop it all at once.

05:05.270 --> 05:11.740
He goes scream this great.

05:11.890 --> 05:14.510
So we run this as well and it's over.

05:14.590 --> 05:19.630
The final thing that we're going to work here is going to be the facts.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.700
So what are facts.

05:21.700 --> 05:27.190
Finals are a group of screens that belong to the same set.

05:27.220 --> 05:27.870
OK.

05:28.060 --> 05:34.540
So there are many schools that are the core corollary chillar that of course we don't want co-related

05:34.540 --> 05:36.680
schools because they cause problems with the model.

05:36.910 --> 05:42.730
So in order to get rid of that correlation and still keep the value of those screens we're going to

05:42.940 --> 05:45.890
grow all those screens into one fund.

05:46.450 --> 05:55.370
If they don't do the one funnel then it becomes a one column of how many screens it contains.

05:55.510 --> 05:58.890
Remove the correlation and we skip that.

05:59.170 --> 06:05.350
So to make it a little more sense I want to show you how is this going to work like this.

06:05.350 --> 06:08.950
First we create a list of all the school stuff a lot of fun though.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.150
Luckily I have knowledge which cream belongs to which And if you work on this project you may know your

06:13.150 --> 06:14.900
product as well.

06:15.040 --> 06:21.280
And for the saving screen we have to say one sentence two cents or two amounted to four five six seven

06:21.310 --> 06:23.710
eight nine ten.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.920
So all these sequences belong to the saving sequence front.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.710
So we run it works as well.

06:29.890 --> 06:40.900
And then we're going to call that new call dataset that savings count which is a count of the saving

06:40.900 --> 06:47.010
screens and we're simply going to do savings.

06:47.170 --> 06:54.720
Screens that some how many of those we have found access because one quick.

06:55.090 --> 07:01.630
So what this does is that it count all the calls to have these names and sums it all.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.780
So the three of those teams are populated then that's a total of three.

07:06.790 --> 07:12.980
So savings account is valued at three and that we can actually get rid of those columns.

07:13.060 --> 07:20.190
But again dropping so is kind of dropped calls.

07:21.010 --> 07:26.590
And will that be the latest savings say these things so we run this and that's it.

07:26.620 --> 07:32.440
We remove all the screens for the from the columns because they're very correlated.

07:32.680 --> 07:41.010
And we added together as this savings count them because we still wanted to get some value from that

07:41.020 --> 07:46.010
we're going to do this for multiple fights because there is a couple funnels.

07:46.030 --> 07:51.580
I'm simply going to copy and paste in here and you want to see how that works.

07:51.850 --> 07:58.130
That clearly maunderings screens that belong together appropriate to their offer the credit card squeezed

07:58.330 --> 08:03.820
together into their own final and the long squeeze that worked together.

08:03.890 --> 08:09.880
Again we do this because this means that we are going to be strongly correlated and we don't want Coralee

08:09.880 --> 08:11.580
fields in our business.

08:12.100 --> 08:20.920
So at the very end we're going to see what we ended up with if we do say that hey we see that the final

08:20.920 --> 08:28.410
call has all the numerical codes that squeak all amps and the phone calls and that's pretty much hey

08:29.020 --> 08:30.030
we can also do it.

08:30.060 --> 08:36.960
Should Use them when you guys want to see how each will have each what happens.

08:37.180 --> 08:41.790
So again you see a bunch of distributions like we see in the B.

08:42.280 --> 08:50.530
Finally we can also I mean do you guys want to really see look into contract here and they are all the

08:50.530 --> 08:55.140
carnage that we have all the squinched that matter all the finals.

08:55.150 --> 08:57.330
And again it's the other screen.

08:57.490 --> 08:59.540
And a couple few fields right here.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.070
So to make sure that we save all this work going forward.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.510
We're going to same way to its own cost to its own data.

09:06.670 --> 09:18.190
So we're going to say to CSC how we're going to hold that new data because then you IP that 10 is pretty

09:18.190 --> 09:20.860
much in your version of the retina.

09:21.310 --> 09:28.070
And I always add this because false because I don't care to say that index that X is right here.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.790
We run this and say and that's it.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.760
We finished the entire pre-processing part of our product.

09:35.860 --> 09:37.390
Thanks a lot for watching.

09:37.390 --> 09:42.490
Next time we're going to begin that you should stop and we'll start building the actual mine that is

09:42.490 --> 09:45.170
going to be easier for easier process.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.920
But you guys are going to understand everything that we have done so far is because of that it is to

09:50.920 --> 09:54.150
make that viable process and easy.

09:55.030 --> 09:56.440
So you next week.
