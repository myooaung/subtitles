00:01.480 --> 00:11.610
Now it's a huge book seeing seamless be before we just to go with the exploration of true justice.

00:11.810 --> 00:19.730
Now we saw the x train Annex just variable's NY train and light just a swirl.

00:19.970 --> 00:25.590
It is now time to work with a machine learning technique called Vandam for us.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.960
We will just import that.

00:28.010 --> 00:36.670
That's what the program for us in the psychic library.

00:36.830 --> 00:41.560
We just need to indicate by ometer that's the number of arrests made.

00:41.990 --> 00:43.590
That's in no way.

00:43.610 --> 00:51.170
How complex will our force be with just put one hundred see how dispar forms in case we need to change

00:51.170 --> 00:51.380
it.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.810
We'll do that later on.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.190
We will also call that fit Meffert.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.030
Remember feet is always for training.

00:59.030 --> 01:02.350
We will use the x train on the white train by airballs.

01:02.450 --> 01:10.760
We need to transform white a white train into body input and we will just wait until this finishes training.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.270
This can take a while.

01:12.380 --> 01:16.280
We will also define white breads buyable.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.370
We just used to run them for us.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.740
We're trying to put it on desks Bible

01:25.960 --> 01:29.500
took a while but we just fast forward it.

01:29.650 --> 01:32.040
The video was showtime.

01:32.200 --> 01:38.840
So now we can put where we also take collate the score for DS.

01:38.860 --> 01:39.810
The accuracy.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.300
That's what we're using for score.

01:42.310 --> 01:46.100
We'll need that X Y test buyable for that.

01:46.170 --> 01:46.640
Well we see.

01:46.650 --> 01:47.740
That's pretty crazy.

01:47.800 --> 01:57.180
You want oh we will copy the Confucian my code from the log book and you'll see it on this one.

01:59.510 --> 02:04.260
Remember this gold will also parks some libraries that will need

02:14.170 --> 02:15.780
no movie.

02:15.850 --> 02:17.420
It's our confusion matrix.

02:17.510 --> 02:20.830
Well I did find a product for that.

02:20.900 --> 02:25.880
The output from the product Meffert on the X test input

02:30.820 --> 02:35.200
so we need to use that with white test as well.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.280
Now that would cover it.

02:36.280 --> 02:43.000
We can plot it calling their plot Confucian matrix funk function as before and after that we need to

02:43.060 --> 02:45.990
just show the Confucian matrix.

02:46.450 --> 02:52.150
So we see the low amount of confuse items but still we can improve

02:56.940 --> 02:58.580
we will do the same thing.

02:58.650 --> 03:07.440
But instead of with the test data set with the entire data set we calculate a new prediction using the

03:07.440 --> 03:09.860
same fandom for that.

03:10.110 --> 03:13.850
I'm also late and your confusion matrix.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.150
We will also plot

03:35.330 --> 03:44.140
how we help only 44 for out on suctions mislabel and only seeks to launch on such as mislabel the entire

03:44.430 --> 03:44.710
set.
