00:03.510 --> 00:06.850
Hello everyone and welcome to this coding exercise right.

00:06.880 --> 00:14.670
Really excited to start training our deep neural network to be able to classify our fashion items into

00:14.670 --> 00:15.980
10 categories.

00:16.170 --> 00:21.250
As you can see here we're going to start with the problem statement and business case.

00:21.330 --> 00:30.870
So just to recap we had 70000 images they are divided into 60000 training data sets and 10000 testing

00:31.140 --> 00:32.150
samples.

00:32.460 --> 00:41.630
The data again they are divided into 28 by 28 greyscale images and the target class is actually No.

00:41.630 --> 00:47.100
1 out of 10 which is kind of a target label which can be categorized as you can see into either like

00:47.100 --> 00:52.110
maybe a shoe maybe like like pants.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.880
Basically these are the target classes.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.620
We have the t shirts trousers pullovers ankle boots sneakers and so on so forth.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.570
All right.

01:00.330 --> 01:07.270
So let's get started by importing the data and then afterwards we can do visualization of data sets

01:07.740 --> 01:12.540
and then going to do training of the model and then we're going to do evaluation of the model and then

01:12.540 --> 01:13.740
we're going to conclude the section.

01:13.890 --> 01:14.380
All right.

01:14.430 --> 01:15.800
Let's get started.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.700
The first step is we wanted to import the data.

01:18.750 --> 01:26.130
So before importing the data we are going to import the key libraries that we had that we need basically

01:26.130 --> 01:27.400
in this exercise.

01:27.420 --> 01:33.810
So first step one is to import Pandurs so we can import pandas as speedy.

01:34.350 --> 01:40.510
And then we're going to import some pie as MP for you for you guys if you don't know our pandas get

01:40.630 --> 01:44.780
maybe to use for data manipulations using the airframes.

01:44.820 --> 01:47.010
It's kind of you know it's kind of similar to Excel.

01:47.010 --> 01:51.750
You know it can be dealing with tables and it's really powerful tool or library.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.170
And then afterwards we get important up-I.

01:54.330 --> 02:02.550
So we're going to import some pie as MP and then we're going to import mat PLA tcllib for plotting and

02:02.550 --> 02:03.580
visualization.

02:03.630 --> 02:06.940
So we're going to import mats lot live

02:10.260 --> 02:19.220
pie plots as P.L. tea and then we're going to import seaborne as well for for visualization as well

02:19.460 --> 02:21.420
mainly for statistical visualization.

02:21.560 --> 02:27.260
So we're going to import seaborne as asinus.

02:27.350 --> 02:27.960
All right.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.020
And let's run these cells.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.310
OK we're good.

02:31.310 --> 02:36.830
The next step is that we wanted to import the data so the data is contained within a folder called input.

02:36.920 --> 02:42.410
So we're going to do that we're going to read the C S V files mainly which is what we call it fashion

02:42.760 --> 02:46.630
train and fashion M.A. test data sets.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.190
All right.

02:47.510 --> 02:56.830
So we're going to do is we're going to do PD that read see is V and what we're going to do we're going

02:56.830 --> 03:03.040
to specify our input folders so we have our inputs and then we're going to include the actual the name

03:03.040 --> 03:04.600
of the of the of the data.

03:04.780 --> 03:11.870
So let me copy it here so this is simply the name of the files.

03:11.870 --> 03:15.160
It's called fashion Amneris training or training as V.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.230
And we need to specify that we have our separator.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.140
We're going to be equal to.

03:20.510 --> 03:21.980
And we have our common.

03:22.110 --> 03:22.820
All right.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.960
And what we're going to read here we want to put it kind of an hour in a data frame.

03:26.960 --> 03:34.460
So going to do fashion underscore train Discordia F and that will be my first data.

03:34.580 --> 03:34.940
Right.

03:34.950 --> 03:36.450
And that's kind of the training data.

03:36.650 --> 03:44.950
All right let's do pretty much the same but for fashion test the as for the testing data and again it

03:44.960 --> 03:46.490
is called Fashion amnesty.

03:46.490 --> 03:51.890
But instead of change going to be test and then we see as V and think we're going to go right.

03:52.010 --> 03:52.880
Let's run this

03:59.050 --> 04:00.440
let's run this too.

04:00.810 --> 04:02.000
OK we're good to go.

04:02.130 --> 04:07.860
So now we have fashion and we have for the training data set and for testing they test it.

04:07.870 --> 04:08.240
All right.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.340
That's pretty much all we need for the important portion.

04:11.340 --> 04:16.520
The next section we're going to go through visualization and that will be really interested and really

04:16.530 --> 04:20.260
interesting and we've got to be very going to be a very exciting section.

04:20.250 --> 04:20.940
All right.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.010
I hope you guys enjoy that section and see you in the next one.

04:24.060 --> 04:30.660
Mr. Tauriel we're going to visualize our dataset and take a look at it using different libraries that

04:30.660 --> 04:32.100
we imported before.

04:32.100 --> 04:32.390
All right.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.930
So let's get started.

04:33.930 --> 04:37.720
So let's delete those and let's start with the visualization.

04:37.740 --> 04:44.470
First of all here let's take a look at our data frame and let's look at the head portion of it.

04:44.790 --> 04:47.990
OK so as you can see here this is basically our images.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.330
Someone can tell me OK what are the image actually the images are presented in 28 by 20 pixels which

04:54.330 --> 04:56.800
is 784 pixels.

04:56.880 --> 05:04.260
So simply we took the image and we flattened the image so that each row here represents an image right.

05:04.500 --> 05:08.530
So simply we have five rows.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.450
This is basic and they have portion only.

05:10.450 --> 05:14.010
So in total we have 60000 titting datasets.

05:14.020 --> 05:14.470
OK.

05:14.730 --> 05:19.760
Over here because I'm showing only the head that's why I'm just showing the beginning or the first head

05:19.830 --> 05:21.590
portion of our benefit.

05:21.690 --> 05:22.440
All right.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.140
So that's the first part we're good.

05:24.180 --> 05:27.990
Let's do this as well but let's instead of had We're just going to call it tail.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.010
Let's see what's going to happen.

05:29.010 --> 05:31.650
So here the tail of the ending actually is pretty good.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.190
Interesting so here we have 60000 samples as we expected.

05:35.190 --> 05:39.750
And we have all the pixels pretty pretty pretty pretty much for all the fraud out image.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.300
All right.

05:41.310 --> 05:45.710
The next step is we wanted to explore let's say the testing data sets.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.310
All right.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.490
So we're going to take that testing.

05:48.720 --> 05:54.190
They are afraid and are going to call it heads that we're going to view the test.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.070
Are very much the same so it has again is again their images too.

05:58.430 --> 06:04.060
And and let's view as well the tail if you want we're going to do this again.

06:04.370 --> 06:08.500
And that will show us the tail so we have again 10000 samples as we expected.

06:08.550 --> 06:10.590
OK now we're good to go.

06:10.590 --> 06:11.190
All right.

06:11.280 --> 06:17.340
The next step is we wanted to view the shape for example of our fashion training and testing.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.240
Let's check out the shape as well of our frame.

06:21.510 --> 06:30.980
So let's go to fashion chain and let's specify a shape method shape so that give me 60000 by 75.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.450
That's what we're expecting.

06:32.460 --> 06:38.550
And again we can do the same the same command again in a cockpit but for sort of chain we're going to

06:38.550 --> 06:43.510
conduct tests for the testing data set that would tell me 10000 times 75 which is perfect.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.210
OK.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.160
All right perfect.

06:46.230 --> 06:52.070
So let's create training and testing arrays so we can actually explore these arrays and actually view

06:52.070 --> 06:53.280
or visualize the data.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.130
All right.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.950
The first step is we're going to call it training.

06:57.110 --> 06:57.750
OK.

06:58.140 --> 07:05.460
And we're going to call and N.P. and some pies and for some pie that array and we're going to call our

07:05.460 --> 07:16.410
fashion fashion train data frame and we're going to specify that the D type or type will get to be float

07:16.560 --> 07:26.920
free to float that you are right that simply will going to create our matrix or array training first.

07:26.930 --> 07:31.740
All right let's run this game with goods and then we're going to do the same as well.

07:31.770 --> 07:36.550
But for testing so we're going to copy this business of training and testing.

07:36.900 --> 07:43.370
And then here we're going to call it fashion tests IDF again the same stuff.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.040
So when we have training and we have testing.

07:46.100 --> 07:50.390
Right next step is we wanted to let's visualize maybe one image.

07:50.390 --> 07:55.470
Let's take an idea of OK how can we visualize just one image in a form of twenty eight by twenty eight

07:55.520 --> 07:56.330
pixels.

07:56.450 --> 07:57.170
Right.

07:57.260 --> 08:06.130
So we could do that we can specify plots that image show to actually show an image and then let's specify

08:06.380 --> 08:08.630
specific training data sample.

08:08.930 --> 08:14.900
So we're going to go into training and we're going within the training kind of no metrics.

08:14.910 --> 08:16.980
We're going to specify that we need any row.

08:17.030 --> 08:24.600
So we need let's say Rule Number 10 for example ok which indicates an image and we need all the columns.

08:24.620 --> 08:25.380
Right.

08:25.430 --> 08:29.870
So what we need to do that we need to specify the let's say Rule Number 10 but we need every single

08:29.870 --> 08:34.850
column we need the Empire pixels we need all the pics of that we have which is 782.

08:35.060 --> 08:40.170
So we could do with it to call this we're going to say OK we need one and all.

08:40.280 --> 08:40.720
OK.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.000
That specify the entire columns.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.010
All right.

08:44.090 --> 08:50.240
The only problem is what we in order to show you an image or using an image show we need to reshape

08:50.270 --> 08:53.720
our data to actually be in the form of 20 able 28.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.500
We can do this by applying the reshape.

08:56.510 --> 09:01.700
So we're going to do reshape and we want to specify the dimensions so he can specify the image 28 by

09:01.710 --> 09:05.140
28 that will show us the basically the image.

09:05.140 --> 09:08.500
Let's let's run it's all pretty interesting that's actually looks like a T-shirt.

09:08.540 --> 09:08.970
Pretty good.

09:08.990 --> 09:09.710
Pretty good.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.140
Let's try maybe a different.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.230
Let's try maybe Rule Number 12.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.030
Tell me OK that's like you know look like a boot.

09:16.350 --> 09:20.410
Let's try maybe row number like 60.

09:20.410 --> 09:21.490
We have 60000.

09:21.650 --> 09:25.030
OK this looks like like like a shoe.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.360
If you keep good keep going let's say six hundred.

09:28.430 --> 09:30.920
That will tell me again another T-shirt and so on.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.330
All right.

09:31.460 --> 09:38.000
So instead of doing this we're going to do if we're going to specify a random value.

09:38.050 --> 09:42.260
So we wanted to kind of you know like tested you know using random values just generate a couple of

09:42.260 --> 09:47.000
random veteran numbers and when instead of using here the value you know we set it ourselves was going

09:47.000 --> 09:57.470
to write it as an index index where we can specify it as random thought Rand int and when to specify

09:57.470 --> 10:00.180
any number between 1 and 60000.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.590
They just all of all samples.

10:02.930 --> 10:05.520
The only problem if we don't this actually going to run into a problem.

10:05.540 --> 10:07.510
Tell me OK name random is not defined.

10:07.700 --> 10:11.820
So we actually need to do that we need to go and define random.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.640
So are just going to import random simply.

10:14.700 --> 10:21.680
We can do this here beforehand so we can import random stron it we're good at it it's now we're good.

10:21.680 --> 10:29.750
Now we're just you know like running kind of randomised numbers and viewing it the next step that we

10:29.750 --> 10:31.010
wanted to display.

10:31.010 --> 10:32.830
They want to display the label for it.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.440
Want to make sure that we actually understand what actually the data even makes sense.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.170
Right.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.730
So if you guys look here.

10:39.920 --> 10:40.670
OK.

10:40.730 --> 10:46.040
The key element really important which is indicating that the first element here is label.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.040
That's the first column.

10:48.080 --> 10:53.950
And that's why actually when we rent here we select was elected not from index zero we actually select

10:53.960 --> 10:56.530
from index 1 because we want to skip the label.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.910
I didn't want the label to be included in my image and that's why we skipped it right.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
I should have though I should have said that earlier.

11:03.290 --> 11:06.590
But I hope you guys are not confused by one and all.

11:06.620 --> 11:06.860
Why.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.810
Because again who's the target caller.

11:09.180 --> 11:09.700
All right.

11:09.920 --> 11:14.810
So what to do right now if I need to show the label order to do this I'm just going to call it label.

11:14.980 --> 11:15.730
OK.

11:15.860 --> 11:18.090
And I'm going to do a thing called training.

11:18.300 --> 11:18.770
All right.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.330
I'm going to go inside my training.

11:20.420 --> 11:27.410
I'm just going to pick basically the value of my index along with zero which is simply the value here

11:27.410 --> 11:28.450
in my first column.

11:28.510 --> 11:29.090
Right.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.060
What are you going to do.

11:30.080 --> 11:38.570
Actually let's go and let's put them all together in one cell so we can just maybe run them all together

11:39.260 --> 11:46.990
and try different numbers so he did this so I'm going to say that and it looks pretty good.

11:47.060 --> 11:49.630
What we need to do actually in addition to showing it.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.170
I just want to show the label too.

11:51.180 --> 11:51.700
Right.

11:51.740 --> 11:52.220
So let's try.

11:52.220 --> 11:53.740
It's actually pretty cool.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.450
They can tell you OK this is actually so label Phyfe.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.030
All right.

11:57.170 --> 12:03.040
So what I need to do to confirm this was just going to show you just going to copy and paste here the

12:03.050 --> 12:05.510
10 classes just for my reference.

12:05.510 --> 12:06.040
OK.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.140
So here I just copy them just you know format.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.530
So five indicates a sandal actually looks like a standard from it to me.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.420
Right sign and a couple of samples are actually.

12:14.430 --> 12:15.540
This is a sneaker.

12:15.740 --> 12:17.710
So which is seven sneaker looks good.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.760
One more time.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.070
Looks like like a pullover.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.410
You know it's a little confusing.

12:23.540 --> 12:27.940
And you can see actually that the next we actually get a little bit confused with it to pull over to

12:28.310 --> 12:29.570
then run it again.

12:29.580 --> 12:33.640
And one more time and then one more time with told me.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.470
8 was little bit of bag.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.960
Let's try one more time actually let's try one.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.430
I just want to see you Sam Okay that's for the coat.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.190
Yeah it looks like a coat.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.940
And one more time that's actually one which the trousers what.

12:47.020 --> 12:47.340
Then what.

12:47.350 --> 12:47.920
Good to go.

12:47.990 --> 12:48.730
Right.

12:48.730 --> 12:50.210
That actually makes sense.

12:50.470 --> 12:55.720
And and we are pretty much you know kind of visual the data.

12:55.930 --> 13:00.980
What I need to do in the next section is to visualize the data as well.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.950
But instead of visualizing them you know just one by one.

13:04.090 --> 13:06.900
I wanted to plot let's say like like a matrix.

13:06.910 --> 13:10.210
All right so now let's view the data in a matrix format.

13:10.210 --> 13:14.920
So what we're going to do is we're going to simply just going to copy the code here I'm going to walk

13:14.920 --> 13:15.670
you through it.

13:15.950 --> 13:16.330
OK.

13:16.330 --> 13:19.220
Just to.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.340
So in a simpler form we can create the matrix or grids.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.120
OK that's 15 by 15.

13:25.120 --> 13:25.670
All right.

13:25.980 --> 13:32.460
And what we're going to do here is that we're going to create subplots of dimensions of our grid and

13:32.680 --> 13:40.050
specify the figure size and then afterwards we're going to flatten our array or our axes simply from

13:40.050 --> 13:41.280
15 by 15.

13:41.310 --> 13:43.540
We're going to make it into our array of 225.

13:43.830 --> 13:45.730
When you can get the length of the training data.

13:45.860 --> 13:46.480
Okay.

13:46.830 --> 13:48.950
And then afterwards we're going to create a loop.

13:49.050 --> 13:49.770
Right.

13:49.830 --> 13:58.010
That goes from 0 up till two hundred and twenty five which is the overall number of images that we wanted

13:58.020 --> 14:01.270
to basically plot.

14:01.560 --> 14:07.000
And then we're going to every time we get to create and create a random variable.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.150
And then once we get there in the variable are we going to show that variable and then we're going to

14:11.150 --> 14:13.530
show as well the index of the variable.

14:13.530 --> 14:15.410
That's what I wanted to do I wanted to show.

14:15.570 --> 14:18.770
OK what's my target class as well.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.000
So we can get an idea of what does it look like.

14:21.360 --> 14:26.340
And then here we're just going to set access to off just to avoid you know all the growing number of

14:26.340 --> 14:30.670
pixels around the image because we're gonna be plotting a lot of images in this case.

14:30.810 --> 14:35.460
And then afterwards we're just going to adjust the space just to height between the images so we can

14:35.460 --> 14:37.330
be able to view the data.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.310
All right.

14:38.310 --> 14:42.380
Let's run the cell.

14:44.310 --> 14:45.810
It's taken a little bit of a while here.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.200
And yet here you go.

14:48.210 --> 14:49.430
Looks great.

14:49.440 --> 14:56.190
So as you can see here we have pretty much just wanted to give you kind of a visual sense of what categories

14:56.190 --> 14:56.990
we're looking at.

14:57.150 --> 15:04.350
So as you can see there are bags that are sneakers that are sort of sandals that are sneakers here that

15:04.350 --> 15:06.240
are like jackets trousers and so on.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.970
So we have pretty much like you know all the time classes pretty much presented.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.040
Right.

15:11.040 --> 15:11.930
That looks great.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.200
So that's pretty much all what I need.

15:14.250 --> 15:18.900
When it comes to the visualization section I hope you guys enjoyed that section and see you in the next

15:18.900 --> 15:19.290
one.
