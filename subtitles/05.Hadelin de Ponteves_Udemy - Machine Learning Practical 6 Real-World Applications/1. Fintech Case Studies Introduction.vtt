My name is run Phoolka and what the machinery uses in a prime issue that interested uses of machine

00:10.200 --> 00:12.510
learning models in a 50 inch.

00:12.510 --> 00:16.460
These products can also live in comfort and have more pressing on their lives.

00:16.480 --> 00:24.720
Scription problems if you not on the data the data for this province is manufactured given that often

00:24.720 --> 00:26.820
these type of data is probably there.

00:27.600 --> 00:34.170
But all of this is an artificially created data set the distribution patterns in association with features

00:34.260 --> 00:36.110
are not random.

00:36.270 --> 00:43.380
They follow rules to what we see in the real world because of this the data serves as a great representation

00:43.650 --> 00:45.920
of what you will encounter in the workplace.

00:46.170 --> 00:51.330

be done with Martlett leading symbol.

01:04.110 --> 01:08.590
And we will spend a couple of years exploring some very useful plots.

01:08.770 --> 01:15.020
Collision course with our saying and we will use pandas and not buy from the models themselves will

01:15.040 --> 01:16.980
be our classification models.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.620
So those will be covered as well.

01:19.620 --> 01:26.040
All are matters of my obligation to read we'll be exploring the following projects depending on which

01:26.040 --> 01:27.600
