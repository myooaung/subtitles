Hello everybody.

00:01.420 --> 00:06.440
Today we're going to Blaikie for cross-pollination to previous resolves to do that.

00:06.450 --> 00:11.860
We're going to first import the book retaliation function only a Skillern part of selection.

00:12.270 --> 00:24.250
So he use a from scale learn that selection in part cross bow score and there we go.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.660
Post-Oscar score run this important so far so good.

00:28.770 --> 00:36.470
Now the next step is to actually create yakkers for the Focus validation which is accuracy's call cross-bar

00:36.500 --> 00:39.210
score where we got it.

00:39.210 --> 00:45.160
We need to give it the earth argument which is what kind of model is going to apply.

00:45.220 --> 00:50.610
Cross-pollination do in this case if the classifier again leads to your question model that we built

00:50.640 --> 00:58.590
earlier then we're going to give it an X are made which is obviously extreme and we're going to do the

00:58.590 --> 01:06.220
same for y y he calls y train.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.940
X.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.270
Finally we're going to get how many folks that we want.

01:12.270 --> 01:16.280
We just went in to see me and we're going to use tent poles.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.640
So we run this.

01:20.130 --> 01:20.760
Excellent.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.170
It took a few seconds.

01:22.170 --> 01:25.250
It will take a lot more time depending on what kind of model you're running.

01:25.260 --> 01:27.530
Ours is pretty light headed because of that.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.740
So now let's see what results we get.

01:31.230 --> 01:39.170
So if we actually focus on the terminal we see here the accuracy's is these different results so we

01:39.200 --> 01:43.700
stand right here and we get that means for those.

01:44.070 --> 01:52.680
It's going to be 63 almost 64 percent accuracy in a cross-pollination meaning that 60 percent accuracy

01:52.680 --> 01:57.340
that we got is very consistent across all fields or data.

01:57.600 --> 02:04.590
Now the last part of this process is going to be putting the accuracies of the classifier and pulling

02:04.590 --> 02:11.130
together with the names of the fields so we can see which particular field is more important in predicting

02:11.370 --> 02:12.800
They response bear.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.840
So let's do that first.

02:15.840 --> 02:23.610
We're going to create a cat named Frank which is pretty much combining two data from two columns into

02:23.610 --> 02:28.860
one final result that we want to print out those columns are going to be the name of the columns as

02:28.890 --> 02:31.260
well as the coefficient of each of those columns.

02:31.260 --> 02:32.640
In the CROSSFIRE.

02:33.060 --> 02:35.590
So let's fill those well with those.

02:35.610 --> 02:39.200
The first column is of course going to be a panacea or frame.

02:39.480 --> 02:49.560
It's going to be composed of the columns of extreme great and it's going to have the column name call

02:49.680 --> 02:51.210
features because that's why this is

02:54.210 --> 02:55.440
excellent.

02:55.440 --> 03:04.050
So now the next argument is going to be a second action and it's going to be the coefficients that come

03:04.050 --> 03:05.290
from the classifiers.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.490
So the classifier comes with the cold fusion.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.360
Excellent but because this role will not make any call.

03:12.380 --> 03:19.010
So we're going to use non-pilot transpose and apply to these.

03:21.030 --> 03:21.970
Excellent.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.260
And we're almost ready to go.

03:24.270 --> 03:31.120
One less thing that we need is we want to keep the final call AKA's final planet they are from a colony.

03:31.200 --> 03:40.960
So let's go we're going to give me a current argument and that's going to be quite efficient.

03:41.770 --> 03:44.690
Excellent excellent excellent.

03:44.690 --> 03:45.930
This is very good.

03:46.530 --> 03:52.100
So the final part here is still the function that the axes that we're working with is on the first axis

03:52.100 --> 03:52.770
to.

03:52.950 --> 03:56.210
These two little friends are going to be columns in our press.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.130
So let's run the bus.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.220
Great.

03:59.220 --> 04:01.230
And we'll look at the screen here.

04:01.230 --> 04:06.680
We're going to see that there are coefficient for each of the features that we've been run.

04:06.900 --> 04:11.450
Most of them are pretty small but it's more about you but a few of them are relatively high.

04:11.520 --> 04:18.310
For example where you are in Iowa you sir are both on one which is higher than the average Portus partners

04:18.340 --> 04:23.620
and purchases are very very high and in actual about their negative numbers.

04:23.760 --> 04:28.740
And those are point twenty nine point seventy two meaning that these two are extremely important at

04:28.740 --> 04:30.300
predicting the response.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.250
Very good.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.880
So now that we have everything ready we can finish this video.

04:35.070 --> 04:40.900
And on that next video we're going to see how feature selection is going to make our model a lot better.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.050
Thank you very much for watching CNN.

04:43.050 --> 04:43.540
Next on.
