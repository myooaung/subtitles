We said we were going to try to solve this problem using machine learning techniques.

00:15.100 --> 00:23.820
But what this machine in it is the science of getting computers to just like humans to particular to

00:23.820 --> 00:28.480
extract patterns from information as we do.

00:28.500 --> 00:34.740
We do that by feeding them data and information of the world and trying to teach them the underlying

00:34.740 --> 00:36.960
patterns and information.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.040
Machines can outperform humans in this task.

00:41.380 --> 00:50.330
And what is the difference between machine learning is a part of what it is based on learning the data

00:50.620 --> 00:58.800
presentations that's different to that specific algorithms that are part of the broader machine learning.

00:59.640 --> 01:07.710
Learning can be sober by us semi supervised or unsupervised although we could tackle this problem with

01:07.710 --> 01:13.870
some unsupervised learning technique where we use so-called mice running alone.

01:14.220 --> 01:21.120
That means that we will need to teach our network input and expected output as well.

01:22.380 --> 01:29.730
In our case the input will be a new credit card transaction and the old label will be in information

01:30.060 --> 01:38.910
that says that they response to a fraudulent transaction or in order to turn those transactions apart

01:39.150 --> 01:42.070
we're going to do some free exchange.

01:42.240 --> 01:48.480
We're going to try to extract the most relevant information to our classification problem.

01:49.500 --> 01:57.540
Those extracted features will be represented with X-1 and next to as shown this can be for examples.

01:57.660 --> 02:06.750
The user's IP location and its COM objects that will be put to the person that that's the most basic

02:06.750 --> 02:17.450
unit in any narrowing and those boots will be multiplied by weights represented by W 1 and w 2 B is

02:17.490 --> 02:26.580
just a bias and the output of the equation that you're seeing will be just assume or one form of training

02:26.700 --> 02:34.320
a neural network is to find the optimal doubling we want it to be optimal by use should not only be

02:34.320 --> 02:41.940
the last for a single transaction but for the entire data set into any new transaction that might come

02:41.940 --> 02:44.760
after us up.

02:45.230 --> 02:49.110
But just knowing your question might not be enough to solve our problem.

02:49.430 --> 02:55.720
So that's why we usually concatenate different person turns into more complex than that.

02:55.910 --> 03:02.980
So just one can see by now they can see two notations of the same architecture.

03:03.360 --> 03:10.330
They always pick one next to and then wait that we need to train our own waste.

03:10.370 --> 03:18.050
Don't you one want you to want that sensor also notice how we can pull our submarines together at the

03:18.050 --> 03:21.520
same level or stack them up in different layers.

03:23.260 --> 03:30.430
Connecting once the layers are put into another layer simpled we can create really complex architectures

03:30.520 --> 03:36.320
such as the ones that we're seeing the first layer when we call input layer.

03:36.530 --> 03:44.850
And the last layer will be called output layer and all the layers in between will just be called layers.

03:44.870 --> 03:46.160
That's it for now.

03:46.220 --> 03:51.520
Don't worry if you didn't get a briefing we'll pick this up in next week.
