Hello everybody.

00:01.410 --> 00:02.790
Welcome back.

00:02.790 --> 00:07.230
In today's media we're going to quickly plot co-relation blood between all the features that we have

00:07.260 --> 00:10.370
explore and the response people get.

00:10.590 --> 00:12.920
So let's get started.

00:12.930 --> 00:18.240
First we're going to use the data set to variable which has our original data set with all the three

00:18.420 --> 00:20.880
columns that we didn't want explore.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.800
Then we're going to write the core with method.

00:23.850 --> 00:30.600
This is going to create a set of correlations within each of the columns and its argument its argument

00:30.600 --> 00:34.200
of course is responsible which is what we want to analyze.

00:34.440 --> 00:38.330
So they say that esign great.

00:38.370 --> 00:41.510
So the next step is to actually plot the result.

00:41.700 --> 00:50.730
So let's write all t and bar bisquits our bar chart and was given a couple of arguments.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.640
The first argument of course is the figure size.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.320
Now this depends on your screen.

00:56.370 --> 01:00.390
For mine this is 20 and 10 is a good figure size.

01:00.450 --> 01:10.470
Then we give it a title and the total is going to be of course correlation with esign because that's

01:10.470 --> 01:12.150
the responsible design.

01:12.660 --> 01:19.300
Then the fun size that we won for this title and other things is going to be 15 for my screen.

01:19.920 --> 01:25.350
And the final two arguments are the rotation argument which is just so that I can read the columns better

01:25.860 --> 01:32.960
the ticks or the x axis and finally the great argument which gives it a grid on the background.

01:33.090 --> 01:35.440
So it's much easier on the eyes game.

01:35.670 --> 01:41.550
So they should be pretty much what we need for blood in these correlations but so let's run it and see

01:41.550 --> 01:42.870
what we get.

01:43.580 --> 01:44.690
Excellent.

01:45.030 --> 01:45.510
So there you go.

01:45.510 --> 01:53.040
Now you can see the correlation but this blood is very interesting because it gives just a correlation

01:53.040 --> 01:55.460
between the arguments and the response variable.

01:55.470 --> 02:01.610
Now it is good to know that this is this correlation it is linear in nature.

02:01.660 --> 02:05.850
So this may not be the actual correlations that are found.

02:05.990 --> 02:11.770
Well we're running models that are not linear in nature like random Forres Superbike machines with Kerno

02:11.770 --> 02:14.040
ICBMs for example are B.F..

02:14.080 --> 02:19.700
So whenever we run models that aren't linear in nature then these relationships may not hold but is

02:19.710 --> 02:24.850
still pretty nice to see how the relationships are when we compare all the columns.

02:24.860 --> 02:33.950
OK so now let's start now just as a reminder of how this plan works the bigger the chart is the bigger

02:33.950 --> 02:38.420
the relationship the bigger the bar the bigger the correlation of course.

02:38.420 --> 02:46.130
Now if it's negative in nature that means that as the variable increases the likelihood of the response

02:46.390 --> 02:48.650
will be positive decreases.

02:48.950 --> 02:54.610
And if it's positive like this chart here when the variable increases the likelihood of the response

02:54.610 --> 02:57.170
variable being positive increases.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.370
So that's how it's related.

02:59.690 --> 03:01.180
And here we go.

03:01.220 --> 03:07.100
Age seems to be very powerfully correlated with the response variable being negative meaning that as

03:07.100 --> 03:12.860
you grow older you are less likely to put up with entire onboarding process and get to the final stage.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.750
The final screening.

03:13.880 --> 03:14.430
OK.

03:14.750 --> 03:20.810
And this unlike some of these other big bars home owner is negatively correlated with Simon in that

03:20.810 --> 03:26.480
if you're a homeowner you're less likely to reach the final step of the process which I cannot explain

03:26.480 --> 03:30.350
why but it's good to see income is positively correlated.

03:30.350 --> 03:31.020
OK.

03:31.220 --> 03:36.120
The next correlation is personal ACAM one which is negatively correlated.

03:36.230 --> 03:41.120
This is something that is a little bit hard to understand because in the next step when we do our data

03:41.360 --> 03:46.970
to engineering this is going to be removed and is going to be combined with this.

03:46.970 --> 03:52.160
So maybe once we combine these two columns we can get a feature that we can understand a little bit

03:52.160 --> 03:53.120
better.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.860
Now the other big ones are these three charts right here.

03:56.930 --> 04:00.450
Has that Amanda requested and rescore number one.

04:00.470 --> 04:06.410
Meaning that either person has a debt like they owe money on their credit cards then they're more likely

04:06.410 --> 04:07.060
to on board.

04:07.090 --> 04:12.860
Again this the reasoning behind these conclusions are not sure yet we're not sure yet but this is good

04:12.860 --> 04:19.100
to educators So how do distributions look the same for a man requested the most amount that you request

04:19.100 --> 04:20.970
or more likely you are to put up with everything.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.170
Richard the final step of the process.

04:23.540 --> 04:26.140
And finally we see the rescore.

04:26.300 --> 04:32.350
So as the initial rescore increases their relationship with the response variable increases.

04:32.390 --> 04:37.970
Now this could be because we have not normalized our relationship yet none of these features are normal

04:37.970 --> 04:43.720
as yet is going to be done in the data pre-processing part but it's good to keep in that in these here

04:44.810 --> 04:48.830
and then the rest of the columns left are not that important it seems.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.450
I mean they have some somewhat a correlation there.

04:51.470 --> 04:58.760
All the risk cores and the external quality score from the marketplace but they're not two influential

04:58.900 --> 04:59.670
things.

04:59.690 --> 05:04.400
And finally last inquiries which is an inquiry that partner has had and the more inquiries you have

05:04.400 --> 05:06.820
the less likely you are to reach the same process.

05:07.090 --> 05:07.760
Okay.

05:07.850 --> 05:08.990
Seems legit.

05:08.990 --> 05:13.870
So let's jump into the correlation matrix in the next video and continue our exploration of the datasets.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.580
Thank you very much for watching and see you next time.
