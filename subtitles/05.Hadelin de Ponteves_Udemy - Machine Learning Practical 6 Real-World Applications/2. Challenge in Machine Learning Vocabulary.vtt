WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:07.370
So now we want to describe our problem in a machine learning vocab right.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.500
So the data sets are going to be using is what we call the fashion minus dataset.

00:11.580 --> 00:12.100
OK.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.070
So as you can see here I kind of took a snapshot of the images.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.280
So it's kind of a grayscale images.

00:18.330 --> 00:18.740
OK.

00:18.810 --> 00:25.550
Of different categories including for example dresses coats sneakers bags and so on.

00:25.620 --> 00:26.120
OK.

00:26.270 --> 00:32.790
And our objective is to build the classifiers build the kind of a deep learning network that can look

00:32.790 --> 00:38.460
at these images and can tell us OK this image basically belongs to one of these target classes.

00:38.460 --> 00:39.740
One of these 10 categories.

00:39.830 --> 00:40.370
OK.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.210
So the fashion is data set contains 70000 images.

00:44.220 --> 00:51.690
They are divided into 60000 chaining datasets and 10000 testing datasets and if all these images are

00:51.690 --> 00:57.430
28 by 20 a grayscale images if you guys are not familiar with how to present images and so on.

00:57.470 --> 01:01.010
And again this is not a kind of a computer vision per se course.

01:01.110 --> 01:04.560
We're going to show you kind of a quick overview how to present that image.

01:04.740 --> 01:10.500
So when we dig into the code we can fully understand how can we train the model even if you don't have

01:10.500 --> 01:17.230
any computer vision or any image for example analysis studies or knowledge before it.

01:17.400 --> 01:17.940
OK.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.080
So again we're going to build our pacifiers.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.260
We're going to take these images.

01:21.310 --> 01:24.500
OK classify them into 10 categories or 10 classes.

01:24.510 --> 01:25.480
Right.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.210
So for example this is kind of an actual images from the dataset.

01:29.220 --> 01:33.770
OK snapshots give you an idea of how easy or hard it is to classify images.

01:33.870 --> 01:36.800
So I guess can see this kind of a sneaker as guess can see here.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.850
This is kind of ankle boots so this is kind of a classified a class 10.

01:42.180 --> 01:42.720
OK.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.930
It's kind of a t shirt.

01:43.980 --> 01:44.390
OK.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.590
And this is kind of a bag.

01:45.630 --> 01:51.000
OK this actual true images that we got out of the amnesty fashion dresser.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.360
All right.

01:52.580 --> 01:58.350
You guys can see all these images are 28 pixels by 28 pixels and all of them are kind of a gray in a

01:58.350 --> 01:59.370
gray scale image.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.390
I'm going to see how going to present degrees can image moving forward.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.130
All right.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.390
So the first question is how can we what is an image or how can we present an image.

02:07.740 --> 02:13.540
So in very simple form again all these images are stored within the computer in just numbers.

02:13.560 --> 02:13.960
OK.

02:13.980 --> 02:14.470
All of it.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.100
Just a bunch of numbers.

02:16.380 --> 02:24.140
So it greyscale image simply present colors as as giving in a number from 0 to 255.

02:24.270 --> 02:24.700
OK.

02:24.900 --> 02:29.880
So if we wanted to represent a black line or a black dot that we're going to say OK we're going to put

02:30.150 --> 02:31.870
within a pixel number zero.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.800
So zero for example if I put it in a pixel that means the color is black.

02:35.850 --> 02:40.500
If we put two hundred and fifty five that indicate the color is white that means the color is kind of

02:40.560 --> 02:44.240
more right in between between zero and 255.

02:44.280 --> 02:50.510
Then we can have kind of a different gray shades of gray scales out of the color.

02:50.580 --> 02:51.380
OK.

02:51.930 --> 02:57.840
So as you can see here this kind of an image as you guys can see and next to it if we dig deeper you'll

02:57.900 --> 03:04.710
see that the image simply is bunch of pixels in each of these pixels is simply a number they can tell

03:04.710 --> 03:14.130
us OK this pixels white or black or gray very simply if it's black in 0 if it's white is 255 and if

03:14.130 --> 03:20.040
it is in-between it might be 100 maybe 80 it might be whatever depends on how the level of darkness

03:20.040 --> 03:20.760
of that gray.

03:20.790 --> 03:21.560
OK.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.350
So I can see this kind of 0 0.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.500
This is 40.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.640
This is 255 indicating white.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.650
This kind of an 80.

03:28.650 --> 03:33.170
This is 155 and as you increase the number it becomes a little bit more brighter.

03:33.230 --> 03:35.800
They are shifting towards white color.

03:35.820 --> 03:36.660
All right.

03:37.260 --> 03:41.820
So I again all these basically images are represented in a binary system or a binary format.

03:41.820 --> 03:45.490
When you say buy new format that means just zero on one so it's not in decimal format.

03:45.570 --> 03:49.170
So this is kind of the image in a decimal format.

03:49.170 --> 03:51.090
And this is the image in a binary format.

03:51.150 --> 03:56.010
So 0 we can it presented in an 8 bit big pixels by a bunch of zeros.

03:56.040 --> 04:01.860
OK if we want to do 255 That's like 1 1 1 1 1 all of them are ones in between.

04:01.860 --> 04:06.650
We can just put kind of a mix of zeros and ones that indicates a different number.

04:06.690 --> 04:12.060
OK so number 40 for example is 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.540
That's how you present the number 40.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.280
OK.

04:14.280 --> 04:18.390
Obviously if you guys are not familiar with binding numbers just you can just quickly look at it.

04:18.390 --> 04:22.520
Wikipedia or whatever you can just you know put different weights to these numbers so that's the trick

04:22.620 --> 04:22.900
here.

04:23.010 --> 04:24.720
The weight of that is two power zero.

04:24.870 --> 04:26.930
That's two part 1 to part 2 and so on.

04:27.060 --> 04:31.800
And that's how you come up with kind of conversion from binary values into decimal that is.

04:31.850 --> 04:32.840
All right.

04:32.850 --> 04:34.270
That's how we present the image.

04:34.530 --> 04:41.510
So in our case we actually have an image and these images are 28 by 28 OK you guys can see we have 28

04:41.520 --> 04:43.400
axles and 20 pixels.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.190
And again each of these pixels has a bunch of numbers.

04:46.200 --> 04:46.470
OK.

04:46.470 --> 04:49.810
This obviously will going to be zero.

04:49.890 --> 04:54.540
This is kind of the way this one is going to be let's say one or two hundred fifty five and in between

04:54.540 --> 04:58.460
you can have kind of a mix of you know like numbers ranging from 0 to 1 and 55.

04:58.580 --> 04:59.340
OK.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.640
So when we look at the data again when you jump into the ship the notebook when we look at the data

05:05.940 --> 05:08.890
you'll see that data is presented in kind of an Excel sheet.

05:08.970 --> 05:09.510
OK.

05:09.690 --> 05:13.020
And it's presented kind of each of the columns representing the pixels.

05:13.020 --> 05:18.540
So here we have the first column representing X and 1 2 3 and so on until pixel seven hundred and eighty

05:18.540 --> 05:23.940
four which is simply if you multiply 28 by 28 that matrix that will tell you the overall number which

05:23.940 --> 05:26.230
is seven hundred eighty four values.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.750
So that's kind of the pixels.

05:28.770 --> 05:31.010
So each row indicates an image.

05:31.020 --> 05:35.980
Is this the first image might be like a hat this bro.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.750
The next draw might be like a sneaker third draw and so on so forth.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.070
OK.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.650
That's kind of how the present hour images are dataset.

05:42.840 --> 05:43.390
All right.

05:43.530 --> 05:46.850
I hope it's not to like foreign language to you.

05:47.010 --> 05:52.740
Again if you guys don't have any experience at hand before in computer vision or like image analysis

05:53.010 --> 05:57.220
this kind of a quick kind of a crash course on how to present images in grayscale.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.040
All right.

05:59.040 --> 05:59.530
All right.

05:59.580 --> 06:02.060
And that's pretty much all we have for the section.

06:02.060 --> 06:04.030
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next section.
