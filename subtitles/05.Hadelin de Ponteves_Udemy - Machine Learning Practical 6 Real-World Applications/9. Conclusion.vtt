00:04.070 --> 00:06.230
So let's conclude this case study.

00:06.500 --> 00:13.190
So as we saw that machine learning techniques was able to classify tumors effectively into malignant

00:13.280 --> 00:17.550
and benign tumors with 97 percent accuracy which is really great.

00:17.560 --> 00:17.900
Right.

00:17.990 --> 00:24.230
And that's assuming that we don't have any deep learning or any features detection of whatsoever.

00:24.230 --> 00:30.220
We actually provided the machine learning with our features we created or features our own which is

00:30.230 --> 00:36.980
kind of on a very basic elementary technique because moving forward we can actually use directly our

00:36.980 --> 00:40.720
images using our deep learning strategies to actually look at the images directly.

00:40.910 --> 00:41.800
OK.

00:42.360 --> 00:42.790
All right.

00:42.890 --> 00:48.960
So the technique as we saw can rapidly evaluate breast masses and classify them in an automated fashion.

00:48.980 --> 00:52.850
We don't need an actual physician to be that obviously you know it's kind of a second opinion that would

00:52.850 --> 00:53.460
be great.

00:53.570 --> 00:57.920
But you know now we've seen the machine learning model that can simply look at the features look at

00:57.920 --> 01:04.190
the images and tell us OK this cancer is malignant or malignant and this cancer is benign right where

01:04.190 --> 01:05.800
the tumor is benign.

01:05.900 --> 01:12.350
So as part of the conclusion of part of the benefits of that study is that our early breast cancer determined

01:12.740 --> 01:17.070
detection can dramatically save lives especially in the developing world.

01:17.230 --> 01:18.370
OK.

01:18.890 --> 01:23.900
And again as we mentioned that can be further improved by combining computer vision and machine learning

01:23.900 --> 01:28.330
and deep learning techniques to classify cancer directly using tissue images.

01:28.730 --> 01:31.740
And just a quick overview of the results that we obtained.

01:31.790 --> 01:36.020
We actually reached on precision of 97 percent which is really great.

01:36.230 --> 01:41.210
And if we can see here this kind of confusion matrix that we achieved through found that we correctly

01:41.210 --> 01:44.690
classify 45 points we correctly classify 66 points.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.950
So in total classify the summation basically these two numbers.

01:48.140 --> 01:51.500
And here we misclassified only three samples right.

01:51.590 --> 01:57.480
And a key element as well here is the misclassification was actually when the class was zero.

01:57.650 --> 01:58.560
OK.

01:58.580 --> 02:00.160
Or the prediction was zero.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.180
However the target class was one.

02:02.340 --> 02:02.750
OK.

02:02.820 --> 02:08.570
So because they called Zero with the kids Menton malignant and one indicates benign which means our

02:08.630 --> 02:13.760
even our misclassified points would actually define what actually is OK it's a kind of a type 1 error

02:14.090 --> 02:22.820
indicating that OK we didn't say that patient for example is didn't have cancer and he had one actually

02:22.820 --> 02:28.400
the patient we said that the patient or we we assumed that the patient the prediction the patient said

02:28.400 --> 02:30.080
that the patient has cancer.

02:30.230 --> 02:32.190
However he was just OK he was just fine.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.140
He just had a benign tumor.

02:34.310 --> 02:38.950
I hope you guys enjoy that case study and let's build a cancer free world.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.240
Hope you guys enjoyed it and see in the next case study.
