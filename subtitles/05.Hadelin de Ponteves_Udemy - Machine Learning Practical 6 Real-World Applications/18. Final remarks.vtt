Hi everybody and welcome to our last beat you do in the last videos we try to solve one of e-commerce

00:15.340 --> 00:23.830
biggest problems credit card fraud that section 4 that we used our real data set with real credit card

00:23.840 --> 00:27.960
transactions that had been anonymize for us.

00:27.960 --> 00:33.580
We came to the conclusion that we had to be not Lessie fire a system that could tell apart from the

00:33.580 --> 00:37.530
low end transactions from non fraudulent ones.

00:37.570 --> 00:44.410
We will do our best to try to avoid that anyone uses our stolen credit cards in our website but at the

00:44.410 --> 00:48.360
same time we will try not to disturb our regular users.

00:49.860 --> 00:56.560
From our exploration we said that we would need to deal with a highly unbalanced data set.

00:56.820 --> 01:04.500
That means that the vast majority of Horten sections would be none fraudulent ones and that just makes

01:04.500 --> 01:12.060
it harder for our classifier to learn from our training that we saw what support Buckton machines or

01:12.150 --> 01:13.800
SBM swar.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.640
Also we saw what the solution juries were as well as random forest.

01:18.660 --> 01:24.290
Another machine learning algorithms we use so gets learned by the library.

01:24.330 --> 01:27.200
So we didn't have to program ourselves.

01:27.790 --> 01:34.200
That allowed us to come to our solution with just a few lines of code but we also tried to solve this

01:34.200 --> 01:36.200
problem using the plumbing.

01:36.330 --> 01:44.100
We built a stack of dense layers we saw that dense layers will build just with the combination of perceptions

01:44.190 --> 01:48.000
using over functions and activation functions.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.480
For this part we used to sort of flow in combination with girls to try to solve the problem.

01:54.090 --> 02:00.420
With that we could create and train our own deep narrow lead work again with only just a few lines of

02:00.420 --> 02:01.790
code.

02:01.830 --> 02:08.730
We also plotted our confusion matrix as we saw that accuracy wasn't a good enough measure to see how

02:08.730 --> 02:10.980
our model was performing.

02:11.370 --> 02:17.370
We talked about other interesting metrics such as regal that then give us a better idea of what's going

02:17.370 --> 02:19.860
on with our transactions.

02:20.250 --> 02:26.190
Finally wheels of light and there are some pulling on world some techniques we found especially good

02:26.190 --> 02:29.700
results using Smout oversampling technique.

02:29.880 --> 02:34.790
We found that we could give a delay Well almost every single fraudulent transaction.

02:34.990 --> 02:41.000
And the vast majority of that non fraudulent ones aswell.

02:41.050 --> 02:42.200
That's it for now.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.820
I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did.

02:45.110 --> 02:46.800
My name is USA.

02:47.010 --> 02:50.200
And you can always reach me from my company's web page.

02:50.210 --> 02:56.010
My big day I hope to see you again in other videos soon.
