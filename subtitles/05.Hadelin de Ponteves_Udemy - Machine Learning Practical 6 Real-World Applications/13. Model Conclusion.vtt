Hello everybody will come back.

00:03.300 --> 00:09.010
And this video we're going to finalize our script by just combining the predictions that we had with

00:09.010 --> 00:14.430
our actual values and these are the identifiers pretty much mapping every user to whatever production

00:14.460 --> 00:17.240
we did for the user.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.770
We have done the same in previous studies.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.700
So let's get start first.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.920
What we do is we create a final bearable.

00:25.960 --> 00:33.180
We're going to call it final results final results well.

00:33.580 --> 00:42.160
And this is going to be a concatenation of two columns PD that concat and we're going to concatenate

00:42.820 --> 00:52.720
the Y test which is a column of esign and fire user identifier which is our entreaties.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.120
Now we're going to do it along the axis equals 1 meaning column axes.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.120
So that makes each of these a color.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.140
Finally we add drop in cases A's.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.290
Is that the case for us.

01:05.290 --> 01:08.180
But I always added as a safeguard.

01:08.710 --> 01:17.100
So after we run these We're going to create the final column which is going to be final results that

01:17.110 --> 01:22.770
predictions and it's going to be the predictions that we are we have made.

01:23.440 --> 01:27.870
And of course they are just pretty great.

01:28.390 --> 01:33.620
And finally we're going to just reordered these results in a way that makes more sense.

01:33.820 --> 01:36.430
So we can find a resource for itself.

01:36.580 --> 01:43.660
We are going to do with a new order of tolerance and it's going to be 450 in 380 which is the user identifier

01:45.430 --> 01:50.050
e-zine which is whether or not the user actually you sign in real life.

01:50.050 --> 01:56.710
And finally the predictions so run these three lines and that's it.

01:56.800 --> 02:03.790
If we take a look at a console we look at final results and this is how it looks.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.630
So scroll up a little bit and here you go.

02:05.830 --> 02:14.600
So the entry ID is the user identifier is esign is 1 or 0 depending on the predictions here are 1.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.500
So the predicate first Dorian Gray the second one is correct.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.910
They are once incorrect correct.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.950
Correct correct correct right.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.560
Correct.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.430
And so and so forth.

02:24.540 --> 02:29.730
Well we know that the accuracy of four days is on the level of 63 percent.

02:29.890 --> 02:31.340
So that's pretty good.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.670
Anyways that said we have finalized our model.

02:33.670 --> 02:37.100
We have mapped our model predictions to our users.

02:37.150 --> 02:42.140
We have applied research and done everything we can do to clean the data and we have refined the matter

02:42.700 --> 02:46.830
so we can present this to our higher ups and liberty in the future.

02:47.470 --> 02:49.350
Thank you so much for watching.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.950
It was very nice to bring this set of projects to you.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.720
I'm going to keep working on making more projects like this.

02:55.940 --> 03:01.690
But the next video we're going to touch on the final conclusions on this project and in our case study

03:02.590 --> 03:05.710
have a great day and thank you very much for watching.
