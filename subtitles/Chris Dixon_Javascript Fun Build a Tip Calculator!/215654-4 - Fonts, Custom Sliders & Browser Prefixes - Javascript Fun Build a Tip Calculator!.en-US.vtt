00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.715
Let's continue on with our styling for this project,

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:08.940
by moving on to creating a custom range slider.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.965
At the moment, if we take a look at the project at the stage, what we're currently at.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:17.265
This makes use of the browser default range,

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:21.030
and it doesn't look too good or fit in with our current project.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.005
So let's talk about how we can create our own custom slider.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:29.790
First, we need to set the appearance of our current range sliders to be none,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.290
to remove all of the default styling.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.230
Then we can go ahead and create our own with some custom CSS.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.450
However, the browser support is not

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.335
perfect for some of the techniques which we are going to use.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:46.535
We can get around this by using vendor prefixes.

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:50.860
Adding a vendor prefix to a CSS property is a way

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.760
to make use of certain CSS experimental properties,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.370
and also properties which are not yet currently fully supported in particular browsers.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.240
If we scroll down, we see the main prefixes which we can use.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.250
The first one is webkit,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.530
which applies to all of these browsers,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.915
such as Chrome and Safari.

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:13.719
We then have the moz prefix,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.510
which applies to Firefox browsers.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.460
We can also target older versions of Opera and also Internet Explorer too.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.080
But for this particular project,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.955
I'm going to focus on these first two.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:29.960
All we need to do is to find a certain CSS property,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.830
such as transition, and then add the moz or webkit prefix inference.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.740
Using these, we'll learn to tell the browser that we're happy to use these,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.925
and give these a try before they are fully implemented in the browser.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:49.655
So to do this, we need to target both of our inputs with the type of range.

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:52.610
So first of all, we have this one just here.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.795
Let's add a class of range.

00:01:56.795 --> 00:02:02.160
I'm going to also to do the same for our second range slider, which is just below.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.670
This means that our styling will apply to both of our range inputs.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.745
So let's start just below our total.

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:16.055
We can select our range.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:20.540
The first thing we need to do is to remove the default range slider.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.885
We can do this by setting appearance to be none.

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:28.810
The appearance property is not yet fully supported in webkit browsers.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.725
So we also need to add the webkit prefix in front of this.

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:37.355
If we now save this and go to our project, reload.

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:40.885
We see that this has removed the progress bar from behind.

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:45.260
We will also move on to styling this form slider very soon.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.255
For now, we're just going to concentrate on the actual slider.

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:53.480
So first of all, we can set the width to be 100 percent.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.010
So this is the full width of our container.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.840
The height of eight pixels,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.655
and we can also set the background color of our slider.

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:06.440
I want to make this light gray,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.330
which is the value of a eee.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.955
We can begin to see our slider is now taking shape.

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:18.320
Let's now add some margin to the very top to give us some spacing from the text,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.205
and also a border-radius.

00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:27.785
So first of all, the margin on the top of 1.2 rem,

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:33.510
and also a border-radius of 0.3 rem.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.890
The next thing we can target when this is active or

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.985
clicked on is the border color which goes around the outside.

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:46.795
We can select this with the outline color,

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:50.995
and change the default value to be any color which we like.

00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:56.540
I'm going to go for a marching value which we used in the linear gradient. So 5bceae.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.530
Refresh. Now, if we click on any of these sliders,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.655
we now see this green color.

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:07.690
The next step is to target this little circle,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.165
which is called the slider film.

00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:13.180
We can again do this in the CSS.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.340
So let's targets our range section.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.235
Then if we use the double colons just like this,

00:04:20.235 --> 00:04:22.935
this is a pseudo-element.

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:27.790
A pseudo-element will allow us to target a particular part of an element.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.640
So for example, if we were targeting a paragraph of text,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.450
we would have pseudo-elements available to

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.235
select the first letter or even the first line.

00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:40.900
But since we are working with our range,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.290
we're going to target the slider film.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.650
Specifically, we're going to target the webkit versions.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.290
So this would be for Chrome and Safari browsers.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.480
Only value which we need is slider film.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.835
We'll also target the Firefox browser in just a moment.

00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:00.040
So like we did with the range,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.480
we're going to set the appearance to be none.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.725
We then need to set the width and heights of our little film slider.

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:12.760
So let's go for the width, 2.2 rem.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.090
The height, which is also going to be the same.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.800
If we set the border-radius to be 50 percent,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.720
this will make it the full circle.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.765
Let's take a look at this.

00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:34.685
We don't see it yet, because we need to also assign a background color.

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:40.580
I almost want to set this to be a color which we used before in the gradient.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.085
We now see our film slider.

00:05:43.085 --> 00:05:47.400
Another thing we are going to do is to change the cursor to be a pointer.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.000
There we go. Next. Let's see how it looks inside of a different browser.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.860
I'm going to go for Firefox.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.075
But of course you don't need to follow along with this step, if you don't want to.

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:07.115
So inside the tip calculator,

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:09.950
let's open up the index.html.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.794
We see that at present we just have the default styling for the background.

00:06:14.794 --> 00:06:18.250
We don't see the film styling just yet.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.795
So let's fix this by creating a section for the moz range film.

00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:26.779
Currently, we are only targeting the webkit version.

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:32.055
So let's copy this and paste it in below.

00:06:32.055 --> 00:06:35.645
Then inside here, rather than having the webkit version,

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.940
which I used to be the most prefix,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.635
and rather than slider film,

00:06:39.635 --> 00:06:42.310
this is called the range film.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.995
Save this and reload the Firefox browser.

00:06:45.995 --> 00:06:49.100
I see the film has been changed.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.530
So a couple of things to note here.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.775
We see there's a border around the film, inside this browser.

00:06:55.775 --> 00:06:59.340
So we can set the border to be none.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.000
This will then remove this.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.080
We also don't need to include the webkit appearance of none for this browser.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.205
One thing we can improve on when we click and make this active,

00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:13.965
is this dotted line around the outside.

00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:18.530
The way to do this inside of Firefox is by targeting the range slider.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.115
Again, you see the double colons for the pseudo-elements,

00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:25.690
and the elements which we want to target is going to be moz.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.970
Use the moz prefix for the Firefox browser.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.695
Then the name of the elements calls in this is the focus outer.

00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:37.145
We can set the border to be a value of 0,

00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:40.670
refresh, and this has now been removed.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.430
So these browser prefixes are something to be

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.250
careful of when working with multiple browsers,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.655
and also anything which is not yet fully supported.

00:07:49.655 --> 00:07:53.570
So this is our customer range slider now complete.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.445
Just one thing to quickly note,

00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:58.160
when we scroll back up to the range section, here,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.490
we're targeting the appearance for only the webkit browsers.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.220
You may be wondering why we haven't targeted the Mozilla versions too.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.679
Well, this is because, for this particular appearance property,

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:13.745
Firefox browsers will also respect the webkit versions too.

00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:16.390
This is for compatibility reasons.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.650
The last piece of styling I'm going to apply,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.650
let's close this Firefox browser,

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.220
is to apply some Google Fonts.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.640
So let's do a search for Google Fonts and head over to fonts.google.com.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.540
I'm going to use a font called roboto.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.490
So let's do a search for this.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.015
This is the one we needed just here.

00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:40.669
To include this into our project,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.450
we can select the font-weight,

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.315
and also if we want an italic version too.

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:49.115
I'm going to go for the light 300 version,

00:08:49.115 --> 00:08:54.245
the medium, and also a bold version too.

00:08:54.245 --> 00:08:57.860
To include these, we need to click on the embed link.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.750
Copy the link to the style.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.960
This goes into our index.html.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.235
I'll paste this inside of the head section just above

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:13.695
our custom stylesheets. Save this file.

00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:19.080
The next thing to do is to also set the font family inside of our stylesheet.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.100
So copy the font-family property.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.995
Open up our styles.css,

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:27.655
and we can apply this for all of our project,

00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:31.040
inside the root HTML elements.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.975
Refresh the browser.

00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:36.255
Our font has now taken effect.

00:09:36.255 --> 00:09:39.255
We can also set the default font weights.

00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:42.120
I want to go for 300.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.165
Now, our styling looks a lot more like the finished version.

00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:48.550
Just to finish this project styling off.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.110
It's pretty hard to tell from our input just

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.215
here because the fonts are not too dissimilar,

00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:58.315
but by default, an input won't inherit the font family.

00:09:58.315 --> 00:10:01.565
To do this, we need to scroll down to our input,

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:03.815
the type of number.

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:07.330
We can even set the font family just like a booth.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.920
Or we can set this to be, inherit.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.715
Reload the browser, and this will now take effect.

00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:18.470
So this is now the end of the styling section for our tip calculator.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.490
Next, we're going to move on to make this function by using JavaScript.
