Hello everyone and welcome to despite an editorial in this video.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,410
We are going to complete maybe the most exciting part of the whole distributed training project we are

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:19,230
going to dig through with our mole to multiple use or to be more specific to multiple devices superiors

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,070
or peers depending on what you have in your P.C. here.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,930
I copy the model from previous videos.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:34,080
The only difference I made here is to rename it from model normal to model distributed we had to make

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,780
that change so we can have some way to distinguish between models since they are the same.

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,020
The most exciting part of these distributed trainings strategy is that it is effortless to implement

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,960
in a similar manner when implemented mirror strategy.

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:59,630
This only single line of code to distribute our model what we are going to do now is to use this newly

11
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:06,810
created model and distributed to multiple use NCP use that we have on our disposal.

12
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,480
It is very straightforward process.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:18,020
Let's start by defining the scope right with distribute which is the name of our variable for our strategy

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,120
and followed by scope and column.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,470
Now we have to indent our model so it belongs to the scope that we defined by doing so it became the

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,720
part of the scope and also distributed to multiple abuse executed the cell and our model was defined

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,360
and well-prepared to be trained on multiple pillars or multiple devices.

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,300
Congratulations on coming this far and learning how to distribute any model in very easy and simple

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,190
way.

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,610
And that's it for now.

21
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,140
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section.

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,260
Otherwise I seen the next tutorial.
