Hello everyone and welcome to this biking tutorial.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,520
In the previous video we talked about the fine tuning methodology and how to perform it.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,940
It is pretty straightforward and in this video we are going to build on top of what we learned in the

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,920
previous one by compiling the model that we um throws a few layers from.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,580
We don't have to specify a new model.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,430
We have to recompile the model and it will be ready the compiling method is the same as before.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,960
So it copied and pasted the code here.

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,320
As you can see we are using the same optimizer what we used with the same learning grade for our loss.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,420
We are still using binary codes entropy and for our metrics accuracy and that's it.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,330
The same step execute the cell and our model for fine tuning is ready to be used in the next video.

11
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,810
We are going to fine tune or to train this model.

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,010
We defeat the generator function for now.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,520
If you have any questions or comments please buzz them in the comments section.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,440
Otherwise I'll see in the next tutorial.
