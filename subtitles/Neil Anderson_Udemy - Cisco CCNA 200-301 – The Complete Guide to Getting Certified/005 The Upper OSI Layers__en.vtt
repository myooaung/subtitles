00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.070
In this lecture, you'll learn about the upper layers of the OSI model.

2
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.300
That's the upper three layers,

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:21.480
5, 6, and 7. Network engineers don't typically work directly with those upper three layers of

4
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.920
the OSI model.

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.950
They're more relevant to application developers, but we still need to know what they do.

6
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.940
And for the exam, we need to know the definitions of each of the layers as well.

7
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.640
It's quite likely that you'll be tested on that.

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.260
So in this lecture, that's primarily what I'm going to be doing is giving you the Cisco definitions,

9
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.530
so you'll be ready for the exam. Information included in the upper layers would include the Message Body

10
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.220
and the Subject Line in an email message for example.

11
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.380
So let's look at the three top layers starting with Layer 7,

12
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.080
the Application Layer.

13
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.470
This provides network services to the applications of the end user.

14
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.140
It differs from the other layers in that it does not provide services to any other OSI layer.

15
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.880
The application layer establishes the availability of intended communication partners. Intended communication

16
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.870
partners would be the host that

17
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.420
this host is communicating with. If you remember from the lecture, before we were discussing the OSI

18
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.720
model, you saw that straight line between two hosts at the same layer of the OSI Stack. So the application

19
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.430
layer, it establishes the availability of intended communication partners, not just straight line going

20
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.000
to the other host. It then synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and

21
00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.870
control of data integrity. Data integrity means checking that data has not been altered or corrupted

22
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.130
in transit.

23
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.030
The next layer is Layer 6, the Presentation Layer. This ensures that the information that is sent at

24
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:18.000
the Application Layer of one system is readable by the Application Layer of another system. The Presentation

25
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.390
Layer can translate among multiple data format using a common format, for example, it might need to

26
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.680
do this for computers with different encoding schemes. And the last layer of our upper layers is Layer 5,

27
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.000
the Session Layer.

28
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.900
This establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between two communicating hosts. The Session Layer also

29
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.950
synchronizes dialogue between the Presentation Layer of the two hosts and manages data exchange.

30
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.730
For example, we might have web servers which have got many users that are using that web server.

31
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.810
So, in that case, we would have multiple incoming sessions.

32
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.040
The Session Layer keeps track of all of those.

33
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.890
It also offers efficient data transfer, Class of Service (CoS), which is similar to efficient data transfer,

34
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.310
and exception reporting of upper layer problems.

35
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.990
Okay, so that's the definitions of the upper layers.

36
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.670
We'll go into the definitions of the bottom four layers in the next lecture.
