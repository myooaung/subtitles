WEBVTT
1
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:14.890
So, now, we're looking at the web packet that the Host A was holding before being able to compose it

2
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.160
as far as Layer 4,

3
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.930
but it couldn't put the Layer 3 IP header on there because it didn't know the destination IP address

4
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.310
yet. It's just received that from the DNS Server,

5
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.439
so it can carry on composing that packet and knows that the destination is 10.10.12.10,

6
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.760
and it sees that it's on a different IP subnet,

7
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.500
so it knows that the destination MAC address is its default gateway, which it already knows is at

8
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.920
4444.5555.6666.

9
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.800
It will then put that web traffic onto the physical wire.

10
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.910
So here's our HTTP Get Request, the source MAC is 1111.2222.3333.

11
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.890
The destination MAC is the default gateway 4444.5555.6666. Source IP is its own IP address,

12
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.540
10.10.10.10, and destination IP is the Web Server at 10.10.12.10. That will hit

13
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.350
Switch 1, which will send the packet to Router A, which it already has in its MAC address table.

14
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.570
The packet will come into Router A. It sees that the destination IP address is 10.10.12.10,

15
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.950
and in our example, Router A

16
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.190
does not have any interfaces in the 10.10.12.0/24 subnet.

17
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.300
So, in that case, it's going to need a route to get there. The route can be either statically configured by an administrator

18
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.630
or learned dynamically through a routing protocol, which also would be configured by the administrator.

19
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.390
We're going to cover how to configure static route and routing protocols in later lectures.

20
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.560
So for our example, let's say that the administrator has already configured a static route for

21
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.270
10.10.12.0/24,

22
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.450
with the next hop address of 10.10.11.2, which is on the next hop

23
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.820
router. Router A has an Ethernet interface in the 10.10.11.0 subnet.

24
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.040
It doesn't know of the MAC address for the next hop address of 10.10.11.2 yet, though.

25
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.700
So, it will hold the HTTP packet from Host A, and it will send an ARP request out that interface in the

26
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.360
10.10.11.0 subnet looking for 10.10.11.2.

27
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.250
So there goes the ARP request,

28
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.670
it's from 10.10.11.1, saying it's looking for 10.10.11.2,

29
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.960
"What's your MAC address?"

30
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.360
It comes from a source MAC of 5555.6666.7777, going to the Layer 2 broadcast address of

31
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.870
FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. The ARP request will hit Router B's interface at 10.10.11.2, and it will see that

32
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.570
the ARP request is for itself. It will send a unicast ARP reply back to Router 1. While it's doing

33
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.300
that, Router B will add an entry for Router A, mapping the IP address 10.10.11.1

34
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.830
to MAC address 5555.6666.7777 to its ARP cache. So the ARP reply goes back, it says "Hey, I'm

35
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.500
10.10.11.2, and here's my MAC address of 6666.7777.8888, going to the destination

36
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.420
MAC of 5555.6666.7777." Router A will get my information, and it can know forward the HTTP packet

37
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:41.950
it was holding to Router B. So, it's the original HTTP Get Requests from Host A. The source IP is always

38
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.040
the same, so it's still 10.10.10.10 on Host A, going to the destination IP of

39
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.580
10.10.12.10 on the Web Server. But the source and destination MAC addresses will get updated for this

40
00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.700
hop, so the source MAC is 5555.6666.77777, the destination MAC is 6666.7777.8888. Router B will

41
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.720
receive the HTTP packet and see that the destination IP address is 10.10.12.10. Router B

42
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.940
has an interface into the subnet of 10.10.12.0/24, so it knows the destination should

43
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.870
be available out that port. But it doesn't know the MAC address of 10.10.12.10 yet, so it

44
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.220
will hold the HTTP packet and send an ARP request out that 10.10.12.1 interface. So, there

45
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.790
goes the ARP request. It's from 10.10.12.1 looking for 10.10.12.10,

46
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.130
asking for the MAC address. It comes from a source MAC of 7777.8888.9999, going to the Layer 2

47
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.860
broadcast of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. The ARP request will be received by Switch 2. Switch 2 will add an

48
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.160
entry in its MAC address table mapping Router B's MAC address of 7777.8888.9999 to Port 1.

49
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.100
And it will then flood the ARP request broadcast traffic out all ports apart from the one it was received on,

50
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.440
so that will be sent out of Port 2. The ARP request will hit the Web Server's interface at 10.10.12.10.

51
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.580
The Web Server will process the ARP request and see it is for itself. The Web Server will then send

52
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.370
a unicast ARP reply back to Router B. And it will add an entry for Router B, mapping IP address of

53
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.320
10.10.12.1 to the MAC address of 77777.88888.9999 to it's ARP cache. That's its

54
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.460
default gateway, so it will use that whenever it needs to send traffic to another IP subnet. So the ARP

55
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.440
reply will go back, saying, "I'm 10.10.12.10.

56
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.060
Here's my MAC address of 2222.3333.4444 going to the destination MAC of 7777.8888.9999."

57
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.130
Switch 2 will get that and add an entry to its MAC address table, mapping the Web Server's

58
00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.380
MAC address of 2222.3333.4444 to Port 2. And Switch 2 will then send the ARP reply out only Port 1,

59
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.510
which Router B is plugged into, which it already has in its MAC address table.

60
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.090
So, there goes the ARP reply unchanged from the Web Server. Router B

61
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.270
will get that, and add an entry for the Web Server, mapping IP address 10.10.12.10

62
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.000
to MAC address 2222.3333.4444 to its ARP cache. And then, Router B will send the HTTP

63
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.200
Request it was holding to the Web Server. So again, it's the original source IP on Host A,

64
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.600
10.10.10.10. The original destination IP in the Web Server of 10.10.12.10. The MAC

65
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.850
addresses will get updated with the source MAC of 7777.8888.9999 and the destination MAC

66
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:49.010
of 2222.3333.4444. Switch 2 will send that HTTP Request out only Port 2, which the Web Server is plugged

67
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:56.150
into, and which the switch already has in its MAC address table. And finally, the HTTP Get Request will

68
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:04.610
reach the Web Server. So, it comes in on the physical wire. The Web Server will look at the Layer 2 header

69
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.980
and see that the destination MAC address is 2222.3333.4444, which is itself, so it will carry on

70
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.290
processing it. It will look at the Layer 3 IP header and see the destination IP address is

71
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:22.790
10.10.12.10, which again is itself. It will carry on processing it. It will look at the Layer 4, Transport

72
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:29.600
header, see that it's TCP, Port 80. So, it knows it's web traffic. It will then carry on up through the Session,

73
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:38.700
the Presentation, and the Application Layer, and the web traffic has now reached the Web Server. Okay,

74
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:46.340
the ARP and MAC address tables are already built, so any subsequent packets in either direction will flow

75
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:55.940
without any need for ARP requests or switch flooding. So, let's say the second packet in the session goes

76
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:02.810
from Host A, so it will send the HTTP Get Request. It comes from a source MAC of 1111.2222.3333, going

77
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:10.040
to a destination MAC of its default gateway 4444.5555.6666. The source IP 10.10.10.10, destination

78
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:17.300
IP of 10.10.12.10. It already has the destination MAC address in its ARP cache, so it can

79
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:26.990
just immediately send the packet. That will get to Router A, which also already has everything in its ARP

80
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:34.190
cache, so the HTTP Get Request is still from source IP 10.10.10.10, going to the Web

81
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:40.340
Server at 10.10.12.10. The MAC addresses will be updated to be relevant for this hop

82
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:46.190
which was a source MAC of 5555.6666.7777, a destination MAC of 6666.7777.8888. That will

83
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:56.440
hit Router B, and again, it's got an interface in the subnet of 10.10.12.0, so it knows

84
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.390
what interface to send out of. Source IP remains unchanged, 10.10.10.10, destination IP is

85
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.640
still 10.10.12.10. Source MAC, it gets updated to 7777.8888.9999. The

86
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:14.870
destination MAC gets updated to 2222.3333.4444, and we've got traffic going end to end. Okay, so we

87
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:24.380
got there. We covered the complete life of a packet from end to end, and you now have a really good knowledge

88
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:31.490
of how IP networking works. Honestly, there's really not much more to it than that. What we're going to be

89
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:39.890
covering in the following lectures are the different features and functions that are available on our

90
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.150
routers and switches to support that and how to configure them.
