00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.570
In this lecture, you'll learn about IPv6 global unicast addresses. The different types of addresses

2
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.430
we've got in IPv6 are global unicast, unique local and link local.

3
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.610
We'll cover unique local and link local in a later lecture in this section. This lecture, we're going

4
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.619
to focus on global unicast. So global unicast,

5
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.680
the adresses are similar to IPv4 public addresses. Meaning not private addresses.

6
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.270
It is an IPv4 public address or it's publicly reachable that was assigned by the Internet authorities.

7
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.520
So global unicast addresses in IPv6 are equivalent to that.

8
00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.350
They're assigned to an individual host and have global reachability everywhere on the Internet unless

9
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.380
blocked by security policy like on a firewall.

10
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.900
And they're assigned from the range 2000::/3.

11
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.070
The Internet authorities assigned blocks from the overall 2000::/3 range to different

12
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.070
organizations that need to communicate on the Internet.

13
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:31.450
And a common assignment for a company is a /48 block. For example,

14
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.010
2001:10:10::/48. So the example is a company has applied through its service provider for a block

15
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.300
of IP addresses and they were given that. So normally it will be a /48, but a smaller or a larger

16
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.650
size block can be assigned depending on the size of the company.

17
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.350
So larger company can get more addresses.

18
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.080
A smaller company will get less addresses.

19
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:06.100
And if you're using IPv6 at home, just yourself, individually, you'll be given a /64, which

20
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.190
will be assigned by DHCP typically.

21
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:16.930
The reason that an individual would be assigned to /64 is that the IPv6 standards state

22
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.830
that addresses aassigned to individual hosts should use a /64 mask.

23
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.180
So it doesn't just applied to you at home.

24
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.150
Every organization everywhere as well.

25
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.170
Even when they're using a large block of addresses for their individual hosts, every individual host

26
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.400
should use a /64.

27
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.790
It's not like an IPv4 where we can be using a /24, or a /16, or a /30 on point to

28
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.110
point links, for example.

29
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.560
Everywhere we're expected to use a /64.

30
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.140
Now the IPv6 address is 128 bits long.

31
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.590
So /64 splits in half.

32
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.290
Half of the address is going to be the network portion and the other half is the host portion.

33
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.270
And if a company is assigned a /48 address by the Internet authoritiy, which is common and uses

34
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.440
/64 host addresses, which is what they're supposed to do, that leaves 16 bits that the company

35
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.570
can use to assign to its internal subnets through its different links.

36
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.410
For example, if the company was assigned 2001:10:10::/48, by the

37
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:44.890
Internet authorities, then that leaves subnets 2001:10:10:0::/64

38
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.600
2001:10:10:FFFF::/64 to be available to be assigned to its internal network segments.

39
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.460
So they've got 16 bits that they can play with for dividing up the largest, the larger /48 block

40
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.720
into smaller subnet. 16 bits means 65535 possible subnets.

41
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.320
That should be plenty for most situations.

42
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.030
That also leaves us 64 bits left over for the host address.

43
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.779
And you can see the number on the slide here.

44
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.200
It's a huge amount of host that you could have in the one subnet.

45
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.050
You're never going to get up to anywhere near that kind of number.

46
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.790
And if you look at the last bullet point in the slide here, you can see a common way that the IPv6

47
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.450
address is going to be divided up, that the first three hextets are the overall /48 block that was

48
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.560
assigned to the company. The next, the fourth hextet, is going to be divided up into different subnets

49
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.600
and the last four hextets are what is assigned to the individual host.

50
00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:01.880
So we've got an example here where a company has been assigned a /48 block,

51
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.030
2001:DB8:0::/48. So that fourth hextet is what we're going to use for each of their different subnets.

52
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:18.110
And you can see the example here on the link between R1 and R2, that subnet 2001:DB8:0:1::/64.

53
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.010
The link between R2 and R3 is 2001:DB8:0:2::/64.

54
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:32.840
If you look below R1 on its fa2/0 interface, that's 2001:DB8:0:0::/64 and on the link

55
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.670
going down from R3 on its fa2/0 interface, that's 2001:DB8:0:3::/64.

56
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.890
So you can see that here, first organization,

57
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:51.360
all of our IPv6 addresses everywhere begin with 2001:DB8:0. That was the /48 block

58
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.150
that they were assigned.

59
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.270
The next hextets, well the first subnet is 0.

60
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.580
The next subnet is 1. The next one is 2 and so on, and so on.

61
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:09.500
They're still going to make sure that when they allocate those subnets, that they do it in contiguous

62
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.260
blocks because that's going to help with the summarization that they're going to configure on their

63
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.920
routers.

64
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.890
OK.

65
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.300
Next thing is we're going to have to configure IP addresses on the hosts as well.

66
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:32.060
So on that link between R1 and R2, on the R1 side, on its fa0/0 interface, we give

67
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:41.870
it IP address 2001:DB8:0:1::/64, which is the subnet and in the host address, 0:0:0:1.

68
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.260
On the link between R2 and R3, on the R3 side on its fa1/0 interface,

69
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:55.700
we've given it IP Address 2001:DB8:0:2:0:0:0:1.

70
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.960
So you can see how the IPv6 address works here.

71
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.700
We're also going to take that on a stage as well because we're going to do the address shortening.

72
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.010
So we're going to remove that contiguous blocks of zeros.

73
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.230
So again, that same interface on R1, fa0/0 interface,

74
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:23.660
it gets IP address 2001:DB8:0:1::1/64.

75
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:31.100
That's just another way of writing the address that you saw earlier where we've stripped out those contiguous

76
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.080
blocks of zeros and we just write it as a ::1 at the end.

77
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.690
So that was the address on R1. The address on R3 on its

78
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.900
fa1/0 interface is 2001:DB8:0:2 for the subnet,

79
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.070
::1.

80
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:55.190
If you have a look on the other side to that link on R2's fa1/0 interface,

81
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:04.250
it would get IP address 2001:DB8:0:2 because it's on the same subnet, and then

82
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:10.130
::2. So the host portion of the address is different and that we're going to have connectivity

83
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.520
between all of our different hosts that you see in the diagram there.

84
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:23.530
Now, using a /64 for all network subnets, including point-to-point links and loopback addresses,

85
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.560
can seem wasteful and in IPv4, you don't do that

86
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:35.260
definitely, if you were using actual public IP addresses. In IPv4, it's pretty standard that we use

87
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:41.470
a /30 four point-to-point links because that gives us an address on one side, an address on

88
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:49.150
the other side. For loopback addresses, it's standard that we use a /32. But in IPv6, you don't

89
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.860
do that.

90
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.000
You always used /64 everywhere.

91
00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.820
Old school engineers can have a bit of a problem with this because we've had it drummed into us for

92
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.070
years that we don't waste the addresses.

93
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:10.240
But for IPv6, the official line of thought for me is, that there is that many addresses, that it doesn't

94
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.660
matter if you if you waste huge chunks of them.

95
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.400
So it's recommended, use /64 everywhere.

96
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:25.270
That simplifies the overall addressing plan and it also enables the use of EUI-64 addresses that you're

97
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.340
going to learn about later in this section.

98
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:36.760
So how do we actually configure this? First thing that we need to do is to enable IPv6 routing with

99
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.660
the IPv6 unicast in command. But actually, it's probably about time to wrap up this lecture.

100
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:48.970
So let's do the configuration in the next lecture where I would also show you how to do it in the lab.
