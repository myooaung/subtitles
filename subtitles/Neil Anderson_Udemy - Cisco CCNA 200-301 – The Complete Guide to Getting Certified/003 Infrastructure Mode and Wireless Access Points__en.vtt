00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:14.070
In this lecture, you'll learn about wireless infrastructure mode and access points, and it really

2
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.040
helps to understand how the lines work if you understand the terminology from the eight to 11 standard.

3
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
So I'll be going through the standard terms in this lecture.

4
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.729
Wireless access points provide connectivity between wireless stations and between the wireless and wired

5
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:33.300
networks.

6
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.020
And when your wireless devices are communicating through a wireless access point, they're operating

7
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.820
in infrastructure mode.

8
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.580
Wireless is half duplex, meaning only one device can communicate at a time.

9
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.000
So in that regard, your wireless access points operate similarly to hobs.

10
00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.640
Here's a picture of a typical wireless access point from Cisco, your wireless APIs can have either

11
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.260
internal or external antennas.

12
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.830
You can see the one year internal and it can also be designed for indoor or outdoor use.

13
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.560
OK, first piece of terminology is best, the basic services.

14
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.810
So an access point, centralizes oxygen and control over a group of wireless devices.

15
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.390
Those devices under wireless settings make up a B, as you remember from the last lecture when we covered

16
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.830
ad hoc mode, it was called an IBS, an independent basic service set because in not peer-to-peer network,

17
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.970
the devices were operating independently with an access point.

18
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.400
Well, now we do have an access point.

19
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.960
So it's not independent anymore.

20
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.220
It's just the VSS Basic Service.

21
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.400
Next terminology is, yes, the distribution system through your wireless app provides connectivity

22
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.160
to the Wired network for the wireless clients, and it's a distribution system that connects the wireless

23
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.230
access points to the Wired network.

24
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.460
So in the example here, you can see our app is connected to the switch here.

25
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.949
That's where it's getting connectivity to the Wired network.

26
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.770
So the switch is known as a distribution system.

27
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.660
Best idea as a basic service set identifier devices within the basic services are identified by verbs

28
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.860
aside, and that is based on their Mac address.

29
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.490
You see, for example, here are wireless app has got Mac address adult B, so that is used as its best

30
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.000
ID to identify it in the wireless network BFC as a basic service area.

31
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.900
And the BSA is a wireless coverage area of an access point.

32
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.690
This is also known as a wireless cell.

33
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.070
You see the example here?

34
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.840
We've got our app in the middle.

35
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.090
That is its basic service area, its area of coverage.

36
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.280
That would be Ashin.

37
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.690
Southside is a service identifier, the Southside is a unique identifier that names a wireless network,

38
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.280
though Bulani, for example, corporate for sure, you've seen this before.

39
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.770
If you've walked into any coffee shop and asked to get onto the wireless network, they will give you

40
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.950
the SS I.D. and password to connect to.

41
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.970
A single access point can't support multiple SS IDs, for example, corporate and guest on different

42
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.540
sides can have different security settings and be mapped to different viewpoints.

43
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:42.210
So, for example, in our corporate office, we have created a corporate side and a guest aside for

44
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:49.560
users to be able to connect to the corporate W on the need to supply a valid username and password.

45
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.400
When they do that, Vermont to the corporate villain and IP subnet and they get connectivity to all

46
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.150
of the internal corporate resources like servers.

47
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.080
If a guest walks into the company and they want to get wireless access, they can get back to the connect

48
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.760
to the guest side.

49
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.300
To do that, they only need to provide a password rather than be a valid user inside the company.

50
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.050
But when they connect to the guest, the Vermont to the guest vielen an IP subnet which does not have

51
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.760
access to any internal resources.

52
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.070
We just give them Internet access.

53
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.380
Beacons, wireless access points, broadcast information about their W lines, including the SSD and

54
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.780
authentication requirements with beacon frames, this can be disabled, which can give you a little

55
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.270
bit of extra security because people cannot then easily see the SS ID.

56
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.630
However, it is trivially easy to sniff this information from other traffic in the wireless area and

57
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.950
find information.

58
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.240
SS is an extended service set, the same SS I.D. can be supported across multiple access points to give

59
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.920
a larger coverage area.

60
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.840
So you can see an odd example here.

61
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.120
We've got our corporate SS ID.

62
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.650
We've got a wireless app on the left here and it's got its coverage area.

63
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.700
It's BSEE.

64
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.920
And then we've got another wireless app which has got its coverage area.

65
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:28.000
It's IBSA and we can keep adding additional wireless apps in our building until we cover the entire

66
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.390
area.

67
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.990
When you do that, you want wireless apps which are enabling each other to be using different channels

68
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.520
so they don't interfere with each other.

69
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.570
I'll cover and I want more detail in a later lecture in the section.

70
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.120
And finally, we have got roaming wireless client stations can roam across wireless apps supporting

71
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.320
the same lines.

72
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.870
So in our example here, we've got our laptop here, which is currently connected to the first app.

73
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.150
If you're on that laptop and you're wondering about the building with your laptop, then your laptop

74
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.030
can room to other apps like that.

75
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.380
OK, but was everything that I needed to cover here?

76
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:17.210
In the next hour, we'll talk about wireless line controllers, which give us more scalability again.
