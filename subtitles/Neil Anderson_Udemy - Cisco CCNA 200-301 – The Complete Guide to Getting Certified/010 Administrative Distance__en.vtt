00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.190
In this lecture, you'll learn about administrative distance.

2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:20.500
Administrative Distance (AD) is used along with the metric to decide which of the available paths is going to make into the

3
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.350
routing table.

4
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.490
A router will typically only learn routes to a particular destination from a single routing protocol.

5
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.590
It's not normal for an organization to be running multiple different routing protocols. When multiple

6
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.550
routes to a destination are learned through a routing

7
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.310
protocol, the router will install the path or paths with the best, meaning the lowest, metric into the routing

8
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.060
table. And different routing protocols use different methods to calculate that metric.

9
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.190
For example, let's say we're using RIP

10
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.420
as our routing protocol, and we want to get to a particular destination, and we've got two different

11
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.770
paths to get there.

12
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:11.980
The first path goes from router A to B, to C, to D. So A to B, to C, to D would be a hop count of three.

13
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.300
And we've got another path which is A to B to D, which would have a hop count of two. RIP uses hop count

14
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.270
as its metric.

15
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.220
It's going to put the shortest hop count into the routing table.

16
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.790
So in this example, A to B to D would be preferred.

17
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:36.090
Now we might have exactly the same network topology but we're using OSPF, and with OSPF, maybe path A>B>C>D

18
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.800
has got a cost of 60, and path A>B>D has a cost of 100 because the A>B>D path has got lower

19
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.940
bandwidth links. Remember OSPF takes the bandwidth into account by default. And with our metric, it's

20
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.360
always the lowest value that is preferred.

21
00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.260
So with OSPF, it would be the other path, A>B>C>D, that would be used, making it into the routing table.

22
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.770
If paths to the same destination are received from different routing protocols,

23
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.270
if for some reason your organization is running multiple routing protocols and a router receives routes to the

24
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.160
same destination from those different routing protocols, then it can't compare their metrics to each other.

25
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.040
For example, a RIP hop count of 5 can't be compared to an OSPF cost of 60.

26
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.190
That comparison would be meaningless because the routing protocols calculate the metric in completely

27
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.350
different ways.

28
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.800
It's like they're talking foreign languages, so you can't compare one routing protocol metric to another. The router

29
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.980
needs to use a different method to choose when routes to the same destination are received from different

30
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.580
routing protocols, and that's what we use the Administrative Distance for. The Administrative Distance

31
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.160
is a measure of how trusted a particular routing protocol is.

32
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.960
If routes to the same destination are received via different routing protocols, the protocol with the 

33
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.440
best, which is the lowest, Administrative Distance value wins.

34
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.540
So with the metric, the lowest is best. With AD, it's the same, the lowest number is best.

35
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.870
And this slide here shows the default AD values of our popular routing protocols.

36
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.040
So worst is RIP, with a value of 120.

37
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:35.190
Then we've got IS-IS at 115, OSPF has an AD of 110, EIGRP is the most preferred of our IGPs,

38
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:44.140
it's got an AD of 90. External BGP has 20, a Static Route has a default AD of 1, and Connected Interfaces

39
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:52.570
will always be preferred, they have an Administrative Distance of 0. So Administrative Distance is used to choose

40
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.750
between multiple paths learned via different routing protocols.

41
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.920
Metric is used to choose between multiple paths learned with the same routing protocol. The Administrative

42
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.100
Distance is considered first to narrow the choice down to the single best routing protocol, and then

43
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.860
the metric is considered to choose the best path or paths, which will make it into the routing table.

44
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.690
We can see what's happening with a 'show ip route' command. So 'show ip route' will show us what routes did make

45
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.540
it into the routing table. You can see from here, connected routes have got an Administrative Distance of 0.

46
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.860
They're are always going to be most preferred.

47
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.560
We've also got some routes in here that were learned from RIP as well. And you see the digits in the

48
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.430
square brackets, that shows us the Administrative Distance and the metric. The first value is the Administrative

49
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.120
Distance. 

50
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.240
We already know that RIP has got an AD of 120. The second value is the metric,

51
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.020
so here, the first route has got a hop count of 1.

52
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.560
The second route has got a hop count of 2.

53
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.270
So let's talk through an example,

54
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.390
say we've got a router

55
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.560
and it receives multiple routes to the 10.10.10.0/24 network.

56
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.310
It receives those routes from both OSPF and RIP.

57
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.450
So when paths to the same destination are received from multiple routing protocols, the Administrative

58
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.460
Distance is considered first before the metric. OSPF has got a better Administrative Distance than

59
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.610
RIP, so the RIP routes are going to be discarded.

60
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.850
Then, the router will compare the routes they received via OSPF and install the one with the lowest cost into

61
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.110
the routing table.

62
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.230
If we receive multiple Equal Cost Paths, then they'll all go into the routing table and the router will load balance

63
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.860
between them.

64
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.750
Another thing we can do is Floating Static Routes.

65
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.250
Okay, so what I just covered is your standard core information for AD.

66
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.730
This is some extra information here.

67
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.400
If the best path to a destination is lost, for example because a link went down, it will be removed

68
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.810
from the routing table

69
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.250
when the router detects that and replace it with the next best

70
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:16.060
route. Now, we might want to configure a static route as a backup for the route learned via a routing protocol.

71
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.770
For example,

72
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.340
maybe we're worried the entire routing protocol was going to go down. A problem

73
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.510
if we want to do this is that static routes have a default Administrative Distance of 1, so they're always

74
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.360
going to be preferred over routes learned via an IGP.

75
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.200
So if we're running an IGP, we've got IGP routes in there. When we want to add static route as a backup,

76
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.930
that won't work by default because it's going to be preferred over the IGP rather than being the second

77
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.410
choice.

78
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.000
So how can we make that static

79
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.560
route

80
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.750
the second choice?

81
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.090
That way we can do that is with using a Floating Static route.

82
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.860
When we do this, we change the Administrative Distance of a static route from the default of 1 to having

83
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:08.230
a higher AD value, an AD value which is higher than the Administrative Distance of our routing protocol.

84
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.520
For example, say we were using OSPF, and we've got our network topology you see in the diagram here.

85
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:23.740
We're running OSPF along the path, from R4 to R3 to R2 to R1, and R5 is not running

86
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.430
OSPF.

87
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.760
Let's say it's a router

88
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:33.100
that does not support OSPF. So we'll have OSPF being used with the first choice path, going along the

89
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.430
top, from R4 to R3 to R2 to R1,

90
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.210
and we want to configure a backup static route on R4, that is going to send the traffic through R5,

91
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.600
but only if a top path is not available. So we can't add a normal static route

92
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.800
because then, it would go through R5 as a first choice. So the command we enter is 'ip route

93
00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:02.740
10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.3.2', selecting R5 as the next

94
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:11.860
hop, and then we put in an extra keyword at the end here, we say '115'. That sets and AD of 115, which

95
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.760
is higher than the OSPF AD of 110,

96
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.700
so this will be used as a backup route. Now,

97
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:24.490
obviously, we'd also need to add static routes coming back in the other direction along the bottom path and

98
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.860
we'd also need a static route going from R5 to R1.

99
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:36.730
Another example, you can also use Floating Static routes where you're using static routes only.

100
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.880
So here again on R4,

101
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.230
I could have first choice going to 10.1.1.2, which is on R3.

102
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:51.570
I could have my second choice for the 10.0.1.0 network going to the 10.1.3.2, which is on R5.

103
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.590
I would do that by giving it an Administrative Distance of 5.

104
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.670
If I just entered both of these routes without an Administrative Distance, it would load balance between

105
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.480
the two of them.

106
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.360
By adding the second route with an AD of 5,

107
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.880
it's only the first route that will make it into the routing table.

108
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.850
But if the link from R4 to R3 goes down, it will be removed from the routing table, and we

109
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.040
will use the second route instead. Now, a word of warning with this.

110
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.590
If I go back a slide,

111
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.610
if you do a Floating Static route as a backup for OSPF, if any of the links from R4 to R1

112
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:29.150
go down, OSPF will detect that and the route will be removed from the routing table.

113
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.310
So, that will work just fine. But with our second example, this will work

114
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.890
if the link from R4 to R3 goes down because R4 will detect that. But if the link from

115
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:45.610
R3 to R2, or R2 to R1 goes down, R1 won't know and it will continue sending traffic

116
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.950
along the top path and only get as far as R3, where the broken link is

117
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.760
and then the traffic is going to fail.

118
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:57.430
So this will work fine if you just have that one router with nothing else along the path, but if you do have

119
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.250
another routers along the path, be careful with this one. You could end up causing problems.

120
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.050
Okay so that was our Administrative Distance.

121
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.980
Next up, we'll take a look at it in the lab.
