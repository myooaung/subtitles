00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:16.110
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure Passive Interfaces through a lab demo. And in our example

2
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.880
topology

3
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.650
here, we've got routers R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, and they're all internal in our

4
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.630
organization. And we've got R6, which is a router which is at a partner.

5
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.110
So we want to have connectivity to that partner company, but we don't want to be sending them information

6
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.780
about our internal networking.

7
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.720
So we want to make sure that we don't start peering, forming an adjacency with R6, and sending them

8
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.220
that information.

9
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.450
We are also going to have a loopback interface on R1 and it's best practice to configure your

10
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.540
loopbacks as passive interfaces. You're never going to have another

11
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.090
router on the other side of that link. You can't have because it's not a physical link. So we'll configured

12
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
that as a passive interface as well.

13
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.110
I've already configured routing on all of my other routers internal in the company,

14
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.390
so R2, R3, R4, and R5.

15
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.070
I haven't configured anything on R1 yet.

16
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.670
So if I jump on R4, I should see all the internal routes but no route to get to the 10.0.1.0

17
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.280
network behind R1. So let's just verify that,

18
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.050
so I'm going to R4 and I'll do a

19
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:52.280
'show ip protocols', and I'm running RIP here for the lab demo and a 'show ip route' and I can see that I've

20
00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.080
got RIP routes going everywhere, but I don't have a route to that network that was behind R1.

21
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.020
And the reason is if I go on R1 and do a 'show ip protocols' on here, I don't have any routing protocol

22
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.080
configured there yet.

23
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.880
Okay,

24
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.660
first thing, let's configure the loopback.

25
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.260
So, that was 192.168.1.1.

26
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.760
So if I do a 'show ip interface brief',

27
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.630
I can see the loopback isn't there yet.

28
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:38.220
So I go 'config t', and then ,interface loopback 0', 'ip address 192.168.1.1' and it's a loopback,

29
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.930
so I'll give it a /32, which is 255.255.255.255.

30
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.580
Next thing I want to do is I want this router to start sharing routes and learning routes from my other

31
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.900
internal routers.

32
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:07.230
So I will go to global config, and I'll say 'router rip'. I want this to be 'version 2' and 'no auto-summary'. We'll

33
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:19.290
cover the RIP configuration in a later section in more detail. And then, I want to say 'passive-interface loopback0',

34
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.080
and the other passive interface is going to be the interface facing the partner company.

35
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.700
Let's check which one that was, so fastEthernet2/0. I don't want to form an adjacency with

36
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.980
R6 and be giving them out routing information. So back onto the router, it was also 'passive-interface

37
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.650
fastEthernet2/0'. Now,

38
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.510
right now, I haven't put in my network statements, so I haven't enabled RIP on the interfaces yet. I've

39
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.630
enabled it globally but nothing's going to happen until I specify the interfaces that I want this to be

40
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:07.620
enabled on. So let's have a look at the network topology again, and all my internal interfaces are in

41
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.070
the 10.X.X.X networks, so I'll add that. I also need to add 192.168.1.1

42
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:25.740
for my loopback. So, let's do that. I'll say 'network 192.168.1.1', 1 at the end doesn't

43
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:34.770
really going to do anything. And also, 'network to 10.0.0.0', and that should be my configuration done

44
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.690
now.

45
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:43.970
So, I might just need to give RIP a second to do it's thing. While we're waiting for RIP to converge,

46
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.820
let's check what that subnet was again, so 10.0.1.0 is behind R1 and also 10.0.2.0.

47
00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:01.160
So 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.2.0, let's see if R4 learned those networks. So I'll go onto

48
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.170
R4, and do a 'show ip route'

49
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.040
now.

50
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.050
And it was 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.2.0,

51
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.390
and there you go,

52
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.570
you can see that it has learned to those networks.

53
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.090
So, you can see why I had to make fastEthernet2/0 a passive interface.

54
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.710
I don't want to make it a normal interface. I don't want to send information to the partner company, but

55
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.740
if I just didn't include the interface in my configuration, then my internal routers wouldn't learn about

56
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.060
the route to get there.

57
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.700
So, that's why I created it as a passive interface.

58
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.110
I can also see I've got the route there to get to my loopback behind R1 as well. So, that's great.

59
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.330
All of my other internal routers are learning all of the routes everywhere including the loopback and

60
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.360
the passive interface. Let's have a look at the partner router which was R6.

61
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:06.270
So if I go on there, and you'll see that I've actually configure RIP on this router already and specified

62
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.620
'network 10.0.0.0'.

63
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.390
So, it's going to try to peer with R1. But

64
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:21.950
if I do a 'show ip route', you see that it hasn't learned any of the routes to the internal networks because

65
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.530
I set it as a passive interface on R1.

66
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.760
So, R1 is not sending it any information. Okay.

67
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.820
That was it.

68
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.150
That was our passive interfaces,

69
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.550
why we do it, and how to configure them.

70
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.620
See you in the next lecture.
