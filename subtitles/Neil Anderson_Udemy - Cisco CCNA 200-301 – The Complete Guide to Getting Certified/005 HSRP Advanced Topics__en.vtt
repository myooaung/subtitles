00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:15.920
In this lecture, you'll learn some HSRP advanced topics, including priority and pre-emption and a way

2
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.590
that we can get load balancing with HSRP.

3
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.960
So, I'll start off with priority and pre-emption.

4
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.980
You can choose which router will be the active by setting priority on the routers when you do the configuration. The router

5
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.920
with the higher priority will be preferred.

6
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.160
If you don't set the priority, it will default to 100. In the event of a tie,

7
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.180
the highest IP address wins.

8
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:53.700
If pre-emption is also enabled, when a higher priority router comes back online after the failure, it will transition

9
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.850
back to active.

10
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:05.519
So let's say for example, we've got our HSRP routers R1 and R2, and we give R1 a higher priority and

11
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.070
we also enable pre-emption on there. Well,

12
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.750
if R1 fails, R2 will take over and become active. When R1 comes back up again,

13
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.270
if we've enabled pre-emption, then R1 will transition back to active. If we haven't enabled pre-emption,

14
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.260
so maybe we've just enabled priority but we haven't enabled pre-emption, in that case, then R2 will remain

15
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.780
the active router. R1 will not come back online as active again.

16
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.090
And if you don't enable pre-emption, that can be more stable, because let's say that R1 has got some kind

17
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.390
of intermittent issue where it's flapping up and down,

18
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.360
so it's coming up, going down, coming up, going down.

19
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.540
Well, if you've enabled priority and pre-emption, the active is going to go to R1 then R2,

20
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.460
then R1, then R2.

21
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.250
There's going to be a short outage each time that happens.

22
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.230
So often, it's a better idea not to enable pre-emption.

23
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.970
For configuring this, so on R1, this is going to be our preffered router. We do our normal HSRP configuration

24
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.610
first, so on interface GigabitEthernet0/1, we've got the standard interface configuration

25
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.650
with the 'ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0' and 'no shutdown'.

26
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.720
We then have our HSRP command 'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1', and then the additional commands for priority

27
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.590
and pre-emption,

28
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.850
'standby 1 priority 110' and 'standby 1 preempt'. On R2,

29
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.380
we have the normal interface configuration where we're giving it 'ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0' and

30
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:58.370
'no shutdown', 'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1', the same virtual IP address that we have on R1,

31
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.480
and on R2,

32
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.430
we've said 'standby 1 priority 90'. The default priority is 100,

33
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.380
so here, R1 will be preferred because the higher value is better.

34
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.780
We have enabled pre-emption here.

35
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.590
If we hadn't put in that command on R1, 'standby 1 preempt', then R1 would be preferred when

36
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.660
both routers come up at the same time.

37
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.200
But if R1 fails over to R2, when R1 comes back again, it would remain R2 being

38
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.830
active.

39
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.980
Okay, so that's priority and pre-emption.

40
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:40.090
Another thing that we can configure is the version. HSRP version 2 introduced a few minor improvements.

41
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.640
So real-world,

42
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.370
you'll often see people still running on version 1, and the default is version 1.

43
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.570
Both routers must be running the same versions, so if you do enable version 2, make sure that you enable

44
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.800
it on both routers.

45
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.800
The configuration for the version is just one additional command 'standby version 2'.

46
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.020
Now, for verifying these commands, it's the normal command to verify HSRP, 'show standby'.

47
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.860
I'll come out of fullscreen mode again to highlight

48
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.709
some of these for you.

49
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:29.390
Okay, so we can see that Group 1 is active, virtual IP is 10.10.10.1. we can see the MAC address,

50
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.280
the virtual MAC address there as well.

51
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.100
So, we covered a lot in the last lecture.

52
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:44.480
The new settings here, I can see that pre-emption is enabled and the active router is local because on here,

53
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.190
the priority is 110. On the standby router, which is our R2 at 10.10.10.3,

54
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.730
the priority is 90.

55
00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.090
So whenever R1 is up, it will be the active router.

56
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.470
Okay, so I do have one other slide to show you here.

57
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:15.670
So, this is about how we can get active/active HSRP. Now, for the same IP subnet,

58
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.220
it's always going to be active/standby.

59
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.280
But if you've got different IP subnets on the inside, you're going to have different VLANs there

60
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.820
as well,

61
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:35.720
then for our two routers, R1 and R2, you can have R1 active for one IP subnet, and R2 

62
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.960
active for a different IP subnet,

63
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.100
or if you had four IP subnets, you could have two on each.

64
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:48.410
So the example here, let's say that our Engineering PCs are in the 10.10.10.0 subnet and our Sales

65
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:56.480
PCs are in the 10.10.20.0/24 subnet. So here, I'm going to have my Engineering PCs are

66
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.150
going to be sending their traffic through R1.

67
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:06.000
My Sales PCs are going to be sending their traffic through R2. This also shows you an example

68
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.230
where you would want to use priority and pre-emption.

69
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.360
So on R1, I configured it on interface Gig0/1 with IP address 10.10.10.2,

70
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:25.250
'no shutdown', 'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1', and I gave it priority 110 and preempt.

71
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.900
On R2, for the 10.10.10 subnet,

72
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.350
it's got physical address

73
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.090
10.10.10.103,
 

74
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.930
'no shutdown',

75
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.840
'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.10.1', and 'standby 1 priority 90'.

76
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.800
So, R1 is going to be the preferred default gateway at

77
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.060
10.10.10.1 for my Engineering PCs.

78
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.750
For my Sales PCs, I flip it around.

79
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.170
So on R1, I give the IP address 10.10.20.3 on the physical interface.

80
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:05.660
The virtual IP is 10.10.20.1 and R2 gets the higher priority 110 and preemption. On R1

81
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.940
it's got priority 90.

82
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.780
So you can see here that R1 will be active for my Engineering PCs. R2 will be active for my

83
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.800
Sales PCs.

84
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:22.310
So that's a way that you can get load balancing through both gateways when you're using HSRP, but it's

85
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.290
only going to work when you do it across different IP subnets. For the same IP subnet,

86
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.270
it's going to be active/standby.

87
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.600
Okay, so that was everything for HSRP, for the CCNA.

88
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.230
See you in the next section.
