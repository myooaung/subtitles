00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:15.910
In this lecture, you'll learn about our first option for inter-VLAN routing, which is to use a router

2
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.770
with separate interfaces acting as the default gateway for each of the different VLANs.

3
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.030
Before we get into the inter-VLAN routing, a quick review,

4
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.250
there's typically a one-to-one relationship between an IP subnet and a VLAN in the LAN campus. For example,

5
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:44.290
we'll have Engineering hosts in IP subnet 10.10.10.0/24 and that will be associated

6
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.520
with VLAN 10,

7
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.140
and then we've got a different IP subnet for Sales of 10.10.20.0/24, that's also going to have

8
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.140
its own associated VLAN, VLAN 20,

9
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.900
for example. Hosts are segregated at Layer 3 by being in different IP subnets, and they're segregated

10
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.370
at Layer 2 into separate broadcast domains being in different VLANs. So hosts

11
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.600
in different IP subnets need to send traffic via a router to be able to communicate with each other.

12
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.540
So in the last section, you saw how to do all of the Layer 2 VLAN configuration, but hosts and different

13
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.370
VLANS weren't able to communicate with each other.

14
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.770
So, let's look at how to fix that.

15
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:42.400
So first option, a router with separate physical interfaces in each VLAN. So here, we have got the ENG VLAN PCs,

16
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.200
they're represented by the purple color, and our Sales PCs are yellow.

17
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:57.160
So on the switch, we've configured our access ports to put the correct hosts into the correct VLAN.

18
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.660
Then, we're adding a router now as well.

19
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.050
In the example, the router interface, FastEthernet0/1, is going to be the default gateway for

20
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.970
the Engineering VLAN.

21
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.120
So we give it an IP address in the same subnet,

22
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.440
10.10.10.1, in our example here, and we configure our Engineering hosts to use 10.10.10.1

23
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.070
as their default gateway. On the switch, its interface FastEthernet0/1

24
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.290
that is connected to that interface

25
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.910
on the router, so we put that in the Engineering VLAN.

26
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.840
So, that's the Engineering side done.

27
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.370
We also need to configure the Sales side as well.

28
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.970
So we're using interface fastEthernet0/2 on the router as the default gateway there,

29
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.570
IP address

30
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.170
10.10.20.1, and on the switch, it's interface FastEthernet0/2,

31
00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.550
on the other side of the link, we configure that as an access port in VLAN 20 for Sales.

32
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.210
In our example,

33
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.710
I'm also going to show you how you do the external routing as well.

34
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.640
So here, we've got interface fastEthernet0/3 on the router which is connected out to the Wide Area Network (WAN).

35
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.930
It's got IP address 203.0.113.1/24,

36
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.880
and the next hop address over on the Wide Area Network (WAN) side is going to be 203.0.113.2.

37
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.000
So, I'll configure a static default

38
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.660
route pointing to 203.0.113.2 as the next hop address.

39
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.990
So, let's have a look and see how to do the actual configuration.

40
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.940
So on our router, we've got interface FastEthernet0/1, IP address 10.10.10.1, with

41
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.710
a /24 subnet mask.

42
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.640
Remember to do a 'no shutdown' as well, and interface FastEthernet0/2, the IP address on there

43
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.470
is 10.10.20.1, and then our default static route to get out of the Local Area Network (LAN),

44
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.410
'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

45
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.500
with a next hop address of 203.0.113.2.

46
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.280
So that's the router configuration,

47
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.140
we need to make sure we put a matching configuration on the switch as well.

48
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.740
So on the switch, I've got interface FastEthernet0/1, 'switchport mode access',

49
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:31.120
'switchport access vlan 10' for the Engineering VLAN, and 'interface FastEthernet 0/2,' 'switchport mode access,'

50
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.510
and 'switchport access vlan 20' for Sales.

51
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.170
So when you use the option of router with separate interfaces for different VLANs, the configuration

52
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:48.160
on the switch is just like it was a normal end host, a normal PC, that was plugged into that port.

53
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:59.880
Now, some disadvantages exist with using a router with separate interfaces. You need a separate physical

54
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.370
interface for every VLAN.

55
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.060
So unless you've got very few VLANS, it's likely that you're going to run out of available physical

56
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.650
interfaces on the router.

57
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.270
Also, traffic being routed between different IP subnets within the campus has to go up and down physical

58
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:26.370
Ethernet cables to the router. You'll see when we get to option three using a Layer 3 switch, it's slower

59
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.380
sending up and down the physical cables than routing it across the backplane of the switch.

60
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.750
That will make more sense when you see option three.

61
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.360
Okay, so that's all the information about our first option.

62
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.850
Next up, let's configure it in the lab. So you can see the topology diagram here,

63
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.290
it's the same set up we were using in the VLAN section.

64
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.040
So I've got my SW1 and SW3, which I've got some Engineering and Sales PCs attached.

65
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.910
ENG VLAN is 10,

66
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.410
the SALES VLAN is VLAN 20.

67
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.200
The difference is we've now added our router, R1, which is connected into SW2. FastEthernet0/0

68
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.210
is going to be configured as the Engineering gateway

69
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.890
with 10.10.10.1.

70
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.900
It connects to fastEthernet0/1 on the switch, and fastEthernet0/1

71
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.320
on the router will be the Sales gateway at 10.10.20.1.

72
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.750
The switch interface on the other side is fastEthernet0/2.

73
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:38.400
I've already configured all the Layer 2 VLAN configuration, so we've got trunks going end-to-end, from S1

74
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.740
to SW3, and I've put the PCs into the correct VLAN.

75
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.460
Let's just verify that first.

76
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.010
So I'll go on to SW1,

77
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:59.040
and if I do a 'show interface gig0/1 switchport', you can see that that is configured as

78
00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.940
a trunk.

79
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.820
We're using VLAN 199 as the Native VLAN, 'show vlan brief'

80
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:14.670
I can see that I've got my Eng and my Sales VLANs configured, and the PCs have been put into correct access

81
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.880
ports as well. Let's check that connectivity works.

82
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.150
So I'll go on to ENG1,

83
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.100
I'll ping 10.10.10.11, which is ENG2, which is connected to the same switch,

84
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.280
and ping 10.10.10.12,

85
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.110
that is ENG3 over on SW3 on the far end.

86
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.500
So, our Layer 2 configuration is all up and working.

87
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:49.980
But if I try to ping a Sales PC, so I'll try to ping 10.10.20.12, which is on the same switch,

88
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.730
this is going to fail because I haven't configured my routing yet,

89
00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:01.170
and obviously, if I ping 10.10.20.10 on SW3, that's going to fail as well.

90
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.510
Okay, so Layer 2 all good.

91
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.500
Let's configure our Layer 3 routing now.

92
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.560
So I'll do the router first,

93
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.600
so I need to go onto R1.

94
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:24.570
Let me just open up Packet Tracer here, and connect to R1, and at the command line,

95
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:35.350
I need to configure my interface for my Engineering VLAN, so I go to global config, and that was interface fastEthernet0/0,

96
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:43.590
IP address would be 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0,

97
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.090
and 'no shutdown'. At interface fastEthernet0/1

98
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:56.900
for the Sales VLAN, IP address 10.10.20.1 with a /24 mask, and 'no shutdown'.

99
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.750
That's all I need to do on the router.

100
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:06.980
I need to configure the switch with a matching configuration. So it's connected to SW2,

101
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:17.740
and in global config, its interface fastEthernet0/1, which is connected to the Engineering VLAN

102
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:28.670
interface. So I'll make that 'switchport mode access' and 'switchport access vlan 10', and then interface

103
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:38.830
fastEthernet0/2 for Sales, I'll hit the up arrow to get 'switchport mode access' and set that to 'switchport access vlan 20'.

104
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.710
So, that's it. That should be my inter-VLAN routing working now.

105
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.010
Let's go back onto my ENG1 PC.

106
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.160
If I do an IP config, you can see it is set for 10.10.10.1

107
00:09:51.160 --> 00:10:00.020
as the default gateway, and hopefully, if all the interfaces have come up, if I ping 10.10.20.12

108
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:06.490
on the same switch, okay, it looks like the ping is going to fail.

109
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.550
Probably just a Packet Tracer quirk again here.

110
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.580
Let's check and see if our interfaces are up on the router.

111
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.110
So on R1, I'll do a 'show IP interface brief',

112
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.420
and interfaces are up, up.

113
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.700
Let's also check the switch.

114
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.730
Well, it should be fine on the switch.

115
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.890
If there was a problem on the switch, it would show up here on the router as well.

116
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
But let's just double check, 'show ip interface brief',

117
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.890
and it was fastEthernet0/1 and  fastEthernet0/2,

118
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.280
they're up, up as well.

119
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.720
Let's try the ping again, because maybe it just took a minute.

120
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.490
Well, there we go,

121
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.650
as you can see, it was the last ping that came through, so everything was fine.

122
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:56.120
That is our inter-VLAN routing working, and I can ping to the Sales PCs over on the other side of

123
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.660
the network

124
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.550
on the other switch, that's at 10.10.20.10.

125
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.890
This might drop a few pings while it's doing ARP and stuff like that as well.

126
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.620
There we go,

127
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.970
we can see we get a reply there too.

128
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:14.420
And I know this is going to work for sure, but let's just double check. Let's also go onto our Sales PC

129
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:20.510
and check that it can ping across to Eng. Let's make this 10.10.10.11 now,

130
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:28.460
and wait for the ARP to resolve, and then hopefully, there we go, the second ping works.

131
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:35.400
So that's how we configure inter-VLAN routing using a router with separate interfaces.

132
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.440
See you in the next lecture for the next option.
