00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.870
In this lecture, you'll learn about the practice tests, which I recommend to give you the best chance

2
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.560
of passing the Shishani exam on your first try.

3
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.620
Now, let me say, stay off the bat that you do not have to get these practice tests.

4
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.790
It's optional.

5
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.290
In this course, you'll learn all of the topics which are covered on this exam.

6
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.700
You'll get all the knowledge that you need.

7
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.920
I cover all the topics completely.

8
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.380
You'll also get all their hands on practice you need through the lab exercises as well.

9
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.360
But the problem is that having the knowledge and skills that are tested on the exam is not the same

10
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.680
as actually passing the exam.

11
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.760
There's quite a high failure rate on this exam for people that take it the first time.

12
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.230
And that is because even though they know the topics well that are going to be tested on the exam is

13
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.940
quite a difficult exam.

14
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.560
The way that the questions are worded can be difficult if you haven't seen those type of questions before.

15
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.940
So the best way to give yourself the best chance of passing on your first attempt is by not just learning

16
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.920
all the knowledge and the skills that you're going to get from this class, but also doing practice

17
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.990
tests which closely mimic what you're going to get on the real exam as well.

18
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.110
And the practice tests that I recommend for that are all for the reason that I recommend Alphabet is

19
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.730
that they've got a huge question bank with thousands of questions which have been written by school

20
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.160
press.

21
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.270
So they're very, very similar to what you're going to get on the real exam.

22
00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.550
And also they've got a really advanced exam engine which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence,

23
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.730
not joking to customize the exam experience to you.

24
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.450
It also gives you really detailed feedback on how you're doing with the practice exams and let you know

25
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.170
when you're ready to take the real exam.

26
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.950
So it's not something that I could have done myself, because to be honest, I don't have the time or

27
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.570
the software development skills to be able to build this custom-built examination, the alphabet half.

28
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.300
So because it's not something I'm capable of doing myself.

29
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.850
That's why I'm recommending the best option for you, which is offer prep.

30
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.330
So let's take a look at how it actually works.

31
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.230
Sure.

32
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.870
To come in to the appropriate website.

33
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.570
Use this Eurail here.

34
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.720
It's w w w dot flat box, dot com slash AP Shishani.

35
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.530
The AP is for alphabet but will always give you the best deal which is available on that day.

36
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.530
So you can see here current pricing is forty five dollars per month, which I think is a real bargain.

37
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.370
So you can come here to sign up for that deal.

38
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.210
Once you do that, you will land on this page here.

39
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.320
Now, when you sign up for this deal, this is you signing up for the current version of this Shishani

40
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.220
exam bank.

41
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.790
When you do that, you also get a free trial.

42
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.580
So all of our other exam resources as well.

43
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.380
So that's why you'll see them on this page.

44
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.990
So what to do is scroll down to the Shishani two hundred Dosch free or one section and click in there

45
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.630
and that will land you on this page here.

46
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.790
So you get the practice test.

47
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.680
You also get the books from school press as well.

48
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.670
So that's also really helpful because you can watch the videos in this class.

49
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.550
If there's anything that you want some further study material on, you can read it right there in the

50
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.970
books.

51
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.870
Now, what to do if you do get the practice test as you go through the course is start off by doing

52
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.650
the quizzes.

53
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.510
So quizzes are over here to know.

54
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.460
I'll click on build a quiz.

55
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.790
And you see in here, it's laid out in the same order.

56
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.890
They are in the school passbooks.

57
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.070
That's slightly different than it is in the course here.

58
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.230
But it's going to be really obvious to figure out what the section was that you just did in the course

59
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.280
and find the only topic in here to come in here, choose whatever it is you've just learned in the course.

60
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.790
Click on that and then you can click on Start Quiz, and then this is going to ask you questions in

61
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.840
the same kind of style.

62
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.140
But you'll get on the exam testing that you have learned properly what you just covered in that section.

63
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.080
So it's going to verify that you do have the knowledge.

64
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.590
OK, so as you go through the class, do the quizzes and then let me just click on the back button here.

65
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.750
When you have completed the course and you're doing your final prep, getting ready for the real exam,

66
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.750
then what to do is go over to.

67
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:15.240
These fuel exams on the right, what the exams do is they mimic the actual real Shishani exam very,

68
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.450
very, very similar.

69
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.820
You're going to get the same amount of time, the same amount of questions.

70
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.360
And the type of questions are going to be the same as what you get in the exam.

71
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.950
Now, as you're doing these quizzes on the fuel exams, Alpha Prep is going to be monitoring your progress.

72
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.710
And you can see up here at the top, it gives you an exam mastery and a pass IQ score.

73
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:44.700
And this is going to tell you when you've got to a level where you're ready to pass the exam with a

74
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.410
high degree of accuracy.

75
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.190
So this is going to actually save you money because the cost of the exam is three hundred dollars because

76
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.470
this is just forty five dollars per month.

77
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.090
To be doing this is going to give you the practice you need to pass the exam.

78
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.080
You're going to pass quicker and also you're going to know when you're going to pass.

79
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.830
So you're not going to waste three hundred dollars on a failed attempt.

80
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:16.080
OK, to give you the full disclosure, I do partner with Alpha Prep, so I do get a small payment if

81
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.970
you do sign up for this service.

82
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.350
But to be honest, I'm not telling you about this to make a few extra dollars that I'm doing it because

83
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.610
it really does give you the best chance of passing the exam.

84
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.730
I would love to be able to give you some kind of software like this within the course as well.

85
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.560
I'm just not capable of doing that.

86
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.680
So that's why I do recommend Alpha Prep.

87
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.430
I think this is a really good deal and it's going to save you money in the long run.

88
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.310
OK.

89
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.290
That was the last thing I needed to tell you.

90
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.900
And we've now reached the end of the course.

91
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.350
So the last thing that I have to say is thank you very much for taking the course with me.

92
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.050
I really appreciate having you as my student.

93
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:07.200
I hope you got a lot of value from the course and you can go on and crush the exam there.

94
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.800
Let me know when you pass, because I absolutely love to hear your success stories.

95
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.670
OK, thanks again and good luck.
