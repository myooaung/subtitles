00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.880
In this lecture, you'll learn about wireless line controllers, advocate VoIP protocol in a large campus,

2
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.570
configuring a large amount of wireless access points individually quickly becomes unmanageable.

3
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.070
You can see in the example campus here, I've got my first wireless app, which is configured with the

4
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.220
corporate line and its settings, and then I've set up the same configuration on the second wireless

5
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.600
app.

6
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.640
Now, that would be fine and easy to manage if I only had a couple of access points.

7
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.670
But what if I had two hundred different access points while configuring them all separately would just

8
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.450
really be unmanageable.

9
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.400
So that is where she comes in.

10
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.850
A W LC, the wireless LAN controller can be used as a central point of management and you can manage

11
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.650
all of your access points from their.

12
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.860
This is what some of our wireless line controllers look like, so over on the left here, you can see

13
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.970
a couple of dedicated hardware W LCD, different models are available, the bigger, more powerful models

14
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.540
to support a larger amount of access points she can give a smaller one down here at the bottom could

15
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.150
be used in a smaller office.

16
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.620
You can also get wireless line controller blades that fit into your switches or routers.

17
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.170
So here's an example of a blade that goes in a switch and below there is a blade that fits into a router.

18
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.050
Virtual wireless controller is also available, which runs in software and redundancy is Sportage.

19
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.650
You're going to want to double up on your wireless line controllers for redundancy.

20
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.830
Standalone access points are known as autonomous access points, so if you don't have a wireless LAN

21
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.380
controller controlling the app, it's a standalone or autonomous app.

22
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.259
Access points, which do have a ULC, are known as lightweight access points, and the installed software

23
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.880
image determines whether or not access point is autonomous or lightweight.

24
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.900
So you can get an access point from Cisco, the exact same model, and it can operate in either autonomous

25
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.580
mode or in lightweight mode.

26
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.200
The way you determine that is by putting the correct software image onto the app.

27
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.310
Use either the autonomous image or use the lightweight image.

28
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.190
OK, let's have a look at the first big way that using a wireless LAN controller makes it easier to

29
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.830
manage a large amount of access points.

30
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.770
And that is ZT zero touch provisioning with zero touch provisioning your access points, discover the

31
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.390
wireless LAN controller and then download their configuration from there.

32
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.920
The way that they can discover where the wireless line controller is is either via the ship.

33
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.580
So with this, you plug your access point into the Wired network.

34
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.460
It sends out a DHP request to get its IP address, subnet mask and default gateway.

35
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.260
And it will also get information about option for EC3, which gives the IP address of the wireless LAN

36
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.720
controller.

37
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.680
So in the ship you've got your various options that you can configure in there like IP address, subnet

38
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.490
mask, default.

39
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.180
Gateway Option three is used to tell an access point the IP address of its wireless LAN controller.

40
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.040
Another option you can use is by using DNS to tell the AP where its wireless LAN controller is with

41
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.180
Cisco EPWs.

42
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.330
When they boot up, they are set like this from the fact that they will look for the next record for

43
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.250
Cisco Copp WAP controller.

44
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.630
So if they do get their IP address subnet, Mos Def will Gateway and DNS server if they have not received

45
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.210
option for EC3 from the DHP server telling them the IP address, the wireless LAN controller, they

46
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.300
will send it DNS request asking for the IP address of Cisco Copp WAP controller.

47
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.510
So if you've configured an address record on your DNS server that which includes the IP address of the

48
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.220
wireless LAN controller, your APIs can find out how to find it from there.

49
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.370
And the other way that this will work is with a local subnet broadcast.

50
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.490
So if you're wireless, one controller is on the same IP subnet and VLAN as a wireless access point

51
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.800
to wireless access point can find it by doing a broadcast.

52
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.050
Obviously, if a wireless LAN controller is on a different subnet, then wouldn't work.

53
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.830
So you need to use the AP or DNS and it's typically DHP that is going to be used for this.

54
00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.090
So the way at this point, we'll discover the IP address of the wireless line controller through one

55
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.700
of those methods, it will then connect to the wireless line controller and download its configuration

56
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.480
from there, but includes what W lines the just point should support on their savings and all the other

57
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.980
settings for that access point.

58
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.780
The wireless line controller also monitors the wireless quality and controls the channels and power

59
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.070
of the access points.

60
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.500
So because it's managing all of the different access points, it can set them up.

61
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.850
So they're using non interfering channels.

62
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.210
It will also set the power levels on the apps to make sure that they don't interfere with each other.

63
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.060
It can also detect rogue apps as well.

64
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:47.730
A rogue app would be if a hacker has added an access point to the campus, which is broadcasting on

65
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.340
legitimate inside, trying to get people to connect in there, and then you'll be able to do bad things

66
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.030
to those clients.

67
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.500
Or maybe it's not a hacker.

68
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.300
Maybe it's just something that's happened by accident, maybe an old app that is not managed by the

69
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.610
W.L. Xi, but you don't want that to be in your building.

70
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.680
You want all of the apps to be managed.

71
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.550
The wireless LAN controller will be able to detect rogue apps, report them to you so that you can correct

72
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.820
that.

73
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.280
We covered roaming in the last lecture, and this is possible with autonomous apps, so with roaming

74
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.880
your wireless stations can room across wireless apps supporting the CMW plans.

75
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.650
So in our example here, we have got the laptop here.

76
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:41.390
And then you walk through the building, you get closer to the other app and your laptop will then associate

77
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.170
wirelessly to the new app.

78
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.920
Now, you can't do that with autonomous apps, but if you're using authentication, which you definitely

79
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.830
should be, then because the authentication is Hopp is handled separately on the two different apps.

80
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.010
You're going to have a break of service when it comes to the new app.

81
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.270
So if you're maybe on a phone call and your device, maybe you're using your phone and you're connected

82
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.410
wirelessly, you're making a phone call, you're walking around the building, that's going to cause

83
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:15.470
a problem because you're going to have dropped your roaming if you're using a wireless line controller.

84
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.240
But the authentication is offloaded from the apps to the wireless LAN controller.

85
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.670
You can get seamless roaming if you're using a WFC with no brakes and service.

86
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.950
The protocol that is used for the communications between wireless LAN controller and the access points

87
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.200
is Copwatch WAP that stands for control on provisioning of wireless access points.

88
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:45.490
It's open standard protocol that enables your wireless LAN controller to manage the apps with what the

89
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:53.560
communications are encrypted inside a DTL tunnel and it uses UDP ports five two, four, six and five

90
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.290
to four seven.

91
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.620
So if you've got a firewall between your wireless LAN controller and make sure that those parts are

92
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.000
open on the firewall.

93
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.560
With a wireless line controller, some of the work is moved from the apps to the wireless LAN controller

94
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.140
box, where they are now called lightweight apps because they're not doing the same workload that we'll

95
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.120
be doing if it were an autonomous app.

96
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.380
Real-Time Traffic is still handled by the app in order to provide suitable performance.

97
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.890
So there's real time traffic.

98
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.260
If that was going to the wireless line controller and back again, but we'd add some additional delay

99
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.070
which would drop the performance level.

100
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:37.320
So for real time traffic, where do we have any delay about still going to be handled by the app?

101
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:42.990
The rest of the traffic and responsibilities are going to be handled by the wireless one controller.

102
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.730
And this functionality is known as split, Marc.

103
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:54.670
So the operations that will be handled by the AFP are the client handshake when it's connecting the

104
00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:01.830
beacons where the AP announces information about its debut lines and their side's performance monitoring.

105
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.370
So the AP will do the actual performance monitoring, checking the quality and its coverage area.

106
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:16.120
But information will, however, be sent to the W.L. She and she is going to be taking action based

107
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.440
on not information.

108
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:24.360
Encryption and decryption is also handled by the AP and any clients are in power safe mode.

109
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.020
Those communications from the AP to them will also be handled by the AP.

110
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:36.380
OK, next up, let's look at the operations which will be handled by the wireless one controller authentication.

111
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:43.220
So when you are going on the wireless network and you enter in your password or your username and password,

112
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.730
the authentication will be controlled with the wireless one controller, the roaming control also maybe

113
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.000
they'll it or two to 11 to eight or three communication.

114
00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:01.700
So all traffic is going from the wireless to the wired line is going to be passing through the wireless

115
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.480
LAN controller.

116
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:07.960
You'll see some more information about this where we talk about that more because it is important also

117
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.590
the radio frequency management.

118
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.870
So making sure that neighboring apps are not communicating on the same channel and causing interference,

119
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:20.630
the WAC will handle that and also the security management and the UAW management.

120
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.570
So let's look at those traffic flows.

121
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.050
So first off, looking at the traffic flow with an autonomous app, so where we're not using a wireless

122
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:37.520
LAN controller and you can see here we've got a wireless client and it is connecting to communicating

123
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.750
with the wired network.

124
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:46.730
So the traffic goes to the app, it will then target with the correct VLAN and send it on to the upstream

125
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.270
switch.

126
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.070
It's different when we're using wireless LAN controller.

127
00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:00.230
Now you can see what happens is the client sends its pocket up to the access point, then the access

128
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.260
point will send it to the wireless LAN controller.

129
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:08.720
The then the wireless line controller sends it back to the switch again and then it goes to the final

130
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.470
destination.

131
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:18.140
So with an autonomous app, it goes from the app to the switch and then directly to the final destination.

132
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:25.490
But when we are using a wireless LAN controller, it goes through the Cat WAP tunnel to the bolshy and

133
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:32.750
then it gets here pinned back onto the network again because all the traffic is passing through the

134
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:40.430
wireless line controller, as well as production traffic between your different endpoints, the management

135
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:48.080
traffic where the wireless line controller is controlling the apps but also passes through the tunnel

136
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.430
as well.

137
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:56.030
So you can see from your there's going to be a lot of traffic that is going through the wireless LAN

138
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.660
controller.

139
00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:02.480
If you've got 100 hundred apps and they're all communicating with devices on the Wired network rather

140
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.610
than it going through the most direct path to get there, it's all going through the wireless line controller.

141
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.120
So because of this, you want that wireless line controller have enough bandwidth to support the throughput

142
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.950
that's going through it.

143
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.610
So typically, you're not going to have just a single physical connection from a wireless LAN controller.

144
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.440
The switch is connected to you're going to want to have multiple physical connections there to give

145
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.470
you enough bandwidth and you're going to bundle them together.

146
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:35.630
And for channel and the terminology in eight to 11 and from Cisco is what is now called log link aggregation.

147
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.790
It's just the same as an ether channel.

148
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.700
OK, last thing to tell you about is flaks connect.

149
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:48.100
So, again, as we were just talking on that last night, all of the traffic between the devices on

150
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.280
your wireless network and the wired network are going through the wireless line controller.

151
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.910
This is not a problem.

152
00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:01.900
If they're all in the same campus and you do have enough bandwidth or not connection between wireless

153
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.250
LAN controller and the switch.

154
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:11.440
But if the access point was in a small remote office and your wireless line controller was in the main

155
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:18.070
office, that would cause a problem because if we had wireless client here and it was communicating

156
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:24.880
with the other wireless client, we don't want that traffic to go all the way over one link to New York

157
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.770
and then all the way back again.

158
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.850
TOSCANI Odd.

159
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.650
Quite a bit of significant delay.

160
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:37.690
So what we can use there is flaks, connect with flight, connect traffic as forward locally.

161
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:43.000
So you can see that the packet does not go over the tunnel all the way in New York and back again.

162
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.460
We are just going to forward locally.

163
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:51.070
So it's useful for small branch offices which aren't big enough for you to want to go to the expense

164
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.170
of putting a wireless one controller in there.

165
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:59.290
You don't want them to be an autonomous EP because you want to still have the central management or

166
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.180
not case you can use flaks connect.

167
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.940
OK, that was everything I needed to tell you here.

168
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.350
See you in the next lecture.
