00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.210
OK, privileged.

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.100
Exactly, so we covered configuring our passwords and our basic security console and the terminal lines,

3
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.410
the last one is configuring a password for the enable prompt.

4
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.700
So when you connect over a console or a viewing line, you'll find the user exact prompt by default,

5
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.030
which has very limited set of commands available to get the super user access you use via enable command

6
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.460
to invoke privilege, exact mode that can be secured with a password as well.

7
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.420
So you could put a password on your console and your terminal wanes and not have an enabled password.

8
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.560
Or you could have an enabled password but not have passwords at the console.

9
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.910
Or you can do both.

10
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.880
Typically you're going to want to do both to the command firebase with the old command or get onto the

11
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.420
new command in a minute is enable password and then the password you want to use and not to global level

12
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.890
command.

13
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.250
So for console and VQ iBOT password was configured at the line level for the enable password is configured

14
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.330
at the global level.

15
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.500
Once we've done this, if we are the user prompt and we enter the enable command will be prompted for

16
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.820
that enable password.

17
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.160
Now, the problem with the enable password is that if you do a short run, it shows up in plain text

18
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
so that you're a senior administrator and you've got a junior administrator with you and you're doing

19
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.350
some training for them and you're showing them some things.

20
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.050
If you do a show on command and airable, they're looking over your shoulder.

21
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.980
They will see what the enable password is and know they can go and get super user access as well.

22
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.100
So you don't want to be the case.

23
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.630
You can see here we've done our show it on and we can see in plain text that the enable password is

24
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.860
flat box free.

25
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.400
So we don't use the enable password command, we use the enable command.

26
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.370
Instead, it's got exactly the same function where once you've configured, if you want to get to the

27
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.860
enable prompt, you have to enter a password.

28
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.250
The difference is that when you use an secret, if you do a show run, it shows up in an encrypted format.

29
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.580
It doesn't show the actual password in plain text.

30
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.320
Now, if you've got Bolaven enabled password and an enabled secret set, the enable password is not

31
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.950
used.

32
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.080
It's being able to secret that is in effect.

33
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.430
Best practice is to configure and enable secret.

34
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.380
Do not configure and enable password at all.

35
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.470
It's just an old command was not used anymore.

36
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.760
So let's say that we did have an able password set as flat box free and we see an enabled secret flat

37
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.990
box free will get a warning message about the same as you'd enable password.

38
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.850
Please use a different secret so we could see a enable secret flat box.

39
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.920
For now, if I do a sure run, I can see that may enable secret is messed up letters and numbers.

40
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.970
So I don't know that it's actually a box for it's not in plain text but enable password does us plain

41
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.030
text which is flat box free real world.

42
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.490
What you would do if you got that warning message is you would see new and you know, enable password

43
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.690
to remove it and then you would see an able secret and put to enable secret then.

44
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.940
As well as the enable password being shown in plain text, any online level passwords that you've entered

45
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.040
are shown in plain text by default as well.

46
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.460
So if I did a show right now, I can see that my inbox is encrypted, my enable password is in plain

47
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.570
text and also those passwords I configured under the console and the virtual terminal lines are in plain

48
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.210
text as well.

49
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.850
Again, that is BYB two.

50
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.250
I do want both showing up in plain text.

51
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.860
So what I can do for that is I can use the service password encryption command.

52
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.790
You enable global level when you do this.

53
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.800
Now, whenever you do a shoot on, all commands will be shown in an encrypted format.

54
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.770
So it is best practice to do this.

55
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.990
So the example here of enabled service password encryption and when I do a show run ishiba all of my

56
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.460
passwords out in an encrypted format are not shown in plain text.

57
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.590
OK, so that was it.

58
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.720
That was configuring basic security next year.

59
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.370
We'll have a look at doing this in MOOP.
