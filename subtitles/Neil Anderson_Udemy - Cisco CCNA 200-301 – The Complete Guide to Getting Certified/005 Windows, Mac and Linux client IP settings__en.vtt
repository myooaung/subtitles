00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:16.180
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure and verify the IP settings on Windows, Mac and Linux clients.

2
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:24.130
I'll start off with Windows, and I'm on my Windows laptop here and I've got Windows File Explorer

3
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.640
open.

4
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.160
This is what I find to be the quickest and most convenient way to open the network settings,

5
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.180
but are other ways you can get there, such as going through the Control Panel.

6
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.140
The way I like to do it is in Windows File Explorer,

7
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.660
I will right-click on Network, and then choose Properties, and then I'll click on Change Adapter Settings,

8
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.350
and then I'll see all of my network cards here.

9
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.640
I've got a lot of network cards on my laptop, because I've got a lot of virtual cards because I've got

10
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.840
VMware installed.

11
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.200
I'm plugged in with an Ethernet cable right now on this interface here and if I wanted to configure the

12
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.860
settings,

13
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.580
I'll right-click on that and choose Properties,

14
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.790
and then in here, you can see that I can set my IP settings for both IPv4 and IPv6. So let's click

15
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.410
on IPv4 and then go to Properties, and you see that it defaults to obtaining an IP address automatically,

16
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.030
which means that by default, it is a DHCP client.

17
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.550
All of the client desktop operating systems will default to being DHCP clients.

18
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.090
If I wanted to configure a manual fixed IP address on here, I would just tick the radio button and

19
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.540
use the following IP address, and in there, I would enter my IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway,

20
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.920
and I would also configure my DNS server in here as well.

21
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.240
But I want to leave this as a DHCP client, so I'm going to select that. Notice in here in the GUI,

22
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.350
it does not actually tell me what the IP address is.

23
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.040
So to find the IP address,

24
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.930
what I'm going to do is open up a command prompt, so I'll go to the search bar and type in 'cmd'

25
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.970
to open up a command prompt and the command is 'ipconfig'.

26
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.050
Now, ipconfig will show you the main information. Normally, you want to do an 'ipconfig /all'

27
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.270
because this will show you extra information, such as the MAC address on your network cards,

28
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.090
also what the IP address of your DHCP server is. So, I'll enter that.

29
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.540
I'm getting loads of output because I've got so many network cards in here. So I'm going to scroll

30
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.400
all the way back up to the top again,

31
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:50.610
and in here, you can see there is the IP address, there's the subnet mask, and there is the default gateway.

32
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.020
I can also see other information in here, such as the DNS servers, the IP address of my DHCP server,

33
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.740
etc.

34
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.850
Okay, so that's how you set your IP address in Windows, and also how you verify it with the 'ipconfig'

35
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.240
command.

36
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.930
Next up, let's have a look at Mac.

37
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:19.290
So, I've got my Mac OS open here. To configure your IP address in Mac, go up to the top left, click

38
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.030
on the Apple icon here, and then select System Preferences,

39
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.290
and then click on Network.

40
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.050
And then you'll see with Mac, it's a little bit different than Windows. The GUI will actually tell

41
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.090
you directly in here what your IP address is.

42
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.400
Again, it's using DHCP by default,

43
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.650
and I can see my IP settings in here.

44
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.890
If I wanted to change this to be a manually set IP address, I just click on the dropdown and I would

45
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.500
choose Manually in there, and then that gives me the option to enter my IP information.

46
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:05.100
If I want to check this at the command line, then what I do is just open up a terminal, and in Windows,

47
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:13.910
it was 'ipconfig'. In Mac OS and in Linux, that you'll see in a second, it's 'ifconfig' for the interface.

48
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.320
So I'll enter 'ifconfig',

49
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:22.290
and in there, I can see same kind of information as I saw on Windows, my IP address, subnet mask,

50
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.770
etc.

51
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.110
This does not actually show me the default gateway, so to get that,

52
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:37.200
what I do is a 'netstat' and then '-r' for routes, and 'n' for numerical to see it in IP address

53
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.600
format, and hit Enter.

54
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.580
And in there, I can see there is my default

55
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.430
route, and there is my default gateway.

56
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:57.420
Okay, so in Mac, it was 'ifconfig' to see the IP address and subnet mask, and the 'netstat -rn' to see the

57
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.290
default gateway.

58
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.400
Okay, last one, let's have a look at Linux as well.

59
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.140
So I'll go on to my Linux machine here,

60
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:15.370
and then to configure your IP address on desktop Linux, so I've got Ubuntu desktop running on here,

61
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.210
which has got a GUI running on it by default, a Graphical User Interface, 

62
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.950
I can click on the Show Applications in the bottom left here, then I'll click on Settings,

63
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.790
and then click on Network,

64
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:40.370
and I can see my network interface cards here. To configure it, I click on the settings icon, and then

65
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.300
I can see the settings in there on the Details tab.

66
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.030
So, that's where I can see my IP address information. To change it,

67
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.850
I click on the IPv4 tab. Again,

68
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:57.500
it defaults to DHCP and I could click on the Manual radio button here and configure my IP address,

69
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.200
subnet mask, default gateway, etc.

70
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.120
Okay, so that's where you can configure it.

71
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.620
If you want to verify it at the command line, then go to the applications again and then open

72
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.260
up a terminal window,

73
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:20.320
and on older versions of Linux, so you'll still see this on a lot of distributions, the command to use is

74
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.670
'ifconfig', the same as it was on Mac. You'll actually see that I'm running a newer version of Ubuntu desktop

75
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.430
here, which is why 'ifconfig' is not installed by default, I could install that if I wanted to just

76
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.800
by running this command here.

77
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.160
But I'll show you what the new command is,

78
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.280
and that is 'ip address show'.

79
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:52.120
And in there, I can see there is my IP address, and I can see it's a /24 subnet mask.

80
00:06:52.390 --> 00:07:00.160
This doesn't show me my default gateway. To see that, it is 'ip route show' and there,

81
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.860
I can see my default gateway is at 192.168.1.1.

82
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.710
Okay, so the older command is 'ifconfig', the newer commands 'ip address show' and 'ip route show'.

83
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:21.760
So that was how to configure and verify your IP settings on Windows, on Mac, and on Linux.

84
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.230
See you in the next lecture.
