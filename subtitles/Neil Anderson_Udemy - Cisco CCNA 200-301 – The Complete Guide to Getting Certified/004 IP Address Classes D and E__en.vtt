00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.310
In this lecture, you're going to learn about the other address classes,

2
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.030
that's 

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.510
Class D

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.850
and Class E. You saw in the last lecture

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.440
that Classes A, B, and C include all of the addresses that are valid to be assigned to our end hosts, and

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.200
those addresses went up from a one in the first octet, up to two, to three.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.490
But you're maybe thinking, what about 224.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255?

8
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.770
Because you know that the maximum value in each of our octets is 255,

9
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.060
we only went up to 223.

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.670
Well, the next class is Class D, and Class D is used for multicast addresses.

11
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.130
You'll learn about what multicast is right on the next slide. With Class D,

12
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.470
the four high-order bits, the first four bits, in the first octet are always set to the binary value of

13
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.310
1 1 1 0.

14
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.820
We can actually count this up. If you look at the first octet down in the bottom on the left here, we've

15
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.070
assigned the bits 1 1 1 0,

16
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.210
a Class D always begins like that.

17
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.330
So if we added these up, 128 plus 24 plus 32 is 224.

18
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.600
So the lowest address is going to be 224, and then the remaining bits over to the right are 8,

19
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.190
4, 2, and 1.

20
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.120
If we add those up, it adds up to 15, and 224 plus 15 adds up to 239.

21
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.620
So, that's where we get the range of 224 to 239 from. These Class D addresses, they're not allocated to

22
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:58.590
hosts, and there's no default subnet mask. They're used just for multicast traffic. So to see how multicast

23
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.920
works, let's do a quick review of unicast first.

24
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.419
I've got my sender over on the left, which has got the source IP address 10.10.10.10, and

25
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.540
it's going to send traffic to destinations at 10.10.10.15 and

26
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.780
10.10.20.15

27
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.720
So it sends traffic to 10.10.10.15, and if you look in the packet in the Layer 3

28
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.470
IP header, you would see the source IP address is 10.10.10.10.

29
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.420
The destination is 10.10.10.15, and if we're using a /24 subnet mask, they're both in

30
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.090
the same subnets so that traffic can go directly between the hosts without having to go via a router.

31
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.160
Let's say that the host then sends traffic to the other hosts up in the top right.

32
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.180
Let's say that this is a video stream that we're sending again.

33
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.690
So we've unicast it to 10.10.10.15,

34
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.420
we then unicast it to 10.10.20.15 as well.

35
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.300
If you look in the IP header, again, unicast traffic, the source address is 10.10.10.10,

36
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.170
the destination address is 10.10.20.15.

37
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.010
Again, we were using that /24 subnet mask,

38
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.770
so they're on different networks,

39
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.560
so the traffic is going to have to go via a router.

40
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.580
And if this was video streaming we were doing here,

41
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.280
it's two completely separate pieces of traffic, so it's going to use 2 MB if it was 1 MB per stream.

42
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.540
We can improve this by using multicast traffic. With multicast traffic,

43
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.670
we're going to send one copy of the traffic from 10.10.10.10, and that one copy

44
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.820
is going to get sent to 10.10.10.15 and 10.10.20.15 as well.

45
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.170
We are going to run an application on the sender, which is going to send it as multicast traffic, and in

46
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.750
our example, we're going to send it to a destination multicast address of 239.0.0.1.

47
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.570
It still comes from the same source address of 10.10.10.10, and the destinations

48
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.350
still have their normal unicast addresses there as well,

49
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.899
but we send it to this special multicast address. That will then go to all of the hosts that were interested

50
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.000
in getting that traffic.

51
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.220
A good analogy of this is you can think of it like tuning into a radio station.

52
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.500
So on those hosts, 10.10.10.15 and 10.10.20.15,

53
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.020
they run an application on there that said they wanted to receive the stream for 239.0.0.1.

54
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.510
As long as you've configured support for this on your routers, that traffic will get forwarded to all of the

55
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.720
hosts that are interested in receiving it. And the benefit you get is,

56
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.190
for example, here, we're only sending 1 MB worth of bandwidth rather than 2 MB, and if there was 50 interested

57
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.640
hosts, it would still just be 1 MB worth of bandwidth rather than 50 MB. So, you save a lot on the

58
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.010
bandwidth that you're using. It makes things a lot more efficient.

59
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.870
Moving on to Class E addresses, they are experimental and reserved for future use.

60
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.110
The first bits in a Class E are always set to 1 1 1 1.

61
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:34.110
So again, if we count it up, that's going to give us the possible values of 240.0.0.0

62
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.360
to 255.255.255.

63
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.480
Just like our Class D multicast addresses, these addresses do not have a default subnet mask.

64
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.190
There is one special address that is actually used in Class E, which is the broadcast address of

65
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.220
255.255.255.255.

66
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.730
That is the broadcast address for 'this network', meaning whatever network the source is on, it's a broadcast

67
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.100
for that network.

68
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080
Actually, while we're talking about broadcast traffic, let's just go back to the previous slide for a minute,

69
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.830
and I'll explain further about why multicast is different and can be more efficient than broadcast

70
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.720
traffic.

71
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.940
Notice in the example here, on the local subnet, the hosts that are attached to the switch, it only went

72
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.360
to the top host at 10.10.10.15.

73
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.510
The traffic did not get sent down to the host below that at the bottom. If this was broadcast traffic,

74
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:38.140
it would be sent to all hosts on that subnet, not just the ones that wanted it. So multicast is more targeted,

75
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.870
it's more efficient.

76
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:46.020
Another difference is that as long as you configured your routers to support it, routers will forward

77
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.350
multicast traffic,

78
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.750
so that's how we were able to get it to the host up in the top right. Broadcast

79
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:59.990
traffic does not go outside its own local subnet. It does not get forwarded by routers by default.

80
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.910
Okay, so about was our Class D and our Class E addresses. These Class E reserved addresses, they are never really

81
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.780
used.

82
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.090
You need to know what they are, and particularly for the CCNA exam. But in real world, you'll never come

83
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.730
across Class E addresses. They're not used in production environments. Class D

84
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.170
addresses are used

85
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.840
if you're using multicast.

86
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.810
Okay,

87
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.780
so that was our Class D and our Class E addresses.

88
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:38.500
Let's just have a look at a summary of the different classes before we move on. So, Class A is 1 to 126 in the

89
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.490
first octet.

90
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.750
The default subnet mask is a /8.

91
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:49.450
Class B is 128 to 191, and that defaults to a /16.

92
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:58.810
Class C is 192 to 223, and that defaults to a /24. Classes A, B, and C are the classes that can be assigned

93
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.660
to hosts. Class D is for multicast, that uses 224 to 239,

94
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:14.650
and Class E is experimental. That's 240 to 255. You want to have these classes committed to memory,

95
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:21.220
not just for the CCNA exam, where they're completely essential. They're also completely essential for real

96
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.430
world networking as well.

97
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.140
Okay, that's it.

98
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.330
See you in the next lecture.
