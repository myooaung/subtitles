00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:17.130
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure basic line level security on a Cisco device and for this

2
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.480
animal, I'm going to use the Rohter are one that you can see in the diagram.

3
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
It's got an IP address already configured on their TANDOOR order one.

4
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.480
And I've got a couple of pigs, PC one and PC, which have got IP connect to the E to the PC one is

5
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.260
also connected up with a console cable as well.

6
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.070
So let's have a look at our one.

7
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.860
So I will jump on there.

8
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.160
And if I go to the table right now, you'll see that I don't have any security.

9
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.730
It configured on heat as well.

10
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.330
Basically, I've just configured a hostname on the IP address.

11
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.420
So when I go, AN�BAL, I'm not going to be prompted for a password and I can sure run.

12
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.480
And you see, I've got IP addresses on there and I've got no configuration under my control or my virtual

13
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.050
terminal lines.

14
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.370
So first thing to do is to secure the console access.

15
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.880
So I'll go to global configuration line console and I'll do a question mark.

16
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.750
And you see that I've only got one line, so it's going to be away in zero and then I'll put a password

17
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.650
on here, so I'll share a password.

18
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.580
Lock box one.

19
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.500
Now, you also need to put in the logging command as well.

20
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.840
So let's see what happens when I don't do that.

21
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.220
So I'll actually, if you're an then return and you see I get an immediately, it didn't prompt me for

22
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.160
a password to get the password prompt.

23
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.990
I'll go back to global configuration waying console zero.

24
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.880
I've already configured the password.

25
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.220
I also have to see a log in as well when I see a log in with no other keywords.

26
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.070
After that it means use the password.

27
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.590
I just configured the line level.

28
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.050
So now if I exit the console when I hit enter again, this is this would be the same if a new user was

29
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.020
hooking up with the physical control cable now will see a prompt to enter the password.

30
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.190
If I put in the wrong password, it's going to prompt me for the password again.

31
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.300
Doesn't let me in.

32
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:45.090
So I'll put in the correct password and you'll see I've no goal in the user level at this stage.

33
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.320
I still haven't enabled and enabled password so I can get to the privilege, the exact mode with new

34
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.150
password prompt there.

35
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.270
Now you saw earlier that I hadn't configured anything under the control.

36
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.650
I and I just that I hadn't configured anything under VTE.

37
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.830
Why fi virtual terminal lines either.

38
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.160
So if I go on to one of the pieces I'll go on to pick one.

39
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.270
And if I to tell if I tried to tell it to either attend or the old one is going to tell me that the

40
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.740
connection was closed because I can't tell in the end because you cannot use telnet unless you explicitly

41
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.220
allow it on the router to do that.

42
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.100
Next I'll go back on to ah one again, I'll go to global config and now I want to go online.

43
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.070
VTE why the first available one is zero and if I do a space and a question mark you can see the highest

44
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.600
number there is fifteen.

45
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.990
So I've got sixteen available lines on here.

46
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.820
Zero and then one to fifteen.

47
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.350
I want to enable you to eight and enable administrators to log in and all of them.

48
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.470
So I'm going to configure zero to fifteen.

49
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.140
I'll configure a password on here.

50
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.630
Let's use the same password so I could use the same password or a different password than I used to

51
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.830
on the console and remember to see a log in again.

52
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.740
And that is telnet access enabled on the row tonight uses Viveka UI lines as well.

53
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.240
But I would need to do some additional configuration to allow associates access.

54
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.880
You'll see to do that and only early next year.

55
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:36.030
So if I try on PC one again to Telnet and you see that Talana is enabled now it prompts me for the password.

56
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:44.610
So I will enter the password and again I get in the user prompt and because verbals new enable password

57
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.950
set, I'm going to get an error message here.

58
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.780
And I'm sure it's really important that when you went to leave town, that doing just enable town to

59
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.280
access, you need to configure the AN�BAL secret as well.

60
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.660
We didn't need to do that at the console, but for telnet, you're going to need to do both.

61
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.670
So we'll get onto that in a few minutes.

62
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:14.770
You can see right now that Tony, access is enabled if I try on P.c two as well, it's also got connectivity

63
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.610
to the router.

64
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.420
So if I tell that to it from PC to as well, I'm going to get prompted for the password.

65
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.980
And I can also log in from PC to if I knew the password here.

66
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.900
Next up, let's say that I want to secure this a bit more.

67
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.840
If I look back at the diagram, I see that my administrator uses PC one.

68
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.940
PC two is just another normal user, but should not have any access to the driver.

69
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:51.220
So I'm going to configure an ACL on our one that restricts town oxygen just to the administrator workstation

70
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.280
at Tandoor or not tan.

71
00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.690
So I will go on to our one and go global config.

72
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:12.310
And this is the standard oxalis axis list one and I'm going to permit 10 or ten, which is PC one and

73
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:24.850
I'll go back to line VXI zero 15 and she access class one in which means only IP address is specified

74
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.580
in the ECL are going to be allowed to telnet.

75
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:36.220
And so I'll go back to PC one again and I will exit the session.

76
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.870
I'll try to tell that.

77
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:47.170
And again I get prompted for the password and if I enter the correct password, I can log in from pi�ce

78
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.590
one.

79
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.010
But if I go to PC two, I notice that it didn't kick existing sanctions.

80
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.780
It's only going to be for new sanctions.

81
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.820
So if I exit here and then try to telnet in again, I get Conexion refused by remote host because this

82
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.780
IP address was not allowed in the e-mail.

83
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.360
OK, so that was my town.

84
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.440
It secured.

85
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.650
So I can't get to the enable prompt here.

86
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.740
So I need to set and enable password.

87
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:29.360
So I will go back onto our one and I'll see enable password for lock box to know.

88
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:37.780
The problem with this is if I do a show run, you can see the enable password as shown in plain text

89
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.050
there.

90
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.000
So if I ever do a show run and somebody is looking over my shoulder, we're going to see what the enable

91
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.780
password is.

92
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.790
I don't want that to happen.

93
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.220
So do not configure and enable password.

94
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.450
So I'm going to remove that.

95
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:58.810
I'll see no enable password and instead I'll see enable secret and I'll use the same password again,

96
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.790
which was black box to.

97
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.550
And now if I do, a show will run.

98
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.660
The enabling secret is not shown in plain text.

99
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.770
It's encrypted.

100
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:18.250
OK, so that was my enabled secret set and if I go back to telnet in again.

101
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.110
So let's go back onto to one now.

102
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.860
If I try to get to enable, I'm going to ask me for a password.

103
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:31.190
I can enter the password here and again, I'll try to do it without a typo.

104
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.590
And there you see, I got to the enable prompt.

105
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.260
OK, last thing to show you.

106
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.789
Here we go back on to our one.

107
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.429
And in my short run again.

108
00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:51.170
Even though I've sat and able secrets of I enable password is encrypted, my passwords on my V.T. Y

109
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:56.140
lines and on the console are still shown in plain text.

110
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.340
I don't want that to happen either.

111
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.170
So I will go to global config and command.

112
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:08.690
I want to enter a service password encryption.

113
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.580
What this does is it will encrypt all passwords in the running config.

114
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.070
So if I do, I do.

115
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.580
Sure.

116
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.340
Run and scroll down to the bottom.

117
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.610
You can see that it was lying level passwords are encrypted now as well.

118
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.860
OK, so that's how to configure basic Wynant level password security.

119
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.000
See you in the next lecture where we're going to get into some more security details.
