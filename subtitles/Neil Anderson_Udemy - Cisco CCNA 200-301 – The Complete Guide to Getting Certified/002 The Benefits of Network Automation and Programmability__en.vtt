00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.760
In this lecture, you'll learn about the benefits the network programmability and automation provides

2
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.380
over traditional network management, looking at traditional network management first, the way that

3
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.160
that is done is by configuring your network devices, your viewers, your switches, firewalls, etc.,

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.110
one at a time using S.H. to the command line.

5
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.930
So if you have a network administrator and you have to configure five hours and five switches right

6
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.320
now, what you'll do is you will connect to them separately and you will configure them each individually,

7
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.790
one at a time.

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.580
And copying and pasting a config from a text file is the usual way of doing things as well as the command

9
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.940
line.

10
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:05.250
Guey tools have also been available for a long time that what you work on rotors and switches and firewalls

11
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.220
one at a time, but they are typically very smooth to use, which makes an efficient.

12
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.850
So network administrators will usually use the command line.

13
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.170
There are also Annemasse network management systems such as Solar Wings and Cisco Works that used to

14
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.000
be available quite a long time ago.

15
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:35.150
And Cisco, prime infrastructure, they use protocols such as S&P and net flu to gather information

16
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.170
from the network devices and report on the state of the network.

17
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.510
S&P was originally proposed in 1988.

18
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.480
So it's been out for a very long time, as well as being able to pull information from network devices.

19
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.500
S&P can also be used to push configuration to them as well, but it's got limited functionality there.

20
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.220
So it's used more commonly for pooling information and reporting rather than for pushing configuration.

21
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.990
Those solutions can be complex to implement and operate.

22
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.810
And S&P also has some security concerns as well.

23
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.180
So looking at the issues with traditional network management, configuring one device at a time is time

24
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.970
consuming and inefficient.

25
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.120
Obviously, if you have got 30 devices that you need to configure there, it's going to be a lot quicker

26
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.200
if you can push the configuration to them all in one go, rather than logging in and configuring each

27
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.630
one one at a time by configuring each one, one at a time.

28
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.100
That also increases the likelihood of typos and other mistakes as well.

29
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.490
So maybe you do one configuration on device if you accidentally do a different configuration on device.

30
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:05.170
The individual edits to multiple devices by different network engineers over time with little version

31
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.560
control also needs to configuration drift where you've got no one standardized configurations.

32
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.870
So the first network engineer might configure a particular feature in one way.

33
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.500
A different network engineer might configure it in a different way.

34
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.400
And having those non-standard IDE configurations and accessing one device a time is also inefficient

35
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.750
for troubleshooting.

36
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.090
So let's look at network automation now and the benefits that it can bring, automation can be used

37
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.160
for device configuration, pushing your configuration to your devices.

38
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.070
Also the initial device provisioning when it first comes from the factory, you can use it for software

39
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.740
version to control to make sure that your devices have the same types of running, the same software

40
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.940
version on there.

41
00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.190
You can use it to collect statistics from devices and report on those.

42
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.970
You can also use it for compliance verification so you can take your new and good configuration.

43
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.810
The device should have and use automation to check that that is what is actually configured on the device.

44
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It can also be used for troubleshooting as well because automation can provide an organization wide

45
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.910
view of the network, which means that you can do system wide troubleshooting rather than having to

46
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.470
do one device a time.

47
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.360
Network programmability enables the automation and reduces human to machine interaction, when you've

48
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.950
got a machine that's doing the work, it's going to do exactly what you tell it to do.

49
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.000
Machines don't make mistakes.

50
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.060
So if it is a mistake, it will be because you have mis configured the machine.

51
00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:00.240
By having a machine do that work, that greatly reduces the chance of human errors such as typos, modern

52
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.380
programmability and automation tools have been built with monitoring, configuration and troubleshooting

53
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.370
in mind.

54
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.110
It's much more scalable when you can use automation to manage multiple devices at the same time, rather

55
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.940
than doing them one at a time.

56
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.040
Network programmability can provide configuration version control.

57
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.630
You can use that to look at the history of what changes have been made.

58
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:35.100
It's also very easy to roll back to a previous version if it is required, and as well as the configuration

59
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.660
version control where you're checking what changes have been made to the configuration on device.

60
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.570
It can also provide software version control.

61
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.120
Where you check the operating system on your different devices is the one that it should be.

62
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.410
Troubleshooting is more efficient with a system wide view, but where you can cardelli events between

63
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.990
your different devices, all in one global view, rather than trying to do it, the old manual way of

64
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:10.330
one time events and at records can be acted on programming program ICLEI so you can automate your response

65
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.620
if there is a problem.

66
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:18.720
And improving configuration and troubleshooting efficiency obviously reduces your operational expenses.

67
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.470
Automation also provides students which can ensure devices have a standardized configuration, it can

68
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.300
also provide reports on and correct any exceptions to that.

69
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.100
It provides correlation between events on different devices for easier troubleshooting, and it can

70
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.230
take corrective action on events and enter codes.

71
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.010
OK, so that is the benefits that we get from automation.

72
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.950
Which automation methods should you use?

73
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.950
Well, it depends on your particular environment because there's lots of different ways, lots of different

74
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:03.290
software tools that you can use to implement this, such as Python Script, Netcom, Rascon, Ansible,

75
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.310
Poppit Estienne, Cisco DNA Center, etc..

76
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.260
We're going to be talking about all of those different options.

77
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.450
You're going to learn about them all in this section.

78
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.400
They all know all of those methods are supported by all devices.

79
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:26.210
So which one you're going to use depends on what is supported in your environment, what is most suitable

80
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.380
for your environment, and also the skills that you have as well.

81
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.390
So maybe you'll be able to use Ansible because they are simple, but you don't have python skills right

82
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.590
now.

83
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.490
Well, in not case, Ansible would be a better choice for you.

84
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.560
Don't want worry.

85
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.710
Buy all the different methods you see there because you are going to learn about them all in this section.

86
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:53.900
OK, before I wrap up here, I want to show you automation in action so that you can visualize this

87
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.020
and get an idea of how useful it is.

88
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:04.730
So something you've seen before, it is configuring a virtual machine in Amazon Web Services.

89
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:11.570
So you can see here, I've logged into my AWB account and I want to configure a virtual machine here.

90
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.850
So first off, I choose the operating system that I want the virtual machine to be running.

91
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.160
So I will select that.

92
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:26.370
Then on the next page, I select how powerful I want this virtual machine to be, how many virtual ships

93
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.240
use it will have and how much memory.

94
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.490
And then I click next on there.

95
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.250
And then on this page, you see I've got all the networking details, so I select the network that I

96
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.390
want to use here.

97
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:46.520
The subnet, if I want it to have an IP address, etc, then I can figure the storage, the type of

98
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.910
storage I want this virtual machine to have and how much it needs.

99
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:57.500
I can add tags, which makes it easier to manage and then I can figure this to a group where is where

100
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.780
I can figure the firewall rules.

101
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:07.430
Can you see the way that this works is Versova Web based front end bot will then talk to some software

102
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:14.390
behind here which automatically configure is the virtual machine with the settings that I requested

103
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:14.630
here.

104
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:20.300
Now the old traditional way of doing this, if you wanted a new server, is you would talk to the different

105
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.010
items.

106
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:27.560
You would have to speak to the server team, also the storage team and the networking team as well.

107
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.540
Everything would be done manually.

108
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:35.000
It would maybe take a few weeks to get this server up and running with automation.

109
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The server can be running in fifteen minutes.

110
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:45.180
Now, obviously, when we put these settings in, it's not being done manually by people over HWC.

111
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.160
This is all being automated through software and it would be impossible for us to do this manually.

112
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.470
Their business model would not work.

113
00:09:54.710 --> 00:10:01.910
So you can see when we've got a very large environment, the benefits of automation are very obvious

114
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.120
if you're in a small environment.

115
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.550
So you can still get benefits of automation as well.

116
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:14.540
So if you're just configuring five devices, it's still quicker to do five at a time and it is one at

117
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.990
a time.

118
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:21.500
And also with the troubleshooting, with the system wide view you can get with network programmability,

119
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.870
you're also going to get big benefits there.

120
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.240
So network programming, ability and automation, it's actually a relatively new thing.

121
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.810
We've been working on our network devices, the command line for decades.

122
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.530
Automation is really just kicking off in the last few years.

123
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:43.160
It's been driven, first of all, by large organizations and cloud providers and service providers.

124
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:50.240
But the benefits are going to trickle down to smaller organizations, as well as more software tools

125
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.290
become available.

126
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.160
Now, if you're worried that automation is now going to mean, well, what's the point of being a network

127
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.010
engineer now, then if everything can be done, am I clever?

128
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.800
It's not going to be a job for me anymore.

129
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.530
Well, with this automation, the people that are going to be configuring this, you still need to understand

130
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:10.880
how networking works.

131
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:16.640
So everything that we've learned earlier in the course about, well, all the different networking technologies

132
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.880
are and how it configure them, you still need.

133
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:26.830
Knew that information, so you've got that baseline information now you can take it and improve on your

134
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.260
working practices by using automation.

135
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.050
OK, that's everything I need to tell you here.

136
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.550
See you in the next lecture.
