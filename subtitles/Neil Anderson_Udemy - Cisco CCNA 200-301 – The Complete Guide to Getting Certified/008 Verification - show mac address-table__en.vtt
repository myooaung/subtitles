00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.770
Another command you can use to check the path that traffic is taking throughout your Layer 2 network

2
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.940
is 'show mac address-table'.

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.850
So for this example, we're going to check the path that traffic is taking from PC1 going to R1,

4
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.110
and you can see in the diagram that it should go from PC1 to Acc3, to CD1, to R1,

5
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.550
so let's verify that.

6
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.780
So I go into R1 and I do a show interface for gigEthernet0/1 there to find out the MAC address,

7
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.240
because I'm going to check the path traffic's taking from PC1 to that interface, with the IP address

8
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.420
10.10.10.02. In the example, I can see that

9
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.090
it ends with MAC address 2D02. I then go onto the first top switch, which is Acc3 and

10
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.150
then I do a 'show mac address-table', and I see the entry there for VLAN 1, for the MAC address ending in

11
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.630
2D02, which is that interface in R1

12
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.370
that the outgoing port is going to be fastEthernet0/24, going towards CD1, which is what

13
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.450
I expected.

14
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.290
I then go into the next hop of CD1, and I do a 'show mac address-table' there, and I can see that the MAC address

15
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.840
was learned on interface gigEthernet0/1.

16
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.580
So again, that was what I expected, going directly to R1.

17
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.400
Okay,

18
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.510
let's also check this in the lab for traffic going from PC2 to R1, 

19
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.850
and you can see from the diagram, we expect the traffic to go from PC2 to Acc4, to CD2, to Acc3,

20
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.530
to CD1, and then to R1.

21
00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:02.820
So first off, let's go onto R1 and check the MAC address. So I need to open up in Packet Tracer here,

22
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.370
I'll go to the command line,

23
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.890
and 'show interface gig0/1'. That's the interface with IP address 10.10.10.2 and

24
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.740
I can see that, yes, the MAC address ends into 2D02.

25
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.200
Then, I will go on to PC2

26
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.910
and open up a command prompt on here. I'll clear my ARP cache first, and then I'll ping

27
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.260
10.10.10.2 to generate some traffic so that the switches in the path will learn the MAC address.

28
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.990
Then looking at the topology diagram, PC2's first hop is Acc4, and I expect that the traffic will

29
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.260
go out interface fastEthernet0/24.

30
00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.020
So let's go onto the Acc4 switch and do a 'show mac address-table' on here,

31
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.550
look for the entry for 2D02, and yes, the traffic is going out fastEthernet0/24,

32
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:19.790
and that will go to CD2 and I expect the traffic out CD2 to go out interface Fast0/21.

33
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.310
So, let's check that.

34
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.380
So a 'show mac address-table' on here, look for the entry to 2D02, and yes, it is going out interface

35
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.560
fastEthernet0/21. The next hop,

36
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.650
I know it's going to hit Acc3 because it's come out fastEthernet0/21 on CD2. On Acc3,

37
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.030
I expect it to be forwarded out fastEthernet0/24 to CD1.

38
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.790
So let's check that, on Acc3, if I can find the switch in here,

39
00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.450
there we go.

40
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.970
Okay, so an Acc3, 'show mac address-table' and 2D02,

41
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.690
yes,

42
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.720
it is on fastEthernet0/24,

43
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.970
and finally, the last hop is going to be CD1.

44
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.690
It should be on interface gigEthernet0/1.

45
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:29.300
So let's go on to CD1 and a 'show mac address-table' on here,

46
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.700
and there is 2D02,

47
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.870
yes, it is going out interface gigEthernet0/1.

48
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.520
So that's how you can verify the Spanning Tree by mapping out your Root Ports, your Designated Ports, and

49
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.410
your alternate Blocking Ports,

50
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.310
and also how you can use the 'show mac address-table' command to verify that traffic will be going through

51
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.420
that path.

52
00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.800
Now, if we have a look at the topology diagram again here, you maybe notice the problem in that traffic

53
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.580
from PC2 and that it was pinging all over the network.

54
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.250
It wasn't going through the most direct path.

55
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.780
Real-world networks were definitely going to want traffic to go along the shortest path to make things

56
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.550
as efficient as possible.

57
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.850
In the next lecture, we're going to cover how you do that by manipulating where the Root Bridge is.
