00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.320
This lecture follows on from the last one where we had a look at our numbered ACLs, both standard and

2
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:23.540
extended with a lab demo. In this lecture, we're going to configure a named ACL.

3
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.630
The scenario is that PC1 here is my administrator.

4
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.320
So I need to give them access to telnet to R2 at 10.0.0.2

5
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.820
but nobody else should have telnet access to the router.

6
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.310
And PC2 is my network and monitoring system and from there I need to be able to ping R2 to check

7
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.130
that it is still up and I don't want anybody else to be able to ping R2.

8
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.090
I want to hide a little bit for security reasons.

9
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.050
I'm going to be configuring this on R1 again.

10
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.150
And if you remember from the last lecture, we had a numbered standard ACL going outbound on fa0/0

11
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.580
that was blocking traffic from the 10.0.2.0 network going to R2. So that ACL,

12
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.540
I'll leave it there.

13
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.870
It's already blocking all traffic, including ping and telnet to R2 from the PCs.

14
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.660
So I just need to control my access from the 10.0.1.0 subnet.

15
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.650
I want to allow telnet traffic from PC1.

16
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.960
I want to allow ping traffic from PC2 going to R2 and block ping and telnet from everybody

17
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.450
else apart from those individual hosts and allow all traffic.

18
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.780
Now I've already got an ACL configured inbound on fa1/0 from the last lab exercise.

19
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.590
So let's remove that first.

20
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.949
So I'll go on to R1 and if I do a show run for interface fa1/0,

21
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.130
I can see there is my ip access-group 100 in.

22
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.710
So what I'll do is at global config,

23
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:27.680
I'll go interface fa1/0 and I'll say no and then I will copy and paste that line to remove

24
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.830
it.

25
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.730
Now doing that just removes the ACL from the interface.

26
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.820
The ACL was still there in the running config.

27
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.960
If I do a show run  and scroll down. You see there's still my

28
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.560
access-list 100 so it's still in the running config.

29
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.410
It's not doing anything right now because it's not actually applied on an interface.

30
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.340
Okay, so let's do this configuration.

31
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.630
So I'll go to global configuration and I'm going to do a named access-list here.

32
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.370
So the syntax is very similar, but a little bit different. For a numbered

33
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.120
access-list, the command starts with just access-list. For a named

34
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.540
access-list, it's ip access-list. So ip access-list, let's check the syntax.

35
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.320
I need to see whether it's standard or extended

36
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.940
ACL. Here,

37
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.330
I'm specifying who the source and destination is,

38
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.730
and the port number.

39
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.130
So I need to make this an extended ACL.

40
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.350
The next thing I do is give it a name.

41
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.070
This is going to be applied inbound on fa1/0 interface. So I'll give it a descriptive

42
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.930
name F1/0_in. That way anybody who is looking at ACL later is going to see where

43
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.570
this ACL was being applied just from the name of it.

44
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.020
OK, so I created the ACL and then you see the difference from a numbered

45
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.800
ACL. It just takes me to the ACL subcommand here. And now I can put in my access control entries.

46
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.270
So the first thing I wanted to do was permit TCP from the host 10.0.1.10.

47
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:23.390
That is PC1 going to host 10.0.0.2. That is R2 and I'm going to allow telnet traffic so

48
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.920
equals telnet.

49
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.210
I want to deny telnet from everybody else.

50
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.940
I'm already denying from the 10.0.2.0 subnet with my other ACL I've already configured.

51
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.090
So here I'll deny TCP from 10.0.1.0 subnet mask

52
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.820
0.0.0.255

53
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.240
0.0.0.255

54
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.540
going to host 10.0.0.2 equals telnet.

55
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.940
Now, I did it this way so I could show you configuring the subnet and a wildcard mask. Another way I

56
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.560
could have done it in which you would actually be better in the real world is permit TCP from any going

57
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.510
to host 10.0.0.2 equals telnet. Just in case

58
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.050
that later on, I have another subnet behind the router or on that side and I want to block it as well.

59
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.910
You can do it either way, whichever is going to make more sense when you're doing it in the real world.

60
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.620
OK, next one is the ping traffic.

61
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:37.660
So I'm going to permit. Now this is not TCP or UDP or IP. Ping is part of the ICMP suite, so I'm going

62
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.580
to permit ICMP.

63
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:48.390
It's coming from host 10.0.1.11 now going to host 10.0.0.2.

64
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.790
It's my router.

65
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.580
Let's check our options and you'll see they're for ping.

66
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.080
It is echo.

67
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:06.650
So, I will permit echoes from 10.0.1.11, and then I'm going to deny you from everybody else.

68
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.540
So deny

69
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.480
ICMP from subnet 10.0.1.0.

70
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.300
wildcard mask

71
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.890
0.0.0.255 going to host 10.0.0.2 and echo again.

72
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:31.120
OK, so I am allowing telnet from 10.0.1.10 PC1 to R2, blocking it from everywhere else,

73
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.250
and I'm allowing ping to R2 from PC2 at .11 and blocking it from everybody else.

74
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.960
Now at this point all of it's going to be allowed is just that telnet traffic from PC1 and the ping

75
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.650
traffic from PC2 because of the 'implicit deny any any' at the bottom of my ACL.

76
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.740
I don't want not here, I want to allow all other traffic.

77
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.120
So I also need to permit and it's all traffic.

78
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:09.970
So it's permit IP going from any going to any. That's my ACL done. As usual,

79
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.690
the thing that's easy to forget is to apply it to the interface.

80
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.950
So I remember to do that.

81
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:28.330
So it's interface fa1/0, ip access-group, and I named it. So scroll up to check.

82
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:38.960
And here we go, F1/0_in. I'll actually just copy and paste that in with

83
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.830
a right click and then I can do it either inbound or outbound.

84
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.570
Looking at our topology diagram, on fa1/0,

85
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.110
the traffic is going from the PCs going to R2.

86
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.230
So it's coming in on fa1/0.

87
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.040
It's going out on fa0/0.

88
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.540
So I'm applying it on fa1/0 here.

89
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.770
So the direction is going to be in.

90
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:10.430
OK, that is my ACL done. Now we need to check it.

91
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:18.530
So I will go on to PC1 and PC1 should be able to telnet to the router R2

92
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:25.160
at 10.0.0.2 and I'm getting the prompt so that is all good.

93
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.540
I'll break out there and I'll try pinging 10.0.0.2.

94
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.169
And this should feel like it was unreachable.

95
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.780
So that is all good.

96
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:45.650
And then I'll check it from PC2 and it should not be able to telnet to 10.0.0.2.

97
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.700
That's blocked.

98
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.300
That's good.

99
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.470
But should be able to ping to 10.0.0.2.

100
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.300
Also from here I should be ping my other subnet so I should check where PC3 was.

101
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.990
It's at 10.0.2.10 so let's ping there from one of my PCs.

102
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.560
Ping  10.0.2.10 and this is where it was important I remember to do that permit ip any any

103
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.820
at the bottom of the ACL.

104
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.680
If I had not put that in, this ping would fail. Because I did,

105
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.720
all our traffic is allowed, including this ping going to the other subnet.

106
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.810
I guess that was my ACL configuration done.

107
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:36.350
One last thing to show you is, actually I need to be on R1 for this, so that's going to R1. To

108
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.480
see what's going on with your ACLs,

109
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:49.010
you can do a show access-list. and there you can see all of my ACLs and you can see how many hits you're

110
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.820
getting on each of those different rules in the ACL as well.

111
00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.040
Also, notice here that the access control entries have got an index number at the start that allows me to inject

112
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.630
other entries in between them if I need to later.

113
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.270
So where is my different ACLs?

114
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.130
I can see the configuration on them.

115
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.780
I can see how many packets have hit each of the different entries.

116
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.220
It's all good.

117
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.850
OK, so that was our configuration for Access Control

118
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.170
List.

119
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.210
I'll see you in the next lecture.
