00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:15.140
In this lecture, you'll learn how to do a basic configuration of single area OSPF in the lab.

2
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:25.120
This is our topology, the same as usual, we've got our 5 routers, R1 to R5, and all of the router interfaces

3
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:34.630
are in IP subnets beginning with number 10. And what we're going to do here is enable OSPF routing on

4
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.950
all the different routers for those internal networks, and then verify that it's working. So it's going

5
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.960
to be the same config, can get pasted into all of the routers. So I'll save some time by doing it in

6
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.170
WordPad first, and then I can copy and paste it in. So I'll open up WordPad, and I'll say 'router ospf 1'

7
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:11.440
and then network is 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255, so that will cover me for

8
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.860
all the interfaces. They just have to begin with a 10, which is all of them, and then I also need to specify

9
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.550
the area. We're just doing single area OSPF for a small network, so in that case, we use area 0, and I'll

10
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:36.680
put in 'config t' at the top to save me having to type that in every time as well. So I will select all this and copy,

11
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:52.110
and then go on to my routers. So R1 first, I'll paste that in there, R2, R3, R4, and R5.

12
00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:00.470
So that's all that is to, to do a simple configuration for OSPF. Let's verify it now.

13
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:10.210
So, I'll go back onto R1. To check your OSPF configuration, you can do a 'show run' and then pipe '|' it to 'section ospf'

14
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.830
and it'll show all of the OSPF commands in our running config.

15
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.620
Next thing to do is check the routing protocols that are running on this router. I'll do a 'show ip protocols'

16
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:33.390
and I can see that I'm just running OSPF, it's Process 1, and I'm routing for the 10.0.0.0 networks. I don't have

17
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.300
any routing information sources yet, that's because the adjacencies hadn't formed yet, and I can just

18
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.580
see in the log now that an adjacency has come up there. Usually, what I'll do is the first command after

19
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.940
doing the configuration is the 'show ip ospf neighbors' and there I can see that the adjacency has come

20
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.440
up with R5 and it's also come up with R2 as well. The next thing I would do would be a

21
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.820
'show ip route' and check that I've got OSPF routes in the routing table and I can see that my router has

22
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.850
learned about all of the other networks.

23
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.780
Now, another command you can use is 'show ip ospf database'.

24
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.560
This is usually just used for troubleshooting.

25
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.890
So say you've set up OSPF, put in those commands, 'show ip ospf neighbors' and 'show ip route',

26
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.930
check that OSPF routes are in there, and you're seeing the routes that you expected and that it's using the paths

27
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.820
you expected as well.

28
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.170
If the OSPF adjacency doesn't come up, there's no point in checking the routing table or the database.

29
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.630
If the adjacency isn't there, then it's not going to be receiving any routes. If the adjacency comes up,

30
00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.870
but you're not seeing any routes in the routing table from OSPF, or you're not seeing the expected paths,

31
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.810
then you would do some more detailed troubleshooting. The first command to use would be

32
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.820
'show ip ospf database' and check to see if the routes have actually been received or not. Some other verification

33
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.560
commands that we can use are 'show ip ospf interface brief'.

34
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.660
This will show us the interfaces that OSPF has been enabled on, the Process ID, the area, and if any neighbors

35
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.040
are reachable on that interface.

36
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.390
Okay,

37
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.250
so that was it. Pretty simple.

38
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.080
That's our basic OSPF configuration.

39
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.810
See you in the next lecture where we'll get into some more advanced topics.
