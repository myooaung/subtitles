00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:14.990
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure IPv6 global unicast addresses with a lab

2
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.980
demo. Just before I get into that, is another thing I want to tell you about, which is about broadcast

3
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:32.090
and multicast in IPv6. In IPv4, we can broadcast to all hosts using the

4
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.160
255.255.255.255

5
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.080
destination address. Routers don't forward broadcast traffic by default, so that traffic will hit everything

6
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.190
in the local subnet, but it won't go beyond there.

7
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.120
IPv6 does not support broadcast traffic at all.

8
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.450
It does, however, support multicast to all hosts on the local subnet

9
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.890
using the destination address FF02::1. So that is functionally equivalent to the broadcast

10
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:15.380
in IPv4. Many services which do use that 255.255.255.2555 broadcast address in IPv4, use a more

11
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:24.080
specific multicast address in IPv6. For example, if a host sends out a DHCP request, if that's

12
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.690
in IPv4, it gets broadcast.

13
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.960
So it hits all hosts and they all have to process it.

14
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:39.950
In IPv6, it gets sent to FF05::1:3, which is the DHCP server

15
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.970
multicast address.

16
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.400
So it's only the DHCP servers that are listening for it that will process traffic.

17
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.080
So it makes your broadcast equivalent and your multicast traffic more efficient in IPv6.

18
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.230
OK, onto our actual global unicast address configuration.

19
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.340
So first thing that we need to do is enable IPv6 unicast routing. On your IOS routers,

20
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.150
IPv4 routing is enabled by default but IPv6 is not.

21
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.750
So you have to turn it on. The way you do that

22
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.060
is at global config. Enter the command ipv6 unicast routing.

23
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.580
You're then ready to configure the IPv6 addresses on your interfaces. In IPv4, you would

24
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.550
go to the interface and enter the command ip address and then the IP address. For IPv6,

25
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.100
almost all the commands are the same as they are in IPv4, but rather than saying IP, we say IPv6.

26
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.400
So we configure an address on an interface.

27
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.750
We go to the interface first. In the example here, I've got interface fa0/0 and then the command is IPv6

28
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.380
address.

29
00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.560
And the address that you want to enter. To verify the IPv6 addresses on your router, again in

30
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.720
IPv4, we would say

31
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.070
show ip interface brief.

32
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.200
So to check IPv6 addresses,

33
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.230
it's a show ipv6 interface brief.

34
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.660
OK, so let's actually configure this in the lab. So I'll do it using the topology you can see on the

35
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.710
slide here.

36
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.470
Let's go to Putty and I will configure R1.

37
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.870
I'll just leave it in the top right window here so you can see the topology as well. Because IPv6

38
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.230
addresses do get pretty long. It's pretty hard to remember them.

39
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:47.540
So on R4, I'll go to global configuration, enter IPv6 unicast routing and I'll configure

40
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.790
interface fa2/0 first.

41
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:59.990
It's going to have IPv6 address 2001:DB8.

42
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.730
Notice that I'm entering it in lower case here.

43
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.520
The IPv6 address is not case sensitive, so it doesn't matter whether it's in capital or lowercase.

44
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:18.649
Then 0:0::1/64 is my IPv6 address on fa2/0.

45
00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.850
That's how you configured it.

46
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.040
You enter the address and then / and then a subnet mask all in one command.

47
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.510
That's the correct syntax. And this is on a router.

48
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.210
So also remember to do a no shutdown on the interface. On our switches,

49
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.920
interfaces are up by default but on routers, they're administratively shut down by default.

50
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.120
So you need to remember, do a no shutdown to bring the interface up.

51
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:53.690
I'll also configure interface fa0/0 and that is IPv6 address

52
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.290
2001:DB8:0:1::1/64

53
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.230
2001:DB8:0:1::1/64

54
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.870
And a no shutdown.

55
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:17.500
And to verify it, show ipv6 interface brief and I can see there is the IPv6 address that I configured

56
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.310
on fa0/0 and the address that I configured on fa2/0.

57
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.770
You noticed, there were also these addresses beginning with FE80 as well.

58
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.000
Those are link local addresses. Don't worry about them yet. We'll cover those in another lecture later

59
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.440
in this section.

60
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.520
OK, let's also put an IPv6 address on R2 as well.

61
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:51.520
So I'll go there and go to global configuration. IPv6 unicast routing. And then on interface

62
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.200
fa0/0, IPv6 address

63
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.560
And what I'll do is I'll put it in the full form of the address. And I won't shorten it at all.

64
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.260
So I'll say IPv6 address

65
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.570
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

66
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.070
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

67
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.210
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

68
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.770
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

69
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.090
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

70
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.350
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

71
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.970
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

72
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.790
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:2/64

73
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.700
So when you enter the address in the router, you can put in the shortened version or you can put in the long

74
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.900
version. They both mean the same thing and the router doesn't mind. It will take either way.

75
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.540
I do a no shutdown on here. And now,

76
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:41.620
notice, if I do a show ipv6 interface brief, the router is going to automatically shorten that to the

77
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.440
short version of the address for me.

78
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.360
OK, so that's how we configure our IPv6 addresses on the router.

79
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.330
Once you've done that, the way they work is really the same as it is with IPv4. So all the routing and

80
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.430
switching is basically the same.

81
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.160
But if we want to check connectivity, it's the same way that we do it with IPv4. So IPv4,

82
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.170
I would use a ping. I can use a ping in IPv6 as well.

83
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:17.110
So from R2, I will ping over to R1 at 2001:DB8:0:1::1

84
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.190
and you see that the ping succeeds.

85
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.900
I could also use a traceroute

86
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.550
exactly the same way that I do with IPv4 as well.

87
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.910
OK, so that was a basic configuration to get IPv6 addresses on our routers.

88
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.500
See you in the next lecture where we're going to get deeper into IPv6.
