00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.050
In this lecture, we're going to take a look at how our IGP metrics work in the lab.

2
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:21.300
I've got the same usual setup for the section with my five routers R1 to R5, and the IP addresses

3
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.100
are already configured.

4
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:31.230
I've got no routing protocols and no static routes configured yet. Let's just verifying that, so at the command

5
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.130
line,

6
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:41.150
you can see I've done a 'show ip interface brief' and there's the IP addresses and from a 'show ip route'

7
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.980
I can see it's just connected routes there, so there's no routing configured.

8
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.200
First up, let's see what happens with RIP. So

9
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.570
I've got the config ready to go here.

10
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.860
So let's just copy this basic RIP configuration and I'll paste that in on every router.

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.420
So we've got it there on R1 on R2, R3, R4, and R5.

12
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.250
And if I look back at the topology again, what we're going to check for is on R1

13
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.300
it's route to 10.1.2.0/24.

14
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.220
So when we're using RIP, you know this already,

15
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.050
the path that it's going to take is going to go along the bottom path.

16
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:39.810
The reason is that RIP uses hop count as its metric, and it's only two hops to the 10.1.2.0/24 network

17
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.310
over the path through R5.

18
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.050
It would be three hops over the top path.

19
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:54.240
So RIP doesn't care that the top path has actually got higher bandwidth. Let's verify that at the command

20
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.540
line.

21
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.560
So I'll go to R1 and do a 'show ip route'.

22
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.930
We should see our RIP routes in the routing table now and we're looking for the path to the 10.1.2.0/24

23
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.370
network.

24
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:20.610
I can see it was learned by RIP and the next hop is 10.0.3.2 which is the bottom path on R5.

25
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.930
And it's going out fastEthernet3/0 on R1.

26
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.390
Okay, let's see what happens if we shutdown that interface. So I go

27
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.260
'config t', I go to interface fastEthernet3/0 and do a 'shutdown.'

28
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.310
When I do this, what's going to happen is the routing protocol is going to reconverge. Meaning, it's

29
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.190
going to see that the path is going down and recalculate the next best path.

30
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.380
This is going to take a little bit of time.

31
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.540
So I've just shutdown the interface,

32
00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.000
and if I do a 'show ip route' again, you'll see, actually, what was really quick.

33
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.980
We were just lucky there,

34
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.560
it can often take a bit longer than that.

35
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.600
So it has recalculated the path for 10.1.2.0/24,

36
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:17.880
and it's now going to 10.0.0.2 which is on the top path to R2, out interface

37
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.980
fastEthernet0/0. To show you the effect of convergence, actually,

38
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.520
if I just do a 'config t' and interface fastEthernet3/0 and do a no 'shutdown' on here and

39
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:42.750
'end', and if I do a 'show ip route' again you'll see traffic is still going out to 10.0.0.2 interface

40
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.560
to R2. It will take a little bit of time before RIP sees that the better path is back up again and then

41
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.240
it will move back over to going through R5.

42
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.360
Okay, so that was our RIP hop count in action.

43
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.120
Next up, let's have a look at what happens with IS-IS.

44
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.920
So I'll copy a basic IS-IS config in here. Now, with the CCNA exam,

45
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.070
IS-IS is not really tested much on there because like I said before, it's not really used in enterprise

46
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.209
environments unless they're very large and they've got their own MPLS network.

47
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.940
It's more commonly used in service provider networks.

48
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.390
So if you do study for a service provider track later, you will get tested a lot more heavily in IS-IS.

49
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.850
Anyway, let's put that config in to save a bit of time.

50
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:44.670
I'll put a 'config t' in here at the top to save me typing that every time, and I'm going to need to change

51
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.700
the net address every time as well.

52
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.380
So, hopefully, I'll remember to do that.

53
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.350
It's fine for R1,

54
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.160
so there's my IS-IS config.

55
00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:01.440
Then I need to go back to the text file and just edit this because every router needs to have a unique

56
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:10.380
net address. So I'll make R2 number 2, R3 will be number 3, and so on. So I'll paste this one into

57
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:28.410
R2. Go back and edit the text file for R3 and copy that, paste that one into R3. Back to the text

58
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:37.540
file again, and we need to do R4, copy this and paste that into R4 and then

59
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.500
just one more to do,

60
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.480
which is going to be

61
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.460
our R5 router

62
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.990
and that's going be number 5.

63
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:55.120
Okay, so I'm pasting in an IS-IS config in here, and what's going to happen is IS-IS routes are going to

64
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.440
replace our RIP routes in the routing table.

65
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.130
The reason for that is administrative distance which is going to be covered in another lecture coming

66
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.030
up really soon in this section.

67
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.650
So I'll do a 'show ip route' on R1 and you can see now that my RIP routes have been removed.

68
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.380
They've been replaced with IS-IS routes.

69
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:27.790
Again, we're looking for the route to the 10.1.2.0/24 network, which is behind R4.

70
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:37.000
And right now this is going via 10.0.0.2, which if we have a look at the topology table,

71
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.260
is going along the top path.

72
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.390
Okay, so that's not what we were expecting, right?

73
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.960
Because I didn't configure any costs on my links,

74
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:56.350
when you don't manually set costs in your links in IS-IS, it's going to act just like RIP because all links

75
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.330
have got the same cost by default.

76
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:05.980
So basically, it acts using hop count. But if we're using hop count, we'd expect the route to go via R5,

77
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.570
right?

78
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:15.160
Well, what's probably happening here is just convergence again, where the R1 router will have formed

79
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.680
an adjacency with R2 and learned the route via R2.

80
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.420
It hasn't learned the route via R5 yet. But when it does learn that route from R5, it will see

81
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:31.180
that it's a better cost and it's going to go out the fastEthernet 3/0 interface instead.

82
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.160
So let's just see if that's happened yet, again you can see before it's going out fastEthernet0/0,

83
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.970
with the next hop of 10.0.0.2.

84
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.860
Let's try this command again, and

85
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.520
there we go.

86
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:53.010
10.1.2.0 is now going out fastEthernet3/0 which is what we expect.

87
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.710
So that's a good lesson actually that just after you've configured a routing protocol, if you have a look

88
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.460
at the routing table and you're not seeing what you were expecting,

89
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:09.160
just give it another minute or so and you'll see it will probably reconverge and then you'll get what

90
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.860
you are expecting then.

91
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.270
Okay,

92
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:19.480
so that was the metric with IS-IS, Actually, let's just check it failing over with this routing protocol

93
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:27.100
as well. So I'll go 'config t', I'll go to interface fastEthernet3/0 and I will shut that down,

94
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.200
and then do a 'show ip route' and for 10.1.2.0 you can see it's still going via 10.0.3.2,

95
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.710
so it has not reconverged yet.

96
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:49.690
Again, we need to give it a little bit of time for the routing protocol to detect that the path is going down and

97
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:58.440
then recalculate the next best path. So I'll put the command in again, you can see it's now reconverged and now for

98
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:05.980
10.1.2.0, it is going via R2 at 10.0.0.2, the next best path.

99
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:14.530
Okay, let's remember to bring the interface back up again. So I'll go 'config t', 'interface fastEthernet3/0',

100
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.440
and do a 'no shutdown'. Okay,

101
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:26.350
so we've had a look at RIP and IS-IS, which are going to take the really the lowest hop count for both

102
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:37.450
unless you manually set a cost on your links in IS-IS. So RIP uses hop count as its metric. IS-IS uses cost

103
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.070
but all links default to the same cost.

104
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.350
So next up, we'll have a look at another routing protocol.

105
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.950
We'll have a look at OSPF next.

106
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.120
So this one, I can just copy and paste the same config in on every router.

107
00:09:52.240 --> 00:10:08.980
So let's do that on R1 and R2, R3, R4, and R5. And again, because of the administrative

108
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:15.570
distance, which again we're going to cover later, the OSPF routes are going to replace the IS-IS routes.

109
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:22.110
So let's do a 'show ip route' and I can see that OSPF has not converged yet.

110
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.160
So let's just try this command again, might have to wait a second for this.

111
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.430
Okay

112
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:38.340
and there, I got the message in the log that OSPF adjacency has just come up now.

113
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:45.030
So I hit the up arrow again, and okay, that's just one of my routers.

114
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.470
So I can see I've got an OSPF route in the routing table going out interace fastEthernet0/0,

115
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:58.400
which is going to R2, so that adjacency has come up but the adjacency to R5

116
00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.320
has not come up

117
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.320
yet. I can see that

118
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.840
because I don't have any OSPF routes

119
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.730
going to fastEthernet3/0 yet.

120
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.710
And if I hit the up arrow, I think I still won't see it because I can't see the adjacency coming up yet.

121
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.190
Oh, there is.

122
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.570
Okay,

123
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.850
I see what the problem is. Actually, that last route, that last

124
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:21.030
IS-IS route is for our Internet interface which I did not include in OSPF but I did include it in

125
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.730
IS-IS.

126
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.990
So, that's why it's showing up there.

127
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.220
So don't worry about that

128
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.730
bottom route.

129
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:33.890
Okay so OSPF uses cost as its metric and that does take bandwidth into account by default. If we have a

130
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:43.340
quick look on R5 and I do a 'show ip interface brief' just check the interfaces I'm using, okay,

131
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:52.420
fastEthernet2/0 and fastEthernet3/0. If I do 'show run fastEthernet2/0', I missed out the interface,

132
00:11:52.440 --> 00:12:00.290
'show run interface fastEthernet2/0', I can see that they're set the bandwidth to 10 megabits per second.

133
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:08.000
The default bandwidth on fastEthernet is of course 100 megabits per second so I've set my interfaces on

134
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:17.330
R5 to be lower bandwidth links, and that's why OSPF is preferring to go along the top path rather

135
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.170
than going through R5. So let's just verify that,

136
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:29.570
and from the show ip route on R1, I can see the route for 10.1.2.0/24 is going through

137
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.570
the top path 10.0.0.2.

138
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:41.660
So that's different than what we got with RIP and IS-IS, and the reason is the OSPF does take bandwidth into account

139
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:51.110
by default. If I shutdown the interface fastEthernet0/0 down, which is the one it's currently being used,

140
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.030
then we will see it will fail over to going through R5.

141
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.890
So I saw that my adjacency with the R2 router went down.

142
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:09.470
If I now do a 'show ip route' and check the traffic for 10.1.2.0/24 network, I can see that it has fail

143
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:17.690
over to go via R5 at 10.0.3.2. Okay, let's bring the interface back up again, which was fastEhernet0/0

144
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:26.090
this time. I'll do a 'no shutdown', and the last routing protocol to look at is EIGRP. So let's

145
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:35.390
bring our text file back up again, I will copy our basic EIGRP configuration and paste that in on every

146
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:43.010
router. Again, EIGRP is going to be preferred to OSPF because it's got a better administrative distance

147
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.190
so it is going to replace those OSPF routes in the routing table.

148
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.620
And I just need to do a 'config t' on R5 and paste it in,

149
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:54.990
Okay,

150
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.370
and that should be EIGRP running. It might

151
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.820
just take a minute to converge.

152
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.560
I can see my adjacencies coming up at the command line here.

153
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:14.540
So if I do a 'show ip route' on R1, and EIGRP, like OSPF, does take bandwidth into account by default,

154
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:24.560
so I expect my EIGRP routes to go via R2. If we have a look for 10.1.2.0, it is going via R2 at

155
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.360
10.0.0.2.

156
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.700
Again, we can watch EIGRP fail over as well.

157
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:39.830
If I shutdown that fastEthernet0/0 interface and then just give it a second to converge, so I can see that

158
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:49.490
the EIGRP adjacency was updated. EIGRP does converge very quickly. If I now do a 'show ip route', for

159
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.220
10.1.2.0,

160
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:56.010
I can see that it has failed over to 10.0.3.2.

161
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.860
Okay, so that was a look at our routing protocol metrics.

162
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.250
See you in the next lecture.
