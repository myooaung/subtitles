00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.460
This is a short lecture where you're going to learn about CIDR, which is Classless Inter-Domain Routing.

2
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:22.920
A problem with the original implementation of the classful addresses

3
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.490
was that when the Internet authorities gave out addresses, they always give a complete Class A with

4
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:41.050
a /8, or a complete Class B with a /16, or a complete Class C with a /24 subnet mask.

5
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.930
And this gave a problem that if a company had more than 254 hosts, they were too

6
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.190
big for a Class C, they would have to be given a Class B.

7
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:59.560
And if they had, say, 500 hosts, they would actually get allocated addresses for 65,543

8
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.080
hosts,

9
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.400
so that's obviously way too much,

10
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:12.270
and this led to huge amounts of the global address space being wasted. So CIDR, Classes Inter-Domain

11
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.080
Routing, was introduced in 1993 as the solution or a partial solution for that problem.

12
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:28.210
CIDR removed the fixed /8, /16, and /24 requirements for the different advanced classes

13
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.500
and allowed them to be split into smaller networks, and the name for this is subnetting. Again, we're going

14
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.080
to be talking about subnetting a lot in the later lectures as well.

15
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.420
For example, the Internet authorities could allocate the address 175.10.10.0

16
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.300
/20.

17
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.840
You can see from the first octet 175 that that is a Class B address, which would normally be /16. But rather

18
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.910
than allocating organization the entire /16, the Internet authorities could now assign them a /20,

19
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.430
which meant that other networks in that 175 range would be available to give to other companies.

20
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.200
So rather than giving out a huge range, we split the classes into smaller networks that could be given to different

21
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.950
organizations and meant that there would be less addresses getting wasted. So, companies can now be allocated

22
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.770
an address range that matches what they actually need and doesn't waste extra addresses.

23
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.400
We get another benefit from CIDR as well, which is route summarization. You see in the example here, we've got

24
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.130
ISP A, and they have allocated the address blocks that you see on the left.

25
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.470
So, one company got 175.10.0.0/24.

26
00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.220
Another one got 175.10.1.0/24, 175.10.2.0/24, etc., all the way up to

27
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.050
175.10.255.0/24.

28
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.730
So, they've given out 255 address blocks there.

29
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:21.270
We've also got ISP B, and they've given out 175.11.0.0/24, 175.11.1.0/24, and so on.

30
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:31.980
Again /24s, all the way up to 175.11.255.0/24. ISP A and ISP B get connected.

31
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.670
Now, if we didn't have CIDR and we weren't able to do route summarization, ISP A would advertise it's actually

32
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.700
256 address blocks there. They would advertise all 256 address blocks to ISP B, and ISP B would, vice versa,

33
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.580
advertise all their 256 address blocks to ISP A. But when we've got CIDR and route summarization, what

34
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.900
we can do is the two ISPs can advertise just an aggregate block. So ISP A, rather than advertising all 256

35
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:17.800
/24s, it advertises 175.10.0.0/16, which is a superset of all those 256 smaller

36
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.540
networks.

37
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:27.190
So now, ISP B, it only learns one route to all the networks behind ISP A rather than learning 256,

38
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:36.860
and ISP B will vice versa just advertise one route of 175.11.0.0/16 to ISP A.

39
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.990
The benefits we get from this is that ISP A doesn't know about all 256 networks behind

40
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.880
ISP B. It only gets a single summary route that covers all of them. Obviously, if it's got one route rather than 256

41
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.530
routes, that's a lot less information.

42
00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.870
It's more efficient, it takes up less memory in the router. And if an individual link goes down

43
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.370
in an ISP B, it doesn't have any impact on ISP A because that one summary route doesn't change. It's going to be different

44
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.440
in ISP B, whenever one of their routes goes down, the other routers are going to have to recalculate

45
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.100
that. The benefit we get from this is we're compartmentalizing the different parts of our network,

46
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.090
and if we've got an issue in part A of the network, it's not going to impact part B of the network.

47
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.700
So it makes things a lot more stable and reliable, makes things more logical, which is better for us humans

48
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.340
as well because it makes it easier to troubleshoot them.

49
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.080
Okay,

50
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.740
that was CIDR, which is closely related to VLSM, our Variable Length Subnet Mask.

51
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.860
We'll be getting to that real soon too. See you in the next lecture.
