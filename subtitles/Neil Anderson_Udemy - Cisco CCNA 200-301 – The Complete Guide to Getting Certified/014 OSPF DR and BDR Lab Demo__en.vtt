00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.810
In this lecture, you'll learn how the OSPF DR and BDR, Designated Routers,

2
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.690
work with a lab demo.

3
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.740
You can see the lab topology diagram here,

4
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.610
I've got my 4 routers, R6, R7, R8, and R9.

5
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:32.520
They've each been configured with a loopback interface, so R6 has got 192.168.0.6/32,

6
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:39.650
R7 is 192.168.0.7/32, R8 is 192.168.0.8/32,

7
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.970
and R9 is 192.168.0.9/32, and they're all connected to the Ethernet segment in the middle here.

8
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.320
That's on the 172.16.0.0/24 network.

9
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.580
Again, R6 is 192.168.0.6, R7 is 192.168.0.7, R8 is 192.168.0.8, and R9 is 192.168.0.9. Right now,

10
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:07.260
OSPF has been configured on the routers but there's only a network statement for their loopback interfaces,

11
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.050
so OSPF is not been enabled on these Ethernet interfaces yet.

12
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.280
So what I'm going to do in the lab is, first off, I'll just verify that everything is set up as expected,

13
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:26.200
and then, I'm going to enable OSPF on the Ethernet interfaces, and at that time, because it is a multiaccess

14
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.400
segment a DR and a BDR will be elected.

15
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.770
So my question for you now is which router will be elected as the DR and which router will be elected

16
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.100
as the BDR. If you need a few seconds to think about it, then pause the video now, because I'm about to

17
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.080
tell you the answer. Okay, so the answer is that R9 will be elected as the DR and R8 will

18
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.500
be elected as the BDR.

19
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.700
I didn't say anything about configuring an OSPF priority,

20
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.640
so all 4 routers will have the default priority of 1 and it's the router which has the highest router ID,

21
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.400
which will be elected as the DR. On the routers here,

22
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.500
they've got loopback interfaces, so it will be the loopback address which is used as the router ID.

23
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.860
So R9 has got 192.168.0.9,

24
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.380
that's the highest address.

25
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.310
The second highest is R8, with 192.168.0.8, and then we've got R7, and R6.

26
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.090
So R9 is going to be elected as the DR, and R8 is going to be elected as the

27
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.840
BDR.

28
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.280
Okay, so let's go and

29
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.160
do that and verify that first.

30
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.400
Then, I will manipulate the DR election and make sure that it ends up being R6, which is the DR,

31
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.470
by giving it a higher priority,

32
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.930
and we'll also see failover working as well to the BDR when I shut down the DR,

33
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.780
Okay, so let's do that now.

34
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.760
So I will go on to R6, and on here, let's check the interfaces are there.

35
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.580
So I'll do a

36
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.960
'show ip interface brief',

37
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.800
and there, you can see it's got the loopback 192.168.0.6,

38
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.910
and the interface connected to the Ethernet segment, 172.16.0.6.

39
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.950
I'm not going to show you for every router, you can take my word for it,

40
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.040
they've all been configured like that.

41
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.590
Okay.

42
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.010
Let's also check the OSPF configuration.

43
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:36.820
So I will do a 'show run' and pipe '|' that to 'section ospf', and you can see that OSPF has been global enabled

44
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.880
on the router,

45
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.300
and it's got a network statement for 192.168.0.0, which is the loopback interface.

46
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.970
So right now, OSPF has not been enabled on the FastEthernet interface because I don't have a matching

47
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.090
network statement for 172.16.0.0.

48
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:07.960
And if I do a 'show ip protocols', I can verify there as well that OSPF is running, and I can see that

49
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.630
the router ID is the router's loopback interface.

50
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.080
Okay.

51
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.590
So that's

52
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.740
everything is set up as expected.

53
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.470
Let's now go and enable OSPF on the Ethernet interface and see what happens.

54
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:29.980
So I will go to global configuration, if I can type it, with a 'config t' and then 'router ospf 1',

55
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.160
and over in my other window here, I've got the network statement already typed up to save me typing that in.

56
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.330
So I'm going to paste that in, so that's for the Ethernet interface,

57
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.060
and that will enable OSPF there.

58
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.350
The router knows it's an Ethernet interface, so it knows that a DR needs to be elected.

59
00:04:48.460 --> 00:05:02.350
So that is on R6, I also need to do it on R7. So enable prompt, 'config t', 'router ospf 1', and I can use the same

60
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.930
network statement again because they're all in the same IP subnet, so that will work just fine.

61
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.720
So, that's R6 and R7 done.

62
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:21.880
Next up, R8, do the same thing on there, and paste on the network statement, and I've just got one more

63
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:32.240
to do, which is R9. So at enable prompt, 'config t' again, try not to make the same typo again,

64
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.640
'router ospf 1', and paste in the network statement.

65
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:46.000
Okay, so now, if I give it a second to converge and form the adjacencies, I should be able to do a

66
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.860
'show ip ospf neighbor' and see the neighbors.

67
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.220
And I'm on R9 right now, and I can see that

68
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.060
yes, it has formed adjacencies with 192.168.0.6, 192.168.0.7, and 192.168.0.8.

69
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.680
I can see that right now, they're showing as all 2WAY/DROTHER, that's because it has not completed

70
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.640
going through the exchange and the loading states, and getting to the full state yet.

71
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.800
So now I've given it a few more seconds,

72
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:20.010
let's try that command again, and it is still 2WAY/DROTHER, and there we go.

73
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.740
Now, I can see that the OSPF loading has gone to full.

74
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.370
So now, if I do that 'show ip ospf neighbor',

75
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:39.060
so earlier, they were in the two-way state with all of the neighbors, and now it has completed the loading.

76
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.980
This is on R9, so I know already, we checked this earlier. We're expecting R9 to be the DR

77
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.170
and R8 to be the BDR, and I can see that.

78
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.460
So this is a Designated Router, so it is going to have a full relationship with all other routers on the segment,

79
00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.800
and I can see that. They are all full and I can see that R8,

80
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.300
I was expecting to be the BDR,

81
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.630
and yes, I can see that it is the BDR.

82
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:12.400
R6 and R7 are not Designated Routers, so they show up as DR for Designated Router, OTHER meaning

83
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.060
they're not the DR and they are not the BDR.

84
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.360
Okay, so that was with the 'show ip ospf neighbor' command.

85
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.510
I can see all that information.

86
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.860
I can also do, so from any router now,

87
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.610
obviously, if you are troubleshooting this kind of thing in a real world network and you're looking at a

88
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.900
segment which does have multiple routers on there, you're not going to be able to tell at a glance which

89
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.010
one has got the highest router ID, which one is going to be the DR.

90
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:45.690
So a really easy way you can find out that information from any router on the segment is by saying,

91
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:53.530
'show ip ospf interface' and I can just hit enter there, or I can get more granular and actually

92
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.700
enter the interface,

93
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.240
so this was on FastEthernet0/0.

94
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.650
I can do this on any router on that segment, and I can see there that the Designated Router,

95
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.670
the DR, is 192.168.0.9, which is R9, and I can see that the BDR is

96
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:13.310
192.168.0.8.

97
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.200
Okay, so that's the expected output on the DR.

98
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.920
Let's have a look

99
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:28.530
now on R8, which is the BDR and I will do a 'show ip ospf neighbors' on there too, and I can see that

100
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:34.500
192.168.0.9 is the DR and 192.168.0.6 and 192.168.0.7 are DROTHERs.

101
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:42.669
And again, both the DR and the BDR do form full state relationship with all the other OSPF routers

102
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:43.360
on there.

103
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:51.060
Let's have a look at one of the DROTHERs now, so I'll go onto R7, and I'll do the same command there,

104
00:08:51.060 --> 00:09:00.310
'show ip ospf neighbor' and there, I can see it's gone full with the DR at 192.168.0.9, full with

105
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:08.940
the BDR at 192.168.0.8, and 192.168.0.6 which is another DROTHER is just two-way there. So you can see the routers

106
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:14.810
which are not the DR or the BDR with each other, they just go to a two-way relationship.

107
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.980
They don't directly exchange routes with each other.

108
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.230
Okay, so that was all of the expected behavior.

109
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:33.810
Now, let's force one of the other routers to become the DR, so I can do that on R7. So on R7

110
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.770
here,

111
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:42.100
I'm going to go to global configuration, and an 'interface fastEthernet0/0', and I will say

112
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.250
'ip ospf priority'

113
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.970
is going to be 100, and I'll do an 'end'.

114
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:58.810
Now, it's not going to become the DR yet. It's going to wait until the election is forced again, and a

115
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.900
way I can do that is by restarting OSPF, or by shutting down and bringing up the interface again.

116
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:13.130
So let's just verify that is still not the DR, so on here, I will do a 'show ip ospf interface' and

117
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:22.040
I'll do that for FastEthernet0/0, and I can see there that the Designated Router is still

118
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:28.530
192.168.0.9 and the BDR is still 192.168.0.8. But I can see now that on this router,

119
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.020
the priority has changed to 100.

120
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.930
It was 1 before.

121
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:42.230
So on here, if I do a 'clear ip ospf process', this will restart OSPF.

122
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.360
I'll say yes to that.

123
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.920
It's asking me to verify because this is going to be disruptive.

124
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:53.120
The router is going to drop all its OSPF relationships, and it's going to lose its OSPF routes.

125
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.360
While this happens,

126
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.260
we have to wait for it to

127
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.940
go back to to loading full again.

128
00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.300
Okay,

129
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.040
and that looks like it's done it with the other 3 routers.

130
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.600
So now, let's do a 'show ip ospf interface' again,

131
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:14.090
and now, I can see that the Designated Router has changed here. It is 192.168.0.7. The BDR

132
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:21.490
stays the same, it is still 192.168.0.8. Okay, so R9 does not become the BDR.

133
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:27.380
I've just made this one the DR. The BDR is going to remain the same unless something changes there.

134
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:33.300
If I went and rebooted all of my routers now, then what would happen would be that R7 would be

135
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:39.300
the DR and then R9 would be the BDR, but it's not going to cause a disruptive change, the change

136
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.850
to BDR from R8 to R9 right now.

137
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:50.230
Okay, so that is how you can force one of your routers to become the BDR.

138
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.600
Now, let's see what happens if the DR goes down.

139
00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.060
So what I'll do is on my R7 here, maybe it will do this easily because I'm in Packet Tracer.

140
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.750
I will just powered off the router.

141
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.550
So I've just powered off the DR, so now

142
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.840
let's see what's happening on my other routers.

143
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:25.900
Let's go on to R8, which was the BDR and see if it's detected the change yet. let's do a 'show ip ospf interface fastEthernet0/0'

144
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.620
and looking in here, it's still sees the Designated Router

145
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:39.610
as 192.168.0.7, and now I can see it has just gone down.

146
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:48.460
So if I put that command in again now, then hopefully, yep, I can see that the BDR has now transition to

147
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:56.500
the DR because it saw that the DR went down. And the the next best router at this point in time

148
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.850

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.300
so I can see that it transitions to the BDR. Okay,

150
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:10.420
so that's everything. That is how the DR and the BDR election process works on your multiaccess segments.

151
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.220
See you in the next lecture.
