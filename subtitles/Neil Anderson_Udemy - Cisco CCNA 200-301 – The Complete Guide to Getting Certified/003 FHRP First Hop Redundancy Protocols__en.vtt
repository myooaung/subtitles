00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.930
In this lecture, you'll learn about FHRP, First Hop Redundancy Protocols.

2
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.860
I'll start with just a really quick review of the routing from the last lecture.

3
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.820
So looking at the network topology, R1 and R2 are the default gateways for our PCs.

4
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.680
On R1, we've got a default static route pointing up to the service provider router, SP1, and is

5
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.370
directly connected to the 10.10.10.0 network going downstream.

6
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.020
If either the upstream link to SP1 or the downstream link to the core distribution switch, CD1,

7
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.770
goes down,

8
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:56.190
we've got backup routes pointing at R2, so it can failover around that outage in the network. And on R2,

9
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.980
we've got a similar configuration where its preferred route up to the Internet goes up to SP2,

10
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
it's directly connected to core distribution, CD2, for downstream traffic,

11
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.780
and if either of those links goes down, it will failover to R1. So you see the configuration on the slide

12
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.320
here, we covered that in the last lecture. That was quite simple.

13
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.760
Looking downstream from the R1 and the R2 WAN edge routers, we've got our core distribution layer

14
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.120
switches and our access layer switches.

15
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.880
We've got redundant links between them as well.

16
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.690
They are Layer 2 only devices, so we don't need to worry about configuring the IP addresses or configuring

17
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.800
routing there.

18
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.500
But when we look down at the bottom, at the PCs, they do have IP addresses,

19
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.760
so they do need the Layer 3 configuration on there and things get a little bit more messy at that point.

20
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.320
Looking at the network from the point of view of the PCs, there are redundant gateways. R1 has

21
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.230
got IP address 10.10.10.2 and R2 has got IP address 10.10.10.3, and R1

22
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.510
and R2 are going to function as the default gateway for the PCs.

23
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.540
So, how are we going to configure this?

24
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.500
Well, we could set up half of our PCs to use R1, 10.10.10.2, as their default

25
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.390
gateway, and the other half of the PCs could use R2 at 10.10.10.3 as their default

26
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.870
gateway.

27
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.250
But it would be really inconvenient to set up half of our PCs to use one gateway and the other half

28
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.690
to use the other gateway.

29
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.010
And an even bigger problem is say if R1 went down,

30
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.860
well, all the PCs that we're using 10.10.10.2 as their default gateway,

31
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.580
we would need to manually reconfigure them to use 10.10.10.3 instead.

32
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.730
You saw when we did the routing configuration on R1 and R2, we've got the backup routes there

33
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.830
and if a link goes down, it will automatically failover to using the other path.

34
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:15.780
We don't want to have to manually reconfigure our PCs if our router or the path to the router goes down,

35
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.100
because that's going to be very inconvenient and it's going to be very time consuming.

36
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.010
So we want a better solution than that,

37
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:33.600
and that is where FHRP comes in, stands for First Hop Redundancy Protocols. With FHRP, the default

38
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.310
gateway routers,

39
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:43.410
so R1 and R2 in our example, they have a virtual IP address which is negotiated between the

40
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.040
two of them.

41
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.230
So R1 and R2 both run a First Hop Redundancy Protocol

42
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.530
and they talk to each other and they agree on what virtual IP address is going to be.

43
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.760
There's also an associated virtual MAC address as well, and they negotiate on which router is going

44
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.230
to be answering on which particular IP address and MAC address.

45
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.540
So now the PCs, rather than having to use IP address 10.10.10.2 or 10.10.10.3 

46
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.630
as their default gateway,

47
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:27.060
in our example, they use the virtual IP address of 10.10.10.1. So say that we've got PC1

48
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:35.910
and it is currently using R1 as its default gateway with IP address 10.10.10.1, and router R1

49
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.250
goes down. Well, R2 will detect that and it will automatically take over the virtual IP address

50
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.530
of 10.10.10.1.

51
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:55.020
So PC1's default gateway address does not change, so it will automatically failover to using R2

52
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.570
without having to reconfigure anything.

53
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:09.940
The different FHRP, First Hop Redundancy Protocols, that we have, our first one is HSRP, the Hot Standby

54
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.190
Router Protocol.

55
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.160
This is Cisco proprietary, and with HSRP, it's deployed in an active/standby pair.

56
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:26.920
So looking back a slide, with HSRP, if R1 is the active, R2 will be a standby only.

57
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.310
So, all traffic always goes through R1.

58
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.130
If R1 fails, it will then failover to R2. So HSRP,

59
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.800
it's an active/standby configuration.

60
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.880
HSRP, if you're in a Cisco environment, is the most commonly used First Hop Redundancy Protocol.

61
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.720
The next one that we have available is VRRP, the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol.

62
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.950
This is very, very similar to HSRP.

63
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
It's also deployed in an active/standby pair,

64
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.550
but VRRP is an open standard,

65
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.760
so not just supported on Cisco routers. It's so similar actually, that if you look at the configuration

66
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.740
between HSRP and VRRP, it's nearly exactly the same

67
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.250
apart from HSRP uses the keyword standby,

68
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.280
VRRP uses the keyword VRRP.

69
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:30.340
And the last option that we have available is GLBP, the Gateway Load Balancing Protocol. This, like HSRP,

70
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.210
is also Cisco proprietary. With GLBP,

71
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.310
it supports active/active load balancing across multiple routers.

72
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.310
So rather than just being active/standby,

73
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.390
not doing load balancing like HSRP does, GLBP,

74
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.290
you can have it doing load balancing between the two routers for the same IP subnet.

75
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.240
GLBP is a little bit more complicated to set up and troubleshoot though.

76
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:05.830
So HSRP is the one that's more commonly used and HSRP is the one that's covered in the CCNA exam,

77
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.550
so that's what we'll be covering in the next lecture.
