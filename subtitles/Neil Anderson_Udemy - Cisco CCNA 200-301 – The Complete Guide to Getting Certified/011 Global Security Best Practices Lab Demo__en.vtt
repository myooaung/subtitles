00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:14.920
In this lecture, you'll see how to do some of the best practice global configuration with a lab Damul

2
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.420
So a very simple lab.

3
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.560
We've got a couple of pieces on the left and the tandoor oh oh oh swash 24 subnet, but ah one is got

4
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.900
IP address, TANDO 0.01.

5
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.520
And on the other side of it I was an A.P. server at hand or one one hundred.

6
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:42.270
So first thing to do is to jump on the right are are one and let's configure a log in Bonheur.

7
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:52.120
So I'll go to the enable prompt and in a global configuration and the command is Bonnar log in and then

8
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.830
enter a delimiter like one of the characters from the top line.

9
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.320
Or here I'll use the double quotes and then hit Enter when you hit enter.

10
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.080
But I will tell you enter a text message you want to use and in and with the same character again.

11
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.040
So let's use a banner of authorized users only.

12
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.600
And then when I'm done I hit the double quotes again and hit enter and then that will take the command

13
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.090
to watch check this working.

14
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:35.380
So I'll go on to the PC, PC one and I will tell that to Tandoor or the other one.

15
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.800
And when I do that you can see there is the banner message authorized users only.

16
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.520
I'd then be able to enter my password to log in.

17
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.010
OK, so that's configuring a login.

18
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.660
Bonheur the other thing I want to show you here is configuring and.

19
00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:02.950
So if we go back on to our one to check what the current time is, say, of the enable prompt, we can

20
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.400
do a sure clock and that will tell us the current day and time.

21
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.430
I can see that right now.

22
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.920
And this is the kind of thing you do sometimes wrong in the real world, is that it is the universal

23
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.280
UTC time and it thinks it's March the 1st in nineteen ninety three right now.

24
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.220
So I want to have this configured with the correct time.

25
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.550
I could manually set the clock on the right are here, but the problem is that it doesn't have a great

26
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.180
clock and it's going to get out of time.

27
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.940
Just like if you had a wristwatch, unless it's a fairly good one in a year's time, it's not going

28
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.500
to have really accurate time.

29
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:53.770
So I want to have this synchronized with an external A.P. server that I know does have a really good

30
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.820
clock on there.

31
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.470
So in the lab, let's have a look and see where I were.

32
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.850
A.P. server was its hand or one dot?

33
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.010
One hundred.

34
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.220
So back on our one, first thing I want to do is set the correct time zone.

35
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.120
Let's see that this is in Sydney, Australia.

36
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:26.530
So I'll go to global configuration and I'll see the clock timezone is AEST, which is for Australian

37
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.330
Eastern Standard Time, and Australia is ahead of UTC by ten hours, I'll say ten.

38
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.010
So if you're in the U.S. and you're behind Ukichi, it will be minus eight.

39
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.810
For example, Australia is plus ten, but you don't type plus ten.

40
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.010
You just say ten to me and it's ten hours after UTC.

41
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.850
Then I need to specify where the A.P. server is to the command for that is Antep server.

42
00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.640
Again, A.P. server makes an A.P. client, not an A.P. server.

43
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.200
And the IP address of a server is at hand or dot one one hundred and then real world.

44
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.360
What you would do is you would leave it five minutes or so and come back and check that the clock is

45
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.149
synchronized because I'm in a lab environment here.

46
00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.220
It should take effect pretty much immediately.

47
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:26.950
So I can do sure clock now and I can see that it has been updated to the correct time, which is just

48
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.080
coming up to 11:00 p.m. in Sydney.

49
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.700
I've got the correct time zone there and the correct date on the correct year.

50
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.170
So that looks good.

51
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.410
Another command to use to verify is schedule A.P. status.

52
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.550
And there I can see that the clock is synchronized.

53
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.410
So this all looks good.

54
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.910
OK, so that was a few of the best practice commands that you want to configure a global configuration.

55
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.960
That wraps up the security section.

56
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.460
I'll see you in the next one.
