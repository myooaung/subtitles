00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.360
This is a short updated video about the new Udemy

2
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.510
interface where I'll cover some things that might not be immediately obvious.

3
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.940
First thing to tell you about

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.310
is the review system because you should be getting a prompt to leave a review for the course very soon.

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.970
And the way that the review system works,

6
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.320
as you can see here, is the courses which get an average rating of less than 4.1 can actually

7
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.520
be removed from the system.

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.030
So, the way the review system does work is that a 5 is a pass, and a 4 is a fail.

9
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.280
It's kind of crazy.

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.190
Now, obviously, I'm not going to tell you what review score you leave for me.

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.310
Please leave whatever you think is fair,

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.280
but do realize that I really do care about getting you through the CCNA and making this course

13
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.360
as high quality as possible.

14
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.870
If you do have any issues with the course, then please send me a private message to let me know, and I

15
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.120
promise I'll do my best to fix that for you.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.810
Okay,

17
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.940
moving on to the actual interface. So, you can see that when you go into the course, you'll land on the

18
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.180
Overview tab here by default. Over on the right hand side, you can scroll through all the contents of

19
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.790
the course it's laid out by section, and this checkmark here says that the video has been completed.

20
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.360
So when you've finished the course, to get your certificate make sure that you do have a checkbox and all of

21
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.370
these to show that you have completed the course.

22
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.060
Other things to show you in here,

23
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.930
when you play the video, an important thing is on the settings button here, if the video appears blurry,

24
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.670
it's not a problem with the video.

25
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.610
It's actually a problem with the network connection on your site, and what's happening is Udemy is down

26
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.890
speeding the video because of your network problem.

27
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.490
What you can do to fix it is come in here and set a fixed resolution here.

28
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.960
So, sometimes even if there's not actually a problem on your side of the network, that issue can occur.

29
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.570
Easy way to fix it, if you do see the video was blurry,

30
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.040
just come in here and set a fixed resolution, and that should fix it for you.

31
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.920
Another thing in here is over on the left here,

32
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.260
you can set the playback speed. So if you want to play the videos a bit faster, you could put it to

33
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.550
1.25 or 1.5 is a good suggestion here.

34
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.230
If you find my Scottish accent a little fast, you can also set it to slower here as well.

35
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.000
Another useful button is if you missed something that I just said, you can click the button here to

36
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.520
rewind slightly in the video.

37
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.010
Last thing to tell you about in here that's not so obvious and important is there's also a volume

38
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.680
control.

39
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.490
So the videos are recorded at a high volume anyway, but if you're finding my voice a bit quiet

40
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.650
don't just turn up the volume in your laptop controls. Come in here and make sure it's set to the maximum here

41
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.630
as well.

42
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.820
Obviously, down here, you can use this button to set the video to full screen, or you can set it to theater mode

43
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.840
here as well,

44
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.150
similar to what you have in YouTube.

45
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.550
Last thing to tell you about is the Q&A tab. So, you can click on there, and it'll show you questions

46
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.440
from other students about that particular video.

47
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.410
So if you do have a question about anything in the course, but something obvious, then obviously, you just

48
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.330
Google it yourself first because you'll get an answer immediately that way.

49
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.830
But if not, then leave me a question here,

50
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.140
and typically, I answer questions within 24 hours.

51
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.100
Okay, that's everything that I needed to tell you here.

52
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.570
See you in the next video.
