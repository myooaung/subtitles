00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:14.350
This is the last lecture in the WAN section, and it's going to be just a short lecture on the WAN

2
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.840
topology options. Now, for this,

3
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.800
just imagine that all of your connections are point-to-point leased lines,

4
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.390
and we're just thinking about our WAN connections between our offices here.

5
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.530
Don't think about Internet connections or VPN connections because it will just get confusing if you

6
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.970
do that.

7
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.850
But you're going to get questions probably on this in the CCNA exam.

8
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.990
Easy way to answer them is if you just think of point-to-point leased lines between offices.

9
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.530
So the first of our topology options is a hub and spoke, which is also known as a star.

10
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.610
You see in the example here that New York is our hub site.

11
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.160
Our spoke sites are Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Boston.

12
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.380
So probably, New York is the headquarters, and the other offices are the branch. All of the branch offices

13
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.720
connect to the head office, which is the hub.

14
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.810
So, if Los Angeles wants to send traffic to Boston, that traffic will have to go via New York. We don't

15
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.890
have a direct connection between Los Angeles and Boston, or New York, between any of the branch offices.

16
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.080
The advantages of using a hub and spoke topology is it's simple, and you get simplified centralised security

17
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.330
policy. Because all of the traffic going between your branches goes through New York,

18
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.680
you can secure it in that central location in New York.

19
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.730
Disadvantages are there's a single point of failure here.

20
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.890
If we lose New York, we've lost connectivity between all of our different offices.

21
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.470
Also, it's suboptimal traffic flow. Traffic from the branches

22
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.870
to another branch is not going directly there.

23
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.850
It's having a go through the hub site.

24
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.530
That's going to add some delay.

25
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.480
The next option we can use is a redundant hub and spoke where we put in an extra hub. So in the example,

26
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.450
is the same as before,

27
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.350
but now we've also got a hub site in Washington as well,

28
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.380
and all of the branches are connected to both New York and Washington as well.

29
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.290
That second hub could be in a different city or it could be in the same city, even the same location

30
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.850
as the main hub.

31
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.360
Advantages of this are pretty obvious.

32
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.310
The main one, it removes that single point of failure.

33
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.480
If we lose New York, all of the offices can still talk to each other via Washington.

34
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.250
Again, we have that centralised security policy for traffic between all of the offices.

35
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.370
It's going to be secured in New York and Washington.

36
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.940
Disadvantages, obviously, the cost is going to go up.

37
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.970
We've just doubled the amount of links we've got here, and it's still suboptimal traffic flow because

38
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.900
traffic between branches is still going via the hub site.

39
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.020
The next topology option we have is a full mesh.

40
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.260
This is where we connect every office to every other office.

41
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.980
The advantage is that we get the optimal traffic flow,

42
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.090
traffic is taking

43
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.950
the direct path. Disadvantage is its higher complexity,

44
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.440
and it's going to be higher cost as well because we've got so many more links now.

45
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:42.310
The last topology that we've got is a partial mesh, which is a trade-off between the other options.

46
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.770
So here, we've got New York, which is acting as a hub site, and we've got our branches in Los Angeles,

47
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.240
New Orleans, and Boston.

48
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.510
But here, Los Angeles and New Orleans have also got a direct connection between them as well.

49
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.370
So, this is going to be a bit higher cost than a pure hub and spoke,

50
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.890
but we're going to get some of the advantages of more direct connectivity between some of our branches

51
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.910
by doing this.

52
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.410
Okay, so those were the topology options for WAN connections between offices.

53
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.610
The last thing that I want to speak about here is a related topic, which is Internet Redundancy Options.

54
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.740
So in the offices for a company,

55
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.130
they're going to want to have Internet connectivity there. The first option is Single Homed,

56
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:39.140
and you can see here that the Customer router is connected to a Service Provider (SP) router with a single link. So, that

57
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.570
is a Single Homed connection.

58
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.570
Hopefully, you can see the obvious potential issue there, which is the single points of failure.

59
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.720
If either router fails or if the link fails, then the customer is going to lose Internet connectivity

60
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.890
in that site.

61
00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.230
So for redundancy, the customer may want to use Dual Homed instead,

62
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.100
and you can see that what they've done is double up on everything here.

63
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.100
So, there are two customer routers connected to two service providers over separate links.

64
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.850
So if any router or link fails, the customer will still retain the Internet connectivity.

65
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.510
Now, it looks like there's no single points of failure here, but there actually is one. Because, what

66
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:30.670
if the service provider has some kind of internal issue and they lose their Internet connectivity?

67
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.620
Not very likely,

68
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.100
I know, but it's not completely unheard of.

69
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.100
So if a customer is worried about that, what we can do is use Multihomed,

70
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.600
and at first glance, this looks the same.

71
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.340
But, you see that now, the customer is connected to two different service providers.

72
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.910
So, they've got a connection to the Service Provider 1 (SP1) and a connection to the Service Provider 2 (SP2), and now theres

73
00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:00.230
no single points of failure. The last option that the customer has is Dual Multihomed, which again,

74
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.720
they're connected to two different service providers,

75
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.180
but the routers have got multiple connections to the different service providers.

76
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.910
This might seem a little bit paranoid, but this does give you the highest level of redundancy for your

77
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.170
Internet connections.

78
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.830
Okay, that is it for the WAN section.

79
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.540
See you in the next section.
