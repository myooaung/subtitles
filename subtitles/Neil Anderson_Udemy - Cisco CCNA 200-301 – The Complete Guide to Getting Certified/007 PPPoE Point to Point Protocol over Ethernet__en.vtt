00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:16.470
In this lecture, you'll learn about PPPoE, the Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. In earlier lectures

2
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.020
in the section, you learned about the different WAN options that a large company or large office

3
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:32.250
would use for WAN and their Internet connectivity. Less expensive options which are often aimed

4
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.560
at home user Internet access, are often used as Internet VPN WAN backup options in those corporate

5
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.490
environments.

6
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.240
They can also be used as the primary WAN connection method to the corporate network from smaller offices

7
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.410
and for home users. So, the types of connections we're talking about here are DSL, Digital Subscriber Line,

8
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.860
cable, and wireless, for example,

9
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.290
4G over cellular networks. With these connection types, there will typically be no corporate level SLA,

10
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
because they're going over the Internet using VPN.

11
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.210
So, that could be going over multiple providers,

12
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.100
so there's no way to give end to end guarantees.

13
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.570
So looking an example of how this would be used, we've got a large company here. They've got an office

14
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.820
in New York, it's their headquarters, and they've got a large branch in Boston.

15
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.240
They've got a Leased Line to the Internet from New York,

16
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.730
ans there's also a Leased Line directly between the New York and Boston offices.

17
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.770
So whenever there's traffic between New York and Boston, it will go over that Leased Line,

18
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.310
and it's got a good SLA there.

19
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.240
Whenever users in New York go out to the Internet, it goes over that Leased Line.

20
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.520
Whenever users in Boston want to go out to the Internet, it will go over the Leased Line to New York and

21
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.860
then break out to the Internet from there.

22
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.810
So, this is all good.

23
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.390
But what if that Leased Line between New York and Boston goes down?

24
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.840
The company are concerned about that.

25
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.730
So, they want to put in a backup option. Now, they're not going to put in another Leased Line just for

26
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.870
backup because that's expensive.

27
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.690
So what they can do is put in a 4G, for example, connection from the Boston office out to the Internet.

28
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.800
Now, if that Leased Line between New York and Boston goes down, the users in Boston can still get

29
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.380
out to the Internet over that 4G connection,

30
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.660
and they can also set up an Internet VPN connection between the two offices as well.

31
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.870
So if the Leased Line goes down, then they won't get as good quality, but at least the connection is

32
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.850
still there.

33
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.550
Another reason that they would want to use one of these kinds of options is they've got an office in

34
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.810
London, which is a small branch office with just a handful of staff there.

35
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.850
So, they can't justify the cost of putting it on a Leased Line in London.

36
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.200
They could put in a DSL connection there that gives the users of our Internet access,

37
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.920
and they could also configure an Internet VPN over the same connection for access to the corporate network.

38
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:26.240
PPPoE, PPP over Ethernet, is commonly used in DSL deployments, and PPPoE can be configured on either

39
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.500
the DSL modem or on the router.

40
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.740
So in my experience, it's usually configured on the modem.

41
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.070
So you don't have to do anything special on the router, but maybe in your country, it is common to do it on

42
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.150
the router.

43
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.840
Okay, that's everything I needed to tell you here.

44
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.700
See you in the next lecture.
