00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.360
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure IPv6 link local addresses with a lab demo.

2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.730
The scenario that we have is we have an existing network which is already being configured with IPv4.

3
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.470
And we're going to migrate that to a dual stack IPv4 and IPv6 network.

4
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.300
Another engineer has already been tasked with configuring R2 and R3, and it's our job to

5
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.290
configure R1. So let's go on

6
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.190
there now. If I do a show ip interface brief,

7
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.060
you can see we've already got their IPv4 addresses on there.

8
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:59.000
If I ping 10.0.1.2, that's the IPv4 address over on R2 and that's just fine as well..

9
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.150
If I do a show ipv6 interface brief, you can see that IPv6 is not being configured on here yet.

10
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:17.960
So first thing I need to do is to enable IPv6 unicast routing and then I'll configure my IPv6

11
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.050
addresses on the router.

12
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.590
So, let's check and see what I need to configure. On fa0/0,

13
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.250
2001:DB8:0:0.

14
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:38.120
Actually, to make it easier, I will minimize my {utty window so that I can see what the IP addresses are.

15
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.490
It's pretty hard to remember them.

16
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:52.870
So I'll go to interface to fa2/0 and give it IPv6 address

17
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.970
2001:DB8:0:0::1.

18
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.840
It's a /64 standard and on interface fa0/0,

19
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.590
it's IPv6 address is

20
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.800
2001:DB8:0:1::1/64.

21
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.770
2001:DB8:0:1::1/64.

22
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.550
And I think these interfaces were no shut already because I had IPv4 already enabled on there.

23
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.210
Let's do

24
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.790
a no shut anyway just to make sure. So I'll also do that on interface fa2/0.

25
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.450
And now I will do a show ipv6 interface brief and you see that I do have my IPv6 addresses on there now.

26
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:48.560
So there is the global unicast address I just configured on fa0/0 and the address on fa2/0

27
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.930
and you can see that link

28
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.460
local addresses have been automatically generated using the EUI-64 addresses.

29
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.630
So as soon as I configure a global unicast address in the interface, it's enabled for IPv6.

30
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:12.620
So it gets that link local address. But it's not very convenient or easy to remember an EUI-64 address

31
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.630
so I will overwrite this with a manually specified link local address.

32
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.180
So I'll go back to global config and on interface fa0/0,

33
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:31.490
I'll give it IPv6 address FE80::1 because this is R1.

34
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.160
I don't need to specify the subnet mask, I just say link local.

35
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.890
It's always a /64. And also for fa2/0,

36
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.690
I'm going to hit the up arrow a couple of times and I'm going to give it exactly the same link

37
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.590
local address.

38
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.560
That's fine because it's only locally significant on that particular interface.

39
00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.070
OK, so that is my configuration done on there.

40
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.800
Now let's check that R2 and R3 are already configured.

41
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.240
So on R2, I'll do a show ipv6 interface brief and I can see that that's being configured with

42
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.250
the global unicast addresses and the engineer there has given it link local address

43
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.330
FE80::1 on both interfaces.

44
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.020
And if I look on R3, I'll do a show ipv6 interface brief.

45
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.380
There I can see the same thing.

46
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.440
It's being configured with the global unicast addresses and we're using FE80::3

47
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.660
for the link local.

48
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.090
So if I go onto R1, I will be able to ping R2. Let's just check that connectivity is working okay

49
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.830
with our global unicast address.

50
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.020
So I'll ping 2001:DB8:0:1::2

51
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.700
2001:DB8:0:1::2

52
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.710
for R2 and that is working just fine.

53
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:12.120
Now, if I ping it on its link local address, I'll ping FE80::2.

54
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.370
And what's going to happen now is the router asks me, which is the output interface? Because the link

55
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.410
local address beginning with FE80 on fa0/0 and fa2/0 as well,

56
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.280
so the router doesn't know which interface to send the traffic out of. You don't have this problem when you send

57
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.220
to a global unicast address.

58
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.270
For example, when I sent to 2001:DB8:0:1::2, the router knows, well that is reachable

59
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.830
out of interface fa0/0, so it sends it out there. But with the link local, all the interfaces are configured with

60
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.950
the same prefix so the router doesn't know which interface to send traffic out of.

61
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.730
So in this case we're sending this towards R2.

62
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:05.340
So the output interface is fa0/0 and I can see that that works just fine.

63
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:12.530
But if I try it, ping R3 on its link local address, well R1 is not directly connected to it.

64
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:21.560
So if I say ping FE80::3, which is a link local interface or R3 and

65
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:30.720
interface fa0/0 which points towards R3, this is going to fail. R2 does not forward

66
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.800
packet on.

67
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.320
It's only valid on the local interface.

68
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.390
OK, so that was link local addresses.

69
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.110
In the next lecture, you'll learn about SLAAC, Stateless Address AutoConfiguration.
