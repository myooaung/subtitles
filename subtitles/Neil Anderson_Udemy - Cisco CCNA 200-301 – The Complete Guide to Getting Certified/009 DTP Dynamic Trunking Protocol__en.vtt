00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.990
In this lecture, you'll learn about DTP, the Dynamic Trunking Protocol. If two Cisco switches are

2
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.540
cabled together, it's possible for them to automatically negotiate a trunk connection on those ports

3
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.840
they're connected with using Cisco's proprietary DTP, Dynamic Trunking Protocol.

4
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.810
It is, however, recommended not to use this to manually configure the switchports instead using

5
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.990
the commands that we've been using earlier in this section.

6
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.560
So if you want to configure a port as an access port, you use switchport mode access.

7
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.940
If you want to configure it as a trunk port, you use switchport mode trunk.

8
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.320
But if you are going to use DTP, these are the available commands.

9
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.570
First one is 'switchport mode dynamic auto',

10
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.090
so this is configured under the interface. That will form a trunk if the neighbor switch port that this

11
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:13.610
port is connected to is set to trunk or desirable. Trunk will not be formed if both sides are set to

12
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.670
auto, and this is the default on your switches.

13
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.190
So with newer switches, the default configuration is 'switchport mode dynamic auto'.

14
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.920
When you connect them into each other, it's set to auto in both sides, so they will not form a trunk,

15
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.080
it will stay as an access port.

16
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.010
The next option you've got is 'switchport mode dynamic desirable', that will form a trunk if the neighbor

17
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.520
switch,

18
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.040
the connection on the other side, is set to trunk, to desirable, or to auto,

19
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.560
and this is the default on older switches.

20
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.850
So with older switches, when you plug them into each other, they're set to dynamic desirable on both sides,

21
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.770
so they will form a trunk by default. And the last option is 'switchport nonegotiate' and that disables

22
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.590
DTP.

23
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.250
So your different options for the switchport mode, you can set it to switchport mode access, or trunk, or dynamic

24
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.350
auto, or dynamic

25
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.770
desirable. But recommended is like I said earlier, use either 'switchport mode access' where your end hosts

26
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.180
are plugged in, 'switchport mode trunk' where you've got another switch plugged in.

27
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.820
Okay, so that's it. Pretty simple.

28
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.370
Let's have a look at this in the lab.

29
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.960
The same topology again,

30
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.110
I've got my three switches, and right now,

31
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.470
I haven't configured anything at all in the lab.

32
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.020
So if I go on to SW1, these are all modern switches,

33
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.220
if I do a show interface gig0/1, that's connected to SW2, switchport,

34
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:55.970
you can see that the default is dynamic auto and this is currently an access port, because if I also look

35
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.930
at SW2 on the other side, I do a 'show interface gig0/1 switchport' over here,

36
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.120
it's also set to dynamic auto. So it doesn't form a trunk,

37
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.730
it stays as an access port, and to the connection from SW2 to SW3

38
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.330
is obviously the same because everything is just brand new, out of

39
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.430
the box, here.

40
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:29.390
So if I did want to use DTP to form a trunk here, what I could do is while I'm on SW2, I could

41
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.840
go to the interface. I'll go to global config and then 'interface gig0/1' and I'll say

42
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:49.100
'switchport mode dynamic desirable', and if the other side is set to either dynamic desirable or auto or trunk,

43
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.990
it will form a trunk,

44
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.490
and you already saw that the other side is set to auto. So you see

45
00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:05.030
when I do this, it resets the interface and if I do a 'show interface gig0/1 switchport'

46
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.100
now, they should've formed a trunk.

47
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.100
I can see the administrative mode is now dynamic desirable, what I just manually set it to, and it

48
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.470
has now formed a trunk.

49
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:23.570
I'll just verify it by going on to SW1 as well, onto the other side, and we'll see it

50
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.340
reset the interface here as well

51
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.820
when I set it to dynamic desirable on the other side and it should have negotiated the trunk.

52
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:38.060
So if I do a 'show interface gig0/1 switchport', and there, you see it's still dynamic auto over here.

53
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.330
I've left it at the default, but because the other side is dynamic desirable, it has formed a trunk.

54
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.340
So, that was DTP.

55
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.580
Again, it's not recommended to use this. The recommended way to configure your trunks,

56
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.920
I've put this into a text editor already to save me

57
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.340
typing all out, you've seen this config earlier in the section.

58
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.280
So what I should have configured on my ports

59
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.380
is I don't want to use the default native VLAN at 1. It's a security issue, so I'm going

60
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.190
to say 'vlan 199' and create my native vlan and then on my ports that are connected to another

61
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.400
switch, I say 'switchport trunk encap dot1q' in case that isn't the default already, 'switchport mode trunk', 

62
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.130
and 'switchport trunk native vlan 199'.

63
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.610
Okay, so that was DTP. See you in the next lecture, where we'll discuss VTP.
