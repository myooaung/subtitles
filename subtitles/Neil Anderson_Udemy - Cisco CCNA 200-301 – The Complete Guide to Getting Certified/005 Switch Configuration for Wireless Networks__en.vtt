00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.650
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure your switches to support your wireless network.

2
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.480
I'll start off first with the configuration for autonomous standalone apps where we're not using a wireless

3
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.490
LAN controller, and then I'll show you the config when we are using a wireless LAN controller.

4
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.510
OK, so before I show you the configuration, there is a difference depending on whether it is an autonomous

5
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.950
or a lightweight app to review the traffic flow again.

6
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.120
So you can understand why we do have difference.

7
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.870
I'll start off with the autonomous app so she can see in our example here, I've got a couple of wireless

8
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.970
ones, the gas station and the corporate ulen.

9
00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.690
And we've got wireless app with a couple of clients connected in there and it's connected into the Wired

10
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.260
network.

11
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:12.000
First off, let's say that a wireless client, which is in the corporate YULAN change in a frame to

12
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.070
the wireless app.

13
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.350
So it comes in on the corporate W line with the corporate side.

14
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.250
The wireless app is aware of it, then sends it to the upstream switch, which it is connected to.

15
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.990
And when it does, what is going to target with the associate VLAN?

16
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.900
So it's going to be tagged for the corporate and then that will then be sent on to the final destination

17
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.280
by the switch, just as if it was any other normal packet.

18
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.190
Then let's say that the laptop which is connected in to the guest, will be on it.

19
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.660
Change in iFrame to the wireless app.

20
00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.630
Well, in that case, the wireless app knows it's coming in on the W line, which is associated with

21
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.500
the guest VLAN.

22
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.440
So it will target with the guest VLAN and send it on to the upstream switch.

23
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.550
And again, the upstream switch will forward as it would any other pocket she can see when we're using

24
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.770
an autonomous app, the app is going to be targeting the frames and sending them on to the switch on

25
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.020
because there can be traffic going for different villains here.

26
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.030
We're going to need to have a trunk configured between the app on the switch to support those different

27
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.630
versions.

28
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.360
So let's look and see how we would configure.

29
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.160
It's the same example.

30
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.450
We've got two wireless ones and we've got the corporate W line with the twenty one and the guest W line,

31
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.840
which is map to view on twenty two.

32
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.570
So we will create our view on first.

33
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.300
So global config on the switch.

34
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.060
I have said view on twenty one name corporate and end view on twenty two name gashed.

35
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.790
Then I need to configure the part on the switch which is connected into the app to in our example its

36
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.320
interface gigabit Ethernet one zero one.

37
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.640
I need it configured as a trunk so I actually switch port trunk ANCOP one.

38
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.580
Q Depending on the model of switch you might not need to put in this command some of the newer switches

39
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.080
only support Dalt one.

40
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.180
Q Anyway, they don't support Israel so if only Dalt one Q is supported, it will give you an error

41
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.660
message when you put in this command because it has all it supports.

42
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.330
But if it is a switch which supports move dot one.

43
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.140
Q on DSL you need to specify is got one.

44
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.930
Q You're using to a switch part func ANCOP don't want you Bentzi switch Portmore Tronc and switch parts

45
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.400
Ivon twenty one and twenty two for the villains that are coming in from the app.

46
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.780
OK, this is either switch configuration where we're using standalone autonomous apps.

47
00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.440
Next up, let's look at what we do when we do have a wireless LAN controller and there's a different

48
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.490
traffic Furnari to here.

49
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.620
It will go through the same example again on the laptop, which is in the corporate W on its hands in

50
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.900
a frame to the wireless app.

51
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.519
Now, the wireless app does not now target with the corporate version and send it on to the attach switch,

52
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.650
which will send it to its final destination.

53
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.830
No, the wireless app is going to send it to the wireless LAN controller through the Copwatch Tunnel.

54
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.760
So at this point, the wireless app is not targeting the traffic.

55
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.380
The frame gets sent through to the wireless LAN controller.

56
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.670
The wireless LAN controller then sees it is for the corporate view on because that information was included

57
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.640
when it was sent from the app and it is a wireless LAN controller which will target with the corporate

58
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.650
view on send it back to the switch again and the switch will then send on its final destination as it

59
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.750
would any normal pocket.

60
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.380
So when we are using a wireless LAN controller, the configuration now is it's the wireless LAN controller

61
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.620
which is going to be targeting the frame to.

62
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.030
The link between the switch and the wireless line controller needs to be configured as a trunk, but

63
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.980
the link between the app and the switch is not configured as a trunk.

64
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.410
It is configured as an axis port.

65
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.910
So we're going to configure a management VLAN for traffic coming from the app to the wireless LAN.

66
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.370
All frames are going to go through there with the same VLAN.

67
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.780
So we're not differentiating between the corporate and Degassed Villines on this link from the wireless

68
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.810
app to the switch that all traffic is going to get sent up on the management VLAN.

69
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.060
It's then going to go to the wireless LAN controller when it gets here.

70
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.180
Pinback Box when Vivaan Tag is on.

71
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.340
So when we're using a wireless LAN controller, the link from the switch to the wireless LAN controller

72
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.330
is configured as a trunk part, but the link from the switch to the app is configured as an access port.

73
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.470
So let's look at our configuration.

74
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.110
So in our example we've got the same two lines again, so we need to create the view and so on.

75
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.590
The switch here, a global config, we see a view on 21 named corporate and then view on twenty to name

76
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.220
gashed.

77
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.960
Then because we are using a wireless LAN controller.

78
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.920
We also need to configure valon for management as well.

79
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:38.420
So I've said Valentin name LG Management and View on 11 name EP management in not example view on 10.

80
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.510
Yoshie management is for the administrator to manage the wireless LAN controller.

81
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.440
So you're going to need to go on to the admin guey for the wireless LAN controller to configure it.

82
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.300
You're going to need connectivity to it.

83
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.860
So we've got a view on set up for in this example we're using Vallentine.

84
00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:03.260
We also have traffic between the access points and the wireless LAN controller is the cop WAP traffic.

85
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.890
And in this example we have configured a different view on from outside view on 11 name IP management.

86
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.760
So the traffic that is coming from the EP to the wireless one controller which has come from the clients,

87
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.360
that is going to be in the app management view on also traffic management.

88
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.430
Traffic coming from the wireless LAN controller when it's managing the apps is also going to be in the

89
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.890
App Management V1.

90
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.230
In this example, I used to different villains.

91
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:39.140
I used one for when you the administrator is managing the wireless LAN controller and I use the different

92
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.980
VLAN for traffic between the wireless LAN controller on the apps.

93
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.140
They would both have their own separate IP subnets as well.

94
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.000
You can do that.

95
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.360
You can separate them out in two different Valencian IP subnet, or you could just use one VONNE for

96
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.660
both.

97
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.960
So I could have just configured view on the management and I could have used that one VLAN and one IP

98
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.610
subnet both for managing the wireless LAN controller as the administrator and also for traffic between

99
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.460
the wireless LAN controller on the EP.

100
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.330
It's optional.

101
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.290
You can do it either way.

102
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.950
OK, so I've got all of my vans configured now.

103
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:18.170
Now I'm ready to configure my parts which are connected to the app and a wireless LAN controller.

104
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.690
I'll do the wireless LAN controller first.

105
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.300
So again, when the topic gets here, pinback through the wireless LAN controller back to the switch

106
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:26.630
again.

107
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.080
The wireless LAN controller is going to be talking about traffic.

108
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.789
So to be able to support the different Villines, it needs to be configured as a trunk part.

109
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.850
So I've got interface gigabit Ethernet one zero two switch part tronc ANCOP don't want to switch Portmore

110
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.650
trunk and switch allowed Villon 10, 11, 21 and 22.

111
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.690
So that is the corporate and degassed view on and also the management Vorlon as well.

112
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:56.210
They're all allowed or not link between the switch on the wireless LAN controller.

113
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:04.460
Then lastly, I need to do my configuration for the switch part which is connected to the AP.

114
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.610
The configuration there I see interface gigabit Ethernet one zero one switch for mode access and then

115
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:16.040
switch for access VONNE 11, which was the AP Management Valon.

116
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.610
So now all traffic coming from the attached wireless clients pneuma are wireless.

117
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:29.990
Lan there in is going to be sent up to the switch in one VLAN and it will then go to the wireless LAN

118
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.250
controller from there.

119
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.920
When this topic is sent up to the wireless LAN controller, it does include information about what wireless

120
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.760
lan it is.

121
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.950
And so because of that, what the wireless LAN controller, when it sends the topic back to the switch

122
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.100
again, it knows what VLAN to target with.

123
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:52.040
OK, and this traffic is going up to the wireless LAN controller in WAP tunnel.

124
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.930
OK, that was everything I needed to show you about the switch configuration.

125
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.370
See it in the next lecture.
