00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.270
In this lecture, you'll learn about MPLS VPNs. MPLS stands for Multi Protocol Label Switching,

2
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640
and WAN connectivity can be provided over an MPLS infrastructure.

3
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.740
The MPLS network is usually going to be operated by a service provider, but you will find some large

4
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.009
companies with their own MPLS network as well.

5
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.420
Traffic from multiple customers when we're using a service provider's network can travel over that providers

6
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.160
shared MPLS network.

7
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.490
So, this is a VPN service because it's traffic from multiple customers using the same shared underlying

8
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.480
infrastructure.

9
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.260
When we use MPLS VPNs, the customers are kept strictly separate from each other.

10
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.350
So, it is a virtual private network.

11
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.330
Different levels of Service Level Agreement for uptime and traffic delay and loss are usually available

12
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.480
at different price points.

13
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.720
So, this is different than a VPN going over the Internet. A VPN going over the Internet could be passing

14
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.970
through multiple service providers,

15
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.120
so it's impossible to get a single unified SLA for the end to end traffic.

16
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.140
But when you're using an MPLS VPN, it's going to be with one service provider that owns the MPLS

17
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.640
network. So, that service provider can give you guarantees for the uptime, for the delay, and the loss,

18
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.170
and they will often have different guarantees at different price points.

19
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.950
Maybe they'll have a gold class which will get really good quality,

20
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.250
a silver class, and a bronze class. Ethernet connections are typically used to connect down to the customer router,

21
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.360
and MPLS VPNs provide a full mesh topology by default.

22
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.009
This is different than Leased Lines, which use point-to-point links. With our point-to-point links,

23
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.490
if we want to have a full mesh connectivity, we would need to

24
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.380
put in those point-to-point links going everywhere. With MPLS,

25
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.570
it's different.

26
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.720
Maybe you've already got five sites that are connected into the MPLS VPN.

27
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.560
When you add a sixth site, it's automatically added with full mesh connectivity to all of the other

28
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.020
sites.

29
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.650
This is good because it means whenever one site is communicating with another site, the traffic is

30
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.230
going to go over the optimum path.

31
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.400
So looking at our MPLS VPNs, in the diagram here, we've got the service provider MPLs network.

32
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.780
Obviously, real world is going to be more than three routers there. To give you the terminology, a PE

33
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.190
is a Provider Edge router, which connects to a CE, which is a Customer Edge router, 

34
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.160
and the routers in the middle going across the provider's core, our P routers, Provider core routers. So our PE routers

35
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.160
connect to the CE, which is the Customer Edge router.

36
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.880
You can see in the diagram here over in the top left, we've got customer A, have got an office in

37
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.720
New York.

38
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.040
The PCs in New York are in the subnet 10.0.0.0/24.

39
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.660
Then, we've also got site one in Boston, the PCs there are 10.0.1.0/24,

40
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.060
and there's a second site in Boston where the PCs behind the CE Router are in the subnet

41
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.760
10.0.2.0/24.

42
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.290
So, the example you see here is for a Layer 3 MPLS VPN.

43
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.560
You can also get Layer 2 VPN

44
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.080
that we'll get to in a minute.

45
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.000
So in the Layer 3  VPN, the customer sites are all in different IP subnets.

46
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.050
We can also have Customer B, who have also got a VPN going over that same shared core infrastructure.

47
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.820
Customer B have got an office in New York that's using subnet 10.0.50.0/24, and Customer B have got an

48
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.360
office in Boston with subnet 10.0.2.0/24.

49
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.120
Notice that both Customer A and Customer B have got sites that are using the same subnet 10.0.2.0/24.

50
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.850
That's fine because the different customers are kept strictly separate from each other, and they've

51
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.450
got separate routing tables. So, you can have different customers using the same IP subnet.

52
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.700
That will work just fine.

53
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.520
This is a VPN technology because we've got multiple customers going over that same shared network,

54
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.370
and it's Layer 3 because each site is in a different IP subnet. When we're using Layer 3 MPLS VPN,

55
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:06.180
MPLS runs across the provider's core on the PE and the P routers. The customer

56
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.490
CE routers do not run MPLS. They don't know anything about MPLS.

57
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.160
They're just configured as normal IP routers.

58
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.570
The customer CE routers peer at Layer 3 with the provider PE routers, let's see what that means on the next

59
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.590
slide, and static routes or a routing protocol run between the CE and the PE. The PE

60
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.000
router looks just like another customer router to the customer.

61
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:40.620
The provider's core routers are transparent to the customer. So, the customer can see the PE router because

62
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.660
it connects to it, but it doesn't know that the PE routers going across the core are there.

63
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.550
And like I said earlier, the customer sites are in different IP subnets.

64
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.340
So looking at our configuration here, you can see Customer A in New York, the CE routers peers with the PE router at

65
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.630
Layer 3. Meaning, on the CE side, we give an IP address 192.168.0.2, and on the

66
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.080
PE side, we give the IP address 192.168.0.1. So, the

67
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:18.240
CE router can see that it is directly connected to the PE router. For getting traffic over

68
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.470
to the other sites,

69
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.910
we can either use static routes or we can use an IGP.

70
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.550
In this first example, we're going to use static routes.

71
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:34.770
So on the CE router, we configure interface gig0/0 facing the PE, ip address 192.168.0.2 

72
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.790
255.255.255.252,

73
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.390
and then, we're using a summary route, ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0.

74
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:52.860
The next hop is the PE, 192.168.0.1. So, that summary route takes care of the 10.0.0.1

75
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.480
/24

76
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.660
network and the 10.0.2.0/24 network.

77
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:04.560
So for configuring the CE routers, you know you just configure them as if the PE is another normal customer router,

78
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.270
With no MPLS configuration on CE routers at all.

79
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.510
All of the complicated part of the configuration is done on the PE.

80
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.360
routers, which you don't need to know right now because that comes under the service provider track.

81
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.190
You will not be tested on that.

82
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.380
So, we can use static routes, or we can use an IGP.

83
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.000
Here, I'm using RIP for the example because it's nice and simple configuration to fit on the side here.

84
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.020
So on the CE again, interface gig0/0, ip address 192.168.0.2 with a 

85
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.490
/30 mask, router rip, version 2, 

86
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:47.490
network 10.0.0.0, so that I'm going to advertise my internal networks, and network 192.168.0.0,

87
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:53.700
so that will enable RIP on the interface facing the PE.

88
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.010
Now, my internal routes will be advertised to the other sites over in Boston.

89
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.970
I'll also learn about the sites over in Boston as well, with my next hop address of

90
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.570
192.168.0.1.

91
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.630
So, that's how you configure it with the IGP.

92
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:16.980
All of the different routing protocols are supported technically, but what you'll often find is that

93
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.490
the service provider won't support them all to make their life easier.

94
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.260
Okay, so that was our Layer 3 MPLS VPN, and you can also get Layer 2 MPLS VPNs as well.

95
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.140
With these, the CE devices do not peer with the PE devices.

96
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.600
We don't even see the PEs are there.

97
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.190
The entire provider network is transparent to the customer.

98
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:48.960
The provider network acts just like it's a giant switch, and the customer sites are in the same IP subnets,

99
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.430
not the different IP subnets that we had with our Layer 3 VPNs.

100
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.250
So, this is what a Layer 2 MPLS

101
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.540
VPN is going to look like,

102
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:03.840
which again, got the provider's core infrastructure with their PE and their PE routers.

103
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:12.330
A CE device is going to connect into the PE. You see, for Customer A in New York, behind the CE, which is a

104
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.160
switch here, they're on subnet 10.0.0.0/24.

105
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.650
Then, they've got a site in Boston.

106
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:26.850
The PCs there are in the same subnet, 10.0.0.0/24, and the second site in Boston,

107
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.860
again, they're in 10.0.0.0

108
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.290
/24.

109
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:37.920
So what this allows to happen is across a Wide Area Network, it looks to the PCs like they're all in

110
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.460
the same network, and they're all in the same IP subnet.

111
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.990
So we can do that for Customer A, we can also do it for Customer B as well.

112
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:52.770
In our example here, Customer B are actually overlaying Layer 3 on top of the Layer 2. They've got

113
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:59.670
a router on the left with IP address 10.0.50.1/30, the router on the right is 10.0.50.2

114
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.190
/30.

115
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.480
So you can see from this, the two routers, they appear to be Layer 2 adjacent. The two routers

116
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.970
think they're directly connected to each other.

117
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.230
They don't see the provider network at all.

118
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.010
Some reasons why we would want to use a Layer 2 MPLS VPN,

119
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:24.030
maybe we want to cluster an application over the WAN, and to be able to do clustering for this particular

120
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.810
application,

121
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.560
all of the different servers need to be in the same IP subnet.

122
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.760
So maybe I've got a server with IP address 10.0.0.1.

123
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.690
I've got another server with IP address 10.0.0.2.

124
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.630
That would normally mean that they have to be in the same LAN,

125
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.430
but now with a Layer 2 MPLS VPN, I can put them in different sites.

126
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.160
So, this gives me really good redundancy.

127
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:54.000
Other reasons for using a Layer 2 MPLS VPN, maybe as a Disaster Recovery solution.

128
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.650
So, maybe I've got my main site.

129
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.820
It's Layer 2 adjacent to the Disaster Recovery site.

130
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:05.430
This makes it really easy to migrate my servers across if I do have a disaster at the main site because

131
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.470
we can keep the same IP address.

132
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:16.320
Some terminology for our layer 2 MPLS VPN, VPLS is Virtual Private LAN Service.

133
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.880
This is a multipoint Layer 2 VPN.

134
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.920
You saw in the example I gave you earlier,

135
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:28.430
We had three sites that were all in the same IP subnet. That would be using VPLS because I've got more than

136
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.180
two sites.

137
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:35.570
VPWS is a Virtual PseudoWire Service and that is a point-to-point Layer 2 VPN.

138
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.460
So they both work the same way,

139
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:43.670
but with VPWS, we've only got two sites. With VPLS, we've got more than 2 sites.

140
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.910
Okay, so that was our MPLS VPNs.

141
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:54.740
I showed you the configuration earlier for the Layer 3 VPN. It's very simple from the customer side,

142
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.600
so I don't need to do a lot of Demo for that.

143
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.790
You knew everything that was covered there already.

144
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:04.610
So, we will start with the next technology in the next lecture.
