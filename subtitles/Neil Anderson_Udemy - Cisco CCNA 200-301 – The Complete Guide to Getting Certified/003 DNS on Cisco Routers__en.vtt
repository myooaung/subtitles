00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.600
The commands to configure a router to be a DNS Client.

2
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.730
The reason you would do this is if you want the router itself to be able to resolve FQDNs.

3
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.730
So, for example, from the router, maybe you want to ping LinuxA from there. Then you would need

4
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.200
to set it up as a DNS Client.

5
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.660
Now, you don't need to set the router up as a DNS Client for DNS traffic to pass through it.

6
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.180
This is only if you need the router itself to be able to resolve FQDNs to hostnames.

7
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.430
So often, we won't do that. Often, when we're working on a router, we're always going to be working with 

8
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.660
IP addresses.

9
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.390
But if you did want it to be able to resolve hostnames, the commands to enter are 'ip domain-lookup',

10
00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.660
to allow it to look up a DNS server; 'ip name-server', and then the IP address of your DNS server; 'ip domain-name,

11
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.120
and then the primary domain name; and if you want it to also lookup additional DNS suffixes,

12
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.420
'ip domain-list', and then those additional suffixes.

13
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.230
Okay, so that's how you configure it to be a DNS Client. If you wanted a router to be your DNS Server,

14
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.390
then to configure that, you would enter those same commands plus 'ip dns server' is the command that

15
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.430
configure it as a DNS server, and then you would need to enter address records for everything that

16
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.390
you want it to be able to resolve. The command for that is 'ip host', and then the hostname and the IP address

17
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.730
of that host.

18
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.050
Now, you will not usually want a Cisco router to be a DNS server.

19
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.590
Usually, you would use an external Windows, or Unix or Linux server to do that, but it is capable of

20
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.040
doing it.

21
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.450
Okay,

22
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.730
those were the commands.

23
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.730
Let's configure that in the lab next.

24
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.660
We'll have to look at the lab topology first.

25
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:10.840
You can see I've got three routers, R1, R2, and R3. R1 has got IP address 10.10.10.1.

26
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:19.450
R2 is 10.10.10.2, and it's also got an interface of 10.10.20.2.

27
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.760
R3 is at 10.10.20.1. I'm going to configure R3 as the DNS Server,

28
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.550
and I'm going to configure entries for all three routers on there, so it will be able to resolve them, and then

29
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.610
we'll configure R1 as the DNS Client.

30
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.240
Okay, so I've got a window open for both routers. Let's configure the DNS Server first,

31
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.750
which was R3.

32
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.130
I'll do a 'show IP interface brief' just to check the IP address is right on there.

33
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.020
10.10.20.1,

34
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.450
that's going to be our DNS Server.

35
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.530
So the commands I'll enter, first up, 'ip domain-lookup' to enable it to use DNS.

36
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.730
Oh, and I forgot to go to global configuration, so 'config t' first to get to global configuration, and then

37
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.740
'ip domain-lookup' should work.

38
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.060
Next up is 'ip name-server' to configure where the DNS server is going to be.

39
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.820
It's going to be itself, which is at 10.10.20.1.

40
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.500
Then, I'll configure the domain name, so 'ip domain-name',

41
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.100
and for this lab, I'll use flackbox.lab.

42
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.060
Obviously, this is a different lab than the one I showed you with Windows because I'm doing it on my

43
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.450
Cisco router now,

44
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.790
and then the command to make this the DNS server is 'ip dns server'.

45
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.410
So, that's my basic DNS commands.

46
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.470
Next up, I need to enter addresses for the host that I want to resolve. 

47
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:10.760
So, the command for that is 'ip host'. The first one is R1, which is at 10.10.10.1.

48
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.570
Then next will be R2,

49
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.160
I'll use command history for this, so I'll hit the up arrow to get that previous command back, and I'm going

50
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.800
to edit this using the cursor keys to make it 'ip host R2'

51
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:37.070
is at 10.10.10.2. Then the up arrow again, the next host is R3, and that is at

52
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.790
10.10.20.1.

53
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.600
So, that's how you do your hosts. I'll also enter these as FQDNs as well. To show you how to do that,

54
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:57.650
so 'ip host R1.flackbox.lab' is at 10.10.10.1, and then R2 is at

55
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.640
10.10.10.2.

56
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.370
So I just used the up arrow again there, and I'll

57
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.040
edit this and make that 'R2.flackbox.lab' and the correct IP address. And then the last one,

58
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:20.010
'ip host R3.flackbox.lab', is at 10.10.20.1. So, that's all the configurations

59
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.970
that I need for my DNS Server.

60
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.480
Next up, let's configure R1 to be a DNS Client.

61
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:38.280
So I'll go in here, I'll go to global configuration, and then 'ip domain-lookup' to allow it to use

62
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:45.560
a DNS Server. Then 'ip name-server' to configure where the DNS server is,

63
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:58.750
that's on R3, which is at 10.10.20.1, and then the DNS suffix, I'll say 'ip domain-list

64
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:07.590
flackbox.lab', and now I'll use 'end' to drop back down to the enable prompt.

65
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:19.770
Let's see if I can resolve hostnames now on R1. So I will try pinging R3 by its hostname, and I can

66
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:29.940
see it's resolving it at the Domain Server at 10.10.20.1. It then resolved that, and I can see that

67
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.790
the success rate was 5 out of 5, so that looks all good.

68
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.920
Let's also try pinging R2.

69
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:47.870
This will also be resolved by the DNS Server at 10.10.20.1, and it resolved that to

70
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.000
10.10.10.2, and I was able to ping that too. So, that's how you configure DNS

71
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.370
on your Cisco routers.

72
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.660
Next up, we'll have a look at ARP

73
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.870
in the next lecture.
