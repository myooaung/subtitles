00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.510
In this lecture, you'll learn what the different routing protocol types are. Our routing protocols can be split

2
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:24.380
into two main types, thats our IGPs, which are our Interior Gateway Protocols and EGP, which is an

3
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:33.350
Exterior Gateway Protocol. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) are used for routing within an organization. And Exterior

4
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.710
Gateway Protocol (EGP) is used for routing between organizations over the Internet.

5
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.180
There are used to be a legacy

6
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.750
EGPs, but the only EGP that is in use today is BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol.

7
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.460
There are several different IGPs though. Our different IGPs can be split into two main types, either

8
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.620
Distance Vector routing protocols or Link State routing protocols. We'll explain what the different ones

9
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.960
are and which group they fall into

10
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.530
coming up in a couple of slides. So in Distance Vector protocols,

11
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:21.040
each router sends its directly connected neighbours a list of all its known networks, along with its own

12
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.610
distance to each of those networks.

13
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:31.040
Distance Vector routing protocols do not advertise the entire network topology. A router only knows

14
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.370
its directly connected neighbours and the list of networks

15
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.540
those neighbours have advertised. It doesn't have detailed topology information beyond those directly

16
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.140
connected neighbours.So because of this, Distance Vector routing protocols are often called as routing by

17
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.160
rumuor.

18
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.130
We can compare this with our Link State routing protocols. In Link State routing protocols, each router

19
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.530
describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbors.

20
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.670
That information is then passed unchanged from one router to another.

21
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.060
Every router thus learns the full picture of a network, including every router,

22
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.450
its interfaces, and what they connect to.

23
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.550
Okay,

24
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.200
I know it's a subtle difference and it can be a bit confusing and I've seen lots of people that actually

25
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.490
are confused with this on the Internet and spreading misinformation.

26
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.810
So let's break it down what the difference is. With our Distance Vector and our Link State routing protocols,

27
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.040
both of them only form an adjacency with directly connected neighbors.

28
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.670
So if you think back to our lab topology before where we had R1, R2, and R3 in a row,

29
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.610
R1 and R2 are going to talk to each other, and R2 and R3 are going to talk to each other

30
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.440
and share information with each other.

31
00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.750
But, R1 does not talk to R3 directly with the routing protocol. Okay, thats for both Distance

32
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.600
Vector and for Link State routing protocols as well.

33
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.880
So both of them, the routers only share information with their directly connected neighbors.

34
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.440
The difference is that with Distance Vector routing protocols, those updates are from the point of view

35
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.600
of the neighbor.

36
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.690
The neighbor says, "I know about these networks and this is what my distance is to each of those." With

37
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.200
Link State routing protocols, the routers still talk to their neighbors

38
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.060
that they say, "Hey, these are all of the routers and their links that are in the network." And the information

39
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.230
passes along unchanged.

40
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.680
It does not get updated from the point of view of that router like it does with Distance Vector routing

41
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.690
protocols.

42
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.020
So with Link State routing protocols, the routers have a full picture of the topology and they have a reputation

43
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.480
of being able to make better routing decisions because of this. But Link State routing protocols

44
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.520
do put a bit more load on the router because it's got more information there.

45
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.490
Okay, so let's take a look at what the different routing protocols they are and what type they fit into.

46
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:21.320
So our IGPs are: RIP, the Routing Information Protocol; EIGRP the Enhanced Interior Gateway Protocol;

47
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:30.050
OSPF, which is Open Shortest Path First; and ISIS, which is Intermediate System to Intermediate System.

48
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:38.930
RIP and EIGRP are Distance Vector routing protocols, and OSPF and ISIS are Link State routing protocols,

49
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:49.220
and that's all the IGPs that there are in use today. EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary Distance Vector routing

50
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.730
protocol, and it's got some really good advantages that we'll speak about later. And because it's proprietary,

51
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.760
Cisco would like you to use it because then it walks you into using purely Cisco devices.

52
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.960
Now like I said, it is a really good routing protocol, but Distance Vector routing protocols have got a

53
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.170
bit of an inferior reputation as compared to Link State routing protocols for the reasons that I just

54
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.190
described.

55
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.750
So Cisco don't want you to think of EIGRP as an inferior routing protocol, so they call it an advanced

56
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.850
Distance Vector routing protocol.

57
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.680
However, to be honest, it's a distance vector routing protocol. It works the same way as RIP does. Cisco

58
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.260
call it advanced because it's got more advanced metrics than RIP is.

59
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.900
So it is a much better routing protocol than RIP.

60
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.480
Again, as we get more into detail into the different routing protocols, I'll explain why that is

61
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.220
later on.

62
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.000
Okay, so that's our different IGPs,

63
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.400
and as I said earlier, our one and only EGP is used today is BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol. In the

64
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.240
next several sections,

65
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.620
I'll be covering the IGPs in depth,

66
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:15.330
we'll get to BGP in a later section. With our IGPs, they all do the same job which is to advertise routes

67
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.260
within an organization and determine the best path or paths to the different networks.

68
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.450
So an organization will typically pick one 

69
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.170
of the IGPs. They all do the same job,

70
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.440
so there isn't really any need to use more than one of them. Actually using more than one of them is

71
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:40.680
a bad idea. But does sometimes happen though, usually because of a merger or maybe just historical reasons.

72
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.550
If that does happen, then information can be redistributed between the different routing protocols.

73
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.820
But because they work in different ways internally, this can get a bit messy.

74
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.000
So it's generally best to avoid that if possible.

75
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.330
Okay so that was our different routing protocol types.

76
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.150
Let's have a quick look at this in the lab in the next lecture.
