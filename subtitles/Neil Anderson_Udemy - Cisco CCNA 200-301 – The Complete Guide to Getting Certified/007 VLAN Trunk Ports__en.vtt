00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:15.510
In this lecture, you'll learn about VLAN trunk ports. We covered access ports in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.220
You saw in the example lab topology, we had a switch with some Engineering and some Sales PCs plugged in,

3
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.410
which are in different IP subnets at Layer 3.

4
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.880
We also put them into different VLANs at Layer 2 and that segmented the broadcast domains at both Layer 2

5
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.340
and Layer 3, giving us better performance and better security.

6
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.030
But what about the links between switches?

7
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.740
So that previous example, we just had one switch there.

8
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350
The example here now is similar,

9
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.510
we've got our Engineering PCs, our Sales PCs, and a router to route traffic between them, but they're

10
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.910
not all plugged in to the same switch.

11
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.190
We've got multiple switches here.

12
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.270
So if you look at ENG PC1, if I also had another Engineering PC plugged into that same switch, they

13
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.670
would be able to communicate with each other.

14
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.360
But the problem is that right now, all of my links between my switches are on the default VLAN 1.

15
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.100
So PCs in the same VLAN on the same switch can talk to each other, but they can't communicate with

16
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.730
other PCs on another switch, even if that was in the same VLAN.

17
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.860
So what we could do to help with this, we could configure those links between switches.

18
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.460
We could put them in the Engineering VLAN, for example,

19
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.380
and great!

20
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.660
Now, all of our Engineering PCs can communicate with each other no matter what switch they're on.

21
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.760
But the problem is that the Sales PCs still can't talk to each other.

22
00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.160
So we need PCs in different VLANs to be able to talk with each other across different switches,

23
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.780
and the way we do that is by configuring a trunk port.

24
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.259
The protocol which used for our trunking is Dot1Q.

25
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:19.170
So on the links between switches, rather than configuring them as an access port which can only carry traffic

26
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.100
for one VLAN, we configured them as a trunk port which will carry traffic for all of our VLANs.

27
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.420
So, an access port carries traffic for one specific VLAN. Dot1Q trunks are configured on the

28
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.250
links between switches where we need to carry traffic for multiple VLANs. The old or one of the

29
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.620
old protocols that was available to do this was ISL, Inter-Switch Link.

30
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.730
That was a Cisco proprietary trunking protocol, which is now obsolete.

31
00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.840
The industry is standardized always on using Dot1Q now. The way that Dot1Q works, when this

32
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.850
switch forwards traffic to another switch over a trunk port, it tags the Layer 2 Dot1Q

33
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.720
header with the correct VLAN.

34
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.890
So in the packet, we've got the layer 2 header in there, and it inserts into the Layer 2 header the VLAN

35
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.700
information.

36
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.790
The receiving switch will only forward the traffic out ports that are in that VLAN, snd when the switch sends the

37
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.860
traffic to an end host, it removes the Dot1Q VLAN tag because our end hosts are not VLAN-aware.

38
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.170
They don't need to see that tag, it confuse them.

39
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.770
This is how the format of the Ethernet frame looks. Up at the top there,

40
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.750
there's a standard Ethernet frame that comes into the switch from the host.

41
00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:02.080
When the switch sends out a trunk port to another switch, it will insert the Dot1Q tag into the header

42
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.580
stating which VLAN this traffic is for,

43
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.800
and again, it removes it at the other end when it sends out to an end hosts.

44
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.130
So let's look at how this works,

45
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.980
I'm going to look at some broadcast traffic. So the Sales PC2 down in the bottom left corner,

46
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.420
it sends out some broadcast traffic. That hits it's

47
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.130
switch, Switch1.

48
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.680
There's no other Sales PCs on there, so it doesn't send it to any other end hosts,

49
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.210
but Switch1 is configured with a trunk port going up to Switch2,

50
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.960
so it will send the traffic up to Switch2.

51
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.460
When it does that, it's going over a trunk port so it will insert the VLAN information into the Layer 2

52
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.580
header. It says, this traffic is for the Sales VLAN.

53
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.480
It comes into Switch2, and it sees it's got the Engineering PC on there, but it's in the Engineering

54
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.850
VLAN, so it knows the traffic is not for it.

55
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.170
It doesn't send it there.

56
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.940
It does have a trunk port,

57
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.660
so it sends up the trunk port to Switch3 again. It puts on the Dot1Q tag saying this is for the

58
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.360
Sales VLAN. On Switch3,

59
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.720
we do have an end host in the Sales VLAN,

60
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.620
it's the router.

61
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.890
The port connected to the router is configured as an access port in the Sales VLAN. So, the switch

62
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.080
will send the traffic up to the router.

63
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.010
When it does that, it's going up an access port, so it strips off the Dot1Q tag. Switch3 is also

64
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.170
connected to Switch4 with a trunk port, so it will send the traffic down there. Again,

65
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:41.500
it will tag with the Dot1Q tag, saying it's for the Sales VLAN. When it comes in to Switch4, it's

66
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.420
also got an end host configured with an access port in the Sales VLAN,

67
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.520
so it will send the traffic out there to Sales PC1, strips off the Dot1Q header when it sends it

68
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.920
down to switch 5. That is again on a trunk port, so it will save

69
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.020
that this is for the Sales VLAN.

70
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.080
Okay, so that is how our Dot1Q trunks work.

71
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.300
Now, just a little aside here, you don't need to know this for the CCNA exam, but you're going

72
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.010
to run into this in the real-world,

73
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.290
so I wanted to mention it here as well.

74
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:26.440
Your end hosts, like your normal desktop PCs, are typically members of only one VLAN and they're not VLAN aware.

75
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.220
So for those hosts, this switch is configured as an access port.

76
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:39.820
But a special case of end hosts is virtualized hosts, like VMware or Microsoft HyperV, where there's

77
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:48.520
virtual machines in different IP subnets on the host. So that one host, that's maybe running a virtual

78
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.870
machine for Engineering,

79
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.050
it's also running a virtual machine for Sales.

80
00:06:53.170 --> 00:07:00.130
So in that case, you need to trunk the VLANs down to that host so it knows which virtual machine to

81
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.170
send the traffic to.

82
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.880
So you can see the example here,

83
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.970
I've got a VMware host in the example.

84
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.930
It's got virtual machines for both Sales and for Engineering.

85
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.560
We've got one physical port on the Ethernet switch, interface fastEthernet0/1 here.

86
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.180
We configure that as a trunk port, rather than as an access port.

87
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.890
Okay, so where you've got normal end hosts, like a normal desktop PC or a

88
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:33.900
normal server which is running just one application on there, you configure your switch as access ports.

89
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:40.200
When you've got ports going to another switch, you configure that as a trunk.

90
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.930
When you've got a virtualized host, like a VMware host, that is also configured as a trunk.

91
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.620
Another special use case is IP phones.

92
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:58.530
When you're using IP phones, the switch is physically connected to the IP phone and then the PC is

93
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.060
plugged in to the back of the phone for that particular user.

94
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.470
The benefit that you get from this is it only uses up one physical port on your switch. So you don't

95
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.720
have the phone and the PC both plugged into two different ports on the switch,

96
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.200
you have the phone plugged into the switch and then the PC plugged into the back of the phone.

97
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:24.270
Now, with this, we want to be able to segregate our phone calls from our data traffic, but they're

98
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.640
both going through the same cable here.

99
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.190
The reason that we want to have them separate is that we need to give different treatment to the

100
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.120
voice traffic.

101
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.200
We need to have that prioritized because it's very sensitive to delay,

102
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.110
and the other reason is for security as well.

103
00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:46.380
We don't want our voice, our phone calls, and our data traffic in the same IP subnet in the same VLAN,

104
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.040
because that would make it easier for somebody to sniff that traffic and listen in to our phone calls.

105
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.230
So we're going to have our voice traffic, our actual phone calls, and our data traffic on our PC,

106
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.460
we're going to have those in different IP subnet and in different VLANs,

107
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.950
and you can see here that they're both going through the same physical cable from the switch to the IP

108
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.340
phone.

109
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.810
So we need to configure that as a trunk port, which is going to carry the voice

110
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.420
VLAN traffic and the data VLAN traffic.

111
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.770
Alright,

112
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.360
let's have a look at how to actually configure this very simple configuration.

113
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.450
So the example here, interface fastEthernet0/24, is connected to another switch.

114
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.150
Optionally, I can put in a description and I've said 'description Trunk to SW2'. Then, the trunking

115
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:41.100
commands I say 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q' and 'switchport mode trunk'. Now, with the 

116
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:48.510
'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q' command, modern switches only support Dot1Q.

117
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.250
So if you put this command in, then it will give you an error message saying it doesn't understand

118
00:09:53.250 --> 00:10:01.110
the command. Older switches support both ISL and Dot1Q, so on older switches,

119
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.140
you have to say 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q',

120
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.880
because they'll default to ISL but we always use Dot1Q.

121
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.620
On modern switches,

122
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.760
there's no need to put that command in. If you put the command in and it gives you an error message,

123
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.050
it's okay, no harm done.

124
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:23.010
Okay, so that's how we manually configure a port as a trunk port. I would need to configure this on the

125
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.590
other side, on the other switch as well.

126
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.470
So that's how we do the configuration on a switchport, which is connected to another switch or to a

127
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:41.030
virtualized host such as VMware. Another configuration to show you here is the special configuration

128
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:47.650
where the switchport is plugged into an IP phone with a PC connected in behind that.

129
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:53.690
The configuration here is, for example, 'interface FastEthernet 0/10'.

130
00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.920
I've said 'description IP Phone', and this port is going to act as a trunk port. It is going to be sending

131
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.750
traffic for multiple VLANs, for the voice VLAN and for the data VLAN, down to the phone.

132
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.380
But we don't configure it as 'switchport mode trunk',

133
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:17.870
we configure it as 'switchport mode access'. So it is actually a trunk port, but you configure 'switchport mode access'.

134
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.180
It's a special case where we've got an IP phone plugged in.

135
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:28.370
Then we say 'switchport access vlan 10', that is our data VLAN, and then 'switchport voice vlan 20',

136
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.220
here is where you configure the voice VLAN.

137
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:38.720
When you've got a Cisco IP phone plugged into a Cisco switch, the switch will detect that it is an IP phone,

138
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.830
and it knows

139
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.510
they both talk to each other.

140
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:48.160
They know that this is the VLAN for the PC and this is the VLAN for the voice traffic on the phone.

141
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.330
Last thing to tell you here is about the Native VLAN.

142
00:11:53.810 --> 00:12:03.110
The switch needs to know which VLAN to assign any traffic to, which comes in untagged on a trunk port.

143
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.960
That used to be required for when a switch was connected to a hub.

144
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:18.020
Hubs are long gone though, you can't even buy hubs anymore. Hubs were Layer 1 devices, so not VLAN

145
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.480
aware.

146
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.340
So, that's why we have the Native VLAN there to support hubs.

147
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:32.720
The default Native VLAN is VLAN 1, but there are some security issues with using VLAN 1 as the Native

148
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.150
VLAN. There's some known attacks that can exploit that,

149
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.520
so best practice is to change it to an unused VLAN.

150
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:46.130
The Native VLAN must match on both sides of a trunk, so on both switches that are connected to each

151
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.090
other, for the trunk to come up.

152
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:54.680
So looking at the full config for our trunk, including setting the Native VLAN, we need to create

153
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.270
a VLAN for this first.

154
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.470
So I've said 'vlan 199', 'name Native'.

155
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:06.380
This is a dedicated VLAN that is not going to be used for anything else and you're not going to have any

156
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:12.850
end hosts actually using this VLAN. Then, on my port that's connected to the other switch, I've got 

157
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:21.260
'interface GigabitEthernet 0/1', 'description Trunk to SW2', 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q',

158
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.820
'switchport mode trunk',

159
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.570
so the same commands we covered just a minute ago, and then 

160
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.930
'switchport trunk native vlan 199'.

161
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:37.430
On the switch on the other side, I put in exactly the same configuration. To verify this,

162
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:45.440
we use the command 'show interface gig0/1 switchport' and here, I can see that the operational

163
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.030
mode is it's a trunk port.

164
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.300
The encapsulation being used is Dot1Q,

165
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:57.530
and the Native VLAN 199. It's saying inactive just because we don't have any access ports

166
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.540
configured in VLAN 199.

167
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.620
That's good,

168
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.260
that's the way that we should configure it.

169
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:10.850
The last thing that I want to tell you about here is limiting allowed VLANs and similarly to changing

170
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:17.720
the Native VLAN, this is done mainly for security reasons, but it also improves performance as well.

171
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:25.760
So you can see in the diagram here on the bottom switch, I've got PCs in the ENG, SALES, and ACCOUNTS

172
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.190
VLAN. But on the top switch,

173
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.160
there's only PCs for ENG and ACCOUNTS.

174
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.800
No SALES PCs on that top switch.

175
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:39.020
So there's no point in sending SALES traffic up to that top switch,

176
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:46.760
and if we did, it would take up bandwidth which would decrease performance, and also, it could be a security

177
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.240
concern.

178
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.760
We don't want to send traffic anywhere where it's not actually required. So to prevent that from

179
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:59.450
happening, on the bottom switch, actually, on both switches on that inter-switch link between the two

180
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:07.310
switches, we can configure the allowed VLANs list. So in the example here, we would allow traffic for

181
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.020
the ENG and ACCOUNTS

182
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.360
VLAN, but we're not going to send traffic for the SALES VLAN over that link.

183
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.060
So the way that we configure it is go to the interface, which is a trunk, interface GigabitEthernet 0/1 

184
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.280
for this example, and the command 

185
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.521
'switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,30'.

186
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:32.330
If you don't use this command, then all VLANs that are configured on the switch will

187
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.620
be sent over link.

188
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.820
By doing this, you limit it to only the VLANs that are required.

189
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.940
Okay, that was the last thing for trunking.

190
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.610
See you in the next lecture,

191
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.950
where we'll do it with a lab demo.
