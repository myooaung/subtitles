00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.640
In the last lecture, I showed you how to connect to a Cisco router or switch over the network. In this lecture,

2
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600
I'll show you how to make a direct connection using a console cable.

3
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.050
Before we start, I'll give you a quick reminder that the lab exercises in this course use Cisco

4
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.570
Packet Tracer simulation software,

5
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.930
and you can see how to install and use that by watching Section 2, How to Set Up the Lab.

6
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.560
So for the lab exercises, we're going to be using in the course, you don't need any physical devices,

7
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.350
and you don't need to install or use Putty.

8
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.070
But when you go, and you start working on real devices in the real world, you are going to need to know

9
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.910
how to do this, how to make the initial connection to a physical device.

10
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.360
So, that's why I'm going to show you here.

11
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.080
Cisco devices do not usually have a default IP address, so we need to set one up before we can connect

12
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.380
to it over the network.

13
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.200
As you saw in the last lecture, I used Putty to connect to the management IP address of the device.

14
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.530
But what if the device does not have an IP address on it yet?

15
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.480
Well, we need a way to connect to the device to do the initial configuration when we first buy it, including

16
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.750
adding IP addresses, and that is where the console connection comes in.

17
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.110
So with the console connection, we can directly connect to the device at a lower level below IP, get

18
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.560
onto the Command Line there, then we can get to do the initial configuration, including adding the

19
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.870
IP address, and once we've done that, we'll then be able to connect to it over the network.

20
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.090
So for that initial direct connection, you connect to the console port on the router or switch.

21
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.680
I'll show you that in a second.

22
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.550
You use a console cable to do it, which comes in the box with your device, and the console cable

23
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.600
looks like this.

24
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.540
You can see that it has got a serial DB9 connector on one end.

25
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.440
It's called DB9 because nine pins go in here, and on the other side, it's got an RJ45 connector,

26
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.950
similar to what you would see on a standard Ethernet cable.

27
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.550
But this is absolutely not an Ethernet cable.

28
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.100
It's not using Ethernet, and it doesn't require IP addresses.

29
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:40.220
This gives you a low level direct access to the Command Line. When you connect this into your router or switch,

30
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.590
it's the RJ45 end that plugs into the console port on the device,

31
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.300
and it is the serial connector that plugs into your laptop.

32
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.300
And this gives us a problem because laptops don't come with serial ports anymore.

33
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:05.620
About 20 years ago, they did, and serial ports were most commonly used to connect to old-style 56K modems.

34
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.550
They don't exist anymore, so manufacturers don't put the ports on our laptops anymore.

35
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.150
So, how are we going to be able to plug this cable into our laptop?

36
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.880
Well, what we need to do is buy an additional USB to serial adapter. So you can see here, it has got a

37
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.540
USB connector on one end, and it's got a male serial DB9 connector on the other.

38
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:42.980
So, we end up having the USB connector plugged into our laptop or a PC that then has the cable going into

39
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.350
the console cable with the serial connectors here, and then the RJ45 connector that plugs into the

40
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.910
router or switch.

41
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.900
Okay, so Cisco realized that that's a problem because devices don't have those old-style connectors anymore.

42
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07.700
So with newer devices, it comes with a newer cable which has got USB on one side to plug into your

43
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.070
laptop, and mini-USB on the other side to plug into the device.

44
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.760
Okay, so let's see how this looks on a router now.

45
00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:22.570
So, I've got in front of me here an old 2600 router from Cisco.

46
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.690
This used to be a very popular workhorse router.

47
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.090
You can see it on the back here where I've got my finger now, that is the AUX or auxiliary port,

48
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.070
and that used to be used for out-of-band management with those old 56K modems.

49
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.350
They don't exist anymore,

50
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.310
so that doesn't really get used anymore.

51
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.120
This port, next to it,

52
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.750
we have got the blue console port.

53
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.310
That is where I've got my console cable plugged in.

54
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.540
Then I've got a couple of on board Ethernet ports on this particular router and a couple of slots up at

55
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.270
the top here where we can put in optional cards,

56
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.110
and I happen to have an ADSL card fitted in here.

57
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:13.490
Okay, so I have got my router there with the console port plugged into it, and you can see that there into my console

58
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.080
cable,

59
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.800
I have got my USB to serial adapter here, and I'm going to plug this end into my PC.

60
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.370
Okay, so I've done that, and I've also plugged in the power lead in the router as well.

61
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.700
So, we're ready to make the initial connection to the device.

62
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.570
The software that I'm going to use for that is Putty, again, the same as what I use to make a connection

63
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.920
over the network.

64
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.600
I showed you in the last video how to download and install that.

65
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.700
Just as a quick reminder, again, you can go to Google and just search for Putty download,

66
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.220
and then the first link here is where you download and can install it from.

67
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.470
Okay, so I've already got Putty installed on here, so I'm going to open up Putty, and the type of connection

68
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.700
we need to use here to connect to the console port is Serial.

69
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:15.650
So I will click on that, and you can see it showing in here the Serial line and the Speed. You need to

70
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.550
select your correct COM port on your computer here.

71
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.290
So the way you find out that information is open up

72
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.880
Device Manager in Windows,

73
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:34.960
and then look in your ports here, and you'll see the com port, and it's usually COM3. Again, you need

74
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.110
to have installed the driver software for the cable before this is going to show up.

75
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.600
Okay, so I need to change this to COM3.

76
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.370
Next thing is, we've got the Speed, and there's actually more settings than this.

77
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:58.450
If you go to Serial over in the main window in Putty here on the left, and there you can see again I'm using

78
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.410
COM3 for this connection, and I need to have the correct settings here.

79
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.730
The default settings are actually okay.

80
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.780
So the Speed is 9600,

81
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:16.480
I've got 8 Data bits, 1 Stop bit, but the Parity is none, and I should set the Flow control to none as well.

82
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.960
But if you leave the Flow control as the default, it will still connect anyway.

83
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:26.950
Okay, so now, I can go back to Session up at the top here, and I can click on Open, and I'm not going to

84
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.000
see anything yet because I haven't powered my router on.

85
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.440
So, I'll just reach over here to the power switch on the back of the router, and I'm flicking it on now.

86
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.700
And you can see, now, I start getting output from the router.

87
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.780
You can see that when you connect over the console connection, soon as you power the device on, you're

88
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.650
immediately connected to the Command Line, and you can view the device booting up.

89
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.840
This is going to take a few minutes to boot up here.

90
00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.300
So, I'm going to speed up the video so we can watch it go through the boot up process.

91
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.480
Okay,

92
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:17.820
and that is the router fully booted up, and I see the message here, "Would you like to enter the initial

93
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.400
configuration dialogue?"

94
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.960
That's because I already factory reset this router.

95
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.040
It's in the same state as if you bought a brand new router straight from the factory.

96
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:34.500
So, that's how you would connect to a new device and get to this prompt here, and then start setting it

97
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.140
up, putting on the IP addresses, etc.

98
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:43.890
Now, hopefully, it's obvious that it's not just for setting up new devices that you can use a console

99
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.500
cable and the device does not need to be powered off

100
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.810
when you first connect to it. You could have a device that's already fully configured and powered on,

101
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:58.110
and in your cabinet, you can connect to it with a console cable, and you will immediately get to the

102
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.310
Command Line prompt.

103
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.680
That's everything I needed to show you about how to use the console connection.

104
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:13.410
Okay, so you saw there that when we get a new device from the factory, we can connect to it with a console

105
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:20.340
cable to do the initial configuration, including adding IP addresses, and we'll then be able to connect

106
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.260
it over the network later.

107
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.740
But the console port is not just useful for the initial configuration of a device.

108
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.660
You'll often see that it comes in useful for troubleshooting as well.

109
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.560
So, for example, let's say that we are trying to connect to an existing device on its IP address,

110
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.800
but we cannot connect to it.

111
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:49.950
Well, often one of the first things you do in that situation is you will plug into it with a console

112
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:57.120
cable to see what is going on because you don't need the IP address to be responsive to connect it over

113
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.260
the console cable.

114
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:05.100
Another thing is if a device just appears to be completely unresponsive, but you can see that it is

115
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.930
powering on. So, that indicates that the device is probably failing to boot up.

116
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:16.200
Well, again, trying to connect to over the network is not going to work because the IP address on

117
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.380
the device is not live until it has completed the bootup process.

118
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.420
So if it's not able to boot up, it doesn't have an IP address on there.

119
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.420
You're not going to be able to connect to it over the network.

120
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.000
But what you can do is you can connect to it with the console cable, then power the device on,

121
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.390
and when you do it that way, you can watch the device booting up.

122
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:41.320
So if it is having a problem completing the bootup, you'll be able to see what's going wrong over

123
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.630
the console connection.

124
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.780
Okay, that was everything I needed to tell you here.

125
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.340
See you in the next lecture.
