00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.690
In this lecture, you'll learn about Adjacencies and Passive Interfaces.

2
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:23.780
Our Interior Gateway routing protocols, so RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF, are configured under global configuration. And then, they're either

3
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.750
enabled or not on the router's individual interfaces. When the routing protocol is enabled on an interface,

4
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.890
the router will look for other devices on that directly connected link, which are also running the routing

5
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.890
protocol in order to peer with them. The router does this by sending out and listening for hello packets for

6
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.160
that particular routing protocol.

7
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.280
When a matching peer is found, the routers form an adjacency with each other and exchange routing

8
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.940
updates with each other.

9
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.350
Modern routing protocols use multicast for the hello packets.

10
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.160
This is more efficient than broadcast that was used by earlier protocols, like RIP version 1. With

11
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.370
multicast,

12
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.260
it's specific to the particular routing protocol. So, a device is only going to process that packet if

13
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.530
it's interested in forming an adjacency with that routing protocol. Unlike broadcast traffic that has to be

14
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.880
processed by all hosts,

15
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.680
so it's more efficient. Okay, an adjacency example.

16
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.590
So here, we've got router R1 in the middle, and RA, RB, and RC. On R1, we got a loopback configured

17
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.090
there with IP address

18
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.950
192.168.1.1/32.

19
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.790
The IP subnets configured on the interfaces, which are enabled for routing protocol, will of course be included

20
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.230
in its routing protocol updates. For example, R1 here

21
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.750
has a routing protocol enabled on the Loopback0 interface and interfaces FastEthernet0/0,

22
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.979
and FastEthernet1/0,

23
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.240
but it is not enabled on FastEthernet2/0.

24
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.780
The reason we've done that is that RC belongs to a partner organization, and we need connectivity to them,

25
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.570
but we don't want to be sending internal network information to them.

26
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.890
That would be a security issue.

27
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.770
R1 will send out and listen for hello packets on the Loopback0 interface, FastEthernet0/0, and FastEthernet1/0

28
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.260
because those are the interfaces that we enabled the routing protocol on.

29
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.130
And it will form adjacencies with any routers that are running that same routing protocol that it finds

30
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.380
on those links.

31
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.590
So in this case, we've also enabled the routing protocol on RA and on RB, on the interfaces that are

32
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.760
facing R1. So the routers will discover each other through the hello packets, and they will then form an adjacency

33
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.410
and share routing updates. But R1 will not send out or listen for hello packets on fastEthernet2/0,

34
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.740
because we didn't enable the roouting protocol on that interface. So, it will not form

35
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:27.380
an adjacency with RC. It's not going to be giving out any network information to RC. So in the example

36
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.840
here where RC is a partner, we need to have connectivity to them but we're not going to be giving

37
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.260
them out internal information. In that case, we could use static routes between us and them just to give

38
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.150
very limited connectivity.

39
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:51.140
An adjacency example, so the same one, R1 will advertise its IP subnets

40
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.100
to RA and RB, because it formed adjacencies with them. So it will advertise the

41
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.390
10.0.0.0/24 subnet,

42
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.610
10.0.1.0/24, and 192.168.1.1/32,

43
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:15.230
it's loopback. But it will not advertise 10.0.2.0/24, because that interface

44
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.490
was not included in the routing protocol. When you enable a routing protocol globally and then you enable

45
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.980
it on an interface,

46
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.010
the router will try to form an adjacency on that interface by sending out hello packets and it will also

47
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.970
advertise the subnet that is on that interface as well.

48
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.910
But if an interface is not included in the routing protocol, then the router won't send hello packets out

49
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.950
there, and also it won't advertise the subnet configured on that link to other routers either.

50
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.630
So in our scenario here, we're not going to be sending information to RC, but also RA and RB

51
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.800
will not learn routes to 10.0.2.0/24, because we didn't include it in the routing protocol.

52
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:14.330
So, what if we do actually need RA and RB to learn a route to get to 10.0.2.0/24?

53
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.620
That's where passive interfaces come in.

54
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:24.840
Passive interfaces allow you to include an IP subnet in the routing protocol without sending updates out of

55
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.960
the interface.

56
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.820
So here,

57
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.570
if fastEthernet2/0 is configured as a passive interface, RA and RB will learn routes

58
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.630
to 10.0.2.0, but internal network information will not be sent out to RC. So, that's what we wanted

59
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:49.820
to do in this situation. It's best practice to configure your loopback interfaces as passive interfaces

60
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.560
always.

61
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.400
So, this has nothing to do with giving out network information on them.

62
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.260
This is because it's impossible to form an adjacency on a loopback interface.

63
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.090
It's impossible for another router to be directly connected to the loopback interface, because it's not a physical

64
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.060
interface. It's just logical,

65
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.650
so there's no way we're going to ever form an adjacency on a loopback. Making the loopback

66
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.780
passive means that it will be advertised by the routing protocol.

67
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.040
We want to do that. We want other routers to learn how to get to the loopback, but we don't want to waste

68
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.850
resources sending out and listening for hello packets when we know

69
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.640
that there's never going to be another router connected in on that link.

70
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.290
So, this makes things more efficient.

71
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.390
Always make your loopbacks passive interface. So the use cases for passive interfaces, to summarize

72
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.700
that, we use them on our loopback interfaces. And also, physical interfaces

73
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.890
where the device on the other side belongs to another organization, or maybe it's not another organization, but

74
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.470
the device on the other side,

75
00:06:52.490 --> 00:07:00.050
we don't want to send routing information out to it, but we do want our other internal devices to know about

76
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.980
that link.

77
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.460
Okay,

78
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.770
so that was the theory for our passive interfaces.

79
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.700
Let's actually configure them in the lab.

80
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.170
We'll do that in the next lecture.
