00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:16.630
In this lesson, you'll learn about the TCP/IP suite. TCP/IP was developed way back in the 1960s by the

2
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.380
US Department of Defense's (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).

3
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:29.590
It's a protocol stack which consists of multiple protocols, including TCP, which is the Transmission Control Protocol,

4
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.040
and IP, which is the Internet Protocol.

5
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.240
So, it's not a single protocol.

6
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.690
It's a protocol stack.

7
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.580
What a protocol is, if you think of diplomats, when diplomats from different countries meet each other,

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.560
there's a certain way they're expected to behave and to communicate with each other. In computer networking,

9
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.960
protocols basically mean the same thing.

10
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.020
So, if you got two hosts and they're going to communicate with each other, there's going to be a protocol which

11
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.140
is going to control how that communication should behave, how it should work.

12
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.050
TCP/IP, it's the main protocol stack used in computer operations today.

13
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:22.090
There used to be other computing protocols way back in the day, like IPX/SPX and AppleTalk, but they're

14
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.590
really dead now. TCP/IP is now ubiquitous.

15
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.330
And whereas the OSI reference model is conceptual,

16
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:41.230
the TCP/IP stack is actually used to transfer data in today's production networks. TCP/IP is also layered,

17
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.540
but it doesn't use all of the OSI layers, though the layers are equivalent in operation and function.

18
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.080
So it does actually use them, but in the documentation,

19
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.400
it only lays out four different layers.

20
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.060
Let's look at those now.

21
00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.470
So you can see on the slide here over on the left, we've got the OSI model that we covered in the last

22
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.280
lesson.

23
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.950
So, we've got the 7 Layers there.

24
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.940
Remember, a way to remember the easy way is

25
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.310
"Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away."

26
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.130
So you've got Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Over on the

27
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.670
right,

28
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.280
we've got the TCP/IP stack.

29
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.270
You can see we've only got four different layers there. Up at the top,

30
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.220
we've got the Application Layer which maps to all three of the Application, Presentation, and Session

31
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.840
Layers in the OSI model. Below that, we've got the Transport Layer which is a one-to-one mapping with the

32
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.910
Transport Layer also in the OSI model. Underneath that,

33
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.250
we've got the Internet Layer which is equivalent to the Network Layer in the OSI model. And down at

34
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.490
the bottom, we've got the Network Access Layer which maps to the Data Link Layer and the Physical Layer

35
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.660
in the OSI model.

36
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:08.620
Now, you know I was saying in the last lesson that it's really important to understand the OSI model. The TCP/IP Stack,

37
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.390
for sure if you're working in networking, you're going to know all the different protocols,

38
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.600
like TCP and IP, like the back of your hand.

39
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.110
But when we're talking to other network engineers, it's more commonly the OSI model that we're going

40
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.220
to be referencing. Moving on, looking at some host communications terminology.

41
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:39.460
So when two hosts talk to each other, they're going to be exchanging PDUs, Protocol Data Units. The PDU

42
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:48.460
is the entire communication all the way from Layer 7 down to Layer 1 the OSI stack. We can

43
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:59.500
also divide that into different terms depending on which layer of the TCP/IP suite we're talking about.

44
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.230
For communications up at the Application Layer,

45
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.740
that's called Data. For communications between the Transport Layer on two different hosts,

46
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.390
that's called Segment. Between the Internet Layer, those are our Packets, and down the Network Access Layer,

47
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.579
those are our Frames.

48
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.630
You notice in the last slide that we're saying, typically, real world, we're not going to be discussing

49
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.780
the TCP/IP stack like this, about the 4 Layers. More commonly, we'll use the OSI 7 Layers,

50
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.660
but on this slide, the terminology actually is commonly used.

51
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.070
So if I'm talking about Layer 2 communications, I'll call that a Frame. If I'm talking about Layer 3,

52
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.830
I'll call a Packet, and if I'm talking about Layer 4, I will call it a Segment.

53
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.590
Another thing I need to tell you here is that packet, efficiently, is at Layer 3, but you might have

54
00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.660
heard me talking earlier on in this section and calling the communication between two hosts a Packet.

55
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.940
So really, the correct term is a PDU, but in day-to-day conversation, often we'll just call communications

56
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.510
between two hosts a Packet, meaning the entire stack.
