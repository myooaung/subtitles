00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:15.860
In this lecture, you'll learn about triple A. authentication authorization and accounting to earlier

2
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:24.740
in this section, you saw how to configure local security and configuring line level secure to a or

3
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.470
local user names on each individual.

4
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.090
Diverter switch has a serious scalability limitation.

5
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:40.190
That is, that if a password has to be added, changed or removed, it needs to be done on all devices.

6
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.420
And this is wherever you're using line level or usernames for the security.

7
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.350
So if a new administrator joins the company and won't see you've got a hundred drivers and switches,

8
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.540
you're going to have to add username on all of the different routers on switches.

9
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.910
If an administrator leaves, you're going to need to remove the username on all of the different switches.

10
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.360
And if you're using a line level password instead, again, if an administrator leaves, then you're

11
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.260
going to need to change your password on all of the different devices.

12
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.920
It would be a security issue to have the same password on there when an administrator knows it and they've

13
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.850
left the company.

14
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.880
So rather than having to configure all of our different devices with our security details, what is

15
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.490
a better idea is to use an external triple A server instead.

16
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.670
And then why was this to centralize the security?

17
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.150
So all of a security configuration, all the usernames and passwords and the authorization details are

18
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.110
configured on the triple A server and all of your adapters and switches pointed out server.

19
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.370
So whenever anybody wants to log in to or switch, it checks with a server if they are authenticated

20
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.320
and authorized or not.

21
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.850
And typically real world, we're not going to just have one triple A server.

22
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.990
We're going to put in at least two for redundancy in case one of them goes down.

23
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.950
To Tripoli, it stands for authentication, authorization and accounting authentication verifies that

24
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.500
somebody is really who they say they are, that's most commonly achieved with a username and password.

25
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.490
The person has to be an actual person to know the password.

26
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.440
So that's how we verify it is them authorization specifies what a particular user is allowed to do,

27
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.100
such as whether they are allowed to run a particular command or not.

28
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.880
And accounting keeps track of the options that a user has carted out.

29
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.190
So we can use this as an audit trail to check what commands and an administrator entered.

30
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.980
And this is not just for pointing the finger at somebody.

31
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.040
If something goes wrong, if something was working before I know it stopped working, then probably

32
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.110
it's because a command was and are having an audit trail.

33
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.240
What you quickly find out what happened just before it stopped working.

34
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.350
So as useful for troubleshooting, authorization and accounting are optional when you're using triple

35
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.950
M, authentication is mandatory if authorization and or accounting are used.

36
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.150
So authorization is seeing what somebody is allowed to do or not.

37
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.420
Well, you want to make sure it really is then before you authorize them to do anything.

38
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.530
The same with accounting.

39
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.150
If you're keeping track of what somebody is doing, you want to make sure it really is them before you

40
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.620
actually keep track of that.

41
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.760
The protocols that are used for triple A are radius and aftershocks, plus both of them are open standards,

42
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.510
although vendors may advocate the extensions.

43
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.620
I'll talk a bit more about that in a minute.

44
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.990
And many vendors triple a server support booth to eclipse vocal support booth radius on tax plus as

45
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.240
well.

46
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.950
Radius is commonly used for and use our Web services such as VPN access.

47
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.100
If you use those out on the road and they're going to VPN in to get access to the corporate network,

48
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.019
then radius would be a better match for that tax.

49
00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:28.920
Plus is commonly used for administrator access or in Cisco devices because it's got more granular authorization

50
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.820
capabilities.

51
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.490
It's better for controlling what commands a particular administrator is or is not allowed to run.

52
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.970
So school, as well as many of our vendors have got the triple A server, Cisco's triple A server is

53
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.820
the ICE, the identity services engine.

54
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.570
They also used to have the ACARS, which is the access control server, and it was available for years

55
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.260
and years.

56
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.020
But it's going end of sealed now.

57
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.240
So the current triple A server from Cisco is the ice.

58
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.020
OK, let's have a look at how triple works.

59
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.190
So here we've got an administrator on the left and she's going to log in to the router in the middle.

60
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.000
And we've also got a triple A server as well.

61
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.090
And all of the traffic is going to be going over IP.

62
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.080
So the administrator connects to the Cisco Earth to manage it, using either telnet or associates,

63
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.560
preferably assess it because it's encrypted.

64
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.430
The router within not telnet RSS.

65
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.680
Each session will challenge the user, ask the user to enter a username and password.

66
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.760
Still, within that Telnet RACC session, the administrator enters their username and password.

67
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.020
Now, if we were using local authentication, we would have username configured on the router itself.

68
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:58.040
But when we use triple A, the username and password is stored externally on our triple A server.

69
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.990
So the router passes the credentials, the username and password over to the triple E server and not

70
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.140
in either a radius or a tax plus section.

71
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:18.140
The server will look to see if the username and password are valid and it will reply back to the driver

72
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.020
to see whether the user is authenticated or not.

73
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.920
Optionally, it can also give the regular authorization information as well.

74
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:34.970
So based on the username and password, what commands that user is allowed to run on the router, then

75
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.430
the administrator is going to be able to work within Matalan RSS each session.

76
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:49.040
OK, so that was just having the user and directly authenticated with a triple E server.

77
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.370
But in real world networks, most user databases are the most common.

78
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.090
User database is active directory from Microsoft.

79
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.040
Almost for sure.

80
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.580
The company you're working for, they're using active directory.

81
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.340
So you come in in the morning and you log in with your Windows username and password.

82
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:16.390
Now, it is possible if we go back to our previous example, that, yes, you could use Octave directly

83
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.320
and your triple A server separately.

84
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.450
So when you come in in the morning, you log in to windows and you're using your active director username

85
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.110
and password.

86
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:30.560
And then when you go to log in to the router to do your Cisco administration, you use a different username

87
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.780
and password that is on the triple A server.

88
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.940
But the problem is that users, if they have to remember lots of different usernames and passwords,

89
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.650
what they do is they write it on a Post-it note and stick it on their monitor.

90
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.890
And then there's not much point in having usernames and passwords.

91
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:55.030
So it's better if you can have just one username and password per user.

92
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.740
That way it's easier for them to remember it.

93
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.120
The it's always going to be in sync.

94
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.720
Another thing you'll sometimes she is if you do have different databases, users try to have the same

95
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.310
username and password and all of them.

96
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.390
But they have to change your password once in a while and it's going to get out of sync.

97
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:16.940
So it's not really possible to manage at its best if you've just got one database, one username, one

98
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.620
password per user.

99
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:25.460
So far that what you'll often see again in Buro deployments is an active directory integration.

100
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:34.630
Now, it is possible that the router can send the username and password directly to the octave directly

101
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:40.190
the main controller, because the active directly domain controller, it supports radius as well.

102
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:48.740
But the problem with this is the Active Directory is a Microsoft product, so it doesn't support the

103
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.370
level of granularity, the control of authorization.

104
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:59.690
The Cisco triple E server does a Cisco triple A server that it can control the individual Cisco commands.

105
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.580
The user is allowed to run on a router or switch the octave directly.

106
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.630
It's from Microsoft.

107
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.740
It's not aware of Cisco level commands.

108
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.030
So this comes down to the vendor.

109
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:18.470
Proprietary Extension's a Cisco Tripoli server is great for controlling Cisco routers and switches,

110
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:25.570
but we don't want to have a separate user database on Mr. School Chappellet server and an active directory.

111
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:31.940
So what we'll do is we'll integrate the A server with active directory that we will get the best of

112
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.630
both worlds.

113
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:40.880
We get the really granular control of our authorization from Cisco Triple E server and it still allows

114
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.360
us to use that one username and password and active directory.

115
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:50.330
So how it's going to work if we've got an active directly integration, the administrator goes to log

116
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:57.960
in to the router using Telnet or S.H., the router blocks and a challenge back to the user inside telnet.

117
00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.720
Our associates asking them for the.

118
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.340
Username and password, the administrator answers for username and password that gets sent to the our

119
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:12.480
orbit switch, the router is integrated with the Cisco Triple E server, which will be the ice and using

120
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.860
radius aftershocks.

121
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:20.160
So it sends the username and password to the server when the router sends a username and password to

122
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.150
the server and reduce of it's encrypted.

123
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.600
So if anybody sniffing the topic over the wire, they can't see that username and password.

124
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.500
The Tripoli server does not have the local user database.

125
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.320
Now it's on the active director domain controller.

126
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:40.200
So the server sends the username and password to the active direct through the main controller.

127
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.750
That will normally be using Elgort, which is white directly access protocol as the protocol.

128
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:53.940
The domain controller will then tell the Tripoli server whether that is a valid username and password,

129
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.040
and it can also give group information back to the Tripoli server as well.

130
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.190
So what this allows you to do is maybe you've got a group, an active directory called Sasko Administrators

131
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.900
and they get full control on the right words.

132
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.120
They can run all commands.

133
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.880
Maybe you've got another group in Active Direct they called Cisco Helpdesk, and they can do read-only

134
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:21.090
type commands, but we can't change any of the configuration so the server can pull the information

135
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.410
from active directory.

136
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:30.210
Then on your server, you can configure what particular groups and active directly I don't like to do

137
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.370
on your right hand switches what commands.

138
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:40.380
But I like to run the Triple A server and send information back in the radius or take accession to the

139
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:46.860
router, seeing whether that was a valid username or password or not, and also optional authorization

140
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.370
information, which will be based on the group.

141
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:56.190
Like I just explained, the writable van, complete the Telnet RSA session with the user and they will

142
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.980
be able to run the commands they are authorized to run.

143
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.700
OK, so that is the city of Tripoli.

144
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.330
In the next lecture, I'll show you how to configure it.
