00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:14.570
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure and verify RIP with a lab demo.

2
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.030
So, I've got the lab topology open here.

3
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:26.120
We've got 5 routers, R1 to R5, and you can see that all of the interfaces begin with a 10,

4
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.479
apart from this interface on R4, interface FastEthernet3/0, which is going out to the Internet.

5
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.310
We'll configure that one a little bit later.

6
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.090
So for now, let's configure all of the internal networks that all start with 10.

7
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.510
So, I'm going to configure that on all of the different routers. Actually, before I do that, let's just check

8
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.650
and see that there's no routing protocols running on here already.

9
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.050
So I'll do a

10
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.640
'show ip protocols',

11
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.950
and you can see there's no routing protocols running.

12
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.790
And if I just 'show ip route',

13
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.660
it's just the connected and the local routes.

14
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.110
So, I want to configure RIP on all of the different routers.

15
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.230
It's going to be the same commands on each one,

16
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.270
so rather than typing it in on each router each time, I'm going to use WordPad, and I'm going to copy

17
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.230
and paste from there.

18
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.460
So let's go to WordPad, and the commands are 'router rip',

19
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.190
I'm going to run 'version 2'.

20
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.740
I want to do 'no auto-summary',

21
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.010
I don't want to do automatic summarization at the classful boundaries, and it's going to be 'network 10.0.0.0'

22
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.350
on each router. And I should just do a 'config t' at the start to save me typing that in

23
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.020
each time and I will copy and paste this into each router.

24
00:01:48.430 --> 00:02:01.730
So I'll start on R1, then R2, R3, R4, and R5. And it will take a minute or

25
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.030
so for the routers to converge,

26
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.789
so let's just check the 'show ip protocols' first.

27
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.110
And this is on R5,

28
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.710
I can see that RIP is running now, and it's routing for the 10.0.0.0 networks.

29
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.370
If I do a 'show ip route', let's see if we've got RIP routes in that table yet.

30
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.450
Yes we do,

31
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.800
I can see my connected and my local routes, and on R5,

32
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.140
I can see routes for the 10.1.X.X networks and individual routes for all of the different 10.0.X.X networks

33
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.510
as well. If I go back to the topology diagram, on R1,

34
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.910
I should see connected and the local routes for the 10.0.X.X networks, and routes learned via RIP for the

35
00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:05.540
10.1.X.X networks. So, let's verify that. I'll do a 'show ip route' on R1, and I can see I've got all

36
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.200
of those individual 10.1.X.X networks learned through RIP. In the routing table, I can see that the Administrative

37
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:21.680
Distance is a 120, which is the standard AD for RIP, and I can see how many hops away

38
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:30.510
it is as well. Going back to the topology diagram again, I should have a route for the 10.1.2.0/24

39
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.130
network. I could go along the top path, but that would be 1, 2, 3 hops or the bottom

40
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.780
path, which is only 2 hops. So it is going to go out the bottom path, out interface fastEthernet3/0,

41
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.840
and the next hop address should be 10.0.3.2, with a hop count of 2. So let's verify

42
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:59.360
that, and I can see there's learned through RIP. There's the 10.1.2.0/24 network, the hop count

43
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:08.000
is 2, and it's via R5 at 10.0.3.2, out the fastEthernet3/0 interface. So that was the

44
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.080
basic configuration for RIP, I've now got reachability between all of my different internal networks.

45
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:24.020
The next thing I'll configure is summarization because you can see on R1 here that we've got all

46
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:34.490
of the individual 10.1.X.X networks listed separately. If I have a look back at the topology diagram,

47
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.660
I can see that all of the 10.1.X.X networks are available through either R2 or R5. So on R2

48
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:51.030
and R5, I'll configure summarization. I will summarize it to rather than the individual 10.1.X.X/24,

49
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:59.180
I'll summarize it to 10.1.0.0/16, and we do that on the interface

50
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:06.940
that we're advertising the summary route out of. So on fastEthernet0/0 on R2, and fastEthernet3/0 

51
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.700
on R5 I'll do that summary 10.1.0.0/16 route.

52
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.040
I also want to do summarization in the opposite direction as well, so you can see that all of the

53
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.360
10.0.X.X networks are available out the right hand side,

54
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.430
on R2 and R5. So out interface fastEthernet1/0 on R2 and fastEthernet2/0

55
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:41.170
on R5, I'll advertise those as a summary address of 10.0.0.0/16, and that will

56
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.210
go to R3 and R4.

57
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.060
So, let's do that on R2 first.

58
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:57.160
So I'll jump onto its command line, and that was, the right hand side interface on R2 was interface

59
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.300
FastEthernet0/0.

60
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.310
This is the one it's facing R1, and I want to advertise the 10.1.X.X networks out

61
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:13.330
this interface. So the command is 'ip summary-address', I'll use tab completion for that. It's for the RIP

62
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.800
protocol, and that was the 10.1.0.0 networks, and I'll advertise it as a /16, so that's

63
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:32.450
255.255.0.0. In the opposite direction, that was on interface FastEthernet1/0, and 'ip summary-address

64
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:41.600
rip 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0'. So, that is R2 done.

65
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:51.220
I also need to do R5, so I'll go to global configuration. On R5, the interface facing R1

66
00:06:51.670 --> 00:07:00.060
is 'interface FastEthernet3/0', and I want to do 'ip summary-address rip', the '10.1.0.0'

67
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:08.170
networks, '255.255.0.0'. And in the other direction, it was 'interface FastEthernet2/0',

68
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:16.530
which is facing over to the left, and that's going to be 'ip summary-address rip 10.0.0.0

69
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.630
255.255.0.0.

70
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:28.840
Okay, so that's my summary routes configured on R2 and R5. So let's check, this is working now.

71
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:39.370
So I'll go back on to R1, and what I'll do is I'm going to restart RIP here. Normally, in a production

72
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.570
environment, you wouldn't want to do that, obviously, because you would lose your routes. You would just

73
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:51.100
wait for RIP to reconverge, but that can take a few minutes. So to speed things up here, I'll say 'config t',

74
00:07:51.100 --> 00:08:06.010
and I'll do a 'no router rip', and then 'router rip', 'version 2', 'no auto-summary' and 'network 10.0.0.0'.

75
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:11.430
So I just restarted RIP there, just to force it to converge immediately. And now, if I do a

76
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:19.780
'show ip route', you see that rather than having all those individual 10.1.X.X/24 networks,

77
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:27.400
I've got a route for 10.1.0.0/16 and the individual networks are now removed

78
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:34.179
from the routing table. If we go back to the topology diagram, you see that when I did a summary route

79
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:39.760
on R2 and R5, well it's 1 hop from R1 to both of those.

80
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:46.450
So that's an equal cost, it's equal hop count, which is the RIP metric. So both of those go into the routing

81
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:53.710
table, and R1 will do equal cost load balancing over both of them. So that's why you can see for

82
00:08:53.740 --> 00:09:02.560
10.1.0.0/16, I've got 2 routes, which have both got a hop count of 1. One is

83
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:10.420
going out FastEthernet3/0 to 10.0.3.2, which is on R5. The other one is out

84
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:20.260
FastEthernet0/0 to 10.0.0.2, which is R2. Okay, so that was our summarization configured.

85
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:27.470
Last thing I want to do is to give Internet connectivity everywhere.

86
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:36.100
So on R4, we've got a connection out to the service provider at 203.0.113.2.

87
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.850
On R4, I will add a default static route

88
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:46.840
going out to the service provider, and I'll then inject that into RIP, so that all of my other routers learn

89
00:09:46.840 --> 00:10:02.750
about it. So let's go on to R4, and I want to do an IP route for 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, so that's a default static

90
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.530
route,

91
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:08.470
and the next hop address is 203.0.113.2,

92
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.250
at the service provider.

93
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:16.000
Now, I could go on to all of my other routers and also configure a static default route on all of those

94
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:16.790
as well.

95
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:26.730
But to save me all that admin work instead, I inject it into RIP on R4. So the command to do that is

96
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:38.370
'router rip', and then 'default-information originate' and that will inject it into RIP.

97
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:49.530
And if I go back on to R1 again, and I'll just restart RIP on here again. So let me copy my config,

98
00:10:49.530 --> 00:11:02.470
go back on to R1, 'config t', I'll do a 'no router rip' and then, restart RIP again.

99
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.890
I must've not copied that correctly,

100
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.650
I'll just type it in.

101
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:11.300
Okay, so 'router rip', 'version 2', 'no auto-summary', 'network 10.0.0.0',

102
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.440
and then if I do a 'show ip route',

103
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.870
it still needs to have gone through the other routers as well.

104
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.460
So let's see if it's showing up yet,

105
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:28.890
and there I can see, it's in RIP. I've got a default static route and it's going to the next hop of 10.0.3.2,

106
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.250
which is on R5, out interface FastEthernet3/0.

107
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:40.900
If I also look at R2 and do a 'show ip route' there as well,

108
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:47.070
I can also see that that default route is being propagated throughout my network.

109
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:55.210
Oh, one last thing that I want to do is I also, let's say that I want my routers to have a route

110
00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:00.010
to that 203.0.113.0 network. Let's go back to the topology diagram.

111
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:06.590
So, let's say I want all of my other routers to have a route to the 203.0.113.0 network.

112
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:12.810
That's not happening right now, because I didn't have a network statement configured for that on R4.

113
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:19.030
So we'll add that with a network statement, but I don't want to advertise my internal network information

114
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.830
out to the service provider.

115
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:27.570
So, I'm going to make interface FastEthernet3/0 on R4 a passive interface. So, that's the last thing

116
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.070
to do.

117
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:46.070
Let's go on to R4 again, and under 'router rip', I will say 'passive-interface FastEthernet3/0',

118
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:54.620
and then 'network 203.0.113.0'.

119
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.190
Okay, that's done now,

120
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.580
and let's go back on to R1 again.

121
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:10.400
So you see that previously, I did not have a route for the 203.0.113.0 network on R1.

122
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.990
It might not have converged yet, so let's do the same again.

123
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:25.180
Let's restart RIP, so 'no router rip', 'router rip', 'version 2', 'no auto-summary', without a typo, and 'network 10.0.0.0'.

124
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.190
And if I do a 'show ip route' now,

125
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:36.420
hopefully, there's my route for the 203.0.113.0 network. But the service provider

126
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:45.380
router won't learn any of our internal routes because, if I go back to the topology diagram again, on FastEthernet3/0

127
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:50.740
on R4, I made that a passive interface. So, R4 is not going to advertise any RIP

128
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.030
routes out of that interface. Okay,

129
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.040
that was it.

130
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.730
That was our RIP configuration and verification.

131
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:04.000
I'll see you in the next section where we'll move on to EIGRP.
