00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:15.090
In this lecture, you'll learn about the characteristics of OSPF, and I'll also do

2
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:24.460
a comparison with our other Interior Gateway Routing Protocols of RIP and EIGRP. So, OSPF stands

3
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:32.870
for Open Shortest Path First. It's a Link State routing protocol as opposed to the Distance Vector routing protocols of

4
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:42.820
RIP and EIGRP. Like EIGRP, it supports large networks and has very fast convergence time. Messages are sent

5
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.310
using multicast rather than broadcast, so it's more efficient, and OSPF is an open standard protocol.

6
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.320
It uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm to determine the best path to learned networks.

7
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:09.080
So, that's where it gets its Open SPF name from. Okay, comparing OSPF with RIP and EIGRP. RIP has

8
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.250
scalability limitations that we discussed in the earlier lectures, so it's not typically used in production

9
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.360
networks. It's suitable for very small production networks or for lab or test environments.

10
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.140
If you've got a lab and you're not testing the routing protocol, you want to test something else, so you just

11
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.260
want to get the routing up and running quickly and easily, then RIP is a good choice for that. But not

12
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.170
typically used in production networks because of the scalability issues,

13
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:52.970
so that means your choice for your IGP comes down to either OSPF or EIGRP. Out of the two, OSPF is the most

14
00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.760
commonly used. It supports large networks and it has always been an open standard. It is supported on all

15
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.300
vendors' equipment, and there's plenty of support for OSPF, supported by everybody,

16
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.830
loads of engineers understand it and are used to working on it,

17
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.680
lots of documentation on the Internet, etc. EIGRP, however, can be simpler to implement and troubleshoot.

18
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.980
But, EIGRP was historically a Cisco proprietary protocol.

19
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.780
It's an open standard now, but there's still very limited support

20
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.180
on other vendor's equipment.

21
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.890
Most other vendors equipment won't support EIGRP.

22
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:49.750
So if you wanted the simplicity of EIGRP, that meant that you were locked in to using only Cisco equipment.

23
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.770
If you wanted to be able to use any vendors' equipment, then your choice would be OSPF. So that's why

24
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.140
OSPF has been more popular than EIGRP.

25
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.330
However, they're both very similar, they're both very good protocols.

26
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.230
So if you want the simplicity, maybe you go with EIGRP.

27
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:16.550
If you don't want to have that Cisco vendor lock in, then you can go with OSPF. So OSPF, it's a Link State

28
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.350
routing protocol. With our Link State routing protocols,

29
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.370
each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbors.

30
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.210
This information is then passed unchanged from one router to another. So that's the difference between

31
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.090
Link State routing protocols and our Distance Vector routing protocols.

32
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.160
Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces, and what they

33
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.390
connect to. OSPF routers use LSA, Link State Advertisements, to pass on the routing updates.

34
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.380
Our OSPF operations,

35
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.020
so when you enable OSPF on a router, the first thing it will do

36
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.640
will discover its directly connected neighbors and form adjacencies with them.

37
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.330
They will then share routes with each other

38
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:17.410
by flooding the Link State Database (LSDB). Once all of the potential routes are learned, the router will then compute

39
00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:22.560
the shortest path and the best routes will be installed in the routing table.

40
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.040
After that, the routers will respond to network changes, for example, if any new links are added, or if

41
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.660
any links

42
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:35.060
go down. Our different packet types that are used in OSPF,

43
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.960
first one is the Hello packet.

44
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.380
As soon as you enable OSPF on an interface, it will start sending out and listening for Hello packets.

45
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.700
And when it receives a Hello packet on that interface, it will form an adjacency with the neighbor.

46
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.680
Once the routers have formed adjacencies, they will send DBDs to each other. DBD is the Database Descriptor.

47
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.580
That includes information about all the networks that the routers know about. If the router is missing

48
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.360
information about any of the networks it received in the DBD from a neighbor, it will send that neighbor

49
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.890
an LSR, which is a Link State Request, asking for more information.

50
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.920
The router will reply back with an LSA, a Link State Advertisement. Other packet types we can have is

51
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.940
an LSU, a Link State Update. That contains a list of LSAs which should be updated.

52
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.800
This is used during flooding.

53
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.550
So for example, if a new link was added or if a link went down,

54
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.440
that information needs to get flooded everywhere with an LSU.

55
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.030
And finally, we have the LSAck, which is the acknowledgement message.

56
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.760
Whenever a router receives a message from a neighbor, it will send an acknowledgement back.

57
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.360
So, this makes sure that the protocol is reliable.

58
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.410
If a router sends out a packet and it doesn't get an acknowledgement, it will resend it.

59
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.780
Okay,

60
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.880
so that was our OSPF characteristics. In the next lecture, we'll take a look at how to configure it.
