00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.400
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure a log with a lab Damul I'm using the same simple topology

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.900
again.

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.410
I've got my Rotar one at Tandoor Order 0.01, and I've got my Annemasse network monitoring system at

4
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.480
Tandoor over 100.

5
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.780
That's going to act as the log server.

6
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.350
And I'm actually on ten point one hundred right now.

7
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.590
I've currently got a control session open with router.

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.330
You can see that there.

9
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.490
And I'm going to open up a telnet session as well so you can see the difference with the logging in

10
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.550
the console and overactivity wireline.

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:00.510
So I'll go to Potti and I'll tell that to Tand or the old one and log in here.

12
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.420
Should I click in right window and put in my password?

13
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.350
OK, so that's me logged in over telnet as well.

14
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.170
And I'll come to the bigger console window and I'll just show logging to look at the current state.

15
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.170
This is the default right now so you can see that the default logging level is debugging and I'm going

16
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.430
to be logging the console and the buffer by default, not to the monitor, which is my telnet and my

17
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.840
SS each session we can see that working.

18
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:50.070
If I go to the telnet session and I'll go to interface fast three swash zero dollars check and see if

19
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.500
it are not shut right now.

20
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.520
So I'll do your IP interface brief and three zero.

21
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.790
It's no actually being used as currently admin up so that they not interface.

22
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.820
And when I do that, we should see there's the logging message showing up in the console window, it

23
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:20.420
doesn't show up in the telnet window because logging is not enabled to your viewing line by default.

24
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.210
OK, let's do some configuring then so you could see that we do have logging enabled to the console.

25
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.000
Right now, let's turn it off.

26
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.980
So I could do that in either window here, either in my talent or my console window.

27
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:43.190
I will go to global config and do no logging console to turn off the logging to the console.

28
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.880
And I do want to enable logging to my telnet session and watch me.

29
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.270
Logging to its monitor for your viewing lines was set at level five.

30
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.970
And also I'm going to make sure the terminal monitor is enabled in here as well.

31
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:16.520
Now, if I go back to interface first three swash zero and I will do a no shut on there now and you'll

32
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.080
see that it should get logged to my telnet session.

33
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.100
There is there.

34
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.500
And it didn't get logged to the console session because I disabled logging on there.

35
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.520
OK, another thing I'll do is just configure logging to the buffer as well.

36
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.480
So for that I will see logging buffer.

37
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.690
Let's make it seven, which is what it was already anyway.

38
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:51.590
And if I now do a show logging, I can see that logging is disabled to the control.

39
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.280
I've got it set to level five, which is notifications to monitor logging, which is for my telnet and

40
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.710
AC sessions and buffer logging is the debugging level.

41
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.300
You can also see how many messages were received in each of them as well.

42
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.740
They're different values here because I've been playing with the logging values.

43
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.850
OK, OK, so what we're doing here at Michurin logging, if I have spacebar, scroll down, you'll see

44
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.240
all of my logging events are in the logging buffer.

45
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.770
I did a debug of ICMP earlier when I was doing a ping.

46
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.800
So that's where you see all the ICMP events in.

47
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.880
They're also the interface going up and down I was just doing a minute ago as well.

48
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.760
OK, so that's pretty much it for our internal logging and configuring that.

49
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.630
Let's also do some external logging as well.

50
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:57.410
So right now I have installed the free Kiwi's just log server on my PC here, which is that tandoor

51
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.210
order order 100.

52
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.520
I haven't done any logging to it yet, so let's set that up now.

53
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:15.580
So I'll go back on the command line on my router and global config offset logging to my log server tandoor

54
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.250
order, order one hundred and I'll set the severity level of events I want to send there so I'll see

55
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.990
a logging trap.

56
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.620
I don't use the debugging level.

57
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:37.850
And now if I go back to that interface Fast's three swash zero, I'll do I do your IP interface brief

58
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.510
again.

59
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:46.160
I can see it's currently administratively shut down so I'll do a no shut down on that interface and

60
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.170
a see that getting logged.

61
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:56.390
So I see it being logged here in my telnet session and I also see it being logged on this log server

62
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.530
as well.

63
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.140
And 5N do a shutdown again.

64
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.680
I'll show you that being logged in both locations as well.

65
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.250
OK, so that was how to configure.

66
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.880
Just log.

67
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.740
See you in the next lecture.
