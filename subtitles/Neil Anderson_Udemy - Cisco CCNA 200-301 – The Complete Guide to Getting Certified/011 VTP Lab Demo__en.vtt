00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:15.850
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure VTP, the VLAN Trunking Protocol, with a lab demo.

2
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.110
So, I've got the usual lab topology here.

3
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.500
I've got my three switches, SW1 through to SW3.

4
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.240
Right now, I've configured trunks between each of the switches, but that's all of the configuration

5
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.900
that I've done.

6
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.600
I haven't created any VLANs anywhere and I haven't created any access ports.

7
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.350
So, let's verify that.

8
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.360
So I'll go on to SW1,

9
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:52.940
and if I do a 'show run' in here and go down to the configuration for that interface GigabitEthernet0/1,

10
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.120
you can see that I've configured it as a trunk port,

11
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.069
and the only VLAN that is configured right now is VLAN 199 for the Native VLAN.

12
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:13.970
So if I do a 'show vlan brief', you can see that the Sales and the Eng VLANs have not been created yet.

13
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.220
So I created a Native VLAN, so that I could do my trunk configuration.

14
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.680
So that's how it's configured on SW1,

15
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.000
it's the same one SW2 and SW3.

16
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.910
And if I do a 'show vtp status' on here, I haven't changed this,

17
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.260
so this is going to be the default where the VLAN domain name is currently null,

18
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.210
there isn't one, and the VTP mode is server.

19
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.940
That's the same on all of the switches.

20
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.400
What I want to do in this lab, if I have a look at the topology again,

21
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:58.240
I'm going to configure SW1 as a VTP server, SW2 will be VTP transparent, and SW3

22
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.100
will be VTP client.

23
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.590
So I'll configure the VLANs on this server,

24
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.590
the VTP transparent SW2 should pass that information on to the client and the VLAN should show

25
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.100
up there.

26
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.460
I'm also going to need to configure the VLANs on SW2 because it's in transparent mode.

27
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.060
So let's go from right to left,

28
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.550
I'll configure the VTP client first. So I'll go on to SW3,

29
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.400
I just do a 'show vlan brief' on here, so you can see there's no VLANs there yet, and a 'show vtp status'

30
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.800
and it's the default of no domain name and it is currently a server. So on here,

31
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.950
I will say 'vtp domain',

32
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.040
let's make it 'Flackbox', and I need to go to global configuration before I can do that.

33
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.260
So 'vtp domain Flackbox',

34
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:04.940
and 'vtp mode client'. So I get a confirmation message that it's changed it to Flackbox and it's changed

35
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.890
it to client mode. I'll do I do 'show vtp status' and I should see that is changed,

36
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.560
so there is the domain name and it's client mode.

37
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.880
So, that is SW3 configured.

38
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.580
Next, I will do SW2. So on SW2,

39
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.220
I don't want it to participate in the VTP domain. If I do a 'show vtp status',

40
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.290
it's also at the default settings.

41
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:39.590
Actually, what's happened here on SW2 is that it has picked up the domain name from the other

42
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.680
switch, which is Flackbox, and it's still a server which is the default.

43
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:54.170
So I'll go to global configuration here, and I will say 'vtp mode transparent'.

44
00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.420
So it's going to be independent for its VLAN configuration now, and a 'do show vtp status' just to verify

45
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.770
that it did

46
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.410
take that,

47
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.960
and yes, it is now transparent.

48
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:14.930
The last one to do is SW1 and on SW1, let's do a 'show vtp status' again,

49
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.800
and I see that it's picked up the domain name as well, at Flack box.

50
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.280
So I'll go to global config and if I do a 'vtp domain Flackbox' in here,

51
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.660
it's going to tell me that the domain name was already set to that, and I'll say 'vtp mode server' and it's

52
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.210
going to tell me it was already a server.

53
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.160
Okay, so that is VTP set up.

54
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.660
All I need to do now is actually configure my VLANs. So again, I'll do a 'do show vlan brief',

55
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.080
I don't have any VLANs configured yet apart from the Native VLAN for my trunks. So on the server,

56
00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.910
I'll say 'vlan 10', 'name Eng', and 'vlan 20', 'name Sales',

57
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:10.460
and if I now look in the VLAN database here with a 'show vlan brief', I can see that those VLANs have

58
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:19.700
been created. If I go over onto SW3 now, it didn't have any VLANs previously.

59
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.700
I just scrolled up there,

60
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.590
you can see that the Eng and the Sales VLANs weren't there before.

61
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:35.030
But if I do a 'show vlan brief' now, I can see that it has learned about the Eng and the Sales VLANs

62
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.190
from the server.

63
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:48.170
If I go onto SW2, and I do a 'show vlan brief' on here, the VLANs aren't showing up on there,

64
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.480
the new ones, because it's transparent.

65
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.910
It doesn't synchronize its database.

66
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.250
Okay, next thing to do is to test everything is working.

67
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.340
So, I will configure the switchports. To save me typing this in,

68
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.140
I've put it into a text file, so let me bring that up.

69
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.240
So on SW1,

70
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:21.250
interfaces fastEthernet0/1 and fastEthernet0/2 are in the Eng VLAN 10 and port fastEthernet0/3 is in the Sales VLAN. So let

71
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.640
me copy this and then paste it in on SW1,

72
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:41.300
and I've also got a config ready for SW3, where interfaces fastEthernet0/1 and fastEthernet0/2 are int the Sales VLAN,

73
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.120
and fastEthernet0/3 is in the Eng VLAN.

74
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.840
So I'll copy that and paste that into SW3,

75
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.690
paste that in. Let's have a look at the topology diagram,

76
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:02.680
so there you see the Eng PCs that I've configured their access ports now on SW1, and on SW3

77
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.870
as well for ENG3,

78
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.250
and I've also configured my access ports for Sales as well.

79
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:20.850
So now, if I go onto the ENG1 PC, and I'll try to ping 10.10.10.12, which is ENG3,

80
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.100
which is on the other far end switch.

81
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.850
I'm going to try this. It's going to fail,

82
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:35.520
and the reason for that is if I go back onto the switches again, you'll see on SW3

83
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:44.910
if I do a 'show vlan brief', I've got the Eng and the Sales VLANs and I've also put my clients into

84
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:54.090
the correct access VLAN, so that was on SW3, and the same thing on SW1 'show vlan brief',

85
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.930
it knows about the VLANs, and the clients are put into the correct VLAN.

86
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:08.640
The problem is if I have a look at SW2, if I can find it in here, when I do a 'show vlan brief' in

87
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:17.240
here, it doesn't know about the Sales and the Eng VLANs because this is VTP transparent.

88
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.010
So looking at the topology diagram again, it comes in from SW1

89
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:29.790
to SW2, tagged with a Dot1Q tag of the Eng VLAN, but SW2 doesn't know about

90
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.450
the VLAN.

91
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.200
So that's why the traffic is failing right now.

92
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:40.020
So I need to go on to SW2 and in global configuration, because it's transparent,

93
00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.720
I need to add my VLANs here as well.

94
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.850
So I'll say 'vlan 10', 'name Eng', and 'vlan 20', 'name Sales'.

95
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:57.360
If I now go back onto my Engineering PC, try the ping again,

96
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.670
it will probably fail for a little while.

97
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.800
I need to give this a second to come up.

98
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.010
So let's just watch the request time out,

99
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.420
and it might take a few pings, I might even have to do the ping again before it's going to actually

100
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.310
come up and allow the traffic through.

101
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.500
Okay, there we go.

102
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.540
So the last one succeeded,

103
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.320
and if I do the ping again, I'll see they're all going to work now.

104
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.610
So I've now got end-to-end connectivity between my Eng PCs,

105
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.990
let's check that Sales is working as well.

106
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.590
This should also be good.

107
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.700
So I'm on SALES1,

108
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.260
I will ping SALES3. So SALES1

109
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:46.190
is on SW3, SALES3 is on SW1 on the other side,

110
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.230
it's at 10.10.20.12,

111
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.410
and this works just fine too.

112
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.930
So I've got end-to-end connectivity between my PCs in the same VLANs,

113
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:05.510
but if I go on a Sales PC and I try to ping an Engineering PC, this is going to fail because

114
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.940
it's in a different IP subnet,

115
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:15.950
and if you have a look at our topology diagram, I don't have a router yet. So we need to configure

116
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.740
inter-VLAN on routing to allow that to work,

117
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.260
that's what we're going to do in the next lecture.
