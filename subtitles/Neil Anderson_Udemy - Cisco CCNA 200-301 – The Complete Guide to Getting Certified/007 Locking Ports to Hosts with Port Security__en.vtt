00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.630
In the last couple of lectures, you learned how you can use port security to prevent unauthorized devices

2
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.650
like wireless access points and switches on your network. In this lecture, you'll learn how you can

3
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.240
use port security to lock interfaces down to a particular host based on its MAC address.

4
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.880
Before we get to that, this works in conjunction with the maximum MAC addresses setting of port security.

5
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.000
When you enable port security on an interface, this default to one. So a maximum of one MAC address

6
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.310
is allowed to send traffic into the port.

7
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.240
You can increase that if you need to.

8
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.420
If multiple hosts share that one physical port. For example, if you've got an IP phone plugged in there

9
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.930
with a PC plugged in the back of the IP phone, and both the phone and the PC, need to use that

10
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.840
one physical port on the switch. To do that,

11
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.540
go to the interface. In our example, interface  fa0/2, switchport port-security maximum 2.

12
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.700
It will never allow 2 MAC addresses to send traffic into that port.

13
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.670
To verify this, the same command as usual, show port-security interface fa0/2, and

14
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.340
it shows you the difference between the maximum MAC address and the total MAC address output that you see here.

15
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.660
Maximum MAC addresses is the total that is allowed to send traffic into the port. Total MAC addresses is how

16
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.140
many are currently detected on the port.

17
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.990
So here, we've allowed two but it's only discovered one MAC address so far.

18
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.450
OK, so let's talk about how to lock the port down to particular hosts based on their MAC address.

19
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.500
We can manually add the MAC address that is allowed on a particular port. To do that,

20
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.830
the configuration here, we've said interface fa0/10, switchport port-security to enable

21
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.100
port security, switchport port-security mac address 1111.2222.3333

22
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.840
for the example.

23
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.050
And then switchport port-security maximum 1.

24
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.950
Once we've done this, it's only that one MAC address that is allowed to send traffic into this port. If any

25
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.620
other MAC address tries to send traffic in,

26
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.950
it's going to get blocked and it will take the violation action, which by default is to shutdown the

27
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.460
port.

28
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.880
But let's look at another scenario. So the reason you would do this would be a highly secured environment.

29
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.610
Let's say it's a bank. But let's say for this example, that it's the headquarters and there are

30
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.330
1000 PCs there.

31
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.100
So we've currently got those 1000 PCs which are authorized hosts already connected to the network,

32
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.410
and we want to lock it down.

33
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.640
It's only those PCs that are allowed on the network and only on the ports that they're already connected

34
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.940
to.

35
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.360
Well, obviously, it wouldn't be scalable for us to find out if its 1000 MAC addresses and

36
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.270
then go and configure all the switches locking that one MAC address down to that one particular port.

37
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.620
That just isn't really feasible from an administrative point of view.

38
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.100
But thankfully, there's an easy way that we can get the same effect and not by using sticky MAC addresses.

39
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.310
Sticky MAC addresses add the learned MAC address to the running configuration. So you saw already from the

40
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.200
earlier lessons that when a host starts transmitting on the port,

41
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.040
the switch will learn the MAC address. With sticky MAC addresses,

42
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.400
it can learn the MAC address that is already connected to the port.

43
00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.870
When it does this, it adds that the MAC address to the running configuration, associating it with

44
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.700
the port for port security.

45
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.610
You can then save that to startup config and that will make it permanent.

46
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.110
So that locks the port down to the PC that is currently plugged in the port without you having it manually

47
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:23.980
specify what the MAC address is. The configuration to do this, interface fa0/2,

48
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.890
switchport port-security,

49
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.600
and then switchport port-security mac-address sticky.

50
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.020
Now there is a lot of confusion with this and people get confused between what's the difference between

51
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.260
when I say MAC address sticky and when I just don't mention the MAC address. I'll show you that when

52
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.750
we do the lab demo and it's going to make it clear.

53
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.980
OK, once we've configured this to verify the MAC addresses that are associated with the different

54
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.230
interfaces, you can just show port-security address. Here,

55
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.750
I can see on fa0/2 there's a MAC address that was dynamically configured.

56
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.820
So this was automatically learned.

57
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.180
The same with the MAC address on fa0/3.

58
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.460
The MAC address on fa0/10,

59
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.200
I can see secure configured.

60
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.640
It was manually added, the MAC address 1.2.3.

61
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.680
That's how you can check the MAC addresses associated with your different interfaces for port security.

62
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.050
And finally, we can also put in a command to view a summary of all the ports on the switch.

63
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.860
This is useful if you want to see if any ports have been shutdown because they're violating - all in one output with

64
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.830
a single command. To do that, it is show port-security.

65
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.560
OK, so that was the theory and also the command examples of how to configure port security to lock

66
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.420
your ports down to particular hosts. In the next lecture,

67
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.580
I'll show you how to configure this as well.

68
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.430
And like I said, it's going to clear up any confusion you had about having no MAC

69
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.850
address specified, having a manually set MAC address or using the sticky addresses.

70
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.030
See you in the next lecture.
