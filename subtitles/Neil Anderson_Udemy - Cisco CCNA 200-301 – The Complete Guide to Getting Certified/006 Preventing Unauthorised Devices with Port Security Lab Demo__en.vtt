00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.800
In this lecture, you'll learn about how to configure port security to prevent unauthorized devices

2
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.380
like switches and wireless access points on your network. And we'll use a lab demo to show this.

3
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.360
So I've got packet tracer open here.

4
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:34.740
I got Switch1 with a couple of PCs plugged in. PC1 and PC2. They've got IP addresses 10.10.10.10

5
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.790
and 10.10.10.11.

6
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.990
They're on ports fa0/1 and fa0/2. Ignore PC3 for now.

7
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.830
That's the villain that's going to show up in a minute.

8
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.520
I guess if I have a look at my config on Switch1, I don't have any configuration on here yet.

9
00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.660
I've just added a hostname and I've also configured spanning-tree portfast on all the ports just

10
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.959
so it'll come up quicker so you can see what's going on more quickly.

11
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:11.950
And what I'm going to do here is I got a global config and then on all of my interfaces, the end hosts

12
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.980
are going to be plugged in.

13
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.740
So that would be interface range fa0/1 - 24.

14
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm going to say switchport port-security

15
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.770
and that is going to give me an error message, because I can't put it on a

16
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.630
port which is a dynamic port. I need to configure them as access ports first.

17
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.990
So I've still got the range selected. So I can say switchport mode access to make them access ports

18
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.690
and then I can try the command again, switchport port-security

19
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830
and it takes the command now.

20
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.400
So I haven't added any parameters. Let's just have all of the default settings.

21
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.520
So let's have a look and see what that does.

22
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.860
So I will do a

23
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.740
show

24
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.770
port-security interface fa0/1. We're all going to have the same config and you can

25
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:17.140
see that the maximum MAC addresses allowed is one. And if there's a violation, the port is going to be

26
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.710
shutdown.

27
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.570
So right now, I've only got one host plugged in to any port so the port shouldn't get

28
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.930
shutdown.

29
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.350
They should have connectivity to each other. Let's check that. I'm going to PC2 and I'll ping PC1

30
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.710
at 10.10.10.10,

31
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.190
and the ping works just fine.

32
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.450
OK, so when you've got the network set up as normal with just one end host plugged into your ports, then

33
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.530
everything is going to work

34
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.430
OK. If I go back to the packet tracer

35
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.750
front end again, and let's say that in the part of the building where PC2 is, they've hired some

36
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.990
additional staff there and there's not enough wall ports.

37
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.740
So what we should do is get in touch with the IT department and say, "Can you put some more wall ports in,

38
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.190
please?"

39
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.420
But you know what?

40
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.990
Sometimes users do things that they shouldn't do and take things in their own hands. So let's say that the users

41
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.770
down here, what they do is that they removed the cable connected to PC2. So let's take that out.

42
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.520
And then so that they can get additional hosts plugged in there, they add an additional switch in

43
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:43.280
that part of the network. So they put a switch in here and then the cable. The host that was there already,

44
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.350
they cable that into the switch.

45
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.980
And the new host, they cabled that into the switch as well. And then,

46
00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.290
they've still got the network cable that was plugged into PC2 before that they know was alive on

47
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.190
the network, so they plug that into the switch.

48
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:11.420
So that was on fa0/2 on our Switch1 and they plug that into their new switch.

49
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:21.170
And you think, great, we've got all of our new hosts are on the network now. But if we go on to PC3

50
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.490
and from PC3, we ping 10.10.10.10,

51
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:34.860
the ping is going to fail because port security on Switch1 sees that as an additional MAC address. There's now

52
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.540
two MAC addresses trying to send traffic into

53
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.600
fa0/2, it's going to shut the port down.

54
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.620
Let's verify that by going on to Switch2 again.

55
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.890
And I will do the same command again.

56
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.790
show port-security interface fa0/1. Notice before the status was Secure-up and there was

57
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.170
no violation.

58
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.220
Now,

59
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.370
I can see that, oh, I'm looking at the wrong port. I'm looking at fa0/1.

60
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.260
Fa0/2 would be exactly the same as that.

61
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.990
So let's go on to the correct one, which is fa0/2 and here, before, it was Secure-up.

62
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:22.300
Now I can see that it is Secure-shutdown, because there is a security violation.

63
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:34.290
And if I do a show ip interface brief, I can see that it is showing as down/down on here now.

64
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.350
OK, so to get the interface back up again, I need to remove the offending host.

65
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.760
So the reason we've done this now is that the port is going to be down.

66
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.760
The users are going to get in touch with IT and say, hey, they won't tell you what they did.

67
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.870
So you're going to hear about it now anyway, because they've lost connectivity

68
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.660
in that part of the network, so you will discover this.

69
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.950
You'll go down there.

70
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.540
If the switch, if the rogue switch is still plugged in, then you will go and cable everything back as

71
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.050
it was.

72
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.680
Possibly the users will have set things back anyway.

73
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.540
So let's have a look.

74
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.970
So back when you're, let's say you go down there and the users haven't fixed anything, they left it as is.

75
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.460
So we need to set things back as they were.

76
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:32.010
So we're going to remove that rogue switch and then cable fa0/2 back into PC2 as it was originally.

77
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:40.570
We'll also get a new wall port in that part of the building so that we can also cable Switch1 into

78
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.500
PC3 as well.

79
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:50.070
Now, at this point, PC3 was put into interface fa0/3, which is not shutdown.

80
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:57.100
So if I go into PC3 now and ping 10.10.10.10, this ping is going to work

81
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:04.960
OK. But if I go back on to PC2 and they were able to ping 10.10.10.10 before

82
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.100
they start messing with the network, if I try pinging now, it still won't work because the interface

83
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.420
is still err-disabled. To bring the interface back up again,

84
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.220
an administrator has to go on the switch and go on to that interface,

85
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.700
toggle config t, interface fa0/2, do a shutdown and then a

86
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.960
no shutdown.

87
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.720
And that will bring the interface back into service, so if I now do a show port-security interface fa0/2,

88
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:45.570
I can see that it is back to Secure-up again now. And a show ip interface brief,

89
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.490
I can see that it is being back to up/up.

90
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:58.600
So now if I go back onto my host, which was PC2 and try pinging again, the ping works again.

91
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:06.690
OK, so that was port security and how we can use it to stop users putting unauthorized wireless access

92
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.880
points and switches onto the network.
