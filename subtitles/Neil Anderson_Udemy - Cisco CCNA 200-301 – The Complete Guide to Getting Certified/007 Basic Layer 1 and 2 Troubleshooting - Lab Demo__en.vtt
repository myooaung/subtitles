00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.750
Alright,

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.180
let's have a look at those troubleshooting commands in the lab.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.450
So,

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:22.560
I'm back on the lab here, and I've got SW1 is connected to R1. On the SW1's side,

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.360
it's on interface fastEthernet0/1. On R1 it's interface fastEthernet0/0.

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.720
Let's just confirm that.

7
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.430
So I'll do a 'show run interface fastEthernet0/1' on the switch, and I've put a description in there it's the

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.320
'Link to R1'. I haven't configured any other settings on there, so they're all at the default. If

9
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:56.850
I do a 'show ip interface brief', I can see that I've got my Vlan1 interface configured with IP

10
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.960
address 192.168.0.10, the router is at 192.168.0.1, and FastEthernet0/1

11
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:12.180
is up/up. So, that all looks good. I should be able to ping the router. Let's try

12
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.180
that, 'ping 192.168.0.1', and the ping is good.

13
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.980
Okay, let's have a look and see what happens if a device on the other side is down. So, I'll go on to R1.

14
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.140
Let's just verify we're going to configure the correct interface, so I'll do a 'show run interface

15
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.240
fastEthernet0/0', and I've got my description there. It's the 'Link to SW1'. Its IP address

16
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.980
is 192.168.0.1, and speed and duplex are at auto.

17
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.000
So what I'm going to do on here is I'll go to global configuration, and I'll go to interface FastEthernet0/0,

18
00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.190
and I'm going to do a shutdown. Actually, just before I do it, let's do a 'do show ip interface

19
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.850
brief' here as well, and we already know because it was good on the other side that FastEthernet0/0

20
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.180
is up/up, so it's all good, and we can see the IP address on there. So, I'm still at that interface

21
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.580
configuration. Let's shutdown the interface now, and I should get a verification message. I can see

22
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.880
the interface going down. I'll hit the up arrow a couple of times to bring back my 'do show ip interface

23
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.650
brief', and I'll see now that on interface FastEthernet0/0 is now changed to administratively

24
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:49.590
down because I shutdown that interface. If I jump back onto the switch now, and I'll do a 'show ip interface

25
00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:01.590
brief' again on here, I will see that interface FastEthernet0/1 has now changed to down/down because

26
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.630
the interface is being shutdown on the other side.

27
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.720
When you see down/down, that usually indicates a Layer 1 issue. Either the cable isn't securely connected

28
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.750
on both sides, or the device on the other side is powered down, or just that particular interface on the

29
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.000
other side is powered down.

30
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.990
Okay,

31
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.360
so that's how we check that.

32
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.940
Next up, let's check out the speed and duplex settings.

33
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.900
Actually, I'll just show you also the 'show interface' command

34
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.870
while we're here as well.

35
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.750
You saw this in an earlier lecture.

36
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.100
That will give you information on the interface. It will tell you whether it's up or not. The MAC address,

37
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.030
IP address

38
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.720
will show in here as well, and what it's really useful for is it gives you interface statistics. So, I

39
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.850
can see if traffic is going through there or not.

40
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.670
I can also see the amount of errors on there too.

41
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.150
Okay,

42
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.820
so yeah, let's have a look at the speed and duplex.

43
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.860
So I'll do a 'show run interface fastEthernet0/1' again, and the speed and duplex is not set here,

44
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.170
so it is going to default to auto. If I do a 'show interface fastEthernet0/1,'

45
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:23.010
I can see that the speed and duplex are set to auto.

46
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.230
Okay.

47
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:34.590
Let's have a look on R1 as well, so I'll do I do 'show run interface fastEthernet0/0' on here,

48
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:44.460
and it shows that speed and duplex are auto. If I do a 'do show interface fastEthernet0/0',

49
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:53.280
I can see that again, Auto-duplex and Auto-speed. I can also see the speed it's running at is 100.

50
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.650
So, it's running at 100 megabits per second.

51
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.410
Okay,

52
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.170
the kind of issues that we can have here.

53
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.350
Let's jump back onto SW1 again,

54
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:14.760
and I'll go to the interface configuration, which was for FastEthernet0/1, and I'm going to set the speed

55
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:26.490
to 10 on this side, and I'll go on to R1, and I'll set the speed to 100 here.

56
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:37.290
So I've got a speed mismatch now, and if I jump back on to the switch and do a 'do show ip interface brief',

57
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.700
I can see that on interface FastEthernet0/1, it's now at down/down.

58
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.020
So, that's caused the interface to go down by having that speed mismatch.

59
00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.920
If I do the same command on R1, I 'do show ip interface brief',

60
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.470
and I forgot to bring the interface up.

61
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.920
Okay, let's fix that.

62
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:18.230
So let's go 'interface fastEthernet0/0' and 'no shut'.

63
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.010
And now I'll do a 'do show

64
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.800
ip interface brief', which does have the speed mismatch,

65
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.170
and I can see on the router side it's up/down. So, this interface has got a problem.

66
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.530
It's not going to be passing traffic.

67
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.770
It was up/down on the router side,

68
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:46.210
and if we have a look on the switch side, I can see that it is down/down on this side.

69
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.120
So if you have a speed mismatch, then that's going to cause an issue.

70
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.320
It will bring the interface down typically.

71
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.000
So let's fix that.

72
00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.280
I will set it to speed 100 on this side as well.

73
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.000
So, it matches on both sides now.

74
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:09.670
I'll just flap the link, so I'll do a 'shutdown' and then a 'no shutdown' to bring it down and then back up again.

75
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:19.060
And now, if I do a 'do show ip interface brief', I can see that the interface is now back up/up.

76
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.200
So, I fixed the problem.

77
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.170
The interface is working again.

78
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.390
Okay, so that was a speed mismatch.

79
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.260
Now, let's change the duplex. So on SW1,

80
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.330
I'll set the duplex to half,

81
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:46.000
and on the router, I will set the duplex to full. And I'll go back on the switch again, and it might take

82
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.800
a few seconds, but CDP should tell me that there is a duplex mismatch. There it is. It comes now,

83
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.900
so I get a CDP warning message about the duplex mismatch.

84
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:05.850
You're only going to see this if you're connected in over a console connection by default, not by Telnet,

85
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.250
but you could view it if you did a 'show log'.

86
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:17.830
If I do a 'do show ip interface brief', and I can see that the interface stays up in this case.

87
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:23.490
So if you have a speed mismatch, it will bring the interface down. If you have a duplex mismatch, it will

88
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.520
leave the interface up, but what's going to happen is you're going to get terrible performance over that

89
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.559
link now because you're going to have loads of collisions on there.

90
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.980
So if you do have that problem, make sure, again, that you set it to the same on both sides.

91
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:46.710
So on my switch, I'll set it to duplex full, and on my router, I'll also set it to duplex full, and that's

92
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.710
all my problems solved again.

93
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.370
Okay,

94
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.290
so that was our Layer 1 and Layer 2 basic troubleshooting commands.

95
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.750
Again, remember, speed and duplex

96
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.350
make sure you set it on the same both sides.

97
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:00.740
Okay.

98
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.260
Thank you.

99
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.670
See you in the next lecture.
