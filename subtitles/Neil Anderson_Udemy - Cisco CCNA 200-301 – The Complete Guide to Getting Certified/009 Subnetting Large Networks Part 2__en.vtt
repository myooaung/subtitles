00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.990
Let's do another example. So, the previous example was a Class A on the 4th octet. This time we're going

2
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.840
to do a Class A on the 3rd octet, and this one can get a little bit confusing,

3
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.060
so you might need to pay attention to this one again.

4
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.350
So in our example, we've been allocated a Class A 60.0.0.0/8.

5
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.420
If we subnet it into /19 networks, how many subnets do we have, and how many hosts per subnet?

6
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.460
So pause the video again, and figure out the answer, and I'll see you back here with the answer.

7
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:58.400
Okay, a /19, the line is going to be after 3 bits on the 3rd octet. That leaves us

8
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.519
13 bits for host, 8 in the last octet, and then 5 on the right hand side of the 3rd octet.

9
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.970
To figure out how many hosts each network is going to support,

10
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.800
it's 2 to the power of 13 minus 2,

11
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.730
so that's 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, and 8192

12
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.540
minus the 2, gives us 8190

13
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.000
hosts per network.

14
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:38.580
And because we were allocated a Class A /8 range, the difference between a /8 and a /19

15
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.070
is going to be 11 bits. To figure out how many networks we have, it's 2 to the power of 11,

16
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.390
so we already know 2 to the power of 10 is a 1024, so we'll double that again,

17
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.570
that gives us 2048 subnets.

18
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.250
As usual,

19
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.360
we've got the second part of the question.

20
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.430
So for the IP address 60.15.10.75 /19,

21
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.310
What's the network address, the broadcast address, and the range of valid IP addresses?

22
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.200
Please pause the video as usual, and I'll see you back with the answer.

23
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.370
Okay, in this example, we are subnetting on the 3rd octet, the other examples, we have been subnetting

24
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:31.310
on the 4th octet. The line is after the 32 on the 3rd octet, so the network block addresses

25
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.550
are still going to go up in multiples of 32,

26
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.090
but it's just it's going to be on the 3rd octet rather than the 4th octet.

27
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.550
So, our network address is 60.15.0.0, you can see it if you write out the

28
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.580
whole IP address. Also, we're 60.15.10.75,

29
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.050
we're going up in multiples of 32, so obviously, 10 is less than 32.

30
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.570
So, the network address must be 60.15.0.0.

31
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.670
The next network address would be 60.15.32.0.

32
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.740
So the broadcast address is going to be 1 less than that on the 3rd octet, and 255 on the

33
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.660
4th octet.

34
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.090
So the broadcast address is 60.15.31.255, and the valid host addresses will be between the network

35
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.850
address and the broadcast address,

36
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:35.690
so that's 60.15.0.1 up to 60.15.31.254. Okay, so the value on the 4th octet in the lower

37
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.010
range is going to be a 1.

38
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.950
The higher range is going to be the 254 for the hosts.

39
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.030
The subnetting is done on the 3rd octet

40
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.170
if the subnet mask is anything between a /16 and a /24.

41
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.870
We can use the magic number method for the example

42
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.480
again. It was a /19, so a /19

43
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.480
that's 3 bits on the 3rd octet.

44
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.900
So that is 128, 192, and then

45
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.180
224.

46
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.970
We subtract 224 from 256, which gives us 32 so that we know the address

47
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.810
block is going up in values of 32.

48
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.190
Again, it's on the 3rd octet

49
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.920
rather than the 4th octet here.

50
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.810
We can figure out the same as we did in the previous slide from that

51
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.970
that it must be a network address of 60.15.0.0 because our value in the 3rd octet is 10.

52
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.180
The broadcast address, 1 less than that, 60.15.31.255, valid hosts

53
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.470
60.15.0.1 up to 60.15.31.254. Okay,

54
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:51.790
review this example again if you're not sure about doing it on the 3rd octet. Remember that we figured

55
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.460
out exactly the same way as we did when we were doing it on the 4th octet.

56
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.290
So the address block is figured out exactly the same way,

57
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.860
again. You just need to remember that on the 4th octet,

58
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.330
your hosts are going to go from 1 in the low end up to 254 on the high end.

59
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.230
Let's do one more example.

60
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.140
You've been asked to subnet the 134.65.0.0 network into 6 different networks.

61
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.410
What subnet mask are you going to use?

62
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.370
Please pause the video, and figure out the answer.

63
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.300
Okay, before I show you the answer on the next slide, let's see how we would figure this out.

64
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.670
The network is 134.65.0.0,

65
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.670
so we know it's a Class B network. And we need to split it into 6 networks,

66
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.420
so we're going to need 3 bits because it's 2, 4, 8.

67
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.060
It's a Class B, so the default subnet mask is a /16.

68
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.360
We need 6 networks, which was 3 bits,

69
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.970
so we add 3 to the /16, and that will give us a /19.

70
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.780
So, very easy to figure this one out,

71
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.520
and that's showing it there with the line on our diagram as well. Some extra information that we weren't

72
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.890
actually asked for in the question, a /19 in dotted decimal is 255.255.224.0, the network

73
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.670
addresses would be going up in blocks of 32, so 134.65.0.0

74
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.710
the next one, 134.65.32.0, etc., and we would have

75
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.530
8190 hosts in each subnet because we've got 13 bits available for the host address.

76
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.780
2 to the power of 13

77
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.700
minus 2 is 8190.

78
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:50.020
Okay, so that's just done for all of the different examples of subnetting. Hopefully, you're confident with

79
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.370
this now. You should be if you've worked through all of those examples, then you're going to be fine

80
00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:02.200
when you do the exam. When you are on the exam, there's lots of different ways they can ask you questions

81
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.550
about subnetting.

82
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.470
But it's all going to boil down to just a few things which you can see here.

83
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:15.550
So, it could be a variation of given a network requirement of 'X' amount of subnet and 'Y' amount of hosts

84
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.240
per subnet.

85
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.450
What network address and subnet mask should you be using for each subnet?

86
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:28.780
The other basic question they can ask is if they give you a particular IP address and subnet mask, calculate

87
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.210
that subnets network address, the broadcast address, and the range of valid host IP addresses.

88
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.450
So again, it could be any variation in those questions. They may ask it in a different way.

89
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.500
But as long as you can answer those questions, which you can know because we've done loads of practice

90
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.370
examples of them, you're going to be fine for anything that they throw at you on the exam.

91
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.450
Okay, so that's our subnetting done.

92
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.700
We've still got a bit more to talk about IP addressing through, starting with private addressing in

93
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.510
the next lecture.
