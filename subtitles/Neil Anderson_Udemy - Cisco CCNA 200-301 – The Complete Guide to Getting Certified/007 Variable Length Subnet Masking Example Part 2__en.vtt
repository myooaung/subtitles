00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.630
The next largest subnet is New York sales which requires 14 hosts.

2
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.510
So I want you to pause the video again here, calculate the optimal subnet mask for New York sales,

3
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.090
and again, determine the network and broadcast addresses, and the range of available host addresses.

4
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.940
So stop the video now,

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.030
I'll see you in a second once you've worked that out.

6
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.660
Okay, so let's look at the answer. We need to support 14 hosts, the smallest possible subnet we can use

7
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.080
is a /28. /28 means we've got 4 bits available for host addresses,

8
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.810
so that's 2, 4, 8, 16 minus 2,

9
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:57.270
that gives us the 14 hosts. 200.15.10.0 to 200.15.10.63

10
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.560
were already being used by the engineering departments.

11
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.360
So the network address that we'll start with here

12
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.050
is 200.15.10.64.

13
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:16.200
If we look at the line, we can see it's after the 16, so 64 plus 16 is 200.15.10.80. Take one

14
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.680
away,

15
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.490
our broadcast address is going to be 200.15.10.79, and the available host addresses

16
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.920
200.15.10.65 to 200.15.10.78,

17
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.820
the addresses that are between the network address and the broadcast address. That's our first 3 departments

18
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.950
done.

19
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.440
The last department was Boston sales, which requires 7 hosts.

20
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.240
So, let's do the same thing again.

21
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.940
Calculate the optimal subnet mask and then the network address, broadcast address, and the host addresses

22
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.690
that we're going to use.

23
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.870
So stop the video now, and I'll show you back with the answer.

24
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.410
Okay, so we need to support 14 hosts, we're going to use a /28 again here, the same as what we

25
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.450
did for the last department.

26
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.920
You can't use a /29, which is a possible mistake, but some people would make. Because we

27
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.360
need to support 7 hosts,

28
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.140
so we go 2, 4, 8. Okay, that's 3 bits, and we'll make a /29.

29
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.360
They forgot to take away the 2 for the network address and the broadcast address.

30
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.000
A /29

31
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.050
supports, 8 minus 2, 6 hosts.

32
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.540
We require 7 here, so that's not enough.

33
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.620
So we're going to use a /28 again, which supports 14 hosts.

34
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.400
The last broadcast address was 200.15.10.79,

35
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.790
so our network address will be 200.15.10.80.

36
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.180
Again, the line is after the 16.

37
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.310
So, the next network address would be 200.15.10.96, which means our broadcast address is going to

38
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.340
be 200.15.10.95.

39
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.720
The valid host addresses are 200.15.10.81 to 200.15.10.94.

40
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.420
Okay, so that's it.

41
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.100
That was our four departments.

42
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.460
So, we're done, right?

43
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.310
No. Remember we have to allocate addresses for the point to point link between the routers in Boston

44
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.460
and New York.

45
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.120
Another thing you would do in the real world is you would also allocate address space for your loopback

46
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.690
addresses.

47
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.790
Loopback addresses are used for management. They're a logical address,

48
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.510
so there's no anything physical on the other, so we'll usually allocate a /32 to our loopback addresses.

49
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.780
Again, we'll talk about loopback addresses more in later lectures.

50
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.360
Don't worry about them for now.

51
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.260
I just mentioned it here for completeness.

52
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.860
Okay, so that last subnet, the link between the New York and Boston routers.

53
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.520
So, let's do the same thing again.

54
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.060
Pause the video,

55
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.920
determine the optimal subnet mask, and the network, broadcast addresses, and the host addresses that

56
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.580
we're going to use.

57
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.190
So pause the video, and I'll see you back with the answer.

58
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.210
So we want to support 2 hosts,

59
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.180
remember a /31 and a /30 supports 2 hosts,

60
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.300
and hopefully, you remember I told you before. Unless the exam explicitly tells you, if you need to support 2

61
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.240
hosts, go with a /30  because that's the standard that we use. It complies with all of the

62
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.280
Internet standards.

63
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.220
We're going to use a /30 here for our 2 hosts.

64
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.060
We're already using up to 200.15.10.95 for our departments,

65
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.520
so our network address will be one up from there.

66
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.210
We're going to use 200.15.10.96.

67
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.260
If you look at the line, it's after the 4,

68
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.320
so the network address is going to go up in increments of 4.

69
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.290
So, the network address would be 200.15.10.100. 1 less than that

70
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.840
gives us our broadcast of 200.15.10.99, which leaves the host addresses

71
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.440
to be 200.15.10.97 and 200.15.10.98.

72
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.580
Okay, one more thing that I want you to do. I want you to have a look again at the network topology

73
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.920
diagram that you saw at the start of this lecture.

74
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.500
You don't need to scroll back.

75
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.060
I'm going to put it up on the next slide.

76
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.110
Then what I want you to do is get a piece of paper and a pencil, and I want you to draw the network

77
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.950
diagram.

78
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.070
But this time, I want you to include the networking information, the different subnets that we just

79
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.670
figured out. So draw,

80
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.960
let me go into the next slide,

81
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.160
so make it look exactly like this, with the routers and the switches.

82
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.790
But rather than saying, Sales: 14 hosts, I want you to say Sales, and then I want you to tell me the

83
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.600
subnet is going to be in use here, so the subnet and the subnet mask in slash notation.

84
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.760
Do that for the 4 departments.

85
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.670
Also, do it for the point to point link.

86
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:05.260
And another thing I want you to do is also put on the IP addresses that will be used on our router interfaces.

87
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.090
For the router interfaces,

88
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.070
use the first available host address in that particular subnet.

89
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.030
Okay, so take your paper and pencil out.

90
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.420
Go ahead and do that now.

91
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.360
On the next slide, I'll show you the answer.

92
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.250
Okay, so here we are with the answer.

93
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.520
Remember when we did our design, we started off with the largest subnets, which was the engineering

94
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.230
departments.

95
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:38.050
So the way I would do my network diagram is I would show engineering in New York that was 200.10.15.0/27.

96
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.760
In Boston, 200.15.10.32/27.

97
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.090
I've then got my sales department in New York, 200.15.10.64/28,

98
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.130
and sales in Boston was 200.15.10.80/28.

99
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.860
And the subnet I used for my point to point link, 200.15.10.96 

100
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.400
/30.

101
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:10.300
Then we're going to use the first available address as the IP address on router interfaces.

102
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:17.060
So that was 200.15.10.1 on the interface on the New York engineering department,

103
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.240
200.15.10.33 for engineering,

104
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.060
200.15.10.65 for New York sales,

105
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.310
200.15.10.81 for Boston sales,

106
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.860
and then the point to point link, I'm using 200.15.10.97 on the left and 200.15.10.98 on the right.

107
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.180
Okay, actually, this would be an acceptable network diagram. In a real world environment,

108
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.950
this is typical for how we would draft that up.

109
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.420
Okay, that's it,

110
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:47.110
so you now know how to do a Variable Length Subnet Mask design for a network.

111
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.610
See you in the next lecture.
