00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.020
In this lecture, you're going to learn why passing the Cisco CCNA is such a great choice for your

2
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.930
career.

3
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:23.430
So, I am here on Monster which is one of the biggest job sites in the UK where I'm from, and I'm going

4
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.720
to plug in all of the other best-known entry and mid-level IT qualifications that you could study for.

5
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:41.060
So let's start with Microsoft MCSA, and I'm going to see how many job results we're going

6
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.870
to get for it. Okay, if you're qualified as MCSA,

7
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.810
there are 143 job vacancies waiting for you today on the Monster. That's for

8
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.980
Microsoft Windows if you want to go into the server team.

9
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.900
Maybe you're not so interested in Windows. Let's have a look at Linux and the RedHat Certified Systems

10
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.670
Administrator. So, there's about 150 jobs for Microsoft MCSA. For RedHat, there's only 21 jobs.

11
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.810
Okay, let's try other Linux.

12
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.180
There's the Linux Professional Institute (LPI), they do qualifications as well which are popular. Only 12 jobs

13
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.230
for LPI.

14
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.280
Okay, maybe Linux isn't such a good idea.

15
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.270
How about VMware, virtualization in the data center. The main qualification for that is VCP,

16
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.260
and there are 111 VCP jobs currently on the Monster website.

17
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.090
Let me go down the list, so maybe we don't want to work in the server of a data center, server team.

18
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.650
Let's have a look at the other networking qualifications.

19
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.480
We'll start off with CompTIA Network+, well-known and popular.

20
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.750
How many jobs have we got for that?

21
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.670
We've got 72.

22
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.040
Maybe we don't want to do a vendor-neutral CompTIA qualification. Maybe we want to do the Juniper

23
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.150
qualification.

24
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.670
The JNCIA is their equivalent of the CCNA. We've got 40 jobs for that.

25
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.910
So, all of these jobs are coming in around maybe 50 or 100 vacancies right now.

26
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.970
Maybe we're not going to do server team or networking. Maybe we want to be on security.

27
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.740
Security is meant to be hot this year. So let's have a search for CompTIA Security,

28
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.470
and if you've got the Security+ qualification, there's 179 jobs waiting for you.

29
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.860
That's a little bit higher, a little bit better, still under 200.

30
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.950
Another well-known security qualification is CEH, the Certified Ethical Hacker, and CEH is way down

31
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.750
at 22 jobs again.

32
00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.480
Okay, so all of the other entry or mid-level popular qualifications I could think of are coming in under

33
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.200
200 vacancies today.

34
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.790
Most of them are around 50, a few of them are up around 150.

35
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.520
Let's have a look for the Cisco CCNA then and see if it's any better.

36
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.530
Okay,

37
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.370
513 jobs waiting for you

38
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.760
once you've got the Cisco CCNA qualification. So you can see from that that Cisco, the CCNA,

39
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.380
it's killing all of the other qualifications out there.

40
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.910
This is the best qualification to do

41
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.940
if you want to break into an IT role.

42
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.700
So, I'm really glad to have you on the course. I'm really happy that I'm going to help you pass this qualification.

43
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.200
It's going to make a huge difference to your career and your life.
