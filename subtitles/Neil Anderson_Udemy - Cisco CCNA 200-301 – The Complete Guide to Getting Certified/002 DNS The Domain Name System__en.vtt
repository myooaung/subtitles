00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.560
In this lecture, you'll learn about the Domain Name System, DNS.

2
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.840
So we're back to the OSI 

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.530
stack here again,

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:26.150
and when a sender composes the packet, starts off with Layer 7, the Application Layer, it puts that information

5
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.370
in there. That then gets encapsulated with the Presentation Layer information,

6
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.770
then the Session Layer information,

7
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.530
and then we get down to Layer 4, where we start getting interested as network engineers, the Transport

8
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.100
Layer. The packet will get encapsulated with the Layer 4 header, which includes information like,

9
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.150
is it TCP or UDP,

10
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.480
and the port number. For example, port 80 for HTTP web traffic.

11
00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:03.230
Then we encapsulate that with the Layer 3 header, which is the IP header, and in that layer, the sender

12
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.500
has to put on the source and the destination IP address.

13
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.290
Now with some applications, it will actually put the IP address directly in there, but quite often,

14
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:25.820
it will use an FQDN, a Fully Qualified Domain Name, such as www.cisco.com, and that FQDN has

15
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.860
to be resolved to an IP address that we can put into the packet.

16
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.300
So, that is where DNS comes in. The Domain Name System resolves that FQDN, the Fully Qualified Domain

17
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.250
Name, such as www.cisco.com, to an IP address.

18
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:53.000
Enterprises will typically have an internal DNS Server or a cluster of internal DNS Servers, which will

19
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.090
resolve the IP addresses of their internal hosts. 

20
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.910
For example, if I was working for an enterprise called www.flackbox.com, we would have our own internal

21
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.710
DNS Server, which would be responsible for resolving all hosts that were in the www.flackbox.com domain.

22
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.040
However, that internal DNS Server, it can't know about everything on the entire Internet.

23
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.940
It can't have the entire database there. So for anything external,

24
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.390
it's going to need to forward those requests onto an external public DNS Server.

25
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.130
DNS requests are sent using UDP port 53, and that can failover to TCP on port 53, but normally, it's

26
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.420
going to use UDP.

27
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:55.430
Let's have a look at how DNS works in the lab. So to do that, I'm going to open up a command prompt here.

28
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:07.430
So, this is on my Windows host. I'll enter CMD, and I'll do a 'ipconfig /all', and you can see on

29
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.480
the interface I'm using for the lab, my IP address is 172.23.1.10.

30
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.040
It's a /24, and my default gateway,

31
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.950
the router, is at 172.23.1.254. My DNS Server

32
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.900
is at 172.23.4.1, and the DNS domain that I am a part of is

33
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.660
FlackboxA.lab.

34
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.900
So, let's have a look at the DNS Server next.

35
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.740
I'm using a Windows Server as my DNS Server,

36
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.720
so let's have a look in Server Manager.

37
00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:00.260
I can click on Tools and then open up DNS, and you can see that the server here is authoritative for

38
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.900
the domain flatboxA.lab.

39
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.590
And if I click on that, you see that I've already set up address records for some hosts in there.

40
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:18.839
So, the host EngineeringA is at 172.23.6.10, EngineeringB is at 172.23.6.11, LinuxA is at

41
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.660
172.23.4.2, etc., and all these hosts are in the FlackboxA.lab domain.

42
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.430
If this DNS Server received a request for an FQDN that was in a different domain, it would need to

43
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.960
forward that out to public DNS. To configure that,

44
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.100
if I right-click on the server up on the top left here and then go Properties, and Forwarders,

45
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.260
I don't actually have any configured here, but I would just edit this, and I would put in the IP address

46
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.230
of a public DNS server in here.

47
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.790
Okay, so that's the DNS setup.

48
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:08.610
If I come back to my local host now, and I can do an 'nslookup' for the host of LinuxA,

49
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.010
and you see, it will take a second, and then my DNS server is 172.23.4.1,

50
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.290
the one I just showed you, and it's resolved LinuxA.FlackboxA.lab

51
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.010
to 172.23.4.2.

52
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.500
And if I ping LinuxA,

53
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.220
then the ping works just fine because it was able to resolve it. So I'll be able to ping that host either

54
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.690
by its FQDN, its hostname, or by its IP address.

55
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.860
Okay, so that's how DNS works in a Windows environment.

56
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.070
Let's have a look at DNS on our Cisco routers next.
