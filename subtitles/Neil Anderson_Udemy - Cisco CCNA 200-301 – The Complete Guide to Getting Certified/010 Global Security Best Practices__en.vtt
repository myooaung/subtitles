00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.020
In this lecture, you'll learn about some global security best practices back in the switch security

2
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.780
section, we covered about best practices for part level or interface level security.

3
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.190
This lecture, we're going to cover best practices for some security commands that we should enter and

4
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.630
global configuration.

5
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.380
And this is on Bouvard on our switches.

6
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.340
First thing, Ecover is login and exec Bonners messages can be displayed in the command line before

7
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.200
and or after an administrator logs into the iOS device.

8
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.100
And this is most commonly used to display security warnings to for before they log in.

9
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.690
That is the login bonnar to configure the global config.

10
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.670
You see biner login and then you put any delimiter such as quotes.

11
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.680
Also most of its special characters on the top line you can use here, then the you then hit enter and

12
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.190
then we will give you feedback seeing and your text message and with the character the same dilemma

13
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.030
that you used.

14
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.580
So because we said Bonnar login and in double quotes hit enter will get that feedback.

15
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.220
We then type in the message that we want to show, for our example, authorized users only.

16
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.160
We then hit the double quotes again and Olbrich is the command.

17
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.090
Now, the next time the user goes to log in before Venera password, they will see the warning message.

18
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.610
You can also configure a message the administrators will see just after they log in.

19
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.340
That is the exact Bonnar for that.

20
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.270
You see Bonnar.

21
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.960
Exactly.

22
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.780
So before it was Bonnen, log in and I would do BONNAR Exactly.

23
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.340
Our dillema are again.

24
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.040
Again, in the example we're using the double quotes.

25
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.450
It will tell us to enter the text message after we hit enter there.

26
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.660
In our example we're seeing please log immediately.

27
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.530
If you're not an authorized administrator, then hit the double quotes again and it will break his back

28
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.800
the command again.

29
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.740
Then you see the effect of this tool.

30
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.580
When a user and administrator goes to telnet into Orvis switch before it prompts them for her password,

31
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.610
it gives them the login Bonheur, which was authorized users only for our example.

32
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.220
Then it will prompt them for a password.

33
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.690
They enter a password.

34
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.380
Then as soon as we've logged, then we'll get the exact Bonnar, which was please.

35
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.580
Well, go immediately if you're not an authorized administrator, for our example.

36
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.470
So those are optional.

37
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.990
If you want, you can configure login banner.

38
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.330
If you want, you could just do an exact Bonnar and also if you wanted, you could move in together.

39
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.210
So that's our log in on exec BONNERS.

40
00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.940
Next thing, Ecover as a best practice is disabling on used services by disabling unused services.

41
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.280
That reduces the attack surface.

42
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.700
For example, say that you've got to keep running.

43
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.380
On the right are on.

44
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.200
A hacker discovers a new exploit.

45
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.150
They can use the attacks.

46
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.100
HTP on answer screwdriver's.

47
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.960
Well, if you're not running HTP, you're not susceptible to that attack.

48
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.310
Another benefit that you get is it reduces the load on our switch.

49
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.090
If it's not running the service, then it doesn't have to give CPU cycles to do that.

50
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.060
So best practice is to disable all of your unused services.

51
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:45.720
I just mentioned about HTP there used that as an example HGP asked to secure HTP is often used if you're

52
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.340
using I guey a graphical user interface tool to manage that or switch.

53
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.460
But HTP really there's never any need to have any.

54
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.180
It's the best practice is to to disable HTP.

55
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.570
Another example of a service you might want to disable is CDPR.

56
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.510
Now, in most normal environments, you will leave CDPR running the Cisco Discovery protocol because

57
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.090
it's really useful if you're on a switch and you want to see what neighbors are connected to, that

58
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.839
IP addresses are, it's very handy.

59
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.800
Have CDP enabled, but this can be seen as a security issue as well.

60
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.700
Maybe you don't want people to be able to map the network using CDPR SO and highly secure environments

61
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.390
such as banks, it's pretty normal to disable CDPR.

62
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.510
So the examples we do for the clients we would do for our examples to disable HTP.

63
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.140
It would be new IP http server that will disable HTP, but it will leave GPS running.

64
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.290
And if you wanted to disable CDPR globally, the global config is no CDPR run.

65
00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.570
OK, the last thing to cover here is time synchronization, all of the servers and infrastructure devices

66
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.750
in your network should be synchronized to the same time.

67
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.730
So not just your voters in your switches.

68
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.070
Also, any firewalls, anything like that.

69
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.680
You've got all of your servers as well.

70
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:18.940
Everything should be running at the same time that it's in troubleshooting because now all of your logs

71
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.140
will report the correct time the events actually occurred.

72
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.160
In real world, you're going to probably run into this where you're doing some troubleshooting and you

73
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.990
look at the log and the time has not been set on that device.

74
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.340
And the real time is 2nd of January, 2018.

75
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.920
But the device thinks that it's first of February 1984 and then of figured out when things actually

76
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.590
happened is very annoying.

77
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.170
So it's much easier to troubleshoot if all of your devices have got the correct time on them.

78
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.670
Another big reason that you want them has the correct time is that some security features actually require

79
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.970
this.

80
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.560
For example, Kerberos authentication on digital certificates.

81
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.470
If you're using Kerberos to log into active directory, the client and the server, the time must not

82
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.840
be more than five minutes by default.

83
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.460
If the time difference is more than five minutes, then authentication is going to feel.

84
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.240
It's to stop people trying to change your username and password again if sniffed it, pretending to

85
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.660
be you.

86
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.940
Everyone there was digital certificates can be used for authentication as well.

87
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:36.390
Digital certificates have got a valid timeline on saved from 2015 to 2020.

88
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.770
Well, if your writer thinks that it's 1984, it will see it as an invalid digital certificate and it's

89
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.410
not going to work for all those reasons.

90
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.980
You definitely want to use time synchronization in your environment.

91
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.090
The protocol that is used for this is and keep the network time protocol.

92
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.720
So you want all of your servers, all of your infrastructure devices to be synchronized with an A.P.

93
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.200
server.

94
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.110
The other thing they can use is their own internal clock.

95
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.860
But if you forget to set it, it can be way out.

96
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.770
And even if you do it a router, it's built to be or are not to be an excellent timekeeper and the clock

97
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.270
will drift over time.

98
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.670
So you want it to be synchronized with an A.P. server, which, you know, has got the exact correct

99
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.820
time on there.

100
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.040
A Cisco can function as Bov, an A.P. server and or a client.

101
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.330
Typically, you're going to have it configured as an A.P. client and you'll use some kind of external

102
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.110
device, which, you know, it's got a really good clock as your A.P. server.

103
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:49.100
Your configuration for Antep, first off, set the time zone on the Rohter year, if you've got a road

104
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.360
in New York, you'll set it for The New York Times.

105
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.760
And if you've got a rider in Sydney, you've set it for Sydney Time Zone.

106
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:05.210
And our example here, the local time is pitched in the US, which is eight hours behind UTC.

107
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:12.150
So we say, OK, time zone and then minus eight, it's eight hours behind UTC.

108
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.990
Then we can figure out where the A.P. server is.

109
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.530
Now, you know how I said the Cisco virus can be either an A.P. server or an A.P. client?

110
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.320
This can trip you up to configure it as an A.P. client.

111
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.290
The command is A.P. server.

112
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.730
She's the A.P. server.

113
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:39.450
And then you see the IP address that the server is at to configure it as an A.P. server.

114
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.669
The command is just a. m..

115
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.750
So usually we'll have it configured as an A.P. client with A.P. server command.

116
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.760
We don't usually use that as an A.M. Once that has done, we can do a sure clock to check that is showing

117
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.960
the correct time.

118
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.950
Also to verify we can do our show, A.P. status, and we want to see that the clock is synchronized.

119
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:08.280
Now, something with this for real world environments when you configure the A.P. server, but ours

120
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:14.730
is not just buying immediately changes time because that could cause some issues with internal processes.

121
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.360
It will do it slowly over a bit of time.

122
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.750
It's called drifting towards the A.P. server so it can take up to around five minutes before it is actually

123
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.920
showing the correct time.

124
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:32.670
So when you're working in the real world and you can figure your switch to use an A.P. server, don't

125
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.990
check the clock immediately.

126
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.240
It's not going to be ready yet.

127
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.870
Go make yourself a cup of coffee.

128
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.400
Come back and check the clock then, and you should see that it's got the correct time on there.

129
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.340
OK, so that was some of our global security.

130
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.730
Best practices in the next lecture will configure it.

131
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.270
The lab.
