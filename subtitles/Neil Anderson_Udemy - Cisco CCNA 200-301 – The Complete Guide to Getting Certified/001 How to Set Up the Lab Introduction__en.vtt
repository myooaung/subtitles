00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.030
that we're going to be covering.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.560
I use the free software Cisco Packet Tracer for the labs, so there's no need for you to buy any Cisco equipment

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.730
or any other software. In this section,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.920
lab exercises in the course, how to download them, how to load them up in Packet Tracer, and how to use

them.
