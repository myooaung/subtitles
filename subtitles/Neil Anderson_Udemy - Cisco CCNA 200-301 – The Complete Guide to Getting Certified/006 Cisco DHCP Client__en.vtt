00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:15.860
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure a Cisco router as a DHCP client. You're maybe thinking,

2
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.660
hang on a minute, Neil. You just told me a minute ago that our routers don't get configured as DHCP clients,

3
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.310
they get configured with manual IP addresses, and that is typically what will happen.

4
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.090
But there is one fairly common exception to that rule,

5
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:42.920
that's where a branch office is connected to the Internet, but it hasn't bought any static public IP addresses

6
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.150
for that office.

7
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.870
That would be because the branch office doesn't contain any publicly available servers that need a fixed

8
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.020
public IP address for incoming connections.

9
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.140
So, the company's decided we're not going to pay for a range of public IP addresses.

10
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.340
They are fixed addresses because we don't need them.

11
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.770
In that case, the office is still going to require at least one public IP address to allow the internal

12
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.700
hosts outbound connectivity to the Internet though,

13
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.150
and it's going to use NAT for that that we spoke about in an earlier lecture.

14
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.010
We're going to cover it in more detail in a later section as well.

15
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.990
So in that case, you're going to be having just one public IP address, but you haven't paid for a

16
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.490
fixed IP address

17
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:38.930
so the router is going to need to get the public IP address on its outside interface using DHCP from the Internet

18
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.980
service provider.

19
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.420
The other inside interfaces on the router will have fixed IP addresses.

20
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.320
It will just be that outside interface facing the service provider that is going to be a DHCP client.

21
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.540
So our configuration to support that is on the outside interface,

22
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.570
in our example here it's interface fastEthernet0/0,

23
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.440
we just say 'ip address dhcp', rather than the usual IP address and then the actual IP address.

24
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.789
And because it is a router, remember, we have to 'no shutdown' the interface.

25
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.370
So that's it, simple configuration to support an interface as a DHCP client. To get information about the

26
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.240
DHCP lease,

27
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.970
it's 'show dhcp lease'.

28
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.230
So in the example here, we can see that we were given IP address 203.0.113.2 by the

29
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.030
provider.

30
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.340
We can also see the DHCP lease server,

31
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.770
that's the server that gave us the IP address, and it is at 203.0.113.1.

32
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.050
Okay, so that's how we do the configuration.

33
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.130
Very simple.

34
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.770
Let's have a look at this in the lab.

35
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:58.400
So I'm running Packet Tracer again here, and I've already configured the Service Provider router as a DHCP server.

36
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.230
The outside interface on R1 is currently unconfigured, so I'm going to configure that as a DHCP

37
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.650
client.

38
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:16.880
So I go on to R1, and 'enable', 'config t' to get the global configuration, and I'm going to go to interface

39
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.190
fastEthernet0/0, 'ip address dhcp' and 'no shutdown'.

40
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.010
It will take a minute and then I should see it picking up the IP address and the interface going live.

41
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.440
In Packet Tracer,

42
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.220
I'll know that's happened when both sides of the link go green.

43
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:49.380
So, I'll just waffle for a second while I wait for that. Actually, let's do a 'show dhcp lease' now,

44
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.250
see that's picked up anything yet and it's 0.0.0.0,

45
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.730
so it hasn't got the DHCP address yet.

46
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.510
I just saw in Packet Tracer that both sides went green.

47
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:11.470
So if I repeat that 'show dhcp lease' command, I now see, okay, it still hasn't got the IP address.

48
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.620
Okay, and there we go.

49
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.329
It does take a while, but after a minute or so, I see a log message that

50
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.140
the DHCP address was assigned on fastEthernet0/0.

51
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.800
It was given IP address 203.0.113.2.

52
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.390
I can do my 'show dhcp lease' again,

53
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:41.230
and I see there's the address, 203.0.113.2, which was given by 203.0.113.1.

54
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:51.340
And if I do a 'show ip interface brief', I can see that for fastEthernet0/0, the method is DHCP,

55
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.620
and the address is 203.0.113.2.

56
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.180
Okay, so that was it. That's the DHCP section completed.

57
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.500
See you in the next one.
