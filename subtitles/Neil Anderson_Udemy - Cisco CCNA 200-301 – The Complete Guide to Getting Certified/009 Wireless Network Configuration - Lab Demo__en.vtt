00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.770
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure wireless networks with a wireless LAN controller with

2
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.910
a lab demo.

3
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.870
So it's the same scenario as from the last video where I configured the switch.

4
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.520
Now I'm going to configure all of the wireless network settings on the wireless LAN controller.

5
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.189
We're going to configure a couple of different W lines.

6
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:39.560
So I'm going to have the corporate wireless network and also the guest W line as well.

7
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.800
The corporate W line is for internal staff.

8
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.620
So for them to log in, they're going to need to supply a username and password and that is going to

9
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.030
be authenticated by the radius server here using it.

10
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.830
You don't want X authentication for guests.

11
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.990
They don't need to enter a username and password.

12
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.940
They just need to enter a plea.

13
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.020
Shiraki two for the guest network that's going to be using WPA personal authentication for the corporate

14
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.130
network that is going to be using WPA to enterprise.

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
Corporate users will have access to all of the internal resources.

16
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.430
So they're going to be assigned to the corporate villain and the corporate IP subnet.

17
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.810
Guest users will be in a different guest VLAN on guest IP subnet and they they'll just have access to

18
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.560
the Internet.

19
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.660
OK, so let's get this all set up.

20
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.090
So first off, I need to connect to the admin guey on the wireless LAN controller.

21
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.330
If I click on the wireless LAN controller and go to the config here in pocket Frayser and look at the

22
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.470
management interface, you can see that it's already been given an IP address.

23
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.060
One thing, two two one six, eight, 10, 11.

24
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.230
So when you're working on a real world wireless LAN controller, the first thing you need to do is go

25
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.030
through the initial set up to give it an IP address.

26
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.060
After that, when you're actually working on the wireless LAN controller, you're going to be working

27
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.680
in the GUI.

28
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.240
You can do configuration in the command line as well, but it's much easier to work in the GUI.

29
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.460
That's what pretty much everybody does.

30
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.080
But before you can connect to this, it needs to have an IP address.

31
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.000
So when you take a wireless LAN controller the box for the first time, you'll hook up to it with a

32
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.170
control cable.

33
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.690
And then the command line that you get through the control connection, you'll go through the initial

34
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.290
setup wizard, and that's where you can figure the basic settings, such as the IP address, subnet

35
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.910
mask and Default Gateway.

36
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.640
So for this WAB demo I've already done, I've gone through the initial setup wizard command line just

37
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.880
to get an IP address on the wireless LAN controller.

38
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.900
Now that is done, I'll be able to connect to its admin GUI from my admin laptop here, so I will go

39
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.880
on to my admin laptop.

40
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.680
You can see I've going to https wanting to 168 dot 10 11 on the wireless line controller and I've entered

41
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.380
my username and password for management and I'm going to log in and this is going to blind me on the

42
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.140
dashboard.

43
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:26.970
OK, next, first thing I'm going to do is to configure my integration with the radius server so I look

44
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.990
back in the mean pocket or window and look on my radius server.

45
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.310
I'll click on that.

46
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.980
And if I go with the config, you can see that it's got IP address one thing, two to one, six, eight,

47
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.570
10, 10.

48
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.660
And if I look at the services and then looking here at triple A, you can see that radius has been enabled.

49
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.900
And I have added a username flat box with the password flat box to and I've also done the radius server

50
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.650
side configuration for integrating it with the wireless LAN controller.

51
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.500
So I've added the wireless LAN controller here and I've specified its IP address is one nine two one

52
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.970
six eight 10 11.

53
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.750
And the shared key is for Xbox One.

54
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:21.630
So now I need to add the radius server on the wireless one controller so much do that to back on my

55
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.640
admin laptop on the guey for the wireless LAN controller.

56
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.820
I'll go to Security Watch where I'm going to configure integration with triple eight servers and under

57
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.060
triple A and radius and authentication.

58
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.680
I will click on there and I'm going to add a new server.

59
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.720
Should I click on new.

60
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.460
The radio server IP address is one thing to do it.

61
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.660
One, six, eight, ten, ten.

62
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.850
And the shared secret was flat box one.

63
00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.980
So I will type that in and then click on apply up here in the top right.

64
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.660
And not as my integration done with my radio server and I can see it in the.

65
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.940
Main page for my authentication servers here.

66
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.340
OK, next thing that I'm going to do so before I configure my W lines, I need to get the global settings

67
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.170
configured first.

68
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.400
That's why I configured for various server.

69
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.570
Another thing that I need to do is when wireless clients connect to voice mail bulletins, we're going

70
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.010
to need to get an IP address from DHP.

71
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.870
We could use static IP addresses, but much more likely we're going to be using DHP there so we could

72
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.970
use an external DHP server.

73
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.020
But for this demo, I'm going to be using the service on the wireless LAN controller, so I need to

74
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.510
configure a DHP scope for both the corporate and the gas to be yuans.

75
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.570
So for that I go to controller.

76
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.730
And then internal DHP server and DHP scope, you can see already default sculpin here, I'm going to

77
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.550
click you to create a new one on this first one.

78
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:20.980
I will name it corporate to match the name of my valon and they'll be Ulen and then I click on it here

79
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.480
to edit.

80
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.350
So I just created to edit.

81
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.060
Click on it again here.

82
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:35.020
And the star address, I'm going to use one name to one six eight, my IP subnet for corporate was one

83
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.850
thing to one 168 dot 22.

84
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.020
And I'm going to start giving out addresses, beginning with one one.

85
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.820
The last address I'll use one two one six eight twenty two to five for the network.

86
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:55.480
One thing to dot one six eight twenty two or subnet mask three five five five five five five.

87
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.830
Or the default router is my earlier switch.

88
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.830
One thing you don't succeed or twenty to one.

89
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.600
And in a real world environment you would enter into DNS details here as well.

90
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:13.690
I'm not using DNS in Matlab here so I can leave blank and click on apply to it.

91
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.840
That's going to give advances to clients.

92
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.820
You connect to the corporate w line.

93
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.450
I need to give addresses to the guest clients as well.

94
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.340
So I'm going to create another new scope.

95
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.080
I will need this cached and click on apply.

96
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.210
Click on it to add it.

97
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:38.520
On to starting address, wanting to do it once you create the guest subnet is twenty three, I'll start

98
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.020
with one or one.

99
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:47.370
The ending address one two one six eight dot twenty three to five for the network.

100
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:54.020
One thing to dot one six eight dot twenty three or subnet masks five five five five five oh.

101
00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:00.000
And the default is one thing to dot one six eight twenty three one.

102
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.680
OK so that is my DHP Scoop's Don click on apply.

103
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.210
I can see them there and I can see that the pools look good.

104
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.200
OK.

105
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.220
Next thing that I need to do is configure virtual interfaces on my wireless LAN controller again one

106
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.540
for each W one and when I configure the virtual interfaces I need to associate them with the physical

107
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.400
part that is connected to the switch.

108
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.620
So let's check and see what part is.

109
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.050
So I will click on parts.

110
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:40.740
And then when the page loads there, I can see that the part is part one.

111
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.900
I can see the link is up to it's part one.

112
00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.550
So in my lab environment here, I've just got one physical part connected, a switch.

113
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.550
In a real world environment, you would want to use log link aggregation, which is an ether channel,

114
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.570
to bundle multiple parts together to give you additional bandwidth.

115
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.040
So here I'm going to be using part one.

116
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:07.350
So now I can go to interfaces and this is going to create virtual interfaces which are similar to an

117
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.490
SVI like interface VLAN that you would see on a switch.

118
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.410
I have got my default interfaces in there already.

119
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.390
I'm going to create a new one.

120
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:28.450
And I will name this corporate on The View on this is in is Vorlon 20 to my corporate view on and then

121
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.440
click on apply.

122
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:36.070
And then on the next page, I need to specify the physical part that this is going to be associated

123
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.930
with, this van can be carried over, which was part one, the van identifier.

124
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.950
It was twenty two.

125
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.880
And I'm going to give this I.P. address one thing to do it.

126
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.320
One six eight twenty two two.

127
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.420
Because my switch is using one subnet mask is two five five five five two two five five oh.

128
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:59.230
The default gateway for this subnet is one thing to do it one six eight 22 one.

129
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:07.540
And then the primary DHP server will I configured the DHP scope here on my wireless line controller,

130
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:13.240
so I will enter in the management address of my wireless line controller, which is one thing to to

131
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.890
one six, eight, 10, 11.

132
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.820
So you can see here when you configure a multi-layer switch, you're going to have your view on interfaces

133
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.210
on there.

134
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:29.120
If it's acting is the default gateway and unvoiced view on interfaces, you're going to have the DHP

135
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.400
helper to address so that the clients can get to the server.

136
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.820
What?

137
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.680
We're doing the same thing here.

138
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:43.350
So now when the wireless clients connect to the W line, they need to get access to the DHP server.

139
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:48.940
So that's why I had to configure the logical interface here, give it an IP address and specify the

140
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.890
address of the server.

141
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.540
OK, so I have done that for the corporate network.

142
00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:02.050
I click on Apply and it's going to say that changing the interface parameters can cause temporarily

143
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.420
loss of content to the able.

144
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.910
I don't have any clients connected yet, so that's no problem.

145
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.750
So I'll click on OK here.

146
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:16.330
And then I can go back to the interfaces page again, I see my corporate interface is where I need to

147
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.250
create another new one for Ghast.

148
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.410
So I'll click on you.

149
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.360
I'll give this the name of Ghast.

150
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.430
The view on is Vorlon.

151
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.820
Twenty three for my guest network and click on Apply.

152
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.560
Then on the next page, I'm going to associate this with part number one.

153
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.140
So both of my villines are going to be trunked over the same underlying physical part.

154
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.770
The IP address here, one nine two one six eight dot twenty three two.

155
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.760
Because the default gateway was don't want any to use something that's not used elsewhere.

156
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:55.120
Subnet mask two five five to four five to oh and the gateway is one thing two to one six eight twenty

157
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.170
three one.

158
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.830
And again for both the corporate and the guest clients, they're both using the same DHP server which

159
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.940
is here in the wireless LAN controller with the IP address.

160
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:14.320
One thing to do it one six eight dot 10 11 so I can click on apply there and click on OK again.

161
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.230
And then click on interfaces.

162
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.100
And there I can see I have got my interfaces configured.

163
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.580
OK, so I've got my integration done with the server.

164
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.910
I've got my DHP Scoop's configured.

165
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.940
I've configured my logical interfaces.

166
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.720
So now I am ready to configure my wireless local area networks.

167
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.090
So if I click on the W launch tab.

168
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:48.810
And then I am going to choose to create new and go their.

169
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.950
And then the type is they'll be you on the profile name again, I'm going to use the same naming convention,

170
00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:04.330
so I'm going to call this corporate on the SS I.D. is also going to be corporate so you can use a different

171
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.650
profile name and SS ID.

172
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.400
Normally you want to keep these same.

173
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.690
It's makes things more logical, easier to see what's going on.

174
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.610
The I.D. is just an index number, so it starts at one and goes up from there.

175
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.270
So one is fine here and I will click on apply.

176
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:28.940
And then when this page, which I can specify the settings for my W1, you want to first thing I need

177
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.510
to do is make sure it is associated with the corporate interface.

178
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.210
I just created so I click on the drop down here and it's going to be associated with corporate.

179
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.360
This is going to get those settings going to get the correct DHP scope.

180
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:48.310
Click on there and then I'm not going to enable it yet because I haven't configured the security.

181
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.180
So I want to make sure that I don't have any clients connecting in here before I've configured for security

182
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:53.570
settings.

183
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:58.840
I need to remember to come back here and enable it when I'm done through security.

184
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.320
So I will click on security and then the layer to security.

185
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:11.390
I will click on the drop down there and I'm going to configure this for eight to one extra authentication.

186
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.790
And you can see that that is an option.

187
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:19.280
But on the wireless line controller, if you choose this is using it or you don't want X with the old

188
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.040
WAP authentication, which we don't want to use anymore.

189
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.720
So I'm going to use WPA and WPA to select that.

190
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.200
And you can see the two to one X is an option underneath here.

191
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:37.190
OK, so go on WPA and WPA two and then for the policy, I don't want WPA to be enabled, I just want

192
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.240
WPA to.

193
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:45.770
So I will click and I want to use AEF encryption, don't want to use Technip and I'm going to be using

194
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:45.950
it.

195
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.680
You don't want access for the authentication here.

196
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.530
And then I also need to click on the triple eight servers top and see where my radio server is.

197
00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:01.190
Click on the drop down here and there I can see is the radius server that I added earlier on.

198
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.900
Select that and then I'm going to click on Apply.

199
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:12.530
So that is all of my settings done on the thing I need to not forget, which is easy to forget.

200
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.340
Also click on enabled and apply that.

201
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:24.810
OK, so that is my Carteris w configured S�vres other settings in here as well, such as QE policies

202
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.680
that don't need to do any of those here.

203
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:34.100
So now I'll go back to the main W Lines page again, and there is my corporate Oblon.

204
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:40.820
I need to create my guess W line as well, so I'll go create new and click on Go.

205
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.340
I will give it the profile name Gashed and the SS ID gassed as well.

206
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.900
It uses the next ID index number, which is two I click on Apply.

207
00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:00.860
And then on the next page, I haven't said this security yet, so I'm not going to enable it yet.

208
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:08.730
And the interface this is associated with is my guest interface under the radio policy.

209
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:15.120
This is where you can specify wherever you want to have it, what you don't live in a sea or an or and

210
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.660
so on.

211
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:21.260
That's where you can specify which of the standards where you want to have enabled for distribution.

212
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.540
OK, next up, I need to do the security.

213
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.610
I'll click on the drop down here.

214
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:34.050
And again, I'm going to be using WPA and WPA two, but rather than eight or two dot one X here I am

215
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.330
using a pre shared key.

216
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:45.930
I need to specify what the key is, so I will enter that in the box here and then I can apply.

217
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:54.560
Oh, I forgot to specify that it's you that I want to use here and yes, OK, so I just selected that.

218
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.660
Now I should apply and this will work.

219
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.960
OK, so that's all good again, I need to remember to enable it, so I'll take the initial check box

220
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.540
and click on apply and that is my W lines now all configured.

221
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:16.930
So Waxwing I need to do is actually check that it is working, but let's check the lines over there.

222
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.400
So I'll just go back to the lines.

223
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.410
Main page again and there I can see there is corporate and gas.

224
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:29.440
I can see Gaston's using a pressure key on corporate is using it to don't want x authentication.

225
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.920
OK, so let's go back to the pocket fisherman window.

226
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.120
You can see I've got corporate laptop and a guest laptop here.

227
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.980
So this is working.

228
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.750
I'm to the corporate laptop.

229
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.450
I'm going to go to the config.

230
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:52.750
And for my wireless interface in here, I'm going to see that I want to connect to the corporate.

231
00:17:53.940 --> 00:18:04.820
SS I.D. and I'm using WPA to see the WPA too, and WPA to pressure key, well, I'm using WPA to Enterprise,

232
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.440
so this is the option here again.

233
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.340
It's not that you don't want X, which is the legacy way of doing it.

234
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.760
It's WPA too.

235
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:20.760
And then in here I specify my user ID, which was flat box and the password is flat box to.

236
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.190
So that is the user credentials that were configured on the radio server.

237
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:33.390
So I've done that and then I'll just click here to make it take effect and go back again and go back

238
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.920
to the wireless interface.

239
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:41.510
I might need to just give this a minute or two to get the IP address from DHP.

240
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:47.120
So while that is going on, let's configure the guest laptop as well.

241
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:54.570
I'll click on that and then the configuration going a wireless network card.

242
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.130
The idea that I'm going to connect to is gashed.

243
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:05.490
And this is where two to pressure key so I don't get the granularity of a username and password is just

244
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.830
the same password.

245
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.130
It's being used for everybody.

246
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:17.070
And that was Blackbox three that I used there can click there and make sure about taking effect and

247
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.420
go back to the config.

248
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.380
That all looks good, actually.

249
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.480
What did I do for the corporate laptop that I put in the wrong password?

250
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.920
There was double check No.

251
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.800
Two, so that's good.

252
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.410
Yeah, that's fine.

253
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.290
And I can see it has now got an IP address, so that looks good.

254
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.510
So be back in the main pocket or window from this indicator's here.

255
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.100
I can see that they are both connected to the wireless network.

256
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:50.460
And if I was on a real world wireless LAN controller, I could go back into the dashboard there and

257
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.040
I would be able to see information about those clients.

258
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.450
OK, so that was it.

259
00:19:54.450 --> 00:20:01.650
That's how to configure wireless networking with the wireless LAN controller and a school environment.

260
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.450
And that wraps up the wireless section see in the next Licia.
