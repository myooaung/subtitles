00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.990
We can also write the subnet mask in slash '/' notation. 255.255.255.0

2
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.690
is writing it in decimal notation.

3
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.850
So, the example here, 255.255.255.0,

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.550
we can write that out, the subnet mask, and you see there is the line between the network portion and the host

5
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.750
portion.

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.250
And as we covered earlier, it's always contiguous 1's and then followed by a block of contiguous 0's.

7
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280
Because it's contiguous,

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.660
we can count how many 1's that we have in a row.

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.230
So the example here, we have got 24 1's in a row. I know that each of these blocks is an octet, they each equal

10
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.830
to 8.

11
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.500
That's 8, 16, 24. So 255.255.255.0,

12
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.710
we can write it like that in dotted decimal notation.

13
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.490
Another way we can write is /24.

14
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.560
Those two things both mean exactly the same thing.

15
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:17.460
If we had 255.255.0.0 as a subnet mask, we could write that as /16, and so on. And whenever

16
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.050
you configure a Cisco router or switch on IOS, when you configure the IP address and the subnet mask,

17
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.580
you have to write the subnet mask out in the full dotted decimal notation. But whenever we're having a conversation

18
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.200
with somebody, or if we are creating a network diagram, more commonly, we will use slash notation because

19
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.330
it's not much fun to be saying 255.255.255.0 all the time.

20
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.430
It's much easier to say /24. Also, /24 takes up much less space on your network diagrams,

21
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.860
so you can have your diagrams looking a lot neater and tidier.

22
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.870
There was the network portion for a /24 highlighted.

23
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.390
Let's look at

24
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.360
another example coming up. Again, we're looking at a /24 there.

25
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:20.380
So the other example is for IP address 10.10.10.15 /255.0.0.0, and hopefully,

26
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.440
you can just by looking at this, you're going to see that that's going to be a /8.

27
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.930
The more you get used to working with IP addresses and subnets, you'll very quickly be able to see where

28
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.290
the lines are by just looking at the actual address and mask.

29
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.760
So the example there, the IP address can be written as 10.10.10.15 255.0.0.0

30
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:54.040
or 10.10.10.15/8 when we're writing it out in full with a subnet mask.

31
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.370
An example here, the network address is 10.0.0.0/8.

32
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.920
I've put this in bold to highlight it because the network address is not 10.10.10.0

33
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.550
/8.

34
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.310
When we write this out, it's just the network portion of the address that we specify.

35
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.240
It's a /8, so it's only the first octet which is the network portion.

36
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.740
So, that is the 10. All the rest of the address,

37
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.650
the last three octets is the host portion.

38
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.300
So when we write this address, it would be 10.0.0.0/8, and the available addresses would be

39
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.740
10.0.0.1 for our first host. The last host would be 10.255.255.254.

40
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.220
We can't use 10.255.255.255 because that would be the broadcast address, and 10.0.0.0

41
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.350
is the network address.

42
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.840
Okay, that was everything I needed to tell you about the subnet mask for now, but we'll be covering it

43
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.760
in more and more detail as we go through the rest of this section.
