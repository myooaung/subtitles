00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.940
In this lecture, you'll learn about the access, which is part of Cisco's digital network architecture,

2
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:23.400
before you can understand why we have the access and the benefits, it brings me to understand the traditional

3
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.300
way of securing access to the network.

4
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.600
So the traditional way to control access to and traffic is within.

5
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.700
A network is with fixed villines IP addresses and access control lists.

6
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.880
Users are expected to always connect to the same physical part where they are assigned and access VLAN

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.500
and IP subnet.

8
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.580
So if a user is in dept a bit expected to plug in or switch part, which is being configured with the

9
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.950
department, a access VLAN do then get assigned an IP address based on that.

10
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.500
If they use those in Department B, they're always expected to plug in a switchboard which is being

11
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.520
configured with the department box view on that and get the department B subnet based or not.

12
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.800
We then have access control lists that control the traffic flows between the different IP subnets configuration

13
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.100
can get complex and because each device is configured individually, it's more work to configure it

14
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.900
and more likely to have ATRs.

15
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.950
It also does not support user mobility because users are always expected to plug into a physical switch

16
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.310
part.

17
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.770
For a very particular group, it means if it's plug ins somewhere else, the solution is really not

18
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.520
going to work.

19
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.860
So looking at the axis now, it's a newer method of network access control which solves those limitations

20
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.600
of the traditional implementation, traffic for security is based on user identity.

21
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.430
Robert Vonetta, physical part the user is plugged into and users can log in from and move to any physical

22
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.050
location in the network.

23
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.320
Two components are required for the axis, that is the identity services engine, but is Cisco's triple

24
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.110
A server and authenticates the user.

25
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.100
The security policy, which controls, permitted and denied communication between groups, is configured

26
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.040
on the DNA center through the ice and the DNA center are integrated and worked together to provide the

27
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.700
solution.

28
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.690
As the axis users and underlay and overlay network, an underlying network, is the underlying physical

29
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.570
network for obvious solution, it provides the underlying physical connections which the overlay network

30
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.830
is built on top of.

31
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.030
And an overlay network is a logical topology used to virtually connect devices is built over the top

32
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.440
of the physical underlay.

33
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.690
So the combination of underly and overlay forms the doctors network fabric.

34
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.360
So looking at this, you can see here is our physical topology here.

35
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.790
So this is the physical underlay.

36
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.580
Now with this diagram, I've just connected this, which is like this that's got no particular meaning.

37
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.030
So for the actual wave that you're going to connect your devices, just do that according to the standard

38
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.750
best practice.

39
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.270
I'm just drawing it like this because it's an easy way to show an underlying network the way this is,

40
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.380
the way that apology is not specific to the artist.

41
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.180
Just do it the way that you would do normally.

42
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.970
OK, so we've got our underlying physical network with those physical connections between the devices

43
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.020
and then for our overlay network.

44
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.110
So for the actual connectivity between devices that uses a tunnel built over the underlying network.

45
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.240
So we've got a virtual tunnel that's part of our overlay, which provides the virtual connect to the.

46
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.500
When the axis is deployed into an existing brownfield network, any configuration can be used for the

47
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.150
underlying physical networks.

48
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.300
If you've got an existing site and then you want to implement the axis there, it means that you don't

49
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.930
need to rip up your your settings.

50
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.650
You have already and start again wherever settings, whatever configuration you've got on the device

51
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.959
will still work with the axis.

52
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.260
So links between the devices can be here two or three and any routing protocol can be used for existing

53
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.820
satellite will work just fine.

54
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.740
DNA center can also be used to automate to automatically provision the underlaid network in new greenfield

55
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.180
sites.

56
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.310
So if you do have a brand new network that is just being physically deployed, you can use DNA center

57
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.940
to do the initial set up for you to support the axis and not case layer three links will be used between

58
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.680
the devices and ISIS is used as the routing protocol.

59
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.590
The reason that ISIS is used, it's very extensible.

60
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.550
It's easy to add additional functionality on there.

61
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.610
So that is why Cisco chose vice routing protocol.

62
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.370
I don't worry.

63
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.000
For any example, you don't need to know anything about ISIS.

64
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.410
You'll learn about that if you go into this, Pete.

65
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:18.820
So on our overlay network for the control plane, we use only for for the plane, it's using Vectron

66
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.680
Cisco transects is used for the policy.

67
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.750
So we've got those three different technologies where each of those technologies has been optimized,

68
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.870
extra features added to it for the ox's.

69
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.660
So let's have a look into more detail about Lisp, the X1 on trussing.

70
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.850
So starting with less and less has been around actually for quite a long time.

71
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.800
There's a good chance you haven't heard of it before because it wasn't duly implemented, not widely.

72
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.210
The original behind Wesp was to support mobility.

73
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.820
So if you had users that were moving physical location, it meant they could take a virtual IP address

74
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.270
with them.

75
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.120
So because we want that with Antiochus, we want to have the mobility Cisco, rather than coming up

76
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.490
with a brand new protocol, they use the lisp and they added some extra bells and whistles onto it to

77
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.720
make it perfect for the access.

78
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.070
So let's have a look at the way that is going to work.

79
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.710
So the tags here in yellow, ï¿½rvar, is making up our physical underlay there.

80
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.690
We've got an edge node switch with IP address, dot, dot, dot one over here to the left.

81
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.090
We've got some additional switches over to try to understand what turned out to contain dot, dot,

82
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.860
dot three.

83
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.180
And one of our switches is going to be designated as the control point.

84
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.990
And actually you're going to have more than one control node for redundancy.

85
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:48.410
So then what happens is we've got a host here, one thing, two to one, six, eight, one, two, I

86
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.200
guess, connected to the network.

87
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:56.990
Our edge node switches over and it sends an update message to the control node, seeing that one thing,

88
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.700
two to one, six eight, one, two can be reached through me.

89
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.680
The next thing that happens is our host over here to the left, one thing to one sixty one point one.

90
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.850
It sends a packet with a destination address of wanting to dot one six eight one to the host over on

91
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:20.310
the right pocket will hit its nearest edge node switch and then not switch will ask the control point

92
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:27.230
node how do I get to one nine two one six eight dot one two be control plane node news because tend

93
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:33.520
to talk to tolda earlier to the control point node board reply box saying you can get to it via ten.

94
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:41.690
Don't tend to that edge node will then build a very long tunnel over across to the other node and the

95
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.690
traffic will be sent through that tunnel.

96
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.110
So you can see we've got our underlying physical network underlay and then we've got our vehicle tunnels

97
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.680
for the Dataplan in the overlay network.

98
00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:00.770
OK, so that is a simplified view of how much works to build the control plane, to build the connectivity

99
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.120
between our devices.

100
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:09.560
Take a look at how mobility works now, so let's say that one thing to the 168 dot, one dot to that

101
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.690
user moves down and is now into this switch here.

102
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.710
Must be most likely if it were over wireless, they move to a different location in the network.

103
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:24.280
What happens then is that the new edge node switch will send a message to the controller playing, seeing

104
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.540
that one thing, two to one succeed or one to two is now available through me.

105
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.340
Dot, dot, dot three.

106
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.020
The control point node will then up the database with the new information.

107
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:41.710
It will inform the other edge node over here on the left and then the van tunnel will now be built directly

108
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.659
between the correct edge nodes.

109
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:53.220
OK, and finally, looking at the policy, Cisco Trust, Jack Cheekiest is used for service to the users,

110
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.260
unauthenticated, meaning they put in their username and password, and that is authenticated by the

111
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.570
ICE, the identity services engine.

112
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.490
The security policy is configured on Unicenter.

113
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:12.270
So ICE and DNA center work together for these users are allocated in a scalable group together and some

114
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.080
documentation.

115
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.320
You'll also see this being referred to as a security tag.

116
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.070
The same thing.

117
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.620
Cisco Trust secures security traffic flows based on the security policy on the streets.

118
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:29.380
So, for example, a user in Department A can get to their servers, but they can't get to other departments.

119
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:37.410
Now, there's a difference with the access in the way that the older traditional social network is trusted.

120
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.350
There's also been available for quite a few years.

121
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:48.980
Trust is a great idea, but an issue with the fact that it's not such a widespread implementation was

122
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.540
that all the devices in the traffic path had to support cross-check.

123
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.500
So that was only on newer model switches it was originally supported on.

124
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:06.120
But when you use the access limitation is taken away because the access users, both virtual tunnels,

125
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.010
the traffic can actually go through.

126
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.630
Any device does not have to be an officially supports or trust device.

127
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.240
It can even be switches from other vendors.

128
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:22.320
OK, so that was everything I needed to tell you about the access to you in the next lecture for SD

129
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.580
one.
