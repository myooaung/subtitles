00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:17.670
In this lecture, you'll learn about the basic operation of routers and how they compare to switches. Routers

2
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.260
route,

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.790
that's why they're called routers,

4
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.510
and what that means is that they can direct traffic between your different IP subnets.

5
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.470
They're required to do that. To be able to route traffic from one IP subnet to another,

6
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.460
you're going to need a router to be able to do that.

7
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:50.360
They route traffic between our different IP subnets. IP is at Layer 3 of the OSI stack. So, a router

8
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.940
operates

9
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.850
at Layer 3 of the OSI model.

10
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.580
Obviously, it has physical interfaces on there as well.

11
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.819
So, it's also operating at Layer 1. It also needs to understand Layer 2 addresses, so it also operates

12
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.040
at Layer 2 as well.

13
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.980
Routers, actually, will normally be aware up to Layer 7 for advanced functions as well. But when

14
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.350
they're doing the job of routing between different IP subnets, they're operating at Layer 3.

15
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.740
So routers are termed as a Layer 3 device. To compare them with switches, routers are Layer 3

16
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.190
aware and can route traffic between different networks. 

17
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.430
Switches are Layer 2 aware. They're not Layer 3 aware and can switch traffic between hosts on the 

18
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:50.180
Local Area Network. Routers support many different types of interfaces such as Ethernet, Serial, ISDN, and 

19
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.920
ADSL. Switches will typically only support Ethernet interfaces. Switches will typically have a lot more

20
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.400
ports than routers, and switches forward broadcast traffic. Routers don't forward broadcast traffic by default.

21
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.090
So let's go back to the slide, a couple of the things that I said

22
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.560
there are that routers support many more different types of ports than switches, and they'll usually have less

23
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.490
available ports than switches.

24
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.840
So if you remember, we had a look at a Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch, which had 48 ports when we did the

25
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.950
basics of switches. So it had 48 ports plus some uplinks on there, and they were all Ethernet ports.

26
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.630
If you have a look at the picture here, this is a Cisco 2800

27
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.730
series router,

28
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.070
and it's only got two built-in Ethernet ports. You see, there are four ports there, but one of them is a console

29
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.430
port, and another one is an auxiliary port. So, it only comes with two Ethernet ports compared to our

30
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.420
48 ports switch that we had a look at earlier.

31
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.900
But if you look to the right of those ports, you see that there are modular slots there.

32
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:14.900
So we can buy different types of interfaces, such as ADSL, Ethernet, etc., serial ports, and we can

33
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.940
put them into the router.

34
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.950
Okay,

35
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.720
moving on. Let's have a quick recap of switch operation.

36
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.770
In the diagram here, you can see we've got a building.

37
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.420
We've got a couple of switches in there. 

38
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.460
All our hosts are on the 10.10.10.0/24 network. When that's the case,

39
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.510
they can all communicate with each other through our switches. When they're all in the same IP subnet,

40
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.990
there's no need to have a router there. But if one of those hosts had the IP address 10.10.11.10/24,

41
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.550
it's now on a different IP subnet, and it's not going to be able to

42
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.810
communicate with the other hosts on the 10.10.10 network

43
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.570
if we only have switches there. It's in another Layer 3 network, 

44
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.480
so we need a Layer 3 device, a router, to be able to route traffic between those hosts.

45
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.870
So, we put a router into the infrastructure now.

46
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.970
It's aware of the 10.10.10 and the 10.10.11 networks, and it's going to be able to

47
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.060
route traffic between all the hosts on the network now.

48
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.280
Okay,

49
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.750
one other thing to tell you about here is that you can get advanced switches which are Layer 3 aware

50
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.730
and can route traffic between different IP subnets. When you get one of those Layer 3 aware switches, 

51
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.050
it's known as a Layer 3 switch.

52
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.320
It still has a lot of characteristics that are similar to a normal switch though,

53
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.870
and that it will typically only support Ethernet interfaces,

54
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.340
and it will usually have more ports than routers.

55
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.580
So, looking at our diagram again. Now, you see that we only have switches in the network infrastructure, but

56
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.360
the switch at the bottom is a Layer 3 switch. Meaning, it is Layer 3 aware. It's aware of the

57
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.140
10.10.10 network and the 10.10.11 network, and it's able to route traffic between

58
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.810
them.

59
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.920
Now, you can actually do this on a Catalyst 2960 like you saw earlier.

60
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.490
Again, way back in the day, Layer 3 switches were expensive, but they've come down in price now. So

61
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.600
it is very common to have Layer 3 switches routing the traffic, which is within the different subnets

62
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.240
on your Local Area Network.

63
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.800
However, if your connection outside that campus, out to the Wide Area Network, is using an interface type which

64
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.760
is not Ethernet, then you would still require a normal traditional router for that traffic as well.
