00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.660
In this lecture, you'll learn how to factory reset your router or switch and also how to do a password

2
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.490
recovery

3
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.840
if you've lost the enable password. So, factory reset first.

4
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.720
The way we do that, very simple, at

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.020
the enable prompt, we use the 'write erase' command. That will erase the startup-config.

6
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.900
You do that, you then reload the device, and it will boot up with a blank configuration.

7
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.970
There is no startup-config, so the Setup

8
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.430
Wizard will then run.

9
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.730
Let's have a look at how to do this in the lab.

10
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.790
So I'm on my router here, R1.

11
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:58.770
If I do a 'show running-config', you can see the hostname is R1 there, and if I do a 'show startup

12
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.310
config', the hostname is also R1 in the startup-config as well, so that has been saved. So what

13
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.960
I'll do here is I go to global configuration, and I'll say 'hostname R2', and I'm not doing a 'copy

14
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.130
run start' yet.

15
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.750
If I break back down to the enable prompt, if I do a 'show run', I've entered the command. So in the running

16
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.580
config, the hostname is R2.

17
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.060
If I do a 'show startup-config', you'll see I haven't saved it yet.

18
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.070
I didn't do the 'copy run start' yet, so that's still hostname R1 there.

19
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.310
So if I rebooted now, it would come back up with a startup-config. I would lose my unsafe changes, and

20
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.370
it would still have the hostname R1.

21
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.590
What this is useful for is if you lose connectivity to a device that you're working on remotely, you

22
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.970
can't get to it anymore.

23
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.320
You need to recover it.

24
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.540
You can ask some in the office to pull the power out and put the power back in.

25
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.240
It's not good because it does cause an outage. It's pretty embarrassing, but it's a way that you can get back

26
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.940
on to that router or that switch again.

27
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.680
Okay, so back to doing the factory reset.

28
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.650
I just want to show you first a bit of the running-config and startup-config. If I wanted to

29
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.180
factory reset this device, the command is, I'll do it and fill for you, 'write erase'.

30
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.660
It will then tell you that this is going to erase the NVRAM file system, which you know is where the

31
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.620
startup-config is saved. So, I'll hit Enter to confirm that. If I now do a 'show start',

32
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.320
it will tell me that my startup-config is not present.

33
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:51.630
It was erased. And if I 'reload' now and confirm that, it will take a minute to do the reload, and when it

34
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.890
comes back up, I can see it's running the Setup Wizard because it's got no configuration.

35
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:08.000
Okay, so that is how you do a factory reset on your router or your switch. We'll back to the slides now and

36
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.670
have a look about how to do the password recovery.

37
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.650
First, you need to know about the configuration register. That is used to change the way that the router boots

38
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.270
from the default.

39
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.110
You can use the 'config-register' command in global configuration mode, or if you're at the ROMMON

40
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.080
prompt to where the router or a switch hasn't completed booting yet, you can use the 'confreg' command.

41
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.000
For example, we could use 'config-register 0x2142' for that setting at global config or 'confreg

42
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.310
0x2142' if we were at the ROMMON prompt.

43
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.310
There's several different configuration registers that you can use, probably the three most useful.

44
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.380
First is 0x2102. That should be the default.

45
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:06.330
The device will boot normally when that is the setting. Next one is 0x2120, will boot into ROMMON mode.

46
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.300
And lastly, 0x2142 will ignore the contents of NVRAM while booting, so it will ignore the

47
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.279
startup-config.

48
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.380
Now, there are other settings you can use as well, which will mostly change the baud rate,

49
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.910
the rate at which you connect to the device.

50
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.280
I can't really think of any reason you would want to do that.

51
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.670
So, these are the three that you would commonly use.

52
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.810
Okay,

53
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.540
if we do need to do a password recovery, so this is where we've lost the enable prompt.

54
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.490
So, maybe it's a small company.

55
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.220
We just had one administrator there before, and unfortunately, they got hit by a bus,

56
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.120
or more happily, they've left the company, and they didn't let anybody know what the enable password was

57
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.260
before they left.

58
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.930
Or just as likely is that if you're in a large company, you take a router or a switch

59
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.860
out of a shelf, out of a cupboard somewhere, and you don't know what the enabled secret is. So it is quite common

60
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.100
that you will have to do this, not day to day, but every once in a while. In a real world environment,

61
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.040
you will have to do a password recovery.

62
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.130
The way you do it is, first off, Google for the instructions for this, because again, you're not going to

63
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.420
be doing it every day, and unlikely you're going to remember how you do this

64
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.590
off the top of your head.

65
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.900
I've done it probably hundreds of times, and I still Google for the instructions whenever I need to do

66
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.750
it.

67
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.970
So, first up is you don't have the enable password, so you can't get in to the device. You need to reboot it.

68
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:46.200
Then while it is rebooting, press the break sequence on the keyboard. That is commonly Ctrl + Break,

69
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.680
but it depends on which software you're using to connect to the console.

70
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.930
Again, you can Google if it's not Ctrl + Break.

71
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.680
Okay,

72
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.800
so do that during the first minute that the device is powering on, and that will break you into the ROMMON

73
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:09.590
prompt. You then enter the command 'confreg 0x2142' at the ROMMON prompt, which says to ignore

74
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.500
the startup-config on boot. Now, you're not deleting the startup-config like when we did a factory

75
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.470
reset. The startup-config is still there, and the full configuration, everything that was configured on that

76
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:28.820
device is there as well, like IP addresses or wherever. And also, the enable secret is still there, which

77
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:36.740
you don't know, but the router is not going to use that startup-config when it boots up, so you don't need

78
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:44.690
to know what the enable secret is. You then enter 'reset' at the ROMMON prompt to boot the device. The router

79
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:52.940
will boot up with no configuration, so it will enter the Setup Wizard. You then type 'no' to bypass that.

80
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.690
You then enter enable mode with the 'enable' command. You're not going to be prompted for the enable

81
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.930
secret because it's not in the current running configuration, which is blank.

82
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.220
Next thing you need to do is copy the startup-config to the running-config.

83
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.640
Do not forget that step. If you forget that step and you do everything else correctly like it says

84
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.810
here, you're going to end up factory resetting that device, and you will lose the previous config. If you're

85
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:29.750
doing a password recovery because the administrator left and you need to still have that configuration

86
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.770
there, that would be a big mistake because you don't

87
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:39.860
forget to copy the startup-config to the running-config at that point. That will copy the entire

88
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:47.310
previous configuration into the running-config, including the unknown enable secret. But you're already

89
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.340
in enable mode,

90
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:55.340
so again, you don't need to know what that enable secret was. You then enter a new enable secret in

91
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:03.200
global configuration mode to overwrite the old one, and that will go into the current running-config. Then

92
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.950
enter 'config-register 0x2102', so the router will boot normally on the next restart. Again,

93
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.330
don't forget to do this either because if you do, every time you boot up, it will boot up with a blank

94
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.280
config, and you're going to think there's something seriously wrong with that router. If you ever get

95
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.260
that symptom where every time you boot up, it looks like it's been factory reset,

96
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.340
it will be because the config register is set to 0x2102.

97
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:39.190
And lastly, we 'copy run start' to save the configuration, and you now are back to where you started,

98
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:44.140
except you're logged in, and you've got a new enable secret. Okay,

99
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.800
so that's how we do the recovery procedure on a router.

100
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:56.300
If you're on a switch, then it can be a little bit different depending on what model you're on.

101
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.150
Also, some routers can be slightly different as well.

102
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:04.580
So whatever kind of device is that you need to recover, it will be very, very similar to those instructions

103
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.450
I just showed you there,

104
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.390
but it might be slightly different.

105
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.960
So again, Google to get the instructions and just follow the instructions to do the password recovery.

106
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.950
Okay, let's have a look at

107
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.480
how to do this in the lab next.
