00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:14.950
In this lecture, you'll learn about Loopback Interfaces. A loopback interface is a logical interface,

2
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:25.060
and it allows you to assign an IP address to a router or a Layer 3 switch, which is not tied to a physical interface.

3
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.070
Because we don't have any physical attributes that can fail, loopback interfaces never go down. Loopbacks

4
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.930
are logical, so it's impossible for them to physically be in the same subnet as other devices. So, they're

5
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.510
usually assigned /32 subnet masks to avoid wasting IP addresses.

6
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.050
That's the standard.

7
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.970
It's best practice to assign a loopback interface on all of your routers and all of your Layer 3 switches.

8
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.450
The loopback is commonly used for traffic that terminates on the router itself.

9
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.400
That could be most commonly at management traffic. Also, for other things like voice over IP (VoIP)

10
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.900
if you need to send voice over IP traffic to the router, also for BGP peering, etc. That provides redundancy

11
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.630
if there are multiple paths to the router.

12
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.430
You'll see how that works in a second. The loopback is also used to identify the router in OSPF because

13
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.750
the loopback address is used as the router ID. So, you'll see this when we do the OSPF section.

14
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.340
When you're looking at the OSPF database, etc., you'll see routers being identified by their router ID, which is

15
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.000
the highest the loopback address on that router.

16
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.310
The same loopback interface is usually used for multiple tasks.

17
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.910
For example, if you need to send traffic to the router for management and for BGP, we'll usually just have one

18
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.720
loopback interface and use the same IP address for everything. Multiple loopbacks can be configured though.

19
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.970
It's not common, we don't normally do that.

20
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.920
It's usually only done for special use cases where an additional loopback is required,

21
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.130
so not standard.

22
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.690
Okay, so here you'll see an example of why we're using a loopback.

23
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.810
We've got a PC,

24
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.660
let's say, which is behind router R4 and it's got IP address 10.1.2.10, and we want to connect

25
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:40.000
to the R1 router to manage it. We've got two paths we can get to R1 via R4 from.

26
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.270
We can either go along the top path, or we can go along the bottom path.

27
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.340
But if the top path goes down, we can't connect to the 10.0.0.1 IP address in R1, it's down.

28
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.280
If the bottom path goes down, we can't connect to the 10.0.3.1.

29
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.120
So, we're going to use a loopback. So that way, we get a single IP address that we can use to connect to R1

30
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.440
even if one of those paths goes down.

31
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.150
So what we do is we add interface Loopback 0, and we give it IP address, in our example,

32
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.120
192.168.1.1/32.

33
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.210
You can use any IP address you want for the loopback, and we then advertise that in the routing protocol.

34
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.700
R4 will then learn the two paths that it can use to get to 192.168.1.1,

35
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.790
and it will use whichever one is got the lowest cost or both

36
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:45.280
if they've got equal costs. And R4 can still connect to 192.168.1.1 even

37
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.620
if either path goes down.

38
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.900
So this is useful for management, and it's really critical for other things, like BGP and IP telephony.

39
00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.250
Let's say that we're sending IP telephony traffic from behind R4 to R1, we want to make sure

40
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.960
that it's always going to get there even if one of the path goes down.

41
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.630
So we don't direct it at a physical address on R1, which can go down. We direct it at the logical address.

42
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.720
In that way, even if one path goes down,

43
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.810
the traffic is still going to get there across the other path.

44
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.210
So that's why we use the loopbacks. So let's configure this in the lab. It's going to be a quick and easy lab.

45
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.590
We'll do it right now.

46
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.730
So I'm going to put the loopback interface 192.168.1.1 IP address

47
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.910
/32 on R1, and we'll see how R4 has got the two paths to get there.

48
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.180
Okay, so I'm on the lab. I'm on R4 here, and I'll just check that

49
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.360
I've got EIGRP running everywhere. So I'll do a

50
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:54.760
'show ip route' and I can see I've got an EIGRP route going out fastEthernet2/0, which is via R5, and

51
00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.350
I've got other EIGRP routes going fastEthernet0/0, which is R3.

52
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.270
So, I want to have two different paths available with one IP address that

53
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.520
I can use across those two different paths to get to R1. So if I go on R1 and I do a

54
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.530
'show ip interface brief',

55
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.560
I've just got my physical interfaces configured there right now.

56
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.990
So I'll go to global configuration, and then, to create a loopback interface,

57
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.500
the command is just 'interface loopback' and then the number you want to use. That creates the interface,

58
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.920
as well as taking you to the configuration mode for the interface.

59
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.190
And notice the interface goes up immediately because it is a loopback.

60
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.150
There is no need to do a 'no shutdown'.

61
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.120
If I do a 'no shutdown', it won't do any harm though, that's okay.

62
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.960
Okay,

63
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.040
I need to configure the IP address on here. So 'ip address',

64
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.190
I was going to give it 192.168.1.1, and I'll follow best practice of using

65
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.550
a /32  subnet mask,

66
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.210
so that's 255.255.255.255.

67
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:09.640
So, that is my loopback interface configured and given an IP address. I also need to make sure that it's being

68
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.960
advertised in my routing protocol.

69
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.300
So I'll do a

70
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.760
'do show run', and for this section,

71
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:27.200
EIGRP, just to check my EIGRP config, and I can see I'm using EIGRP 100 and it's just network

72
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.820
10.0.0.0

73
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.350
that is included in there right now.

74
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.280
So, I need to include my loopback address as well.

75
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:46.290
So I'll go 'route EIGRP 100', and then 'network 192.168.1.1'

76
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.070
and it's a wildcard mask,

77
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.980
that's the inverse of a subnet mask, so '0.0.0.0', and hit enter.

78
00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.610
And now, if I go back over to R4, EIGRP converges pretty quickly.

79
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.160
So, let's see if the route is there yet.

80
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.500
Yeah, it's there already. I've got a route

81
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:12.160
going to 192.168.1.1. There are two paths, but one of them has got a better

82
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.640
cost.

83
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.490
So, that's why it's the fastEthernet0/0 path that is made it into the routing table

84
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.030
right now.

85
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.940
I can ping 192.168.1.1, and that works.

86
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.550
And if I traceroute to 192.168.1.1, I can see that it's going along the

87
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.690
top path with the next hop of 10.1.1.2, 

88
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:44.950
and that was out interface fastEthernet0/0. So let's check that I can failover and still

89
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:52.170
get to the loopback, so I'll go 'config t' on here and go to 'interface fastEthernet0/0', and I'm going

90
00:07:52.170 --> 00:08:00.640
to 'shutdown' that interface. So that first path is not going to be available anymore. I see my EIGRP adjacency

91
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:13.480
going down, and now, if I do a 'show ip route', so before the route to the loopback was going via fastEthernet0/0,

92
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:22.750
if I do a 'show ip route' now, I can see that it's in the routing table from EIGRP again, and

93
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:28.510
now it's failed over to the other path. It's going to use fastEthernet2/0. So I can still

94
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:35.559
ping 192.168.1.1, and if I traceroute to it, I'm going to see it going down the bottom

95
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:46.330
path via R5. Okay, so that's why we want to use loopbacks, so that we can get to our routers no matter what

96
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:52.510
path we've got available, still using that same IP address. Okay, that was it for loopbacks. See you in the next

97
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:52.930
lecture.
