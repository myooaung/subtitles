00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.090
In this lecture, you'll learn about Leased Lines. A Leased Line is a dedicated physical connection

2
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.920
between two locations.

3
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.900
It has fixed reserved bandwidth, which is not shared with anyone else, and the same bandwidth is available

4
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.460
in both directions.

5
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.710
So if you've got a Leased Line which is being used for your Internet connection and it's a 2 Mbps

6
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.560
Leased Line, you've got 2 Mbps going up to the Internet, and you've got 2 Mbps coming down as well.

7
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.080
That's different than some other options, like some versions of DSL.

8
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.880
The company may own the cable infrastructure themselves, but far more commonly, it's going to be leased

9
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.090
from a service provider for a monthly fee.

10
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.370
That's where we get the name 'leased line' from. With our leased lines,

11
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.650
the first location is typically a corporate office, and the second location is typically either another

12
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.020
corporate office, and that provides point-to-point connectivity between the two offices,

13
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:20.170
or it could be going to a data centre that's connected to the company's existing WAN that provides multipoint

14
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.010
connectivity between offices,

15
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.360
or it could be going to a data centre that's connected to the Internet, providing Internet connectivity

16
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.180
and optionally a corporate office connectivity using Internet VPN.

17
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.440
The data centre we're talking about here is a data centre at the service provider.

18
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.190
So an example of a Leased Line, this is the one you saw earlier, we've got our office in New York and

19
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.690
an office in Boston, and we put in a point-to-point Leased Line between those two offices.

20
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.630
Let's say that our servers are in New York.

21
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.790
Our users in both New York and Boston can now access those servers over a private network connection.

22
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.060
We're also going to want to have Internet connectivity as well.

23
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.080
So, for example, in New York, we got a Leased Line going out to the Internet from there. Our users in

24
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.330
New York can access the Internet from there,

25
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.640
and also our users in Boston, they could send their traffic over the Leased Line to New York

26
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.830
and then break out to the Internet from there.

27
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.880
Some other topology options that we have, we could put in a Leased Line going out to the Internet and

28
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.510
New York, and also a Leased Line going out to the Internet in Boston. That gives us Internet connectivity

29
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.470
from both sites,

30
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.830
and then we could configure a VPN tunnel that's going over the Internet. That gives us connectivity between

31
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.000
both sites as well.

32
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.360
So in that example, we're using the same Leased Line for both of our Internet and our office WAN connectivity

33
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.010
as well.

34
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.980
Another way that we could do it similar to the last one is where we have Leased Line going out

35
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.470
to the Internet in New York and Boston,

36
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.970
and we also put an a Leased line directly between New York and Boston as well.

37
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.990
Now, obviously, we've got one extra Leased Line here,

38
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.080
so this is going to be a more expensive option.

39
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.350
The reason we would do this is that we don't want the corporate traffic between New York and Boston

40
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.500
going over an Internet VPN.

41
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.920
We want it going over a direct Leased Line. That way, we're going to get

42
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.170
SLA for the traffic between the offices, we're going to get guaranteed uptime,

43
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.810
and also delay and loss. We wouldn't get that if we were sending the traffic over the Internet.

44
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.670
So our leased lines use a serial connection requiring the correct physical interface card in the router.

45
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.990
They don't use an Ethernet port.

46
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.450
Now, like I said at the start of this section, different service providers will use different terminology.

47
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.300
So another service provider may offer you a Leased Line, which is not actually using a serial connection.

48
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.730
But as far as Cisco were concerned for the CCNA exam, Leased Lines is direct point-to-point connections using a serial

49
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.480
port. Common bandwidth options for our Leased Lines,

50
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.560
it depends whether you are in North America or in Europe, or another part of the world.

51
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.940
In North America, we've got the T1, which is 1.544, so 1 and a half Megabits

52
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.600
per second (Mbps).

53
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.280
In Europe we use an E1, which is 2 Megabits per second.

54
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.220
Now, whichever country you're in, it's highly unlikely that you would have the option of a T1 or an

55
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.790
E1.

56
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.460
If you are in North America, you can get a T1.

57
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.600
You can't get an E1.

58
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.320
If you're in Europe or Australia, for example, you can get an E1 if you're in another continent

59
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.270
like Asia.

60
00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.670
It depends what country you're in, whether the service provider is going to offer T1s or E1s

61
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.320
there. We can also get higher bandwidth connections as well.

62
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.890
For example,T2 is 6 Megabits per second, and E2 is 8 Megabits per second. There's also even higher

63
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:19.690
bandwidths as well, the T3 and T4, and the E3 and the E4. Further back in the past,

64
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:29.110
we would get slower bandwidth connections like this, like 64 Kbps or 128 Kilobits per second (Kbps), 256 Kbps or 512 Kbps, etc. 

65
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.330
So, lots of different options for the bandwidth on your Leased Lines.

66
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.810
Obviously, the higher the bandwidth, the more expensive it's going to be.

67
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.520
Now, there's benefits and drawbacks with our Leased Lines. Big benefit is that they have fixed reserve

68
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.070
bandwidth for you.

69
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.840
It's not shared with anyone else.

70
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.360
And because of this, that means that the service provider can give you a Service Level Agreement with

71
00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.130
guarantees for uptime, and traffic delay, and loss on the link,

72
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.150
but you have to pay for that kind of service.

73
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.170
So, Leased Lines are typically more expensive than the other options. There can also often be a longer

74
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.690
lead time to wait for the installation.

75
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:22.880
So because of that extra cost, copper or Fiber Ethernet connectivity options down to your CPE,

76
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.530
that's the Customer Premise Equipment, are becoming more common than serial Leased Lines

77
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.030
are.

78
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.560
You can still get these, but less expensive options are often being used now.

79
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.720
Satellite connections share the same characteristics as our cabled leased lines.

80
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.430
So, that's why I'm mentioning them

81
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.270
also in this lecture. They're typically expensive and lower bandwidth.

82
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.610
So, why would you use a satellite connection?

83
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:58.460
Often it's the only option if you're in a hard to reach area, like if you're working in mining or oil

84
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.910
and gas, and you want to put in one connection on an oil rig. Satellite is normally going to be your

85
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.840
only option there.

86
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.200
There's one last thing that I want to tell you about here that you don't actually need to know for the

87
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.230
CCNA exam, but I'm going to include it so that you don't get confused when you're working on real

88
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.790
world deployments.

89
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:30.570
That is the T1 and E1 links were also commonly used for connections to the phone network, that's the PSTN,

90
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:36.480
the Public Switch Telephone Network, just like you connect to from your phone at home

91
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:44.610
if you still have one, or from your cellphone. Now, the analog phone cable to your house is capable of carrying

92
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.380
only one call,

93
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:54.720
but if a company connects a T1 or an E1 to the phone network, they're going to be able to carry

94
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.830
much more than just one call over that single cable.

95
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:06.850
If they've got a T1 digital line, it can carry 24 concurrent calls, and E1 can carry 30 calls.

96
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.760
So this is good for the company,

97
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.380
they don't have so many cables going into the building.

98
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.650
Also, it can come with additional phone services as well.

99
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:24.630
So back in the day, you would very often see T1 and E1s being used for a company's connection to

100
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.710
the phone network.

101
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:35.100
Nowadays, VoIP, Voice over IP using SIP, the Session Initiation Protocol, over an Ethernet WAN connection

102
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.780
to the Telco is more popular.

103
00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.679
So, E1 and  T1 used to be super popular.

104
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:47.940
It's being replaced by SIP connections, usually going down to an Ethernet interface at the company though.

105
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.800
So, looking

106
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.370
If we are using T1 or E1 going out to the phone network, we've got the same example company again

107
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:03.060
with an office in New York and in Boston. Looking at the office in New York, on the router there, they've

108
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.690
got three different T1 interfaces.

109
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.180
One of the interfaces is connected out to the Internet,

110
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.010
another one is a direct connection to the office in Boston,

111
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.870
and then the third connection is connected to the phone network.

112
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.920
So now that company, if they make a phone call, say we've got a user with an IP phone in their desk

113
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:35.130
in New York, and they call Boston, that call will go over the T1 direct link between the two offices.

114
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:40.590
It's better to do it that way than sending it over to PSTN because then, the company doesn't have to

115
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.790
pay toll charges.

116
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.860
But the company, they're not going to be just calling between their own internal users.

117
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.480
They need to be able to call suppliers and customers on the outside as well.

118
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:59.010
So if I'm in New York and I phone a customer anywhere outside the company, then the call is going to

119
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:04.200
go via my router, then out the T1 to the phone network to get to that customer.

120
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:11.940
Okay, that's everything that I needed to tell you about T1s, E1s, and the other bandwidths we can

121
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.430
have with our Leased Lines for now.

122
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.040
I will see you in the next lecture.
