00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.670
In this lecture, you'll learn about Dynamic NAT. Dynamic NAT uses a pool of what are usually public

2
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.870
IP addresses which are given out on an as needed, first come, first served basis. Dynamic NAT is usually

3
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.790
used for internal hosts which need to connect out to the Internet, but they do not accept incoming connections.

4
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:39.580
So looking at our lab again, in the last lecture, we configured a Static NAT rule to give INT-S1,

5
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.970
our internal server, up in the top left, a fixed permanent public IP address so it could be reached

6
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.780
by host sending incoming connections in from the Internet.

7
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.970
In this one, we're going to be doing NAT for our normal desktop PCs that you see down in the bottom

8
00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.360
left.

9
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.360
So they are on the 10.0.2.0 network. They're just standard desktop PCs

10
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.670
so they never need to accept incoming connections coming in from the Internet. Whenever they're communicating

11
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.400
with the Internet,

12
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.680
the traffic is always initiated by them in the outbound direction. They need to except return traffic coming back

13
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.670
in from the outside,

14
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.150
but traffic is never initiated from the outside. So they don't need to have a permanent fix public

15
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.840
IP address.

16
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.360
They can just get the next available public IP address as in when they need it.

17
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.440
So in our scenario, we've bought the range of public IP addresses, 203.0.113.0/28

18
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.820
from the service provider.

19
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.780
It's the same scenario again that we used for Static NAT. 203.0.113.2

20
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.220
is on the outside interface on R1. 203.0.113.1

21
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.690
is being used by the service provider on the other side of that link.

22
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.620
And we're already using 203.0.113.3 for the Static NAT rule that we

23
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.420
configured in the last lecture.

24
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.540
So that leaves us with 203.0.113.4 to

25
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.760
203.0.113.14.

26
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.930
The hosts in the 10.0.2.0/24 network do not need to accept incoming connections, like I just

27
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.490
explained. But they do need to have the outbound connectivity to the Internet

28
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.350
so they do need to have a public IP address when they do that.

29
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.320
So we're going to use those remaining addresses, 203.0.113.4 - 14 for this.

30
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.400
And we're going to put them into a pool that are going to be allocated first come first served whenever

31
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.620
a host on the inside, sends traffic out to the outside.

32
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.420
The first host to send traffic out will be translated to the first address in the pool.

33
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.330
That's 203.0.113.4.

34
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.780
The second host will get the next address, 203.0.113.5, etc., all the

35
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.420
way up to 203.0.113.14 at the end of the pool.

36
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.030
Now, with Standard Dynamic NAT that we're discussing in this lecture, you need a public IP address

37
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.390
for every inside host that needs to communicate with the outside.

38
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.400
So, for example, if you had 30 hosts inside, you would need 30 public IP addresses. If you had 200

39
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.820
hosts, you would need 200 public IP addresses. When all the addresses in the pool have been used with just

40
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.660
Standard Dynamic NAT, new outbound connections from other inside hosts will fail because there's no public

41
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.000
IP addresses left to translate them to.

42
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.060
So in that case, a host that tried to send a traffic out when there was no addresses available, they're

43
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.900
all used up,

44
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.390
it would have to wait for an existing connection to be torn down and the translation to be released

45
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.770
back into the pool before it was able to send traffic out.

46
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.600
So it's Standard Dynamic NAT that we're discussing here, is not typically used in the real world.

47
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.990
What is used is PAT, Port Address Translation, and I'll cover that next.

48
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.200
But you need to understand Standard Dynamic NAT first.

49
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.370
So that's what we're doing here.

50
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.970
So our configuration, we need to specify our interfaces again. So we've got IP, we've got

51
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.870
interface fa0/0, we see IP NAT outside. We'd actually already done that in the previous lab for Static

52
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.630
NAT so we don't need to do it again.

53
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.750
The config was already there. But our inside hosts are on a different interface than our inside server

54
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.050
was.

55
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.870
Remember that inside server was on fa1/0.

56
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:53.480
Our desktop hosts are on fa2/0 so we need to say interface fa2/0, ip nat inside.

57
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.240
So for our scenario,

58
00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:02.510
we're actually going to end up having 2 IP NAT inside interfaces, interface fa1/0 that

59
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.860
faces the server with the Static NAT entry and interface fa2/0 that is facing our desktop

60
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.520
PCs.

61
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.770
They're going to be used for the Dynamic NAT entry.

62
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.610
That's fine.

63
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.010
On all of your interfaces,

64
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.360
you can specify outside or inside on there and you can have different interfaces as outside and as inside.

65
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.650
So we configure our interfaces.

66
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.120
Next up, we need to configure the pool of global addresses that will be available for our hosts. So for that,

67
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.070
the command at global config is ip nat pool.

68
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.300
Give it a name, Flackbox.

69
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.320
And then the range of addresses. It is going from 203.0.113.4 to

70
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.360
203.0.113.14. And then netmask or the subnet mask.

71
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.340
Well the subnet mask on our outside interface is 255.255.255.248.

72
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.360
So that's what we use here.

73
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:06.470
Next, we create an access list which references the internal IP addresses that we want to translate.

74
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.520
Here,

75
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.510
we need to identify the hosts on the inside and it's going to be by the source address so we can just

76
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.060
use standard ACL here.

77
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.270
If you want to get more granular than this, you can also use an extended access control list with source

78
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.640
and destination addresses.

79
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.690
That's a valid configuration as well.

80
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.260
But for our configuration here, we'll keep things simple.

81
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:38.030
We can just do a standard ACL. So our command is access-list 1 permit 10.0.2.0 and the wildcard

82
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.020
is 0.0.0.255.

83
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.840
So we've specified the pool of addresses. We've specified the hosts that are going to get translated into

84
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.710
those addresses.

85
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.240
The last thing we need to do is tie them together. So the command to do that

86
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.760
is ip nat inside source.

87
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:04.280
It's a list this time and list 1 means use access list 1. And then the pool, we're going to translate them

88
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.620
to is pool Flackbox.

89
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.430
So that's it.

90
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.970
That's the complete config to do Dynamic

91
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.490
NAT when we're not using PAT yet.

92
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.550
If we want to verify it, it's the same command as before, show ip nat translation. In the example output

93
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.360
here, you can see that we've got an entry for Inside

94
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.400
Local, our inside desktop PC, is 10.0.2.10,

95
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.560
and it's been translated into 203.0.113.4, which was the first available

96
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.670
address in the pool.

97
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.730
And it's sending traffic out to 203.0.113.20. If another

98
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:48.250
host then sends traffic, it would be translated to 203.0.113.5.

99
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.220
And we would see an entry for that in the translation table as well.

100
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.970
Remember, you need to be quick with this command because entries time out quite quickly.

101
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:04.570
This is a good time to tell you about another couple of show commands for NAT as well, and the clear

102
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:11.380
command here. So clear ip nat translation can be used to remove translations from the translation

103
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.290
table. And that can be useful when troubleshooting.

104
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:21.010
So if you're seeing output that you weren't expecting, you can clear the translations in there and then send

105
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.560
the traffic back out again just to double check what's actually happening.

106
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:32.679
It's also often required, if you want to edit, your NAT configuration will not allow changes when

107
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.710
there are active translations.

108
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.520
So if you want to edit it, make sure that all the translations are cleared first or you're going to get

109
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.299
an error message

110
00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:47.530
if you try to change a configuration. To remove all dynamic translations, it's clear ip nat translation

111
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.610
and then a star.

112
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.610
So you can you can remove just a single specific translation if you want, or you can remove all by

113
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.070
using that asterisk wildcard.

114
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.500
The other command that I wanted to show you, was show ip nat statistics.

115
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.700
So this command,

116
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.520
we don't use it as often as show ip nat translation, but this tells us how many addresses have actually

117
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.750
been translated.

118
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.330
OK, so that was Dynamic

119
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.000
NAT. In the next lecture,

120
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.040
I'll show you how to configure it with a lab demo.
