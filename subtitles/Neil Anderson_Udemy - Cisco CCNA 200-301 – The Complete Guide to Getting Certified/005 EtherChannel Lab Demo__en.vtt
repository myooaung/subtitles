00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:15.470
In this section, you'll see how to configure portchannels, etherchannel with a lab demo, so I'm

2
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.830
using the same lab topology that I used in the spanning-tree section.

3
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.070
So we've got our two core distribution layer switches, CD1 and CD2, and we've got a couple

4
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.210
of access layer switches, Access3 and Access4.

5
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.250
I've already set up the VLANs and the trunks.

6
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:47.480
I've configured CD1 as the spanning-tree root bridge primary and CD2 as the spanning-tree root bridge

7
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.380
secondary.

8
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:57.590
So, if you have a look at the diagram here, you can see from both Acc3 and access layer switch 4

9
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.600
that they've got four uplinks, but there's only actually one of them which is active and forwarding

10
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.370
traffic. On both of them,

11
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.210
it's an interface which is facing CD1 because CD1 is the root bridge.

12
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.050
So I've got four uplinks there, but I'm only able to use the bandwidth from one, so I want to improve

13
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.710
on that.

14
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.110
So I'm going to create a portchannel from Access3 going up to CD1.

15
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.460
I'm also going to create a different portchannel from Access3, going up to CD2.

16
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.700
It's going to a different switch, so it's going to be a different portchannel.

17
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.890
And then from Access4, I'll configure its portchannels - one going to CD1 one going to CD2.

18
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.120
The first portchannel, I would do from Access3 to CD1 and I'll use LACP for that.

19
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.520
So it's going to be on interfaces on Access3 fa0/23 and 24.

20
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.350
And it's the same on the CD1 side as well.

21
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.560
So I'm going to be configuring them with the same matching configuration.

22
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.270
I'll then do the portchannel from Access3 to CD2 and I'll use PAgP for this one.

23
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.300
Now, real world,

24
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.370
hopefully it's obvious that would be an insane thing to do.

25
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.540
You would always standardize on one protocol for your portchannels and it's recommended to use LACP.

26
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.440
You can use static if one side doesn't support LACP.

27
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.880
But for the lab demo,

28
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.380
I want to show you all of the different protocols, so I'll do the first one with LACP.

29
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.030
I'll do the second one with PAgP.

30
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.340
Third, portchannel will go from Access4 up to CD2 on the same side.

31
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.730
On the right hand side of topology, I'll use static for that, so you'll see all three and we've got one

32
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.660
left over, so I'll use LACP for that again.

33
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.570
OK, so that's what I'm going to configure.

34
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.070
So let's start off on our switch Access3.

35
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.100
I'll do the first portchannel.

36
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:18.470
So that is going to be LACP up to CD1 on interfaces fa0/23 and 24.

37
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.240
So I'll go on to the Access3 switch if I can find it in here. There it is.

38
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.620
And actually, I want to show you spanning-tree first as well. So we can check this - show spanning-tree.

39
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:46.490
And my PCs are in VLAN 10. show spanning-tree VLAN10 and I can see that I am forwarding

40
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.450
on fa0/1.

41
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:56.630
That's actually facing down towards the PC so I show run and check the config and interface fa0/1

42
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.390
That all looks good.

43
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.000
So it's in VLAN 10.

44
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.840
switchport mode access facing down to the PC. So before uplinks are fa0/21 to 24 and

45
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.490
only one of them is forwarding now.

46
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.850
That's a port that is connected to CD1, which is my root bridge.

47
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.640
So let's put this into an etherchannel.

48
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.360
So I'll go to global config, interface range fa0/23-24.

49
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.890
is what's connected to CD1 and to provision a portchannel,

50
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:43.430
it's channel-group 1 mode then I want it to be LACP, so I'll make the mode active and as soon

51
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.050
as I do that, it creates a portchannel interface for me.

52
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.400
So if I do a do show ip interface brief

53
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.400
I can see up at the top there, I've now got this new portchannel interface and I need to configure

54
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.030
my interface level settings on the portchannel.

55
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:12.120
To do that, I go to interface ports. I can just do po as shorthand. interface po1 for portchannel 1.

56
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:21.690
And then on here I want to say switchport mode trunk because it's connecting to another switch.

57
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.590
And switchport trunk native vlan 199 is the native VLAN that we're using.

58
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.540
I would also set the allowed VLANs on here normally as well and in a production environment.

59
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:41.670
OK, so that's it. Done on the Access3 side. Let's to do it on the other side of the links, which is

60
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.110
on CD1. I'm going to put in the exact same configuration here.

61
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:53.070
So config t and it's interface range fa0/23-24.

62
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.090
Now the interfaces on both sides don't have to be the same

63
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:04.620
number interface. It could it be an interface fa0/9 and 10 on this side, and 23 and 24 on the other

64
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.980
side.

65
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.600
And that will work just fine.

66
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.350
But it's best and easiest if possible,

67
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.740
you can use the same interface number on both sides.

68
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.180
It just makes it easier for us as human administrators to understand what's going on.

69
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.740
OK, so I've specified interfaces and then channel-group 1 mode active.

70
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.020
I could say passive here, but it's best practice to do active on both sides and then you can't get

71
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.880
them mixed up.

72
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.860
I see the portchannel comes up.

73
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.640
I'm getting a native vlan mismatch because I haven't configured it yet.

74
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.240
So let's do that now.

75
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:51.030
So I'll go to interface portchannel 1, switchport mode trunk and switchport trunk native vlan

76
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.290
199

77
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.380
And I see it unblocks it because I've got the same native VLAN on both sides now, so that looks good.

78
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.320
So now the next thing to do is check that portchannel came up OK, so I'll do a show

79
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.930
etherchannel summary

80
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.880
And this all looks good, that's what I wanted to see, for portchannel 1, SU

81
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.970
which means it's a layer 2 interface and the U

82
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:25.560
is for In use which basically means it's up and it's ports fa0/23 and 24.

83
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.920
And they are both in the portchannel. So that all looks good.

84
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.310
So that was my LACP configuration.

85
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:44.040
Next, let's do PAgP from Access3 going up to switch CD2.

86
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.880
So get on my command line here and this is going to be interface range fa0/21

87
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.870
- 22 is the interfaces that are connected over to CD2 switch on the right hand side and

88
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.000
I'll say channel-group

89
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:10.460
Now I've already used 1, so I'll use 2 for the next one and I'll say 'mode desirable' to make it PAgP.

90
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:19.730
I see the portchannel is created and then I go on to interface portchannel 2. Now, switchport mode

91
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.650
trunk and switchport trunk

92
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.390
native vlan 199

93
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:35.940
I need to make sure I cofigured marching settings on the other side, which is over on CD2

94
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:43.200
So a config t and it's interface fa0/21 - 22, you can hopefully see the

95
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.390
benefit of using the same interfaces on both sides

96
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.420
now. I'm not really having a think about it.

97
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.780
I know that it is the same on both sides and I just forgot to put in the range keyword there.

98
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.680
So I specify a range and I'm using the same on both sides.

99
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.760
So it's nice and logical.

100
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.380
It saves me getting confused and mixing things up. And channel group,

101
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.980
I haven't created a portchannel in here yet, but because I used 2 on the other side, I'm going to

102
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:18.760
use 2 on this side as well, again, to keep things logical, so channelgroup 2 mode desirable.

103
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:28.440
This is also a PAgP, then I need to go to interface portchannel 2 this time and switchport mode

104
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.110
trunk, switchport trunk native vlan

105
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.500
199

106
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.630
OK, so that is my first. You're done. Let's check if it came up OK.

107
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.370
So show

108
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.750
etherchannel summary

109
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.220
And this one's up as well.

110
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.240
It's all good, too. So, first two were done.

111
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.980
Next up, I'll go on to Access4.

112
00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.930
And I'll configure the portchannels going up the same right hand side of the topology.

113
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:10.390
So I go to global config and it's interface range fa0/23 - 24

114
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:17.420
on the right hand side and channel-group 1 mode

115
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.330
I'll make this static this time.

116
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.620
So it's going to be on.

117
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:29.690
And that is my static configured, I can now go interface portchannel 1, switchport mode trunk

118
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.100
and switchport trunk native vlan 199.

119
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:44.510
I need to configure the other side to this and link, which is on CD2, so I'll go to global config.

120
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:57.440
That's interface range fa0/23-24 and then channel-group 1 mode on.

121
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:07.900
And I see that I'm getting an error message here that fa0/23 is not compatible because of DTP mode.

122
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.660
Well, if I have a look at my interface, so I'll do a show run

123
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.410
and I can see on interface fa0/23

124
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.430
and fa0/24

125
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.670
that the settings are the same on there and the same on the other side as well.

126
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.210
So this is just that glitch with the packet tracer.

127
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.410
The etherchannel should come up in a second anyway.

128
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:42.280
So let's just complete the configurations. I'll go config t and then interface portchannel 1, switchport

129
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:51.570
mode trunk and switchport trunk native vlan 199.

130
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.630
And that should get rid of that error message.

131
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.480
That looks good.

132
00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:02.650
And then if I do a show etherchannel summary and yeah, I can see that it did come up there.

133
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:09.280
Sometimes when you first configure this in packet tracer, when you do the static, it might throw that

134
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.390
error message at you, but just complete the configuration anyway.

135
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.540
You might have to give it a minute and then the portchannel should come up.

136
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:26.020
So there's the portchannel I created earlier, the PAgP one, which is going to Access3 and this is the static

137
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.990
that I just configured going down to Access4. You can see where it shows a dash on the protocol.

138
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.180
That means that is static.

139
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.440
OK, so that's my first three portchannel was configured.

140
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.650
I verified that they're up and working.

141
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.620
I'll do the fourth one, which is going to be another LACP as well.

142
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.080
You don't need to see me doing that because you already saw me configured it.

143
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:57.940
So I'll see you back here for the next lecture where we'll have a look at how this is going to affect

144
00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.750
spanning-tree.
