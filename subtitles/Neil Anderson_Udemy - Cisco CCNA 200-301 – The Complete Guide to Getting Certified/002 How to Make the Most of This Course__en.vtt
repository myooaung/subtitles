00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.130
In this lecture, you'll learn about how to make the most of the course. So, I'm logged into the course

2
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.110
here. It might look a little bit different from you because I'm logged in as the instructor, but

3
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.570
it should be pretty much the same.

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.800
I'm on the course content tab here, and this is where you can see all of the lectures.

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.840
First thing I should tell you about is that the first few sections are theory-based.

6
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.280
The reason is that I need to give you the core foundational knowledge before we go on to actually configure

7
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.180
the devices.

8
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.960
You need to understand that before you're going to understand what you're configuring.

9
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.890
So, bear with me through the first few sections.

10
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.110
Like I said, that will build your core knowledge.

11
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.950
After that, we'll get on to the actual technologies.

12
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.700
You'll see me working at the command line, and then you can practice this yourself in the lab,

13
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.370
but let me go down and show you what I mean there.

14
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.510
The way that the course is laid out is that I've got the theory lectures first in each section, so I'll

15
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.210
explain what the particular technology is.

16
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.630
I'll also show you how it works in the lab as well.

17
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.850
So once you understand what it is, you'll also see how to configure it and how to troubleshoot it.

18
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.310
So watch the videos first, and then you'll see at the end of every section that I've got a configuration

19
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.760
lab.

20
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.200
These are lab exercises for you to actually do.

21
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.380
So, what you'll find in those lectures is there's a couple of PDFs. There's the lab exercises, which are

22
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.810
the tasks for you to do in the lab,

23
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.230
and then there is the answer key that gives you the detailed explanation of how to actually do it.

24
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.040
My labs are a little different than some others that you might see, and that I don't give you step by step

25
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.440
instructions on what to do because if I do that, you're just following what I'm telling you to do.

26
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.880
You're not really learning anything.

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.990
I give you tasks, and I don't tell you how to do it.

28
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.940
That's already been explained in the earlier videos.

29
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.090
So watch the videos, see what I do in the lab.

30
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.330
I then give you these lab tasks for you to do, and then you'll have to figure it out yourself, and you're really,

31
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.960
really going to learn the technologies by doing it that way. As well as having that 2 PDFs

32
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.830
with the exercises and the answer key, there's also the lab set up file in there as well.

33
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.030
In the next section, I'll show you how to set up the lab.

34
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.780
You can run the lab for free on your laptop.

35
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.850
It uses Packet Tracer.

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.760
And in the next section, I'm going to show you step by step how to install it and how to configure

37
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.630
it on your laptop.

38
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.720
So, you'll be able to get up and running with the labs in around 10 or 15 minutes, pretty much immediately.

39
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.740
Okay, so that's how to do the course. Do all the lectures from start to finish. Watch the videos first

40
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.640
just as it's laid out, and then do the lab exercises as well.

41
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.460
In that way, you're going to get a really solid, deep understanding of the technologies, and you're

42
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.730
also going to build the practical hands-on skills so that you can configure and troubleshoot it as well.

43
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.630
Another thing to tell you in here as well that notice for all of the theory lectures, there's also a downloadable

44
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.100
PDF here as well.

45
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.860
That's a PDF of sthe slides that I use,

46
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:39.860
and I deliberately make the slides in a human readable format, not just really short bullet notes that

47
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.320
don't make sense without an explanation.

48
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.780
So the slides are maybe a little bit longer than what you're used to seeing, and I know that's not

49
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.380
what you're meant to do in PowerPoint if you view any PowerPoint material, but I've done it deliberately

50
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.920
like that,

51
00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.890
and the reason is so that later when you're getting near to the exam date, you can have a look at

52
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.200
those PDF and they act as flashcards. So if you're taking your own notes, you can just review

53
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.760
that as review material, and it's going to get you ready for exam day.

54
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:19.370
Okay, so that was everything about how to go through the course. One other thing to tell you here is

55
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:27.260
there's also other additional material on my blog. That is here at the Flackbox blog.

56
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.910
So if you come in here and then go to Tutorials, and go to the Cisco Training Videos section, you'll

57
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.550
see I've got loads of extra material in there. A lot of these are similar videos to what I have in the course,

58
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.510
but this also includes a text description which gives you even more detail.

59
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.680
I also have a whole heap of other free resources on my blog as well.

60
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.680
Free training courses, free resources.

61
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.560
I'll be adding new Cisco resources in here as well.

62
00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.190
So, have a look at the blog every once in a while and get those extra free resources to help you

63
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.910
through the course.

64
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.630
Okay, the very last thing for me to point out 

65
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.070
you is to come down here to the last section in the course where I tell you the practice tests I recommend

66
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.210
to give you the best chance of passing on your first try.

67
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.520
Getting these is purely optional,

68
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.750
but if you are going to get them, it's best to get them at the start of the course.

69
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.800
So then, you can test your knowledge as you go through the different sections.

70
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.110
So come down here to the last lecture

71
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.840
now, have a look at that, and then you can go back to where you left off at.

72
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.580
Thanks.
