00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.610
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure a one-to-one Static NAT rule with a lab

2
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.090
demo. So you can see our lab scenario here.

3
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.380
I've got INT-S1. That's my Internal S1 server inside my company on the left.

4
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.600
It's using private IP address, 10.0.1.10 on the inside.

5
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.890
And I need to NAT that to a public IP address so that it can accept incoming connections.

6
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.360
The public IP address that I'm going to use on my outside interface on R1 is

7
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.040
203.0.113.3.

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.010
And we're going to need to test this as well.

9
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.330
So that's why I also have the External S1 server that I'm going to use to connect into S1 from there.

10
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.710
So let's configure this.

11
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:08.600
So I will jump on to my command line here on R1 where I'm going to do the NAT translation rule. I'll go to global

12
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.620
configuration and it's interface fa0/0.

13
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:24.170
That is my IP NAT outside interface and interface fa1/0 is my IP NAT inside interface.

14
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.850
So whenever there is traffic going between those interfaces that match a NAT rule, the translation will

15
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.780
be applied.

16
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.500
I need to configure my translation as well.

17
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:46.040
So my command for that is IP NAT then it's inside source and I'm doing a static translation from

18
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.300
10.0.1.10, the private address and the inside to 203.0.113.3,

19
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.940
the public address on the outside.

20
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.950
And that's the whole configuration done.

21
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.240
Now, whenever the host sends traffic out, it will be translated to the public IP address and whenever

22
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.880
traffic comes into the public IP address, it will be translated to the private IP address.

23
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.450
So let's check that it is working.

24
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.900
So first thing I'll do is I'll ping from the host on the inside going out to the public server on the

25
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.530
outside.

26
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.350
So let's set up a debug so we can see what's happening.

27
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.710
So on External Server1 on the outside, I'm going to do debug ip icmp. The difference between a show

28
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.960
command and a debug command,

29
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.060
whenever you enter a show command, it gives you a single point in time

30
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.910
output. It shows you what state it was when you hit enter on that show command.

31
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.460
When you do a debug, it gets updated in real time.

32
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.510
So whenever anything changes it will show you the output to your command line, as in when it's changing.

33
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.040
You'll see what I mean in a second.

34
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.660
So I've turned on ICMP debugging on EXT-S1, so when ping packets come into it, we should get

35
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.860
some information there.

36
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.450
Let's go on to INT-S1, the host on the inside

37
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.190
where we're doing the NAT rule for and see what actually happens.

38
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.470
So I'm going to ping 203.0.113.20 which is EXT-S1 on the outside.

39
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.030
I'll hit enter and then I'll go on to EXT-S1S1 and you can see there is the debugs coming in.

40
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.840
Actually, I will show you

41
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.480
debug better. Let's do an extended ping.

42
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.240
It's IP, target IP address 203.0.113.20.

43
00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.380
And let's go for repeat count of 50 so you can see the debug happening. And I'll just hit enter for everything

44
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.730
else and jump over there. And you can see that the output is updating every time the ping packet is

45
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.330
coming in.

46
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:19.070
OK, so let's look at the output here. And I can see that the echo reply was sent back from the external

47
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.959
server to the internal server.

48
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.110
The source address used was the external server's IP address 203.0.113.10.

49
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.260
And the destination address is 203.0.113.3.

50
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.040
So I can see that may NAT rule is working. The actual IP address and the host, if I have a look at

51
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:48.530
that, with a show ip interface brief, this is actually  a router that I'm using here to emulate the server and

52
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.100
its IP address is 10.0.1.10.

53
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.940
So that's the IP address configured on the actual host's operating system.

54
00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.030
But when it sends traffic out that 10.0.1.10 address, it is being translated to

55
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.570
203.0.113.3.

56
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:14.200
by the NAT rule on the router. OK, so it's working fine for outbound traffic. Let's just check the

57
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.180
inbound traffic is working as well.

58
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.370
So from the server on the outside, I will check that I can get to my Web server on the inside.

59
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.900
So I will telnet to its public IP address, 203.0.113.3.

60
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.140
And I'll do that on port 80 because for this example, it's a Web server on the inside.

61
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.350
So I'll enter 80 for the port number and I can see that is open.

62
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.970
So it was able to connect.

63
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.300
I've already configured the host on the inside to be a web server.

64
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.520
OK, so NAT is working in both directions. It's all good.

65
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.280
Let's check the translation table on

66
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.090
R1.

67
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.950
So I'll do a show ip nat translations and they're OK.

68
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.940
I can see the ICMP entry has timed out already. You'll see this in the real world as well.

69
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.090
That connections time out pretty quickly from the NAT translation table.

70
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.670
So let's do the ping again.

71
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:25.920
So I'll ping that outside interface again from the inside.

72
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:36.670
And now if I do a show ip nat translations on R1, I see that the output has changed. That was the

73
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.660
old one where the ping had actually timed out from the table.

74
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.630
The new entry is here where I can see, there's ICMP entry, so there is the ping.

75
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.510
So that was the ping.

76
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.110
It went from the real IP address on the host.

77
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.950
That's the Inside Local which was 10.0.1.10.

78
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.060
And that source address was NAT'd to 203.0.113.3.

79
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.580
So that's how it will look to the host on the outside.

80
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:14.620
The host on the outside is 203.0.113.20 and R1 is not doing any

81
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.950
kind of translation from that outside host so 203.0.113.20

82
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:26.320
shows up as both the Outside Local address and the Outside Global address as well, because I'm doing

83
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.770
one-way

84
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.990
NAT here. I'm not doing two-way NAT.

85
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:39.640
Also, we had that inbound Web HTTP connection from the outside server going to the inside server and that was

86
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.950
going to port 80.

87
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.820
So there again, I can see that the Inside Local, the private address 10.0.1.10, it was connecting

88
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:55.300
to port 80. The public IP address, that it was NAT'd from, 203.0.113.3

89
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.290
port 80.

90
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:03.340
And the host on the outside that connected in is 203.0.113.20.

91
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.120
And it was using source port 16282.

92
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.670
OK, so that's it.

93
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.820
That's how we can figure a Static NAT entry and how we verify it with the show ip nat translations

94
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.330
command. See you in the next lecture

95
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.520
where we'll do Dynamic NAT.
