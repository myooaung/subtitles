00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.070
We covered the Class A addresses.

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:16.470
Next up is Class B. So, Class B addresses were originally assigned to medium to large-sized networks.

3
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.360
With Class B,

4
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.770
it's the first two bits in the address are always going to be set to 1 0.

5
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.680
Class A addresses default to a /8, which is the first octet.

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.060
Class B subnet masks always default to a /16, which is the first two octets, and the valid network addresses

7
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.540
range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0.

8
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.930
Again, this is a Class B. The subnet mask is the first two octets, so the ranges use the first two octets.

9
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.880
So 128.0 to 191.255,

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.480
that allows for 16,384 networks and 65,534

11
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.620
hosts on each of those networks.

12
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.620
Again, you would never have a flat subnet with up to 65,000 hosts in there. If you were given

13
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.400
a Class B network in real world, again, you would subnet it into smaller subnets.

14
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.150
The last class that we'll cover here, the last one that can be used to assign addresses to hosts, is Class C,

15
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.450
and this is used for small networks.

16
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.810
You show that Class A, we've got the first octet, so /8 is used for the subnet mask.

17
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.800
Class B, the second octet,

18
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.870
it's a /16. With Class C, the default subnet mask is a /24, up to the end of the third

19
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.050
octet. And with Class C, it's the first three bits that are important.

20
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.320
They're always set to binary 1 1 0.

21
00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.830
The valid network addresses range from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0.

22
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.639
That allows for a little over 2 million networks and 254 hosts per network.

23
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.020
But something that you're going to know by heart, later on, a Class C network has got 254 hosts up to

24
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.430
that amount. With a Class C, that's small enough, so that could be allocated as is for a real world deployment,

25
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.450
or again, if we wanted to, we could actually subnet that into smaller networks as well. A quick note on private

26
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.310
addresses now,

27
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.890
so I give you all the addresses that were available in our Class A, B, and C networks, and we spoke about

28
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:48.700
the reserved addresses for our loopbacks, and also the addresses beginning with 0 are reserved

29
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.930
as well.

30
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.050
There's also a range of reserved private addresses in each class.

31
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.920
Those are valid to be assigned to hosts, unlike the other reserved addresses, but the difference is that these

32
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.640
ones are not routable on the public Internet.

33
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.130
So, these were originally designed for hosts in a closed private network that should have no Internet

34
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.270
connectivity.

35
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.210
For example, imagine you've got a high school, and you've got students there that need to work on PCs,

36
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.160
but you don't want them to be able to browse the Internet.

37
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.860
You would put them on private addresses. The benefits you get from that are that they can't get hacked because

38
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.200
they're not connected to the Internet,

39
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.650
and also, it doesn't cost you anything.

40
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.690
You have to pay for public IP addresses. Private IP addresses are, of course, free.

41
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.160
The different ranges that are used for our private addresses, in Class A it's 10.0.0.0

42
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.400
to 10.255.255.255 on the host addresses. The private host addresses in Class B, 172.16.0.0

43
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.600
to 172.31.255.255, and the Class C private range,

44
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.170
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.

45
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.270
Again, when you're experienced with working in networking, these are things that you're going to know

46
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.140
off the top of your head.

47
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.570
Private addresses, there's quite a bit more we need to talk about with those. That's going to be covered

48
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.300
in a later lecture in this section.

49
00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:16.550
Okay,

50
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.110
so that was all the info I needed to give you about

51
00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.470
our Class A, B, and C classes for now.

52
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.750
We'll talk about the Class D and Class E addresses in the next lecture.
