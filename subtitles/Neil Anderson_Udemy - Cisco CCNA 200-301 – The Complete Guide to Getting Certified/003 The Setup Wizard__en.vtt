00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.480
In this lecture, you'll learn about the Setup Wizard for our routers and switches.

2
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.750
I'm using the same lab setup again,

3
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.370
where I've got R1, which is going to have IP address 192.168.0.1 on

4
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.930
interface FastEthernet0/0. We're going to use that as a management IP address. And we've got SW1

5
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:38.280
which is going to have management IP address 192.168.0.10 on the VLAN 1 SVI,

6
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.850
and SW1 is connected to R1 with interface FastEthernet0/1.

7
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.320
So, let's

8
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.640
have a look at this in the lab.

9
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.810
So this is what you'll see when you first take a router out of the box, power it on, and hook up a

10
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.470
console cable. When it's brand new from the factory,

11
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.690
it will automatically open up with the System Configuration Dialog.

12
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.270
Also, if you factory reset the router, next time you boot it up,

13
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.100
this is how it will look when you boot it up.

14
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.740
Now, I've cheated a little bit here. You notice that I already had the router setup already. So, another

15
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.920
way that you can invoke the Setup Wizard is at the enable prompt, you can use the command 'setup'. So you

16
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.450
see, that's what I've done here,

17
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.320
and when you enter 'setup', it will show you the prompt here, the System Configuration Dialog.

18
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.920
"Do you want to continue with the configuration dialog?"

19
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.930
This is what you'll see, the message down at the bottom here, when the router is first time out of

20
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.730
the box, brandnew from the factory.

21
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.600
So, you can use this to do the initial setup of the router.

22
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.280
Basically, all it is going to do is put a hostname on there and configure an IP address for management.

23
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.350
To be honest, I've never actually seen anybody use this in the real world.

24
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.000
Everybody will always just break out of here by entering 'no', and then configure the router or the switch manually.

25
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.350
But you might be tested on this on the CCNA exam, so I'll show you how to do it anyway.

26
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.730
Real world, you're probably never going to use this.

27
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.110
Okay, so we are going to use it here.

28
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.800
So, I'll enter 'yes' to

29
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.860
continue with the configuration dialog. It then tells me it's going to do a basic setup of the system.

30
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.980
"Would I like to enter the basic management setup?"

31
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:36.200
I'll say 'yes'. It then asks me for the hostname. I'll name this router R1. It then asks for an enable

32
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.860
secret.

33
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.430
This is a secret password, which is encrypted, that is going to be required to get into the enable prompt.

34
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.820
It's best practice to enable one of these.

35
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.370
We didn't do it in the last lecture because I'm going to show you when I show you how to secure a

36
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.600
router in a later lecture. So for the enable secret, I'll use Flackbox1.

37
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.010
Next, it'll ask me for an enable password.

38
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.920
This is basically the same thing, but the enable password is not encrypted, so it's not actually used.

39
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.140
But the Setup Wizard are still going to ask me to enter one

40
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.540
anyway, so I'll use Flackbox2 for that.

41
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.740
Then, it asks me for a virtual terminal password.

42
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.600
This is the password that's going to be used for incoming Telnet or SSH sessions when I'm doing remote

43
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.130
management over the router to the IP address. So, I'll put another password in here.

44
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.350
Okay, so that's my passwords entered. Next it will ask if I want to configure SNMP, the Simple Network Management

45
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.020
Protocol, I'll say 'no'.

46
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.760
I could configure this later if I wanted to.

47
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.200
It will then show me the interfaces on this router and asks me which one I want to use for the management

48
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:57.260
interface. So, I will choose interface FastEthernet0/0. When I choose this, this is the one

49
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.740
that is going to be enabled for remote management access.

50
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.290
It asks, "Do I want to operate in full-duplex mode?"

51
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.730
Yes, I do.

52
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.100
Do I want to configure IP on this interface?

53
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.470
Yes, I'm going to need to so that I've got an IP address to connect to for management. So I'll say 'yes',

54
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.899
and I'll use 192.168.0.1.

55
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.590
It will default to the Class C subnet mask 255.255.255.0

56
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.660
When you see an answer in brackets, it means that's the default, and you can just hit enter to accept that.

57
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.820
It saves me having to type in 255.255.255.0 myself.

58
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.210
It will then show me a summary of the commands that will be entered.

59
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.610
So I see that it is going to enter the hostname R1, it's going to configure the IP address on interface

60
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:56.030
FastEthernet0/0, and no shutdown. And if I scroll down to the bottom, it will ask me if I want to

61
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.180
save the config. It gives me the option to break out to the normal command prompt without saving

62
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.430
or to go back to the start of the Setup Wizard if I made a mistake in one of my entries, or number 2

63
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:19.120
is going to save the config and exit. So I will hit 2, and that is the Setup Wizard completed on R1.

64
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.560
Let's

65
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:29.520
also do it on SW1. So I've got another tab open for SW1, and I'll go at the enable prompt

66
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.830
and 'setup' to invoke the Setup Wizard.

67
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.170
"Do I want to configure the configuration dialog?"

68
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.910
'Yes', very similar

69
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.790
on SW1 as well. "Do I want to enter basic management setup?"

70
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.060
'Yes'. Enter the hostname.

71
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:55.540
I'll call this SW1. I'll use the enable secret, I'll enter that, and also an enable password, the virtual

72
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.980
terminal password for Telnet access.

73
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.140
"Do I want to configure SNMP?"

74
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.750
Not for now.

75
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.620
It will show me the interfaces and this is a Layer 2 switch,

76
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.470
so I need to configure it on the SVI for VLAN 1.

77
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.950
"Do I want to configure IP?"

78
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:23.250
'Yes', I'll need that to allow remote management, and the IP address was 192.168.0.10, subnet mask

79
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.290
defaults to 255.255.255.0.

80
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.190
That's fine.

81
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.120
"Do I want to enable this as a cluster command switch?"

82
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.310
'No', this is not a cluster switch.

83
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.500
I'll say 'no' to that.

84
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.130
It then shows me a summary of the commands that are going to be entered.

85
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:46.550
I can see I've got my management IP address there on VLAN 1, and that is the Setup Wizard completed again.

86
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.430
It's number 2 to save and exit.

87
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.460
And to test this, I should be able to ping the router now

88
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.030
at 192.168.0.1. That works great,

89
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.090
okay, so good.

90
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.690
Something you may have noticed it did not prompt me for a default gateway, so it's not going to be able

91
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:16.350
to get out to other subnets yet. So I'll enter global configuration, and 'ip default-gateway

92
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:25.410
192.168.0.1'. Okay, that's it done. That's the Setup Wizard completed.

93
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:35.120
I'll end out there, and to test that management access works, let's try 'telnet 192.168.0.1'.

94
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:45.070
That looks good, I'm getting the password prompt, so I'll enter what I set as the password, and I've now

95
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:52.630
got a prompt. I've remotely telneted into R1 for management. Okay, that's everything I needed to show

96
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.350
you there.

97
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.880
That's the Setup Wizard. Again, real world, you're not ever going to use this, but it's there if you ever want

98
00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.110
to.
