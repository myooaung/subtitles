00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:15.070
In this lecture, you'll learn about the different etherchannel protocols and how to configure and verify

2
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.300
them.

3
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.350
So there's three available protocols. That's LACP and PaGP and static.

4
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.680
So first one is LACP, the link aggregation control protocol.

5
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.390
This is an open standard.

6
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.620
So it's supported an all vendor switches. With LACP,

7
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:43.000
the switches on both sides negotiate the portchannel creation and maintenance. And all of the three available

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.570
methods,

9
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.530
this is the preferred one to use.

10
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.720
Next one we have is PaGP, which is Cisco's proprietary port aggregation protocol.

11
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.710
This works similarly to LACP.

12
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.140
Wherever switches on both sides again negotiate the portchannel creation and maintenance.

13
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.820
But it's not recommended to use PaGP because it's proprietary.

14
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.570
And the third option we have is to configure a static etherchannel. With static,

15
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.840
the switches do not negotiate creation and maintenance, but the settings must still march on both sides

16
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.630
for the portchannel to come up.

17
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.940
So with all three, you've got two switches

18
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.430
that've got links going between them and you're going to configure those into a portchannel.

19
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.860
You need to configure the same settings on both sides, on both switches. And for static,

20
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.300
this is the one that we'll use if LACP is not supported on both sides. LACP will be supported

21
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.200
on all Cisco switches, but maybe you're connecting to another vendor switch or a server or something

22
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.700
like that.

23
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.890
So those are the three different options.

24
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.600
The configuration for all is really, really similar.

25
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.050
They all actually use the same command, which is the channel group command, but it's on the keywords

26
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.870
that we use along with Channel Group that decides which of the three protocols is going to be used.

27
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.150
For the parameters for either chinless, I touched on this just a minute ago where I said that the configuration

28
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.060
has to match on both sides of the link.

29
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.410
The interfaces need to have a matching configuration.

30
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.860
So settings that have to be the same on both sides include the speed and duplex,  whether the port

31
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.050
is set to access or trunk mode.

32
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.110
The native VLAN, the allowed VLANs on there, and the access VLAN, if it's an access port.

33
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.360
So looking at the configuration. The first one we look at is LACP. Your LACP interfaces can be set as either active

34
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.860
or passive.

35
00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.480
So let's see, we're going to configure a portchannel between Switch1 and Switch2. If Switch1's

36
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.160
interfaces are as active and Switch2 as passive, the portchannel will come up.

37
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.040
But if both sides are set as passive, the portchannel will not come up. And if both sides are active,

38
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.280
the portchannel will come up.

39
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.390
So it's recommended to configure both sides as active.

40
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.280
Your choices are either both sides as active or one side is active and one side is passive.

41
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.470
It's easiest just to configureboth as active because then you don't need to worry about which is

42
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.560
the active side and which is the passive side.

43
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.880
So here's our configuration, it's configured at the interface level. So specify the interfaces you want

44
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.430
to group in the portchannel.

45
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:53.030
Here we're seeing interface range fa0/23 - 24, and then our command is channel-group 1

46
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.350
mode active.

47
00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.550
As soon as you enter that command, it will create a new logical interface, which is your portchannel

48
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.210
interface.

49
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.190
Here we're configuring channel-group 1, so that would create portchannel 1.

50
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.550
The reason that there's a number here is that you might have different portchannels going to different

51
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.339
neighbor switches. So let's say that we have Switch1.

52
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.010
We've got a portchannel going to Switch2, we could make that portchannel 1. If we've also got

53
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.870
a portchannel going to Switch3,

54
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.200
We could make that portchannel 2.

55
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.740
So that's the command to create your portchannel. After the portchannel has been created, most of

56
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.370
your interface settings are set at the portchannel level.

57
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.420
So to do that,

58
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.950
we say interface portchannel 1, and then switchport mode trunk.

59
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.250
We would also set the native VLAN, the allowed VLANs, etc.,

60
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.180
at this level.

61
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.410
And you need to configure those matching settings on the switch on the other side as well. So you see

62
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.150
that the configuration here is exactly the same.

63
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.640
We did it first on Switch1 and then we do a matching configuration on Switch2.

64
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.970
So that was LACP.

65
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:17.360
So if LACP, it's channel-group command and then you use either active or passive. The configuration for PaGP

66
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.870
is the same, but rather than using active or passive, we use desirable or auto.

67
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.280
And it's similar rules that we had with LACP where if one side is desirable and the other is auto, then

68
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.630
the portchannel will come up.

69
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.420
If both sides are auto, it won't.

70
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.360
And if both sides are desirable, it will.

71
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.900
So again, if you are going to use PaGP, which is not recommended, then set both sides as desirable.

72
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.260
Then you don't need to worry about which is desirable and which is auto.

73
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:57.080
So looking at the config, exactly the same as it was for LACP. But here we say channel-group 1 mode desirable

74
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.420
rather than channel one, channel-group 1 mode active.

75
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.360
So you can tell by the keyword at the end whether it's going to be LACP or PaGP. Or, when we get to

76
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.060
the next slide, static. For static,

77
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:19.190
again, it's exactly the same configuration, but we say channel-group 1 mode on. So active for LACP,

78
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.410
desirable for PaGP and on for static. Rest of the configuration

79
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.970
exactly the same for all of them.

80
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:35.660
So that's how we configure it. How we verify it, there's one Swiss Army knife command for checking

81
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.330
etherchannel, which is show etherchannel summary. And you see the flags just under there.

82
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.450
So it tells you what all the letters actually mean here.

83
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:50.700
Looking down at the bottom, we can see that this is Group 1, our first portchannel. The portchannel interface

84
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.880
is Portchannel 1, and in brackets I see a capital S and a capital U.

85
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.780
The capital S means it's in layer 2 portchannel.

86
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.970
You can also configure a layer 3 portchannel as well. On the interface, you would

87
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.120
say no switchport and put an IP address on there.

88
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.450
But more commonly it's going to be a layer 2 portchannel.

89
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.150
The capital U means it's in use, which basically means that it is up.

90
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.240
I can see that the protocol is LACP and over on the right I can see that my ports are fa0/23

91
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.230
and fa0/24.

92
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.810
A capital P means they are in the portchannel. For a layer 2 portchannel,

93
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.720
if you see any letters other than exactly what you see here, there's a problem with the portchannel and

94
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.380
it's not going to come up. If there is a problem with your portchannel,

95
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.340
by far, the most common issue is that your settings do not match on both sides.

96
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:54.350
So look at the interface, both the physical interface level and also at the portchannel interface level as

97
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.710
well.

98
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.600
And just make sure that the settings are exactly the same on both sides.

99
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.990
Also, make sure that you've selected the correct interfaces that are cabled to each other as well.

100
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.230
OK, so that was our show

101
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.190
etherchannel summary command. You can also just show etherchannel and that will give you

102
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.210
more verbose output, but summary really tells you everything that you need to know.

103
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:21.350
The last command to look at is show spanning-tree vlan. Because as we explained before, the reason

104
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:28.310
for using etherchannel is to avoid spanning-tree shutting down some of your links.

105
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.340
So after you've configured this, you want to check the

106
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.190
spanning-tree is working as you would like.

107
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:41.210
So the example here is before we've configured etherchannel. If you look at the picture over at the

108
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.150
right, we've got a Switch Access 3 with uplinks going to our switch CD1, the core distribution one.

109
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.710
CD1 is the root bridge for spanning-tree.

110
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.240
And if we look at Access3, it's got two links going up to CD1.

111
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:01.940
If we don't put those in a portchannel, then spanning-tree sees them as a potential loop,

112
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.400
and it's going to block one of the links. Looking at the output of our show spanning-tree vlan 1

113
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.230
command here,

114
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.820
look down on the bottom,

115
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.660
I can see that fa0/23

116
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:19.820
is forwarding. It's the root port on Access3. And fa0/24 is blocking to prevent the loop.

117
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.830
So these are fast Ethernet interfaces.

118
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:28.790
In our example, I'm only getting 100Mbps of uplink bandwidth rather than 200Mbps with my two ports.

119
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.180
To fix that, we configure etherchannel.

120
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.220
After you have configured etherchannel, we can put the same command. And again,

121
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.230
show spanning-tree vlan 1

122
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:47.030
And now if I go back a slide, before the portchannel, you see that spanning-tree saw the physical interfaces,

123
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.810
fa0/23 and fa0/24.

124
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.410
When we put those in a portchannel, spanning-tree just sees that one logical interface.

125
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:03.050
So it sees it as being one link, which is not a potential loop as far as spanning-tree is concerned.

126
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.930
So now on the portchannel, it is forwarding. I don't have any ports that are blocking.

127
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.530
I get the full bandwidth of both physical interfaces now.

128
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.920
OK, so that was our configuration and verification.

129
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.690
See you in the next lecture.
