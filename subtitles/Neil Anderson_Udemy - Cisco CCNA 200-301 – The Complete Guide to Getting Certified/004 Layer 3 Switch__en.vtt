00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.790
In this lecture, you'll learn about the third and last option for inter-VLAN routing, which is to

2
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.450
use a Layer 3 switch.

3
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.700
Now, you're less likely to get tested on this option in the CCNA exam, but it's actually the option

4
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.430
which is most commonly used in the real-world.

5
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.910
So, I wanted to explain it to you here to give you the complete picture.

6
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.530
So looking at our lab topology, it's the same as before where we've got a switch, which has got both

7
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.130
Engineering and Sales PCs plugged into it,

8
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:56.030
and we've split that into an Engineering and a Sales VLAN. And we put the Engineering PCs in access

9
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.500
ports for the ENG VLAN,

10
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.760
the Sales PCs are configured on access ports for the Sales VLAN.

11
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.660
Once we've done that, the PCs will be able to communicate with each other within their own VLAN.

12
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.100
But because the two VLANs are also in different IP subnets, ENG is using 10.10.10.0, Sales

13
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.890
is using 10.10.20.0, we're going to need to configure routing between them as well.

14
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.060
The first two options we covered used an external router.

15
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.660
This option, we're going to do the routing actually on the switch itself.

16
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.030
So to be able to do that, you can't use a lower-end Layer 2 only switch.

17
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.980
It has to be a Layer 3 switch to be capable of doing routing.

18
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:52.640
When you do have that, the switch, it doesn't use a physical interface for the routing.

19
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.250
It uses a virtual interface,

20
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.740
that is our SVI, a Switch Virtual Interface. So see with the config here,

21
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:09.530
we configure interface VLAN 10 and then IP address 10.10.10.1, and interface VLAN 20

22
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.860
and IP address 10.10.20.1.

23
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.430
Those virtual interfaces will act as the default gateways for the PCs.

24
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.480
Whenever a PC sends traffic into the switch, we've already configured the switch with the access port

25
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.560
with the correct VLAN on there, so the switch knows which VLAN the traffic is coming in on. So, it

26
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.830
knows which SVI would correspond with that.

27
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.580
As long as we've got IP routing enabled on the switch and we've configured our SVI, Switch virtual

28
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.400
Interfaces, it's going to be able to route traffic between the two different VLANs. 

29
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.300
Now, notice on here in my topology diagram,

30
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.820
I've also got an external router

31
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.200
even though the switch is able to do routing itself.

32
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.530
The reason for that is the external router is connected out to the Wide Area Network.

33
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.030
It's quite often the case that your connection to a service provider is not going to be using an Ethernet

34
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.480
port,

35
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.690
and our Layer 3 switches only support Ethernet.

36
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.620
So if you need to use a different type of interface, you're going to need to have a separate, dedicated

37
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.520
router for that.

38
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.110
Another reason would be that maybe there's some kind of WAN feature that is required that again is

39
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.490
not supported on the switch, that is only supported on an external router.

40
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.960
So, that's why we've also got the external router for the WAN connectivity.

41
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:47.000
So whenever we've got any traffic between our internal VLANs, that is going to get routed on the switch.

42
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.170
That traffic never goes up to the router.

43
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.680
But whenever there's any traffic that needs to go outside the Local Area Network, that needs to go

44
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.790
out to the WAN, that is going to get sent up to the router.

45
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.040
So, let's check the configuration for this. Before we look at that WAN connectivity configuration, here,

46
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.890
we're just doing the inter-VLAN routing.

47
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.970
So this is going to allow traffic between our PCs that are on the internal network, between the Eng

48
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.769
and the Sales PCs. At global config,

49
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.700
first off, we have to enable IP routing and then we configure our SVIs.

50
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.720
So we say 'interface vlan 10', 'ip address 10.10.10.1' with a / 24 mask, and 'interface vlan 20',

51
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.090
'ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0'.

52
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.790
Once we've done this, the Engineering and the Sales PCs are going to be able to communicate with

53
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.300
each other.

54
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.100
We still need to do our WAN routing configuration as well through.

55
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.630
So if I look back at the topology diagram again, you'll see that is interface fastEthernet0/1 on

56
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.680
the switch which is connected up to the router, and I need to put an IP address

57
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:14.140
directly onto that physical interface. So to do that, I need to configure it as a Layer 3 interface.

58
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.360
A Layer 3 interface means that it's going to have an IP address on that interface.

59
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.330
So I say 'no switchport' for that, then I can put the IP address on the interface.

60
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.830
So I say 'ip addresse 10.10.100.1' with a /24 mask, and I need to configure the route to

61
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.990
send all traffic up to the router

62
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.590
that's it's going out to the WAN. So 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

63
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.190
next hop 10.10.100.2.

64
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.790
I also need to configure a matching configuration on the router as well.

65
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.580
If you look back at the diagram again, the inside interface in the router is fastEthernet0/1,

66
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.260
the outside is fastEthernet0/2.

67
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:09.010
So on the inside interface, I configure IP address 10.10.100.2, and on the outside

68
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:16.240
interface in this example, it's IP address 203.0.113.1. Then I need to configure

69
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.570
a default static route for traffic going out to the WAN,

70
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.380
So that's 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

71
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.850
next hop address

72
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.850
203.0.113.2,

73
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.930
and then I also need to configure a route for the internal LAN traffic as well. I could have

74
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.340
configured two different routes,

75
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.490
one for 10.10.10.0/24, and one for 10.10.20.0/24,

76
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.890
but I can do that with a single summary route.

77
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:53.710
So I configure 10.10.0.0 255.255.0.0, next hop on the switch 10.10.100.1,

78
00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.250
and that covers me for both of the 10.10.10.0 network and the 10.10.20.0 network.

79
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.500
Going back to the diagram again, when we did the first two options with a router with separate interfaces

80
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.530
or Router on a Stick, the router was directly connected to the 

81
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.470
10.10.10.0 and the 10.10.20.0 networks,

82
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.620
so I didn't need to configure an explicit route for it.

83
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.450
In this example, it's the switch which is connected to those networks.

84
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.850
The router is not,

85
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.790
so I do need to configure a route in this example.

86
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.870
Okay, so that is the configuration.

87
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.920
Looking at the considerations here, traffic being routed within the campus is now routed across the

88
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.120
switch backplane.

89
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:49.750
It doesn't need to travel up and down physical cables to an external router, like what's happening with

90
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.100
the first two options.

91
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.890
But as we mentioned earlier in this lecture, you might still need an external router for WAN connectivity

92
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.450
and services.

93
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:04.720
Okay, so that is all of the theory for our Layer 3 switch.

94
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.050
Next up is to configure it in the lab,

95
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.910
I'll do that in the next lecture.
