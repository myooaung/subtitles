00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.180
In this lecture, you'll learn about the basics of hubs and switches, and I'll do a comparison between

2
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.230
the two.

3
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.840
The functions of hubs and switches are very similar.

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:28.350
You take your end hosts in your Local Area Network, like your PCs, your servers on your printers,

5
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.840
and you plug them into a hub or a switch with an Ethernet cable, and those end hosts are then able to

6
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.540
communicate with each other through the hub or the switch. In the picture here,

7
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.040
we've got a Cisco 2960 Catalyst switch.

8
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:54.080
It's a 48-port model, so obviously, you could plug in a maximum of 48 hosts into that switch.

9
00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.140
But what if you've got more than 48 hosts in your campus, which you probably will have?

10
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.120
Well, in that case, you're going to have multiple switches in your Local Area Network, and your switches

11
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.340
will be connected to each other with Ethernet cables. Again, that's your inter-switch links. So, I said

12
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.960
we were going to compare hubs and switches. We'll have a look at hubs first. Hubs always operate in half-

13
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.210
duplex mode.

14
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.580
That means that the attached hosts can either send or receive data. They can't do both at the same time.

15
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.420
All of the hosts that are plugged into that hub share the same collision domain, meaning that only one

16
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.250
device can transmit at a time. If two devices do transmit at the same time, then they will detect that,

17
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.620
and they'll back off, and they will then resend to make sure that there is not another collision

18
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:03.350
again. The method that is used for detecting and recovering from collisions is CSMA/CD.

19
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.020
That's Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection.

20
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.170
Okay, so hubs, half-duplex and a shared collision domain. With switches, on the other hand, they can operate

21
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.330
in either full-duplex or half-duplex.

22
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.560
In practice, they're always going to operate in full-duplex mode because that's much more efficient.

23
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.910
When they are operating in full-duplex, the attached host can both send and receive data at the same

24
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.690
time using their receive and transmit wires.

25
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.390
Also, all hosts have their own dedicated collision domain.

26
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.480
Because of that, we're not going to have collisions. A collision detection mechanism is not required.

27
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:58.490
Looking at the OSI stack, switches operate at Layer 2. Our hubs operate at Layer 1. So hubs, they're

28
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:06.670
not MAC address aware. Whenever a frame is received on a port, it's flooded out to all the other

29
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.210
ports

30
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.630
apart from the one that it was received on. Because of that, all hosts that are plugged in there are

31
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.060
going to receive the frame,

32
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.190
so they're going to have to process it, at least as far as seeing that it's not for them. Switches, however,

33
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.810
operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model.

34
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.080
They also operate at Layer 1, obviously. They've got physical ports on there. 

35
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.030
This means that switches are MAC address aware. Whenever a frame is received, the switch will look at

36
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.080
the source MAC address in the Layer 2 Ethernet header, and it will learn

37
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.910
that MAC address. It will then add that MAC address to its MAC address table, which is a mapping between the MAC address and the port

38
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.720
that is reachable on. If a unicast frame is later received where that MAC address is the destination,

39
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.990
the switch will only send out the relevant port, unlike a hub that floods it out everywhere.

40
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.440
This is better for performance and security, as frames only go where they are required. Whenever a

41
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.950
frame is received for the broadcast address or an unknown unicast address, it would be unknown

42
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.060
because the switch hasn't learned about it yet, it will be flooded out all ports

43
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.320
apart from the one it was received on. Okay, that was the basics of hubs and switches and the difference

44
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.770
between them. We'll be having a look at switches in a lot more detail as we go through the other sections

45
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.340
of the course. We're not really going to talk about hubs anymore because hubs aren't used anymore.

46
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.470
Back in the day, like 15 years ago, hubs were commonly used because switches were very expensive. Switches

47
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.620
have come down in price so much now, though, that you can't even buy hubs anymore. Switches are always

48
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.040
used.
