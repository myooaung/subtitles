00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.660
In this lecture, you'll learn about VTP, the Vlan Trunking Protocol. It allows you to add, edit, or delete

2
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.980
VLANs on switches which are configured as VTP servers, and then other switches which are configured

3
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:31.340
as VTP clients, will synchronize their VLAN database with the servers. So say you go on to a VTP server,

4
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.660
there's no configuration on any of your switches yet,

5
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.230
and on the server, you create VLAN Eng and VLAN Sales.

6
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.920
That configuration will be pushed to the VTP client switches. So it saves you having to create all

7
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.890
your VLANs on all of your different switches,

8
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.610
and if later on, you don't need the Sales VLAN anymore, you can delete it on a VTP server and it

9
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
will be automatically deleted on all of the clients.

10
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.570
Or if maybe, it was VLAN number 10 before and you change it to VLAN number 100, that information

11
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.140
would also be synchronized across all of your switches.

12
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.500
So it can be convenient if you manage a large campus with a lot of switches there. You're still going

13
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.650
to need to perform the port level VLAN configuration though. The switches can't somehow magically

14
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.180
know which physical port needs to be in the Eng or in the Sales VLAN.

15
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.420
So you'll still need to go and do your port level access port or trunk port configuration, but it saves you

16
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.860
having to configure the VLAN database on all of your different switches.

17
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:47.240
Now, be very careful if you do use VTP, because it doesn't just allow you to add VLANs, you

18
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.720
can delete and edit VLANs as well.

19
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.350
So if you accidentally introduce a switch with a higher VLAN database revision number and it doesn't

20
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.470
have all of your production VLANs on there, like say you're currently using VLAN Eng and VLAN

21
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.180
Sales, and then you go and get an old switch out in the cupboard which doesn't have VLAN Eng and VLAN Sales

22
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.840
on there,

23
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.790
and this switch happens to be a VTP server, which is the default, and it's got a higher revision number

24
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.410
and it doesn't have the VLANs on there,

25
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.300
well, when you plug it into your campus, it will update the other switches.

26
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.840
They will delete the Eng and the Sales VLANs

27
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.620
and you've just dropped all of your PCs off of the network.

28
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.180
That would be a very bad day at the office.

29
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.490
That would be a career limiting mistake to make,

30
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.890
so do be careful if you are using VTP. If you use both DTP and VTP, we covered DTP in the last lecture, the VTP

31
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.440
domain name has to match on neighboor switches for trunks to be formed by DTP.

32
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.000
It's not recommended to use DTP anyway.

33
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.680
You should be manually configuring your trunk ports.

34
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:11.720
The different VTP modes that you've got are VTP server, VTP client, and VTP transparent. On a switch

35
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.640
which is configured as a VTP server,

36
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.220
you can add, edit, or delete

37
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.680
VLANs. A VTP server will synchronize its VLAN database from another server with a higher revision number,

38
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.010
so you don't have to just have one master server there.

39
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.130
You can have multiple servers for redundancy, but only one of them is going to be the actual copy of the

40
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.990
vlan database.

41
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:45.260
Whichever one has got the highest revision number will act as a master. Next type was a VTP client. On a VTP client,

42
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.800
you cannot add, edit, or delete VLANs.

43
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.520
It can only get the information from a server.

44
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.370
A VTP client will synchronize its VLAN database from a server with the highest revision number.

45
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.480
And finally, we've got VTP transparent.

46
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.660
A switch configured as VTP transparent does not participate in the VTP domain.

47
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.560
It does not advertise or learn VLAN information, but it will pass it on.

48
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.150
So if you've got a VTP server and a VTP client, and there's a VTP transparent switch in the middle, it will

49
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.720
pass on the server information downstream to the client. On your VTP transparent switch,

50
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.410
you can add, edit, or delete VLANs, which is in its own local VLAN database, so it doesn't participate

51
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.100
in the domain.

52
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.590
It's just independent on its own.

53
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.720
Now, while we're talking about that, let's look at how VTP coexistence works with your different modes

54
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.560
of switches, because this is something that confused me when I was first learning about VTP.

55
00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.750
So in our example here, we've got the VTP server up at the top and the other switches downstream from

56
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.610
there are VTP clients, apart from the VTP transparent switch.

57
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.860
So on the VTP server, for our example network here, we need the Engineering and the Sales VLAN.

58
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.920
So we configure the Engineering and the Sales VLAN on the VTP server.

59
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.150
The client switches will synchronize their database, so they will learn about that VLAN and they will add

60
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.350
it to their database.

61
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.550
The VTP client down in the bottom right will also learn the information as well, because the VTP transparent

62
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.530
switch will pass it onto it,

63
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.350
but the VTP transparent switch will not update its VLAN database.

64
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.030
It will not add the Eng and Sales VLANs just because that was configured on the server.

65
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.960
So on the VTP transparent switch, you need to add the VLANs there as well.

66
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:03.210
So on the VTP server, you manually add the Eng and Sales VLANs and on VTP transparent, because it's

67
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.290
still in the campus, it still has PCs in the Sales and Engineering

68
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.670
VLANs. It needs to know about them.

69
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.970
You add the VLANs there as well.

70
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.020
The VTP configuration, you need to specify the VTP domain.

71
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.900
So here we've said 'vtp domain flackbox' and then to set the mode

72
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.410
it's either 'vtpmode server', or 'vtp mode client', or 'vtp mode transparent',

73
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.970
and the default mode is VTP server. To add your VLANs,

74
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.060
you know this information already, for example, 'vlan 20' 'name sales'.

75
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:49.100
So our configuration in this last example, on the VTP clients, we would say 'vtp domain flackbox' and then

76
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:58.890
'vtp mode client'. On the VTP server, we would say 'vtp domain flackbox' and 'vtp mode server'. On transparent,

77
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.810
we would say 'vtp mode transparent'. Then on the server,

78
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.920
we would configure VLAN 10 and VLAN 20, and on transparent switch, which we would also configure VLAN 10

79
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.540
and VLAN 20 there.

80
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.200
Then, all of it switches would know about all of a different VLANs.

81
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.230
We would just need to configure them down at the port level, put the actual client PCs in the correct

82
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.220
access port.

83
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.630
Okay, that is the whole thing for VTP apart from verification. To verify it, 'show vtp status',

84
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.090
that will show you what the domain name is,

85
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:39.570
also what the mode is, whether it's a client, server, or transparent, and also the current revision number.

86
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.360
Okay, so that's the theory for VTP. In the next lecture, we'll configure it in the lab.
