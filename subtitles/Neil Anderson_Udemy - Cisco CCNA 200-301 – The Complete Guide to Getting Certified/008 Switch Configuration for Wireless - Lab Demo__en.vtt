00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.630
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure a switch to support wireless networks with wireless LAN

2
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.230
controller with Damul.

3
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.100
I'm going to use packet tracer for this demo so you can see that I've got it up in here.

4
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.080
I've got my switch here in the middle.

5
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.000
That's what I'm going to be configuring here.

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.880
And it's connected to a wireless LAN controller.

7
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.729
A couple of access points in my admin laptop.

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.260
And later on, I'm going to configure a corporate and guest W lines.

9
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.780
So because I've got the two different W lines there, I'm going to need to have two different Villines

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.290
to support both of them.

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.700
So what I'm going to configure here is I'm going to create my corporate villain and I'm going to create

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.230
my guest Vorlon.

13
00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.550
I'm also going to create a management version as well for the wireless traffic.

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.130
So the different types of traffic that is going to be on top management view on when my admin laptop

15
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.550
is connecting M to the wireless LAN controller to configure it, but it's going to be on the management

16
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.930
VLAN and management IP subnet.

17
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.600
Also, when the wireless LAN controller is communicating with the EPWs, that is going to be on the

18
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.260
management Vorlon as well.

19
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.830
So I'm going to have that management velum with its associated IP subnet and that's going to be used

20
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.130
both for management of BWL XI and also for WSC Traffic to the apps.

21
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.450
And back again, you could split in two different villans.

22
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.270
I'm going to just use one Vorlon for it here.

23
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.010
So I'm going to have three different versions.

24
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.330
The management, Villon, the corporate Vorlon and the guest of you on.

25
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.500
I'm also going to need to configure my switch parts as well.

26
00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.850
The WSC connection to the switch that needs to be a trunk part to support all those different villains

27
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.760
for the app connections going to the switch.

28
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.090
Those are going to be configured as oxes parts in the management Vorlon.

29
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.510
OK, so let's get this all configured.

30
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.150
So I will click on my multi-layer switch while I'm coming in here.

31
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.890
By the way, in Pocket's race or a trunk part to the wireless LAN controller is not separate.

32
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.270
So do not follow along with me as I do these lob demos.

33
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.780
OK, use the supplied lob exercise at the end of a section which does have a trunk port going bolshy.

34
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.240
But I've got a workaround in there that's going to make everything work because you don't follow along

35
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.490
with me with you get the end of the section user supply doob exercise and then everything will work

36
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.210
just fine.

37
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.730
OK, so I'm on the switch here.

38
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.740
I'll go to the command line, I'm going to the enable prompt and then I'm going to go to global configuration.

39
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.180
So first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create those Vallens.

40
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.110
So first we go on Algis and Management V1 with furbished design of what Vilan numbers you're going to

41
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.240
use and what the associate IP subnets are going to be in a real world environment.

42
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.600
You would work with the network designer to decide which villines in which IP subnet.

43
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.470
So let's see if I've done that already.

44
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.680
We've decided that the management valon is going to be violent and zalk view on ten and I'm going to

45
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.410
give it the name of management.

46
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.140
And then I'm going to want to have an SUV, I switched virtual interface in view on 10 as well, so

47
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.870
I'll create the obviously interface view on 10 here on my multi-layer switch.

48
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.240
And I'm going to give the IP address one thing to DOT one six eight, and this is going to be 10, which

49
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.400
matches up with view on 10.

50
00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.990
And I will give us IP address DOT one, the subnet mask two five five five five five five.

51
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.220
So this is on my multi-layer switch and my multi-layer switch is going to be the default gateway for

52
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.750
all of these different Villines and IP subnet.

53
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.320
It's going to be able to vote the traffic between them.

54
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.120
So that's why I'm creating the interface VLAN 10.

55
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.140
OK, so I've got the view on created and I've given it an IP address on The View, on interface, on

56
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:34.450
my apps and also the management IP address for my wireless line controller are going to be in this VLAN

57
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.200
and in this IP subnet with my apps.

58
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.080
When we get plugged in and they come online, I'm going to want them to communicate, to connect to

59
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.920
the wireless line controller and download the configuration from there.

60
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.840
So I'm going to be plugging the APIs in.

61
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.640
I want them to get connectivity to the wireless LAN controller, so we're going to need to get an IP

62
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.110
address.

63
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.140
So I need to configure the scope for what you could use an external DHP server.

64
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.720
This I'm going to do it here on the switch, so I'll go back down to global configuration and my subnet

65
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.430
is one thing to do it.

66
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.690
One six, eight, 10, the old swash 24.

67
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.850
I'm only using I'm already using IP address dot one, so I don't want to go and give out a host.

68
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.510
So let's say that I will allocate addresses one thing through to one six, eight, 10 one or one two

69
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.150
two, five, four with my DHP scope.

70
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.370
So I need to exclude three addresses.

71
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.580
One thing two to one, six eight goaltend one to one thing to dot one six eight or ten point one hundred

72
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.960
so that it starts giving out starting with address one or one to the command.

73
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:52.030
To do that I will see IP, the HGP excluded address and I want to exclude one thing two one six eight

74
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.930
door ten one two one nine two one six eight ten one hundred.

75
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.030
So start with the next address, which is one nine two two one six eight ten one two one.

76
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:12.430
But I need to create my scope so I see IP the sheep pool and give it a name.

77
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.120
I'll call it management, which ties up with the villain name.

78
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:26.170
And then the network I'm going to be assigning addresses from is one name to one six eight Tand or subnet

79
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:32.370
mask five five five five two five five or the default router.

80
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.730
So the default gateway for this network is here on the switch.

81
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.880
It's one thing to dot one six, eight, 10, dot one.

82
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.230
And the other thing that I want to do is tell the access points where the wireless line controller is.

83
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.190
So for I'll see option for three IP and my wireless LAN controller has got IP address.

84
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.620
One thing to you, that one she thought ten, eleven.

85
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.560
I've already statically assigned to the IP address to the wireless LAN controller.

86
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.590
Now in this example, because of the wireless LAN controller and the apps are in the same Vorlon and

87
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.740
the same IP subnet, I didn't actually need to do that because the EPWs would find a wireless LAN controller

88
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.360
from a broadcast anyway.

89
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:24.310
But if the apps and the wireless LAN controller are on a different subnet, well, routers don't forward

90
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.200
broadcast, so that would not work.

91
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.170
So in that case, you would definitely want to add the option for free to your DHP scope.

92
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.380
OK, so that is my management view on DHP scope all gone.

93
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.140
Next up, I need to create the Villines for my wireless networks as well.

94
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.380
So it is going to be one for corporate and one for gas.

95
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.910
So let's do corporate first.

96
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.500
And again, I've spoken to the network designer and they've told me use valon twenty two, Salkey Valon

97
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.280
twenty two.

98
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.260
I will see name corporate.

99
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:08.170
And then again, this multi-layer switch is going to be the default gateway for the IP subnet, so I

100
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.670
need to create the interface for that.

101
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.960
So I will say I just to show you, this is Barkett global config again.

102
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.580
I'll say interface.

103
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.310
It's Valon 22 and I'll give it IP address.

104
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:26.920
One thing to do it one six eight more services in subnet one and two 168 dot twenty two again to tie

105
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:34.900
up with the view on number on dot one for the default gateway subnet mask five five five two five five

106
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:35.750
dot.

107
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.429
Oh.

108
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:46.060
OK, so that is my corporate view on configured now the wireless clients that are connecting into the

109
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.960
corporate DoubleLine, they're going to need to get an IP address as well.

110
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.840
So I also need a DHP scope for them.

111
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:58.750
But rather than creating it here on switch, it's actually possible to configure a DHP scope in the

112
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.050
wireless LAN controller.

113
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.530
So for my wireless clients, I'm going to create the DHP Scoop's there in the wireless LAN controller.

114
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.710
You'll see how you do that later on when I do that demo.

115
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.530
OK, so I've got my Villon created for corporate.

116
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.440
I need to do it for Ghast as well.

117
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.010
So I'll see Valon and we're using Vorlon 23 here.

118
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:24.820
The name is gashed and then because I switch here it is the default gateway again.

119
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:37.030
I need to see Interface Valon twenty three and give it the IP address one nine two one six eight twenty

120
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.020
three point one with a swash twenty four subnet mask.

121
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.790
I don't need to do a no shut on these interfaces because of our virtual interfaces.

122
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.920
They are not shut down way by default.

123
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.400
OK, so I've got my villans configured.

124
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.460
Let's just check that.

125
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.500
That looks OK.

126
00:09:53.530 --> 00:10:01.990
So I will do a show VLAN and in here I can see a couple of the ones that were already created in my

127
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:08.170
lab environment here, which was for the radius server and also for my admin laptop.

128
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.340
So they were done already.

129
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.720
I can see the villains I've created.

130
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.540
There's Valentin Management and then view on 22 corporate and view on 23 guest.

131
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.580
So that looks good.

132
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.120
And I'll do a show IP interface brief.

133
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:32.410
On the bottom and there I can see 10 and view on 22 and view on twenty three.

134
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.650
I can see the state issues up down here about, OK, it's just because none of my switch ports have

135
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.300
been allocated to that view.

136
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.230
And yet when I've done that, then Vivienne's will come completely up.

137
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.970
OK, so that is my Villines old year and also my DHP school done as well.

138
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:57.900
Now what I need to do is configure the switchboard's, so I will have a look back at the diagram again.

139
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.880
So I need to configure the switchboard here connected to the wireless line controller as a part.

140
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:10.290
And I also need to configure V Switchboard's here connected to my EPWs as oxes parts in the management

141
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:17.730
VLAN to watch through the wireless line controller first through back on the switch again.

142
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:29.420
I'm going to go back to global configuration again, and it is interface gigabit Ethernet one, swash

143
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.020
or swash five, which is connected to my wireless LAN controller.

144
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:40.970
So let me just put in a description to see that Celsi description W, l, c and then I need to configure

145
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.780
this as a trunk for the model which I'm working on here.

146
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.230
Does support both dot one Q and Izell trunking.

147
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.760
So I need to specify.

148
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.760
But it is switch part tronc encapsulation is dot one.

149
00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:06.130
Q that I'm using here, the switch part mode is trunk and then best practice.

150
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.730
I want to limit the V lines on this part to the ones that are actually going to be used.

151
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:19.130
So I will say switch parts tronc allowed valon and I'm going to allow my management Valon 10 and then

152
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:26.210
my vans for my wireless networks, which was 22 and 23.

153
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:33.110
And then the connection to the wireless LAN controller is not doubling back into of our switches again.

154
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.310
So I know that I'm never going to have a spiting three loop going through this part.

155
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:43.250
So I can also see spanning three part fastest to disable spidering to be on the part.

156
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.600
OK, done.

157
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.080
So that is my switchboard connected to my wireless line controller.

158
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:55.910
Don, I also need to configure the switchboard's connected to the EPT, so I will see I'm going to do

159
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.050
the same time.

160
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:06.650
So I will see interface range and they are connected to gigabit Ethernet one or three and one or four.

161
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.930
So I'll configure and move that same time.

162
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.810
I'll put a description in description.

163
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:22.500
Wireless AP and then I will see switch part mode is access.

164
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.550
And then switch part.

165
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:33.880
But can typewrite search for access, Vallon was violent when the management valon and again, I can

166
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.980
disable responding to you on here, I'll spanning three part fast, OK?

167
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.380
And that is it done.

168
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:49.720
What should be happening now is the access points are going to get your IP address from the DHP server

169
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:57.190
running here on my switch will then discover where their wireless line controller is and we should register

170
00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.450
it.

171
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.700
So let's just check that.

172
00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.890
That is working.

173
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.830
So I'll go back to my main pocket, a window here.

174
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.070
I'll go to the admin laptop, which has got connectivity to the wireless LAN controller.

175
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.860
I got my desktop and then web browser.

176
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:20.510
And I need to use https to get to the admin guey on my wireless line controller and it is got IP address

177
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.660
one thing to you to 168, dot 10, dot 11.

178
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:30.130
So I'll click on Google and then that brings me to the login page for the wireless line controller.

179
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:36.200
I'll click on login, enter in my username and password.

180
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:44.950
And that will open up the dashboard on the wireless LAN controller and in here in the Access Point summary

181
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:51.700
section, I can see that I have got two access points which are registered.

182
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.600
OK, so that is all good.

183
00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:02.350
I could also go to the access points in here on a real world wireless line controller to get more information,

184
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.870
including your IP address.

185
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.670
But this is all good and pocket tracer.

186
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.810
I can see that the apps are registered.

187
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:16.000
So now I'm ready to move on with the rest of the configuration, actually creating my W lines on the

188
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.480
wireless line controller and I'll do that in the next lecture.
