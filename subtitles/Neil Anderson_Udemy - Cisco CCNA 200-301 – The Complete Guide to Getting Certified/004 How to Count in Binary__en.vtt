00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.760
IP Addresses are written down in a decimal format.

2
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.950
But to understand how they control the logical separation between networks, it really helps if you think

3
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.310
about them the same way that a computer does, and that is in binary.

4
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.720
In this lecture, I'm going to show you how to convert decimal numbers into binary, and that's going to

5
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.970
help understand IP addressing as we work through the rest of this section.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.350
As humans, we are conditioned to count in decimal.

7
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.390
It's how we're taught to do it from a really young age,

8
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.060
and we do it now without thinking about it.

9
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.210
When we write a number down, for each column in the number, we have got 10 possible choices from 0 through

10
00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.940
to 9,

11
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.650
and every time we add a column to the left, the value is multiplied by 10.

12
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.340
We start with 1's as the furthest right column.

13
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.120
So, let me show you what I mean.

14
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.040
When we write down a number, starting from the right hand side of a number, we've got the 1's there.

15
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.230
The next column is the 10's, then we've got the 100's, then the 1000's,

16
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.790
then the 10000's, and so on.

17
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.000
So, you can see that it's being multiplied by 10 each time we add a column to the left. If we were going to write

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.400
down the number 236, the way that we do that is starting from the left now.

19
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.570
Starting with 1000's column, how many 1000 can we fit into

20
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.320
236?

21
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.510
Well, obviously, that's going to be a 0 because 236 is a smaller number than

22
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.400
1000.

23
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.820
So, we can't fit any 1000's into 236. That leaves us still with 236

24
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.580
leftover.

25
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.270
Next up, 

26
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.470
how many 100's can we fit into

27
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.320
236?

28
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.560
Well, we can fit two 100's into 236,

29
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.670
and that leaves us with 36 leftover.

30
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.390
Next up,

31
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.050
how many 10's can we fit into the 36 that was leftover?

32
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.310
We can fit three 10's into 36, that leaves us with 6 leftover,

33
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.800
and then how many 1's can we fit into 6?

34
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.670
That's obviously 6.

35
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.300
So, that gives us the number of 236. It's how we would write that down.

36
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.670
Now, like I said at the start of this lecture, that's completely obvious and intuitive to you,

37
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.220
so you may be wondering why I'm breaking it down like that.

38
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.070
Well, it's because binary is not obvious and intuitive, but it works the same way.

39
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.970
So, seeing how it works with decimal is then going to help understand and see how it works with binary.

40
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:06.040
Computers don't work in decimal. They work in binary, and electrical impulses are either off or on.

41
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.270
So there's only 2 choices, a 0 or a 1. Unlike the 10 choices that we have in decimal, which is 0 through

42
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.620
to 9, and every time we write down a number in binary for each column in the number, we've

43
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.620
got two possible choices that's 0 or 1, rather than 0-9 that we had in decimal.

44
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.000
Every time we add a column to the left, the value is multiplied by 2, rather than multiplied by 10

45
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.890
as it is in decimal. So looking at the columns in binary now, again, we've got a 1 on the furthest

46
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.340
right,

47
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.010
the same as it was in decimal.

48
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.620
Then, we multiply that by 2,

49
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.290
so the next is 2, then we've got 4,

50
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.160
then we've got 8,

51
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.340
so we just keep multiplying by 2, just doubling it each time.

52
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.130
Next would be 16, then 32, then 64, then 128, then 256,

53
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.080
then 512, and so on.

54
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.250
You saw how to write 236 in decimal before.

55
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.060
Now, let's see how it

56
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.730
write 236

57
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.310
in binary.

58
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:18.089
You can see on the slide here that the number we're going to get in the end is 11101100.

59
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.830
So really not intuitive like it is with decimal, but we do it the same way.

60
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.700
Rather than seeing how many we can fit in,

61
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.320
it's either going to be on or off, 1 or 0.

62
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.770
So starting off with 256 here, this 256 fit into 236,

63
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.320
yes or no? Well, no.

64
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.140
It doesn't.

65
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:47.930
236 is a smaller number than 256, so we can fit zero 256 into 236, and that

66
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.260
leaves us with still 236 leftover.

67
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.220
Next up, can we fit 128 in a 236 or not?

68
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.530
And the answer is yes.

69
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.430
So that gives us a 1, and we've got 108 leftover because 236

70
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.530
minus 128 is 108.

71
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.840
So, next up, does 64 fit into that 108 that was leftover or not?

72
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.690
Yes, it does,

73
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:22.100
so we put down a 1, and we've got 44 leftover because 108 minus 64 is 44.

74
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.660
Next up, does 32 fit into 44 that was leftover?

75
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.500
Yes, it does,

76
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.570
so we have a 1 again, and we've got 12 leftover now.

77
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.010
Next up, does 16 fit into 12 or not?

78
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.870
No, it doesn't,

79
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.850
so we put a 0 down, and we've still got 12 leftover. Then does 8

80
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.900
fit in 12 or not?

81
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.940
Yes, it does,

82
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.530
so that's a 1, and we've got 4 leftover. Then, does 4 fit into 4?

83
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.460
Yes, it does,

84
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.490
so we put a 1 down, and that leaves us with 0 leftover.

85
00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.080
So obviously, the other two digits are going to be a 0 and a 0 because 2 and 1 do not fit

86
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.930
into 0.

87
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.300
So you can see there that when we've got it written out,

88
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:15.490
that comes out to 11101100, that is 236 in binary. As a final check, you should always have 0

89
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.900
leftover, so if you get down to the 1 column and you've still got digits leftover there, that means

90
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.410
that you've made a mistake, so you should go back and do it again.

91
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:33.430
You can also do a final check of your answer as well, where you do add up all of the columns where you've

92
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.980
got a 1. Add them all together, and that should total up the number you were looking for.

93
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:49.160
So in our example here, we've got a 1 in the 128, a 1 in the 64, a 1 in the 32, in the 8, and in the 4.

94
00:06:49.210 --> 00:07:00.130
So if we add up 128 and 64, and 32, add 8, add 4, that equal to 236, which was the number that we were looking to

95
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.530
calculate. Okay,

96
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.640
next up, let's check that you understood that and you can do it.

97
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.340
So, what is 179 in binary? I'll pause the video here.

98
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:20.980
Write down what is 179 in binary, and I'll be back in a second to check that you got it right.

99
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.760
Okay,

100
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.860
so how did you get on?

101
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:32.300
The easiest way to do it is to get a pen and piece of paper and write the columns down exactly like

102
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:39.220
you see on the slide here, and then just go from left to right as you saw me doing it in the last example.

103
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:47.610
So figuring out 179 in binary, does 256 fit into 179, yes or no? No, it does not,

104
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:55.090
so we put down a 0, and we've still got 179 left. Then, does 128 into 179 or not?

105
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.180
Yes, it does,

106
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:02.660
so we put down a 1, and we've got 51 left. Then, does 64 fit into 51?

107
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.470
No, it does not,

108
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.030
so we put down a 0, and we've still got 51 leftover.

109
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.430
Then, does 32 fit into 51 or not?

110
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.360
Yes, it does, and 51 minus 32 is 19,

111
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.310
so we've got 19 leftover. Then, does 16 fit into 19 or not?

112
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.300
Yes, it does.

113
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.250
We put down the 1, and we've got 3 leftover. Does 8 fit into 3?

114
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.200
No, it doesn't,

115
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.010
so we put down 0, and we've still got the 3 leftover. Does 4 fit into 3?

116
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.880
No, it doesn't,

117
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.340
so again, we put down 0, and we've still got 3 leftover.

118
00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.130
Then, does 2 fit into 3?

119
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.260
Yes, it does,

120
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.289
so we put down a 1, and we've got a 1 leftover.

121
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:47.390
And finally, 1 does go into 1, so we put a 1 there, and then we've got our 0 leftover.

122
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:54.720
So, writing down 179 in binary is 10110011.

123
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.110
Okay,

124
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.760
so that's it.

125
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:02.000
That's how you convert from decimal to binary, and that's going to help as we go through the rest of

126
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.040
the section. See you in the next lecture.
