00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.990
In this lecture, you'll learn about the different Operating Systems that run on Cisco's different router

2
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.260
and switch platforms.

3
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.820
Now, you don't actually need to know this for the exam.

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.560
The exam focuses purely on IOS on Cisco routers and switches.

5
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.330
So if you're wondering why am I including this then,

6
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.410
the reason is that it's something that you would wonder about anyway,

7
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:45.490
and I want to explain to you that, by taking this course and learning how to configure Cisco IOS, it's

8
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.720
going to enable you to work on any of the different Cisco routers and switches, because, from a management

9
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.590
and administrative point of view, it's pretty much identical no matter which actual Operating System

10
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.250
you're working on.

11
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.410
So, I'll start off by giving you a bit of history.

12
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:13.060
Many people think of Cisco as being a routing and switching company, but they actually were just a purely

13
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.990
routing company when they started off.

14
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:24.670
And when they did start off, IOS was the original Operating System that they used on routers, the same

15
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.400
Operating System that's used today, although obviously it's gone through quite a few upgrades in the

16
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.790
time since Cisco started back in 1984.

17
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.920
So, they were originally a routing company. To offer switches, that was through an acquisition.

18
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:51.370
They bought Crescendo in 1993. The Catalyst switch product line came about because of that acquisition.

19
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.010
The original Operating System on the Catalyst switches was CatOS,

20
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.710
but that's been deprecated quite a long time ago now. Cisco firewalls evolved from another acquisition.

21
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.690
That was the acquisition of Network Translation back in 1995. Cisco got their PIX firewall from that,

22
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.200
which uses the Finesse Operating System.

23
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:25.460
Now, both the Catalyst switches and the originally PIX firewalls, it's now the ASA firewall,

24
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.070
were ported over to the IOS operating system over the following years.

25
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.090
So, Cisco standardized on IOS for all of their network infrastructure devices.

26
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.990
There are some other Operating Systems on some of the newer router and switch platforms, though.

27
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:58.090
IOS runs on the majority of Cisco routers and switches, but some of the newer platforms do

28
00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.800
have these new Operating Systems.

29
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
Let's look at those now.

30
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:12.430
So, on the Cisco Nexus and the MDS Data Centre switches, they run on NX-OS. On the high-end service

31
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.630
provider routers, the NCS and the CRS,

32
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.460
and also on the ASR9000 and XR12000 routers, they run on IOS-XR, and on the ASR1000

33
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:32.500
service provider routers, they run on IOS-XE. So, you're maybe thinking, "Oh well, this is going to make

34
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.200
things more difficult if there's

35
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.730
all these different Operating Systems."

36
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.990
But really, it doesn't, because all of the different Cisco Operating Systems, they are incredibly similar

37
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.040
from the Command Line point of view. If you know a command in IOS, it's probably going to be exactly the

38
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.730
same command in all of the different Operating Systems, as well. As far as administering and managing

39
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.200
them,

40
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.640
they're all nearly exactly the same.

41
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.350
So, you're maybe wondering, "Well, if managing them is exactly the same,

42
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.210
why is there the different Operating Systems?"

43
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:16.690
The main reason, and where they're different, is under the hood. IOS has got a monolithic kernel,

44
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.180
meaning that if one process running on the router crashes, it can crash the entire router. The other newer Operating

45
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.940
Systems have got microkernels, and the processes run in separate, protected memory address space.

46
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.000
So if one of the processes crashes, it shouldn't affect the running on the rest of the system.

47
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.410
These other Operating Systems are mainly on the higher-end routers and switches, but on the enterprise-grade

48
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.400
routers and switches, they're still running IOS. Now, don't think that IOS is a bad

49
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.660
or an unreliable Operating System.

50
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.450
It's been purpose-built

51
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.240
and by Cisco, who are the biggest networking company in the world, to run on enterprise-grade routers 

52
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.050
and switches.

53
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.020
So, it is very hardened. It's still very, very reliable.
