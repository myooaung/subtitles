00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.340
In this lab, we'll have a look at Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) with a lab

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:23.150
demo. Now, to start it off, I'll use the same lab again where it's Unequal Cost Paths. So we've got the topology

3
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.410
with R4 going down to R1 in the 10.0.1.0/24 network is behind

4
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:39.800
R1. And R4 can get there either via R3 or via R5 and what I've done in the lab

5
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.260
already, I've configured all the IP addresses and I've configured RIP on all the routers as well. So to

6
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.590
get to the routes behind R1, R4 is going to go via R5 because it's got a lower hop

7
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.200
count. It's only two hops via R5, it's three hops via R3.

8
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:08.300
So let's have a look at that in the lab, and if I do a 'show ip route' on R1, I'm sure that's going to

9
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.670
show my routes going back to R4. Let's have a look at R4 going to R1 so I just 'show ip

10
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.420
route' there and I can see my route for 10.0.1.0

11
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.260
is going to go via 10.1.3.2, which is on R5 and I've only got one route to get to

12
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.740
10.0.1.0 because it's a best path. It's better than the route

13
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.060
going through R3.

14
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.360
Okay,

15
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.170
so that's what happens when we've got this lab topology with Unequal Cost Paths.

16
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.560
What happens if I change the lab topology with Equal Costs? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

17
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.970
reconfigure the lab, I'm going to put in R6 in here.

18
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.700
So that way, it's going to be three hops whether we go via R3 or go via R5.

19
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:13.700
Now, at first, I'm going to leave the links on R5 as 10 megabits compared to 100 megabits fastEthernet on all of the

20
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.000
other links. And you're going to see the difference that it makes whether we're using RIP or OSPF.

21
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.550
So I'll go and reconfigure the lab

22
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.940
now, I'll see you back here in a second.

23
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.430
Okay,

24
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.780
I'm back again

25
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.970
and if we have a look at the old config you'll see that R5 was directly attached to R1 with

26
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.920
its fastEthernet3/0 interface.

27
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.170
What I've done is I put in R6 in there. So fastEthernet3/0 in R5 is now connected to R6,

28
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.210
and I've changed the subnet. I've made that a 10.1.4.0/24 subnet and R6, its fastEthernet3/0

29
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.790
interface is now got the IP address 10.0.3.2 that used to be

30
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.740
on R5. I still have the links on R5 as 10 megabits per second, the links everywhere else are

31
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.600
100 megabits. So, let's just check the differences that I made in the configuration. If we have a look

32
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.160
at R5, you see I've just changed the IP address on that link to R6. I've put it in the subnet

33
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:33.320
10.1.4.0 and on R6, I have configured it's IP address on fastEthernet0/0 going

34
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.010
back to R5, and I've configured RIP on there. I cannot just see I forgot to do something, I also

35
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.340
need to go interface fastEthernet3/0 which is connected to R1 and it's going to get

36
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:57.380
IP address 10.0.3.2 with a /24. That's the IP address that used to be on R5, and do

37
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.940
a 'no shut' on here.

38
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.220
Okay, let's just check that RIP is running everywhere.

39
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:11.610
So there are 'show ip route' on R6, it might take a minute for RIP to run on here.

40
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.149
Okay, there we go. So there's our RIP routes showing up. So now if we go and have a look on R4, before,

41
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:30.320
R4 just had that one route to the 10.0.1.0 network behind R1. Also, for the 10.0.2.0 network

42
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:38.010
behind R1 as well, but I can see it there, so 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.2.0 

43
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.510
which is one route which is going out fastEthernet2/0 interface because it was the best

44
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.430
route going down that bottom route via R5. But because I've made those changes now, both the top and

45
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.730
the bottom path are Equal Cost. They've both got the same hop count which is going to be three hops. So if I

46
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:06.730
do a 'show ip route' now, the routing protocol should have converged right now and it hasn't yet

47
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.940
I can see that I've still got one route.

48
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.770
Okay, you know what I'll do to

49
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:23.040
speed things up is I will do a 'no router rip' to disable RIP, and then, I'll enable it again. So I'll say

50
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.880
'router rip',

51
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:33.220
and it was for network 10.0.0.0 and let's see if that speed things up a bit.

52
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.790
I'll do 'show ip route' and there's the difference now. I can see that for the 10.0.1.0 network

53
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:51.360
is now going to go via two paths, 10.1.3.2, which is on R5 and 10.1.1.2,

54
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.860
which is on R3.

55
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.520
So, it's going to load balance via both of those routers.

56
00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.350
Also, I'm going to do it for the 10.0.2.0 network which is also behind R1 on the right.

57
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.980
Okay, so that just configured Equal Cost Multi Path for RIP.

58
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.670
Let's see what happens if we enable OSPF on here now.

59
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:22.100
So I'll go to my text file again, and I'll paste in a basic config for OSPF.

60
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.440
I'll do that on all of my routers.

61
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:32.580
Actually, let me just put it in a 'config t' in front of here to save me typing that every time.

62
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:47.630
Okay, so I'll copy this and paste that in on every router, so that's R1, R2, R3, R4,

63
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:55.380
R5, and R6. And let's see if it's converged yet or not.

64
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:05.370
So back on R4, I'll do a 'show ip route' and I should see the RIP routes being replaced with OSPF

65
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.090
routes, and

66
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:13.580
just come up now on R4. Again, you'll see it does take the routing protocol a little bit of time to converge

67
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.860
and there's the other neighbor,

68
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.400
so if I do a 'show ip route on here

69
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.790
now,

70
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.040
I can see that my RIP routes have been replaced with OSPF routes.

71
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.500
You saw for RIP, I had two Equal Cost Paths going through

72
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:37.270
both R3 and R5 but OSPF just put one route into the routing table for the 10.0.1.0

73
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.160
and the 10.0.2.0 networks.

74
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.170
So, why is that happening?

75
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:49.880
Well, if I go back to the topology diagram, you'll see that the links on either side of R5 are 10

76
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.270
megabits, the links along with top path are 100 megabits.

77
00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:01.460
So, these were Equal Cost when it was with RIP because it just looks at hop count but OSPF takes bandwidth

78
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.290
into account.

79
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.880
So the top path is the better path here

80
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.350
that's why it's the one that was installed into the routing table.

81
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:16.310
So if I want to get Equal Cost Multi Path here, what I can do is go onto R5 and make those links

82
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.140
100 megabits per second as well.

83
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:25.690
So let's just check what interfaces they were on, I'll do a 'show ip interface brief', they're on fastEthernet2/0

84
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.840
and fastEthernet3/0.

85
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.080
So I go to global configuration, 'interface fastEthernet2/0',

86
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:39.270
and just to check the correct command, I can do a 'do show run interface fastEthernet2/0'.

87
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.580
And I want to do a 'no',

88
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:48.860
and then in my client here, I can just select the bandwidth, right click, and it will paste that in.

89
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:54.380
So that's going to remove that manually configured bandwidth and it's going to set it back to the

90
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.250
default bandwidth of 100 megabits per second.

91
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.520
So I need to do that on fastEthernet2/0 and also on interface fastEthernet3/0, and

92
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.180
I'll put the command in there as well and I need to do that on the other sides of the link as well. So

93
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:21.710
I'll go over to R4, do a 'config t', and it's on interface fastEthernet2/0 on this side.

94
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.720
Now, let's just double check it.

95
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.100
So I'll do a 'do show run interface fastEthernet2/0', and

96
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:34.310
I can see I've got the lower bandwidth configured there as well, so I'll remove that command to set it back

97
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:40.090
to the default. And also on R6,

98
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.410
this is on interface fastEthernet0/0.

99
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.760
So I'll 'do show a run interface fastEthernet0/0.' And

100
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.490
I can see the lower bandwidth was configured there as well.

101
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.890
I'll remove it there too. I'm on the wrong prompt there,

102
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.470
so I need to go 'interface fastEthernet0/0', and I'll try that again.

103
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.770
And there we go,

104
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.640
we're done.

105
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:05.320
Okay.

106
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:10.920
So again, we might need to give this a little bit of time to converge.

107
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.500
But if I go into R4 now, so before,

108
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.480
it just had that one route going to the routes behind R1.

109
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.510
If we try a 'show ip route' now.

110
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.740
Yeah, we can see it's converged already.

111
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:33.810
So now, because it's two Equal Cost Paths, to get to 10.0.1.0/24, it can go via 10.1.3.2,

112
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:43.100
which is on R5, or 10.1.1.2, which is on R3. And also for

113
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.060
10.0.2.0/24

114
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:51.450
also behind R1, it's going to load balance the traffic over those two different paths as well.

115
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.900
Okay,

116
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.590
so that was a demonstration of our Equal Cost Multi Pathing.

117
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.860
See you in the next lecture.
