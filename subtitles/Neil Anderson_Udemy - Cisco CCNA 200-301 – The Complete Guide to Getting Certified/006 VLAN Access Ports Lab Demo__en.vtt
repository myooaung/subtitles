00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.960
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure VLAN access ports with a lab demo.

2
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.640
So, I've got a simple topology for the lab here.

3
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.830
I've got a single switch, SW1, and I've got a couple of Engineering PCs plugged in there.

4
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.460
ENG1 is plugged into port fastEthernet0/1.

5
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.720
It's got IP address 10.10.10.10, and ENG2 is plugged into fastEthernet0/2 and it's in the

6
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.250
same IP subnet with IP address 10.10.10.11. I also got a Sales PC, SALES3,

7
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.280
which is plugged into fastEthernet0/3, and it's in a different IP subnet with IP address

8
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.240
10.10.20.12.

9
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.680
Right now, I haven't done any configuration on the switch. So, I'll just show you that.

10
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.300
So I'll go on to SW1,

11
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:08.000
and if I do a 'show interface fast0/1' and then 'switchport' to see VLAN information,

12
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.570
you can see that this is configured as an access port and it's currently in the default VLAN 1.

13
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.140
And if I do a 'show vlan brief', you see that VLAN 1 is actually the only VLAN that is configured

14
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.090
on here and all ports are in VLAN 1.

15
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.040
So now, if I go on to AEngineering PC1, because all PCs are in the same VLAN and ENG2

16
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.950
is also in the same IP subnet,

17
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.410
I should have connectivity. So I'll ping it at 10.10.10.11, and you see that the ping succeeds.

18
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.540
If I try to ping the Sales PC though, which is at 10.10.20.12, this is going

19
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.260
to fail.

20
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.690
They're in the same VLAN at Layer 2, but it's in a different IP subnet at Layer 3,

21
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.180
so I would need a router to be able to route traffic between the two different IP subnets. Now let's look and

22
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.220
see what happens with broadcast traffic.

23
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.050
So I ping 10.10.10.255, which is the broadcast address for the subnet that this

24
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.440
PC is in, I see I get a reply from ENG2 at 10.10.10.11.

25
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.250
If we have a look at the lab topology, that traffic is broadcast isn't just hitting ENG2,

26
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.200
it's also hitting SALES3 as well because it's in the same VLAN. The switches are Layer 2 switches.

27
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.230
It's not Layer 3 aware. It doesn't know anything about different IP subnets, so it's flooding that

28
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.360
broadcast traffic everywhere.

29
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.710
So it's bad for performance and security, that traffic is hitting Sales PC, as well as the Engineering

30
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.370
PCs.

31
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.590
So, that's why we're going to configure our VLANs. So let's

32
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.230
do that now,

33
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.150
so I'll go back onto the switch.

34
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.460
I need to create my VLANs first, so I'll go to global configuration and I will create VLAN.

35
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.680
We were going to use VLAN number 10 for the Engineering subnet and I'm going to give it a name as

36
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.170
well,

37
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.700
'name Eng'. You always want to give your VLANs a name,

38
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.680
so if ever engineers looking at your config later, it's going to be obvious about what you've

39
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.280
configured.

40
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.700
And I'll also configure my Sales VLAN,

41
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.820
we were going to use VLAN 20 for that. So 'vlan 20' and 'name Sales'.

42
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.330
Then, the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to put my Engineering PC1 into the Engineering

43
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.490
VLAN. I'm not going to put ENG2 in there yet because I want to show you the effect of this.

44
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.460
So, ENG1 PC was on interface fastEthernet0/1.

45
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.480
I'll say 'switchport mode access', to make an access port.

46
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.960
In case you're wondering, the other type of port we can have is a trunk port. I'll cover that in the

47
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.790
next lecture.

48
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.670
So 'switchport mode access' and 'switchport access vlan 10'.

49
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.060
So if you look back at the topology diagram again, ENG1 is in VLAN 10, the other two PCs

50
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:34.010
are still in the default VLAN 1. If I go onto the command line on ENG1 and I try to ping ENG2

51
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.340
at 10.10.10.11

52
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.150
now, the command is going to fail. They're in the same IP subnet, but they're in different VLANs

53
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.300
at Layer 2,

54
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.840
and the switch does not send traffic between different VLANs.

55
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.010
So, that's why the traffic is failing.

56
00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:00.230
And if I send broadcast traffic, 'ping 10.10.10.10.255', because this PC is the only

57
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.620
thing in VLAN 10, this won't hit anything else at all.

58
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.520
This is good.

59
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.110
This was the point of doing VLANs,

60
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.510
it's to segment our broadcast domains.

61
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.370
The problem is that we want the two PCs to be in the same VLAN though.

62
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.880
Right now, we don't have any connectivity with each other.

63
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.300
So, let's fix that next.

64
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.050
So I'll go back onto the switch configuration, and

65
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:33.170
ENG2 was on interface fastEthernet 0/2, and I'll use the up arrow to put in the command 'switchport mode access'

66
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.520
and 'switchport access vlan 10'.

67
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:47.270
If I now go back onto ENG1 again, and if I try pinging the PC at 10.10.10.11 now, then

68
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.070
the ping should succeed.

69
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.090
If this fails, sometimes Packet Tracer will do this.

70
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.870
I'm using Packet Tracer for the Lab Demo, so let's just flap the interface.

71
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:09.290
So I'll go back onto the switch and I'll do a 'shut' and a 'no shutdown' on interface fastEthernet0/2 to flap it.

72
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.380
Let's just do interface fastEthernet0/1 as well while we're at it.

73
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.350
So 'shut' and 'no shut' on there,

74
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.200
and that should bring it back up again.

75
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.380
So let's try the ping again now, 'ping 10.10.10.11',

76
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.580
and it's probably just taking a minute for the interface to come back up, sinc I did a no 'shut'.

77
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:40.650
So let's give this a few seconds for the interface to come back, and I'll waffle for a few seconds

78
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.930
until it does. I might need to do another ping here.

79
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.470
So, let's just wait for this one to time out. Okay, let's ping it again, 'ping 10.10.10.11'.

80
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.730
Okay, there we go,

81
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.890
so we got the reply now.

82
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.330
So that's just a quirk in Packet Tracer. In a real world network,

83
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.920
you would not need to 'shutdown' and 'no shut' an interface because you changed the VLAN on it.

84
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.360
Okay, so that's my Engineering PCs with connectivity now.

85
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:16.530
Next thing to do, let's go back onto the switch and put the Sales PC into the correct

86
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.000
VLAN.

87
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:27.870
So that was on interface fast0/3, and I'll say 'switchport mode access' and 'switchport

88
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.050
access vlan 20'.

89
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:38.650
So looking back at the topology again, both my Engineering PCs are in VLAN 10, my Sales PC

90
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.590
is in VLAN 20, so I've completed my configuration.

91
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:50.270
Everything should be all good now. For verification, we'll go back onto the switch and I'll do a 'show

92
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:58.830
vlan brief', and you can see there's my Engineering VLAN, VLAN 10, and interfaces fast0/1 and 0/2

93
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:06.940
are there, and my Sales VLAN 20 is configured with fastEthernet0/3.

94
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.300
All of the other ports I haven't touched yet,

95
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.700
so they are still in the default VLAN 1.

96
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.550
Okay,

97
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:21.490
so that was how we configure our VLAN access ports, see you in  the next lecture for trunk ports.
