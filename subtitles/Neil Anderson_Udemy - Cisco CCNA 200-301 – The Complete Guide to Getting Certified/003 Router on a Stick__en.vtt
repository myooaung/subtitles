00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.680
In this lecture, you'll learn about our second option for inter-VLAN routing, which is Router on

2
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.310
a Stick, and out of the three options,

3
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.170
this is probably the one that you're most likely to get tested on on the CCNA exam.

4
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.830
So, make sure you understand this and know how you do the configuration for it.

5
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.030
Okay, so this is how it's going to work.

6
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.110
We've got our switch here in the middle, and we've got our access ports configured on here for our Engineering

7
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.680
VLAN PCs and our Sales PCs.

8
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.120
In the previous option, we were using a separate physical interface

9
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.220
on the router for each of our different VLANs,

10
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.530
but a problem with that is you're going to run out of interfaces.

11
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:06.160
So a way that we can resolve that is by using virtual sub-interfaces on the router, which are all on the same

12
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.600
underlying physical interface.

13
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.350
So, that's what we're doing here.

14
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.210
So going down from the router to the switch was actually just one physical interface here and one physical

15
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.900
cable.

16
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.720
The physical interface we're using on the roouter is interface fastEthernet0/1 here. So we configure

17
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.080
that interface with no IP address, but we do a 'no shutdown' on it to bring the interface up.

18
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:45.100
Then, we add the interface fastEthernet0/1.10. Just by putting in the command 'interface fastEthernet0/1.10',

19
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.530
that will create the virtual sub-interface for us.

20
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:59.390
We then specify that that sub-interface is going to be in VLAN 10 and we give it the IP address 10.10.10.1.

21
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.390
That is going to act as the default gateway address for our Engineering PCs.

22
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.530
We then also create a sub-interface for the Sales VLAN.

23
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.490
We're going to use interface fastEthernet0/1.20

24
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.150
for this example. With your sub-interfaces, it's the main physical interface name, and then a dot, and

25
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.350
then the sub-interface

26
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.750
number, and you don't have to number them sequentially, like .1, .2, .3, and so on.

27
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.670
So that's why I've used .10 and .20 here, because it's more logical.

28
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.110
It ties up with the actual VLAN number.

29
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.310
So on interface fastEthernet0/1.20,

30
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.260
I specify that that is for VLAN 20 and give it IP address

31
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.550
10.10.20.1.

32
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.010
Now, what's going to happen is my Engineering PCs,

33
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.220
when they want to send traffic to another IP subnet, I've already configured them with their default

34
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.400
gateway address of 10.10.10.1.

35
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.060
So if an Engineering PC wants to send traffic to a different subnet, it will send out an ARP request for

36
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.670
the MAC address of its default gateway.

37
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.920
The switch will forward to everything that is in the Engineering VLAN, all the other Engineering PCs, and it will also

38
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.740
get sent up the fastEthernet0/1 interface going towards the router, and we've configured that interface on

39
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.960
the switch as a trunk port.

40
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.870
So when the switch sends it up to the router, it will tag it with VLAN 10. So, it will hit the VLAN 10

41
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.510
sub-interface. The router can then reply back to the ARP request and we're going to have a routing going through

42
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.750
there.

43
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.900
So whenever the switch sends traffic up to the router, because that fastEthernet0/1 port

44
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.220
is configured as a trunk,

45
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.650
it will tag it with the Dot1Q tag. When it reaches the router, it looks at the Dot1Q tag and that's how it knows

46
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.350
which sub-interface this traffic is for.

47
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.940
So the configuration to do this, on the router, 'interface FastEthernet0/1'.

48
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.590
So I'm using a different interface

49
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.110
number here, FastEthernet0/1, for this configuration.

50
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.899
That is the physical interface that is connected to this switch. I don't need an IP address on here,

51
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.370
so I say 'no ip address'.

52
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.870
I do need to bring it up,

53
00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.610
so I say 'no shutdown'.

54
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.190
I then create my first sub-interface with the command 'interface fastEthernet0/1.10'. Because

55
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.290
it starts with fastEthernet0/1,

56
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.950
it knows it's a sub-interface attached to this physical interface,

57
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.260
and then .10 is the sub-interface number. 

58
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:45.940
'encapsulation dot1q 10', by saying that, whenever any traffic comes up and hits the interface

59
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.410
which has got a Dot1Q tag on there, if it's a Dot1Q tag 10,

60
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.260
the router knows it is for this sub-interface.

61
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.000
Whenever I send traffic in the other direction, sending it down to the switch,

62
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.250
when it comes from this sub-interface, I will tag it again with Dot1Q tag 10.

63
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.590
I put my IP address on here,

64
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.120
IP address 10.10.10.1 with a /24 mask. So, that is my Engineering VLAN sub-interface configured.

65
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.560
I do exactly the same config for my Sales VLAN sub-interface.

66
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:25.540
So 'interface FastEthernet0/1.20', 'encapsulation dot1q 20' for the Sales VLAN,

67
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.940
'ip address 10.10.20.1 21 255.255.255.0'.

68
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.190
If I just go back a slide,

69
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.360
you see we've got the connection to the Wide Area Network (WAN) again available

70
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:44.170
out interface FastEthernet0/2 with IP address 203.0.113.1.

71
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.390
The next hop address in our example is 203.0.113.2.

72
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.120
I want my PCs on the inside to be able to get outside the Local Area Network (LAN) as well,

73
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.240
so that's why I'm configuring a static default route here.

74
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.180
So the command is 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

75
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.870
the next hop address of 203.0.113.2.

76
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.150
Okay, that's the entire router configuration. I need to put a matching configuration on the other side of the

77
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.470
link on the switch.

78
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.310
So on the switch, I say 'interface FastEthernet0/1', 'switchport mode trunk'. So now,

79
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.840
whenever this switch sends any traffic up to the router, it will tag it with the Dot1Q tag,

80
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.080
so then it will hit the correct sub-interface on the router.

81
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.440
Some considerations here, you don't need a separate physical interface for every VLAN. So this

82
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.050
is better than option 1 where we did that,

83
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.780
you're less likely to run out of interfaces here.

84
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.220
However, traffic being routed within the campus still has to go up and down a physical Ethernet cable

85
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.700
to the router.

86
00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.910
In here, you've got traffic for multiple VLANs all using the same cable,

87
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.720
so there's more contention for bandwidth than when we were using separate interfaces in option 1.

88
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:17.760
Okay, so that's the theory. Next up, let's configure this in the lab. We've got the same topology as in the

89
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.770
last lecture when we did option 1.

90
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:25.080
The only differenc is we've only got one link going between the switch and the router here.

91
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.370
Again, I've already configured all of the Layer 2 configuration.

92
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.260
So I've configured my trunking going through from SW1 to SW3,

93
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:41.820
and I've configured my access ports and put the correct PC into the correct VLAN.

94
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.980
So if I go onto my ENG1 PC, you can see it can ping other Eng PCs,

95
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:56.880
so I can ping 10.10.10.11, the other PC on the same switch, and ping 10.10.10.12

96
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.750
over on SW3.

97
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.780
But if I tried to ping a Sales PC, this isn't going to work because I haven't configured the routing

98
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.200
yet.

99
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.370
So, let's do that now.

100
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.330
I'll configure the router first.

101
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.010
So again, I need to open this on Packet Tracer.

102
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.260
I'll open up R1,

103
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.570
go to the command line,

104
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:31.280
and go to global configuration. So the switch is attached to interface fastEthernet0/0 here,

105
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:38.630
'no ip address' is the default anyway, and I need to do a 'no shutdown' to bring the physical interface up.

106
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:47.890
Then I'll create my first sub-interface, so 'interface fastEthernet0/0.10', and then I will say 

107
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.700
'encapsulation dot1q 10'.

108
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:59.660
The IP address 10.10.10.1, with a /24 subnet mask.

109
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.140
I don't need to do a 'no shut' here because it's a virtual interface.

110
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.950
As long as the underlying physical interface is up, this will be up too. I need to configure my sub-interface

111
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.310
for the Sales VLAN as well.

112
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.270
So that's also an interface fastEthernet0/0 and it's going to be .20.

113
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:30.050
I'll say 'encapsulation dot1q 20' and 'ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0'.

114
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.260
I'm also going to do my default static

115
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.400
route to allow them to route out to the WAN as well.

116
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.850
So 'ip route

117
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.420
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

118
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:47.510
the next hop was 203.0.113.2.

119
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.780
Okay, that is my router config done.

120
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.960
Next up, I need to configure a matching configuration on the other side of the link,

121
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.000
so that was on SW2. On SW2, at global config,

122
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.730
the router is connected to interface fastEthernet0/1 here and I need to say 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q',

123
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.920
and 'switchport mode trunk'.

124
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.570
Okay, that's all the configuration done. All I need to do now is test it.

125
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:30.330
So I'll go back on to ENG1 and let's try pinging the Sales PC that's on the same switch

126
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:30.670
here.

127
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.440
So that was 10.10.20.12

128
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.240
and it will probably miss a few pings

129
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.820
while the interfaces and everything's coming up and it's doing the ARP,

130
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.020
so let's just wait for this.

131
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:53.520
In real-world, it's probably going to be successful a bit quicker, this is because I'm using Packet

132
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.610
Tracer here. So looks like maybe all the pings are going to fail,

133
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.460
let's try it again,

134
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.240
and there we go.

135
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.760
The ping is working now.

136
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:11.900
Let's try pinging 10.10.20.10 over on the switch on the other side of the network,

137
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.930
and this should hopefully work fine too.

138
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.870
Yeah, there we go.

139
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.820
That's all good.

140
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:26.930
So that was the theory and configuration and verification for Router on a Stick.

141
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:33.500
See you in the next lecture, for the last option which is using a Layer 3 switch.
