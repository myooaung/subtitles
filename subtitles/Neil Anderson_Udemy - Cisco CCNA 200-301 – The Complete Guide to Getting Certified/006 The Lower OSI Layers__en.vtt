00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:15.460
In this lecture, you'll learn about the bottom four OSI Layers. Where network engineers are not typically

2
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.630
very concerned with the top three layers,

3
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.180
we are very concerned with the bottom four layers.

4
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.700
This is really bread and butter stuff for us.

5
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.080
Each of these bottom four layers are so important that they're going to have their own dedicated section

6
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.870
later on in the course.

7
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.800
Here, I'm going to focus on giving you the definitions which you're going to need to know for the exam.

8
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.110
So the first of the bottom four layers, we'll start with Layer 4, which is with Transport Layer.

9
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:59.080
The main characteristics of this layer, are whether TCP or UDP transport is going to be used, and the port

10
00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.670
number.

11
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.470
Now, if you don't know anything about TCP or UDP or port numbers already, don't worry about it too much

12
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.530
for now because we're gonna be covering this in the dedicated section for Layer 4 later.

13
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.300
For now, you just need to know that if we want the communication between the two hosts to be reliable,

14
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.980
then we'll use TCP.

15
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.860
If speed is more important than reliability, like for voice or video of traffic, then we'll use UDP

16
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.700
instead.

17
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.130
The other main characteristic at this layer is the port number.

18
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.620
For example, port number 80

19
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.600
for HTTP web traffic, port number 25 for SMTP email.

20
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.590
Now, there is quite a lot of other information also in the Layer 4 header, but we'll talk about that when

21
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.450
we get to that particular section in the course.

22
00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.810
The definition for Layer 4, the Transport Layer defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble

23
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.280
the data for individual communications between the end devices.

24
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.040
It breaks down large files into smaller segments that are less likely to incur transmission problems.

25
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.550
The next layer is Layer 3, the Network Layer.

26
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.510
The most important information at the Network Layer is the source and destination IP address.

27
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.130
Again, there's a lot of other information also carried in the Layer 3 header, but we'll talk about that

28
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.530
when we get to the later section. Routers are Layer 3 devices.

29
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.640
They operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model, and the definition of the Network Layer, it provides connectivity

30
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.450
and path selection between two host systems

31
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.100
that may be located on geographically separated networks. The Network Layer is the layer that manages

32
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:05.920
the connectivity of hosts by providing logical addressing. IP addressing is our logical addressing.

33
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.450
Next layer is Layer 2, the Data Link Layer.

34
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.930
The most important information here is the source and destination Layer 2 address.

35
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.260
Again, just like with Layer 3 and 4, there is other information also included in the Layer 2 header.

36
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.130
For example, the source and destination MAC address if Ethernet is the Layer 2 technology. Different Layer 2

37
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.190
technologies use different formats for their addressing. For example, old legacy Frame Relay uses

38
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.290
DLCI or DLCI numbers for the addressing. With Ethernet, which is what is always used in our Local

39
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.130
Area Networks, it's the MAC address that is used here. Switches operate at

40
00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:01.450
Layer 2. Our switches are Layer 2 aware devices. The definition for Data Link Layer, it defines how

41
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.430
data is formatted for transmission and how access to the physical media is controlled.

42
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.450
It also typically includes error detection on correction to ensure a reliable delivery of the data.

43
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.990
And finally, we have Layer 1, the Physical Layer.

44
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.270
This concerns literally the physical components of the network.

45
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.310
For example, the actual physical cables being used. Definition of the Physical Layer, it enables bit transmission,

46
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:40.120
the 1s and 0s, between end devices. It defines specifications needed for activating, maintaining, and

47
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.580
deactivating the physical link between end devices. For example, voltage levels, physical data rates, maximum

48
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.800
transmission distances, and physical connectors, etc.

49
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.590
Okay,

50
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.670
so there you have it.

51
00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.650
That was the quick overview and mainly the definition of the bottom four layers. As we go through the

52
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.470
rest of the course, we'll be covering those in much more detail.
