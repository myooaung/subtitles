00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:14.000
In this lecture, you're going to learn about IOS configuration management, and the running configuration,

2
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.720
and the startup configuration.

3
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.440
So, I'm going to mix some configuration commands to demonstrate this for you.

4
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.510
I'm going to go to global configuration, so I enter 'config t'. Notice right now that I've just got the default

5
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:39.500
set up in this example, where the hostname is Router. If I enter the command 'hostname Router1' and hit Enter,

6
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.660
you'll see that the hostname changes immediately.

7
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.380
So in IOS,

8
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.210
whenever you make a change, the change takes effect immediately.

9
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.560
When you make the change, it goes into the running configuration, which is the configuration that

10
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.510
is in effect right now.

11
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.750
But as well as having the running configuration, we've also got the startup configuration.

12
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.010
Running configuration is the configuration in effect right now. The startup configuration is the configuration that

13
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:21.770
will go into effect when the router is next started or rebooted. And commands that you entered in the

14
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:30.920
running configuration do not get saved permanently until you explicitly copy them from the running configuration

15
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.690
to the startup configuration.

16
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.110
You can see here I entered the command 'hostname Router1'. That went into the running configuration immediately,

17
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.290
and my hostname was immediately changed to Router1.

18
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:52.460
But if I now do a 'show startup-config', now I notice my not so deliberate mistake, I'm at global configuration,

19
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.200
so I can't enter a 'show' command.

20
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.210
I told you, you'd make that mistake a lot,

21
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.480
right?

22
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.240
I still make that mistake too. So I hit Ctrl+A, and make that a 'do show start',

23
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410
and let's do Tab completion to check what the command should be.

24
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.840
So the full command is 'show startup-config',

25
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.410
I'll hit Enter, and notice here

26
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.960
that the hostname is still Router.

27
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.130
It hasn't changed to Router1. So in the startup configuration,

28
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.110
it's still hostname Router.

29
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.920
If I now do a 'do show running-config',

30
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.210
I can see in the running configuration that the hostname is Router1.

31
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.160
So if I now reloaded the router, it would come back, and the change would not have taken effect.

32
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.500
Now, this is actually deliberate because it allows you to back out of mistakes.

33
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.000
Say, if I made some changes on the router, and I made some catastrophic changes, but I hadn't saved it

34
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.360
yet.

35
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.290
The easiest thing to do is to just pull the power of the router and then plug it back in again.

36
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.310
Boot it up, and it will come back with the configuration

37
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.160
it was already on there before I'd made those changes.

38
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.190
Now, obviously, that's a fairly drastic thing to do.

39
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.010
It requires a reboot on the router.

40
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.650
So you would only do that as a, really, a last resort.

41
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.560
Okay, so I've changed the name of my router to Router1 in my running configuration.

42
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.690
I haven't copied it to the startup configuration yet, though,

43
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.850
so it's not going to be persistent across a reboot. To do that,

44
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.720
the command is 'copy run start', and again, I'm at the wrong command level.

45
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.100
So, I'll 'end' to drop back down to the enable prompt. To do your 'copy run start' command, you have to be

46
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.880
at the privilege exec mode. So, I can now do a 'copy run start'.

47
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.120
It will ask me the destination filename I want to save it to. Pretty much always,

48
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.850
we're going to accept the default here and just hit Enter.

49
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.570
It will take a few seconds to build the configuration, and I get the "OK" message telling me that, "Yes, it's

50
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.370
being copied to the startup configuration."

51
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:10.880
So if I now do my 'show startup-config' command again, you'll see that the hostname is now Router1 in

52
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.750
there as well.

53
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.070
So, it's permanent.

54
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.079
If I reboot the router now, it's going to come up with that as the configuration.

55
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.520
The next thing I want to show you is how to back up your configuration.

56
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.830
Now, Cisco do have tools like Cisco Prime Infrastructure that can be used to automate this

57
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.030
from a centralized server. That's not tested on the exam, by the way, but you can also back up manually

58
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.570
as well.

59
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.280
The way to do that is I'm going to copy the running configuration.

60
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.000
I'll hit the question mark '?' now to see where I can copy it to,

61
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.000
and you'll see one of the options here is flash, which is flash memory on the router.

62
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.330
So I can do a 'copy running-config' to 'flash', and I have to give it a file name

63
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.820
when I do this, so I enter a colon ':' and I'll call it 'my-config'.

64
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.140
Try to do it without a typo,

65
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.920
there we go.

66
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.940
It'll say, "What I want the destination filename to be?"

67
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:20.100
Yes, I want it to be called my-config, and I've now backed up my configuration to flash. To verify that,

68
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.550
I can try a 'show flash',

69
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.940
and there you see, I've got my configuration is in there.

70
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.830
If I wanted to restore from this backup, the way I do it is by copying it to the startup configuration

71
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.240
and then rebooting.

72
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.500
But when you do a copy, it's going to actually merge the commands rather than replace,

73
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.740
and typically, I would want to replace the entire startup configuration.

74
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.320
So the way I do that is, first off, I erase the startup configuration.

75
00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:01.440
So I enter the command 'erase start', it's telling me an "Incomplete command." So, let's use the context

76
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.480
sensitive help. To help, we hit the up arrow, space, question mark '?',

77
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.400
and it tells me "Unrecognized command."

78
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.240
Okay, this is because I'm working on an older router here.

79
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.600
So in an older router, the command is 'write erase',

80
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.150
and that will tell me it's going to erase the NVRAM file system, which is where the startup configuration

81
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.760
is saved.

82
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.010
"Do I want to confirm?" I hit Enter to confirm that,

83
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.280
and that will erase my startup configuration.

84
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:38.730
I can now 'copy flash:my-config' to the startup configuration. Confirm that, and I would

85
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.420
now reboot the router to come back up with that configuration.

86
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:49.770
Now, hopefully, you're thinking it's not a very good idea to back up the configuration to flash on this router

87
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.100
because if the entire router blows up, I'll lose the router, and I'll lose my backup as well.

88
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.990
It's always a bad idea to back up a device to the same device.

89
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.700
You want to back it up somewhere else.

90
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.420
So, the easiest way to do that would be to copy the running configuration to a TFTP server.

91
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.360
So, I copy it on TFTP and hit Enter.

92
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.220
It will then ask me for the IP address of my TFTP server.

93
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.890
Let's say this is at 10.10.10.10,

94
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.650
I hit Enter. Then, the name of the filename I want to use,

95
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.360
let's say I'm going to use router1-config, and then I could enter today's date in here.

96
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.970
Let's say

97
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:40.230
that's the date and hit Enter. And it will then connect to the TFTP server and back up the configuration there

98
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.400
as a text file.

99
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.640
I'm getting an error message because I don't actually have a TFTP server in the lab here. While I'm saying

100
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.870
that it will show up as a text file,

101
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.490
another thing you might wonder is, "How do I check what the actual contents of my backup are?" If it's

102
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.380
safe to flash,

103
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.210
the way that you can do that is using the 'more' command.

104
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:07.890
So I would enter the command "more flash:my-config",

105
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:13.920
and that will print out here what the contents of that configuration file are.

106
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:21.750
The last thing that I need to tell you here is where the different configuration files are stored.

107
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:29.310
Now, for the device to boot up, it needs to initially load the IOS operating system image,

108
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.590
and that is stored in Flash.

109
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:40.020
Once the operating system is up and running, then it will load your actual administrator configuration

110
00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.830
from the startup configuration, and the startup configuration is stored in NVRAM.

111
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.090
That's non-volatile memory,

112
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.170
so it's persistent

113
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:58.590
across a reboot. The running configuration is stored in normal memory, in RAM, and it's loaded into RAM

114
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.670
memory from the startup configuration when the device boots up.

115
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.950
Okay, that's it.

116
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.460
See you in the next lecture.
