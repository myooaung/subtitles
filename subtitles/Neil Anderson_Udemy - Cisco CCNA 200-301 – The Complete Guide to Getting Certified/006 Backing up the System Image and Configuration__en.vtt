00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:15.870
In this lecture, you'll learn about backing up the IOS system image and your config file on your router

2
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.790
or switch.

3
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:27.540
You can back up either to an external FTP, or TFTP server, or to a USB stick, or you can back up to Flash

4
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.100
in the device.

5
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:38.010
The reasons you would want to do a backup, you could backup the system image to an off box TFTP server

6
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.160
so that if you need to recover the image later, it saves you downloading it again from the Cisco

7
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.050
website. It's going to be handy,

8
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.680
they're already on your TFTP server.

9
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.150
Obviously, there is no point in backing up the system image to Flash. It's there in Flash already anyway.

10
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.760
Reasons we would take a copy of the backup config is if we want to roll back to that later on. We could

11
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.020
again take a copy to an off box location, or it might be more convenient just to do it to Flash

12
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:21.000
in that case. If you do want to restore an old version of the configuration file, you can't just copy

13
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.530
it into the startup or running-config because if you do that, it will be merged.

14
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.370
It's not going to replace it,

15
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.480
and if we want to restore, we're going to want to do a replacement, not a merge.

16
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.410
So the way that you do that is you, first off, factory reset the device.

17
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.010
You then copy that old config into the startup-config and then reboot, and then you're back with that

18
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950
old config.

19
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.240
Okay,

20
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:57.710
the different commands to take a copy of our system image or to take a copy of our config file,

21
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.660
some examples, we could do 'copy flash

22
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.650
tftp'. The IOS system image is in Flash, so that's the command

23
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.210
you would use to backup the system image.

24
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.030
We could do a 'copy running-config

25
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.490
tftp' to save a copy of our config off box on a TFTP server.

26
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.110
Another example is 'copy startup-config usb'. Okay, so

27
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.140
let's have a look at some examples in a lab environment. With the lab,

28
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.540
I've got a router at 10.10.10.1, and I've got a TFTP server at 10.10.10.10

29
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.970
First couple of things I'll do is I'll back up the system image and the running-config

30
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:54.390
to the TFTP server. So let's go on to our router first, and if I do a 'show flash' here,

31
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.770
you can see that the system image is

32
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.320
c2900-universalk9-mz is what it starts with.

33
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.900
I just want to show you that it's not already on the TFTP server, so I'll go into TFTP server, and you

34
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.750
can see there's no file already there that starts with c2900. So,

35
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.510
I want to have a backup of this system image onto the TFTP server. The way I do that is back on my

36
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.510
router,

37
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.020
I say 'copy flash

38
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.340
tftp'. It will ask me for the source file name.

39
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.060
I'm going to copy and paste that from the 'show flash' output.

40
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.370
Then the address of the remote host is my TFTP server that is at 10.10.10.0.

41
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.220
I want to use the same file name on the TFTP server as well, so I hit Enter, and I can see that it goes

42
00:03:49.230 --> 00:04:01.230
copying the file over to the TFTP server. If I now go back onto the TFTP server again and just refresh

43
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.110
this, so go back to the Services and TFTP,

44
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.350
I can see the file is now on my TFTP server.

45
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.120
Okay, so that's how you take a backup copy of your system image. If you wanted to take a backup copy

46
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:26.190
in your config, I'll go back on the router again. And for this, I will do a 'copy run tftp'. It will copy

47
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.320
my running configuration there.

48
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.830
It will ask me where the remote host is again, the TFTP server is at 10.10.10.10. Then, it will ask

49
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.420
me what I want to call the file name.

50
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.790
I will call this R1-Monday because it's a Monday here today. It's a good idea to put the actual

51
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.500
date on there.

52
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.500
Obviously, a bit more specific than just Monday. Hit enter.

53
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.850
It's a really small file, so it takes next to no time to copy.

54
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:04.050
If I go back on the TFTP server and refresh this again, you can see there is the backup of my configuration.

55
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:14.790
Okay, so that's how you back up to a TFTP server. Next one, let's take a backup to Flash and then restore

56
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.120
it.

57
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:24.570
So I'll go back on the router, and I'll do a 'show flash', and you can see that I don't have any backup files

58
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.570
in there right now. So, I'll do a copy-

59
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.150
Actually, let's show you the change happening.

60
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:45.330
So I'm on hostname R1 right now, and I will take a backup of my running-config. So I'll say 'copy

61
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:57.620
run flash', and let's call this R1-Lab for the file name.

62
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.280
Okay,

63
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:06.460
and now I will go to global configuration, and I will change my hostname to R2.

64
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.670
Now, I haven't saved it to the startup-config yet.

65
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:19.140
So if I wanted to get it back to R1, I could just do a reboot. But as soon as I do a 'copy run start',

66
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:26.400
that hostname is now in both the running-config and the startup-config. So I do a 'show run', I can see my

67
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:36.140
hostname is R2, and if I do a 'show start', the hostname is R2 there as well. Let's say, I don't

68
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.180
like this new config, and I want to get back to the old config. Really, in the real world, where this is

69
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:50.190
useful is in a lab or a test environment. So say that you want to do some lab exercises, and then you

70
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.740
want to be able to easily go back to the startup-config for the start of that lab.

71
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.710
What you do is you set up the starting configuration and then save a copy of it to Flash, and then you

72
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:08.250
can then go on make whatever changes you want. Then to get back to the startup-config again,

73
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:15.480
what you do is you do a 'write erase' to erase the startup-config.

74
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.480
So when I do a 'show start', you'll see that the startup-config is gone.

75
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:31.990
Then what I'll do is 'show flash', just to check the name of my backup config, and I'm going to do a 'copy flash start'.

76
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.010
The source file name,

77
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:44.660
I will copy and paste. So I will paste that in, it was R1-Lab. The destination file name is going to be the

78
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.310
startup-config.

79
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:56.580
And now, if I do a 'reload' when it comes back up again with a little bit of luck, it's going to be with

80
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:02.570
the original configuration, and the hostname is going to be R1.

81
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.550
So there you go,

82
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.860
that works just fine.

83
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.560
Okay,

84
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:14.240
so that is how you backup your running or your startup-config to an off box server,

85
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:21.390
how you can also take a backup of your config to Flash, and how to restore from that if you need to later on.

86
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.010
See you in the next lecture.
