00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.850
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure the OSPF router ID,

2
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.270
passive interfaces, and how to do default route

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.270
injection with a lab demo.

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.510
So in our lab topology, we've got the usual 5 routers, R1 to R5, and R4 is connected out

5
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:36.170
to the Internet on interface FastEthernet3/0, with IP Address 203.0.113.1.

6
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.930
So let's go onto R4, and check what the router ID is right now.

7
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850
So I'll do a 'show ip protocols',

8
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.130
and I can see that the router ID is 203.0.113.1.

9
00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.970
If I do a 'show ip interface brief', I see that I don't have any loopback interfaces configured on here.

10
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.330
So it's taken the highest IP address, which is

11
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.830
203.0.113.1.

12
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.940
So, it's bad practice to have that.

13
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.260
It's better to use a loopback or to manually set the router ID. So let's configure

14
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.610
a loopback first, so I'll go 'config t', then 'interface loopback 0',

15
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.630
and I'll give it an IP address 1.1.1.1,

16
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.400
255.255.255.255 as the subnet mask. It's a loopback, so I don't need to do a 'no shutdown'. It's 'no shutdown'

17
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.640
automatically.

18
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.420
If I do a 'show ip protocols', you're going to see that the router ID has not changed.

19
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.700
What happens is when the router boots up or when OSPF starts, it checks to see what is the highest loopback

20
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.640
or physical IP address

21
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.250
if the router ID is not being manually set.

22
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.380
But if you change this later by adding a loopback, it's not going to automatically update it.

23
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.650
So, we can force was to update by restarting OSPF. Let's do a 'show run | section ospf' just so I

24
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.090
can be able to copy and paste this back in, and I'm going to copy my current OSPF configuration. And then at global

25
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.620
config,

26
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.090
I'll do a 'no router ospf 1' and then paste the config back in. So, that will stop and start

27
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.220
OSPF on here.

28
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.830
Again, obviously, don't do this in a production environment because you would lose routes. I'll then 'end',

29
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.190
and if I do a 'show ip protocols' now, I'll see the router ID

30
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.030
has updated to the loopback

31
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.400
Other way that you can manipulate the router ID is by setting it manually.

32
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.780
So to do that, in global configuration,

33
00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.610
I go 'router ospf 1' and then, 'router-id' and let's give it 2.2.2.2.

34
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.320
And with OSPF,

35
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.370
I'm going to have to restart OSPF again, so I can reload or I can do a 'clear ip ospf process' command.

36
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.990
That's similar to removing and then re-enabling the config. So you saw with EIGRP, when I set the router ID,

37
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.850
it took effect immediately, but with OSPF, if I now do a 'show ip protocols', it's still using the

38
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.400
loopback address. So I can restart OSPF, I'll just copy and paste this in. So I'll 'clear ip ospf process'.

39
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.790
At the enable prompt, it will ask me to verify because again, this would be disruptive, and I'll say yes.

40
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:55.200
And now, if I do a 'show ip protocols', I'll see that it has taken that new router ID. You can see

41
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.930
it was disruptive, because you see the adjacency went down and then came back up again.

42
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.990
Okay, so that's how you configure the router ID. The next thing,

43
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.270
if we have a look back at the topology diagram, you see on interface FastEthernet3/0,

44
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:22.940
we've got the 203.0.113.0/24 network, and that is not currently being advertised in OSPF.

45
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.330
I want to advertise that to my routers on the inside,

46
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.760
so routers R1, R2, R3, and R5, but I don't want to give out internal routing

47
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.990
information to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) router.

48
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.310
So, I'm going to make interface FastEthernet3/0 a passive interface.

49
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:54.270
So let's go back onto R4 again, and if I do a 'show run | section ospf', you'll see that I've just

50
00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.700
got a network command right now for the 10.0.0.0 networks, so that is not being advertised in OSPF yet.

51
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.830
And if I go on to another router, and do a 'show ip route', you'll see there's no route there for the

52
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.920
203.0.113.0/24 network.

53
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.090
So. I want R1 and my other internal routers to learn this. So on R4,

54
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.620
I'll go to global configuration, 'router ospf 1', and I will say,

55
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.380
let me just do a 'do show ip interface brief' just to double check what the interface was.

56
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.780
Okay, it was on interface FastEthernet3/0. So still in the OSPF config,

57
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.700
I'll say 'passive-interface FastEthernet 3/0',

58
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.360
and then I need to put in the network command, so that it will be advertised

59
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:51.220
internally. So, it's 'network 203.0.113.0' the wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255,

60
00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:01.750
and area 0. And if I now go back into another router and do a 'show ip route', if it's converged

61
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.340
yet, yes, there it is.

62
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.790
I can see that that is now being learned by my other internal routers, but it's not going to send any information

63
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.060
out. Okay,

64
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.230
last thing is I want to do static default route

65
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.640
injection into OSPF. So it's back on R4 again, it's connected out to that Service Provider.

66
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.940
So on R4, I will do an 'ip route',

67
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.840
so a static route, for everything that doesn't have a more specific route, so 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0,

68
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:40.190
and the next hop address is 203.0.113.2.

69
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.540
And I don't want to have to configure a static route on all my other routers. I want them to learn

70
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.250
it dynamically, so under 'router ospf 1',

71
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:59.400
I'll say 'default-information originate', and that will inject that default static route into OSPF.

72
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.540
So then I go onto R1, and do a 'show ip route' here,

73
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.450
you see the routing table was updated.

74
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.780
It's got that default route, which was learned from OSPF.

75
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.710
Okay, so that was our OSPF advanced topics in the lab.

76
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.620
See you in the next lecture.
