00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.280
In this lecture, I'll tell you about the study plan. Before I show you it, let me tell you why I've included

2
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.710
this. So quite a long time ago, I was working for a big oil company, and I was based out of an office

3
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:31.250
in Aberdeen in Scotland, and we had the whole floor to the IT department made up of different teams.

4
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.730
So, I was in the corner with the networking team.

5
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.560
We had the server team over my left, and help desk was over in the other corner, and I used to speak to

6
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.350
the people on help desk every day because tickets would come in, and if it was a networking issue, they'd

7
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.500
come over and tell me about it, and we would work it out.

8
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.880
So a lot of the people on the help desk, they want to get on the networking team because it had higher pay.

9
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.620
It was seen as a better position.

10
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.610
And one day, one of the guys on help desk said to me,

11
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.820
"So, how do I get on the networking team?

12
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.140
How did you do it?"

13
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.120
So, I explained that really a lot of it was down to having the certification,

14
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.220
and I said the best thing that he can do is get his CCNA.

15
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.140
So, he said, "Okay, how do I do that?"

16
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.310
So, then I didn't have a training course at the time, but I knew where I got all the resources,

17
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700
so I laid it all for him.

18
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.620
I got all the material. All the things that I'd wasted time, doing stuff that wasn't that useful,

19
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.590
I cut all that out and I just told him exactly what he needed to do,

20
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.440
laid it all out for him. Anyway, I let him go away and do it.

21
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.570
I said, "Any questions, come and ask me,"

22
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.790
and about a month later, I asked how he was getting on with his studies. And he said, "Oh! Well, actually,

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.350
I haven't started yet."

24
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.810
So I said, "What?"

25
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.470
And he said, "Yeah, well you know EastEnders is being really good this month," and if you're not from the

26
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.770
UK, you probably don't know what EastEnders is.

27
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.669
It's a popular soap opera over there. Anyway, I was really disappointed because I put

28
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.900
all this work in to try to help him, and he hadn't done anything with it.

29
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.990
Now, you've already watched the videos this far,

30
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.890
so you're doing better than a lot of people.

31
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.280
But I want to make sure that you stay on track because, really, the biggest buzz I get from doing this

32
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.150
is when you succeed. After you've done this, you pass your CCNA, send me an e-mail, let me know that

33
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.270
you've got it, and really I'll be super happy for you.

34
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.500
I really want to help you get there. So, a way that we can help keep you on track is with this study plan.

35
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.840
So, you see I've got to open here and on this page, it's a breakdown of all of the lectures all the sections

36
00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.740
that make up the course, and I've put them into a sample timetable which gives you an idea of how long

37
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.310
it will take to get to your exam date. So, you can use my one here if you want.

38
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.420
If you follow this one, it's quite intensive.

39
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.810
It'll take you maybe a couple of hours a night something like that, and then it'll take you about 6

40
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.390
weeks to get your CCNA. So you can see it's a lot of work, but if it wasn't a lot of work, it wouldn't

41
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.840
really have any value to it.

42
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.050
But, you're doing this work and getting it. That's how you're proving your value to employers, and that's

43
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.300
how you're going to really build your career.

44
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.350
So, this is if you want to do over 6 weeks,

45
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.990
but what to do is you see I've got the next couple of pages are blank so you can fill your own

46
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.460
timetable in here based on my template.

47
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.340
Now, don't fill it all in right at the start because, for sure, some things will come up, and it may

48
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.620
knock you back a few days.

49
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.760
So, what I suggest is fill in 1 week at a time. Make it quite hard to do it, but doable, and then try to

50
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.850
do it. And then, at the start of the next week, see where you are and fill in your planned timetable for

51
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.990
that week, and really it's going to help you get your CCNA quicker. Things will come up like maybe it's

52
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.070
your friend's birthday. If it's your friend's birthday, skip that day.

53
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.390
Life's too short.

54
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:26.010
some things are more important. So, this will help you minimize those skip days and get your CCNA as

55
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.210
quickly as possible.

56
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.470
Okay,

57
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.920
you can download it in the extra material for this lecture.

58
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.070
I hope you find it useful.
