00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.210
In this lecture, we're going to look at the lab example for static routing.

2
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.300
I've got my three routers R1, R2, and R3.

3
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.170
You can see the IP addresses that are configured on there, in the diagram on the screen I'm not going to read

4
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.620
you all the IP addresses,i t would take ages. And I've got my three PCs as well,

5
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.950
and what we're going to do is we're going to configure static routes between the different routers and then

6
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
test connectivity between the PCs.

7
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.250
So, let's have a look at the lab.

8
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.920
I've already configured the IP addresses on everything. So PC1 has got IP address 10.1.0.10,

9
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.520
PC2 is already configured 10.0.2.10 and PC3

10
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.350
10.1.1.10.

11
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:11.040
If we look at R1, I've already added the IP addresses which is added my connected and local routes

12
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.590
to the routing table and also the IP addresses are already pre-configured on R2, and also on

13
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.040
R3.

14
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.000
Okay, let us go back and look at the lab topology again, I'll have to go back a few times as we're doing

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.950
this to check and see what we need to add routes to. So let's do R1 first, R1 is connected to all

16
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.570
of the routes around R1. It's going to need a route to 10.1.0.0, which is behind R2,

17
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.680
and to 10.1.1.0 which is behind R3.

18
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.100
So the first route we need to add is 10.1.0.0 and that's going to be reachable on

19
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:11.070
10.0.0.2. Okay, so let's go back and add that, that was on R1. You know what I'm going to do is I'll minimize

20
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:19.280
this window just to make a bit easier to see what we're doing. Okay,

21
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.930
so that should be a bit easier.

22
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.520
So the command to add a static route is 'ip route'. I need to be at global config first, and the command is gonna be 'ip

23
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.190
route 10.1.0.0',

24
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:44.670
which is behind R2. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the next hop address is the

25
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:53.060
fastEthernet0/0 interface on R2, which is at 10.0.0.2. Okay, so that's my first

26
00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.130
route added and then I need to add a route also to 10.1.1.0. Again, I'm always using a subnet

27
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.840
mask of 255.255.255.0 just to make it easier to see what we're doing.

28
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:15.390
And again, it's reachable through R2. I don't point it directly at R3, and the IP address on the directly

29
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.370
connected interface on the R2 side is again 10.0.0.2.

30
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.620
Okay,

31
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.770
so I have now configured routes from R1 going to those networks behind R2 and R3.

32
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.680
But if I go back down to the enable prompt now, if I ping 10.1.0.1, even do my router

33
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.650
has got a route to get there, this is going to time out.

34
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.690
The reason is that a ping checks that the traffic can get there and get back again as well.

35
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.510
So the traffic on R1, let me show you how to double check this.

36
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.520
So, let's go on to R3.

37
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.420
Okay,

38
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:08.580
so I'm on R3 here, which is going to be receiving the pings. And I'm going to 'debug ip icmp' because

39
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.240
ping uses ICMP, the Internet Control Message Protocol, again we'll be talking about how ping works more

40
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.920
in a later section.

41
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.680
This is going to show me the pings coming in.

42
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:29.100
So if I go back onto R1 and try pinging again, and then jump on to R3, I can see those

43
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.060
ping requests are coming in. So the traffic is getting from R1 to R3 just fine,

44
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.950
the problem is it can't get back again because if I do a 'show ip route' on R3, and make this bigger

45
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.320
again, it would need a route back to the 10.0.0.0 network.

46
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.890
And right now, it doesn't have in its routing table.

47
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.050
So that's why the ping is failing out right now. I need to configure reachability to everywhere in both

48
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.600
directions for everything to work. Okay, so let's go back and just double check that configured everything

49
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.030
on R1. So I'll do a 'show ip route' on here,

50
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.030
and it needed static routes to get to the 10.1.1.0 network and the 10.1.0.0 network.

51
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.260
Those have been both added going via 10.0.0.2 on R2,

52
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.660
so R1 is all good right now.

53
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:37.240
Next up, we'll move along to R2, go to global configuration. R2 needs a route to the network behind

54
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.140
R1,

55
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.590
so that's ip route

56
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:49.120
going to 10.1.1.0 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0, and the next hop address is

57
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.200
on R1,

58
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.470
it's at 10.1.0.1, the directly reachable interface.

59
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.790
I also need to configure routes to the routes behind R1.

60
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:08.200
So let me just slide my window over here, and the routes behind R1 is ip route

61
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:19.570
going to 10.0.1.0, 255.255.255.0 and the next hop address of 10.0.0.1 on

62
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.800
R1.

63
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.390
Then I also need to get to 10.0.2.0 network,

64
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.560
I just hit my up arrow here to bring the previous command back because I just need to change one digit

65
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.300
here, it's going exactly the same place but it's for the 10.0.2.0 network.

66
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.480
Okay, so that is router

67
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.100
2 done as well.

68
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.010
And finally, we need to configure R3.

69
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.320
So let's slide back over this side again and R3 is going to need a route to the 10.0.0.0

70
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.490
network because it's not directly connected there

71
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.770
so I'll say ip route to 10.0.0.0 it's a /24

72
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:09.380
as usual and the next hop address is 10.1.0.2 on R2.

73
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.150
I also need to configure routes to the networks behind R1.

74
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.460
So let's move across and see what they are,

75
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.890
so that's going to be ip route

76
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:26.300
going to 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0, again

77
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.170
going to R2 which is at 10.1.0.2,

78
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:38.130
and I'll hit the up arrow again, and add my route for the 10.0.2.0 network. Okay,

79
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.440
so that should be all good.

80
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.270
Let's just check the routing tables on our routers again.

81
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.970
So you already saw the routing table in R1, it's got routes for it's directly connected networks

82
00:07:52.210 --> 00:08:01.370
and it's also got routes to the two networks behind R2. R2 has got its routes as well, let's do the

83
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.520
'show ip route' here,

84
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:09.730
it's got its directly connected networks and it's got static routes to the networks that are reachable

85
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:19.740
behind R3, and also the two networks that are reachable behind R1. And R3,

86
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:27.250
if I do a 'show ip route' on here, it's got it's directly connected networks and it's got static routes for the

87
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.190
three networks at all available behind R2.

88
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.620
Okay, so that should be all good,

89
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.700
let's just test this now.

90
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:42.070
So let's have a look and see where we need to ping to and from.

91
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:52.210
So let's ping from PC3 to PC1, so I'll ping 10.0.1.10 and with a little bit of luck,

92
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.230
we didn't mess anything up. Yep,

93
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:54.910
that's all good,

94
00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:05.860
the ping is working. And I will also ping to PC2, which is at 10.0.2.10 and that

95
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.540
works just fine too.

96
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:14.050
We already tested in the last lab that PC1 can ping PC2 and because PC3 can ping both

97
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.770
PC1 and PC2 and pings test two-way reachability,

98
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.300
I know that

99
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.910
the lab is all working great now.

100
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.990
Everything has got connectivity to everything else.

101
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:36.130
Let's just try a trace route as well, so I'll trace to 10.0.1.10 from PC3, and I

102
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:44.230
can see that the first hop is its default gateway at 10.1.1.1 on R3. It then hits

103
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.190
10.1.0.2 on R2.

104
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:56.550
Finally, it hits 10.0.0.1 on R1 and then it makes it to the final destination.

105
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.970
Okay, so that was how we configure

106
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:04.450
static routing. See you in the next lecture for more routing.
