00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.780
In the section, you'll learn about network programmability and automation, so let's have a look and

2
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.450
see what you're going to learn in this section.

3
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.380
So I've come to the Cisco Web site and I'm looking at the exam topics here to find this page.

4
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.430
Just Google for Cisco, Shishani, 250 01 exam topics.

5
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.940
And then we'll bring you here this list.

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.520
So everything that's covered in the exam listed baby Demiï¿½n.

7
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.520
And you can click on show details here to expand.

8
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.840
So I've done that for the Automation on Programmability section.

9
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:48.280
And you can see that what you need to know is how automation impacts network management to looking at

10
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.370
the benefits of programmable automation.

11
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.020
Also comparing traditional networks with controller based networking.

12
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.460
You need to know about the Estienne architecture of the North and the southbound APIs comparing traditional

13
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.420
Compass device management with Cisco DNA Center.

14
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.930
You'll also learn about that characteristics of based APIs, reverbs and data encoding.

15
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.570
Looking at configuration management tools.

16
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.550
Poppit, Chef and Ansible.

17
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.420
And you need to be able to interpret Jeshurun encoded data so you can cheevers a lot of things in there.

18
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.830
It's quite a wide topic and this can seem overwhelming at first.

19
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.980
But don't worry in the section, all of these different terms that you see here, I'm going to be breaking

20
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.570
them down and explaining them.

21
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.940
So by the end of section you're going to be comfortable with everything here.

22
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.320
Now, know that in the requirements for the exam, you don't actually need to be a developer that's

23
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.170
able to write your own code for the network.

24
00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.610
Programmability Python is the programming language of choice for working with network environments.

25
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.260
And you see that Python isn't even mentioned here at all.

26
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.230
So what you're going to learn here is really an introduction to network programmability and automation.

27
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.690
You're going to learn what all the different components are and how they all fit together.

28
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.490
But you're not going to actually be doing your own coding from here because that would just be a very

29
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.460
steep learning curve.

30
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.880
You are, however, going to be able to implement network automation by using tools such as Ansible

31
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.790
and DNS and are thoughts.

32
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.170
So you will be able to do your own automation.

33
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.890
You're just not going to be right in your own code in Python.

34
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.850
OK, so that's what we're going to be covering here.

35
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.860
You do actually need to know some of the basic terminology around Python, so I'm going to be covering

36
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.300
that in the next lecture.
