00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.790
In this lecture, you'll learn about Static NAT which is the first of the available NAT types that

2
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.780
we're going to cover. With static NAT, it's a permanent one to one mapping, usually between a public

3
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.470
and private IP address.

4
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.160
This is used for servers which must accept incoming connections. For example, your mail server or

5
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.830
a public Web server

6
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.100
if you're hosting that yourself. The next type is dynamic NAT that uses a pool of public addresses

7
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.860
which are given out on an as needed, first come, first served basis.

8
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.740
These are usually used for internal hosts which need to connect out to the Internet that they don't accept

9
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.150
incoming connections.

10
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.000
And the last NAT type is PAT, Port Address Translation.

11
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.150
This allows the same public IP address to be reused and we're going to be covering the other two types,

12
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.440
dynamic NAT and PAT in detail later on in this section.

13
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.520
With the examples I'm going to be giving you, this is NAT lab that we're using. So you can see that

14
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.020
we are the organization over on the left and R1 is our Internet edge router.

15
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.840
We've got a server, which is INT-S1, Internal Server 1, which is at 10.0.1.10.

16
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.720
And then we've got our internal normal hosts, our normal desktops out on another IP subnet, as you

17
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.720
would see in the real world. They're on the 10.0.2.0/24 subnet.

18
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.900
So we need to configure a static NAT rule, to allow incoming connections to Internal Server 1, because

19
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.610
it's running public services like it's a Web server and it's supporting users out on the Internet.

20
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.550
Or maybe it's our mail server and we need to accept email coming into the organization. Down below,

21
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.710
you'll see the PCs. They're not running any services that people on the Internet need to connect into,

22
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.610
but they need to be able to connect out to the Internet. For example, for our users browsing webpages.

23
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.290
So that's what we're going to be configuring. For the examples,

24
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.360
we've got EXT-S1 over on the right.

25
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.520
That is an external server that I'm just going to use for testing and for checking that NAT is working.

26
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.690
So our static NAT scenario, we've bought the range of public IP addresses, 203.0.113.0/28

27
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.660
from our service provider. It's a /28, so that gives us 14 public IP addresses.

28
00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.950
Of those addresses, 203.0.113.2 is used on the outside interface on our Internet

29
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.570
edge router, R1.

30
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.700
So let's just look at the diagram again.

31
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.660
You can see we've got 203.0.113.0/28,

32
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.070
is our range of public IP addresses on our outside interface fa0/0 on R1.

33
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.510
And we're using 203.0.113.2 on our outside interface and over on the service

34
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.710
provider side of that link, 203.0.113.1 is being used there.

35
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.250
So that leaves 203.0.113.3-203.0.113.14

36
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.100
available that we can assign.

37
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.500
INT-S1 at 10.0.1.10

38
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.260
is an internal Web server which needs to accept incoming connections from the Internet so that people

39
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.500
out on the Internet can browse our website.

40
00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.970
So we need to assign a fixed public IP address to accept incoming connections.

41
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.380
We will use the first available address in our range.

42
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.580
That was 203.0.113.3.

43
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.460
So that gives us a permanent public IP address that external people can use to connect them to our Web

44
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.910
server.

45
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.940
We're using a private IP address in the inside of 10.0.1.10.

46
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.330
So we're going to need to configure a static permanent NAT translation to translate the public IP

47
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.640
address 203.0.113.3 on the outside fa0/0 interface to 10.0.1.10

48
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.410
on the inside fa1/0 interface for voice incoming connections.

49
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.480
Now, the translation is bidirectional.

50
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.360
So we're going to configure the static NAT translation for traffic coming from the outside to

51
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.050
the inside.

52
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.860
Our server also needs to send traffic back out to the Internet as well, but we don't need to configure

53
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.690
a separate NAT rule for that.

54
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.890
Our static NAT rules are bidirectional.

55
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.420
So it will also take care of the outgoing traffic.

56
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.210
So here is how we do the configuration. So on R1, first off, we need to specify which interface is

57
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.230
the outside and which is the inside.

58
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.870
So we say interface fa0/0, ip nat outside, and then interface fa1/0,

59
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.620
ip nat inside.

60
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.550
Then we configure the static NAT translation. For that, we say ip nat inside

61
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:39.450
source static 10.0.1.10 is the inside IP address, 203.0.113.3 is the outside

62
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.130
IP address and that's it.

63
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.510
That's the whole config.

64
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:52.290
Now whenever the host 10.0.1.10, since traffic coming in on interface fa1/0 and

65
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.900
it's going out to the outside, out fa0/0,

66
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.680
the router will change its source IP address on that outbound traffic from 10.0.1.10,

67
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.930
to 203.0.113.3.

68
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.550
So that's for the outgoing traffic. For the incoming traffic,

69
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.340
whenever traffic comes in with 203.0.113.3 as the destination address, coming

70
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.520
in on interface fa0/0 on the outside,

71
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.180
the router will change that destination address to 10.0.1.10 and send it through to interface

72
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.610
fa1/0.

73
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.210
So this is going to take care of our NAT translation for traffic in both directions.

74
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.610
To verify that is working, send some traffic to or from that host  with the outside and then do the

75
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.940
command show ip nat translation. And there's quite a lot to the output there.

76
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.550
So I'll explain that in the next lecture.
