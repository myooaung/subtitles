00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.050
In this lecture, we're going to have a look at connected and local routes in the lab.

2
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.620
The topology just has one router, R1, and it's got three interfaces that have not been configured yet.

3
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.060
I'm going to put IP address 10.0.0.1/24 on fastEthernet0/0, 10.0.1.1/24

4
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.580
is going to go on fastEthernet1/0, and 10.0.2.1/24

5
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.660
is going to go on fastEthernet2/0.

6
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.350
I also have a couple of PCs that I'm going to use to test connectivity across the router. I've got

7
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.770
PC1 at 10.0.1.10

8
00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:00.360
and PC2 at 10.0.2.10. So, let's get everything configured. So I'll go on PC1 first,

9
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.920
this is my PC emulator in GNS3. So to

10
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.340
check the config, it's 'show ip' and I can see it's already been configured with IP address 10.0.1.10/24,

11
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.800
and the default gateway of 10.0.1.1, and on PC2, it's already

12
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.390
pre-configured, IP address 10.0.2.10, and the default gateway 10.0.2.1.

13
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:38.160
But if I go on my router R1 and I'll do a 'show ip interface brief' on here, and I can see the

14
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.530
interfaces are not configured and they're still shutdown.

15
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.330
So let's configure our IP addresses on the router, actually just before I do that, I'll do a 'show ip route' first

16
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.570
to show you that the routing table is empty right now because I don't have any IP addresses configured

17
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.450
anywhere on the router. Obviously, it's not going to be capable of doing any routing. So I need to configure

18
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.850
those, so I'll go to global configuration, interface fastEthernet0/0 and give it IP address

19
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:17.160
10.0.0.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0 and remember to 'no shutdown' the interface. Then

20
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.630
interface fastEthernet1/0 is going to be IP address 10.0.1.1,

21
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.600
subnet mask 255.255.255.0, and 'no shutdown'.

22
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.470
And finally, interface fastEthernet2/0 is IP address 10.0.2.1,

23
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:51.030
255.255.255.0 and a 'no shutdown'. And if I have a look on my routing table now, I'll do a

24
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.860
'show ip route' I should have my connected and my local routes added to the route table now. So because I

25
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:07.320
configured out those IP addresses, it knows that 10.0.0.0/24 is connected, and it's

26
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:16.730
out interface fastEthernet0/0. 10.0.0.0/24 is connected on fastEthernet1/0

27
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.710
and 10.0.2.0/24 is on fastEthernet2/0. I can also check and see what IP addresses

28
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.430
are configured on the interfaces as well from my local routes. 10.0.0.1 is on interface

29
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.890
fastEthernet0/0. It shows it as a /32 here but I can also see what the subnet is as well

30
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.830
just by looking at the corresponding connected route. And 10.0.1.1 is on fastEthernet1/0

31
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.730
and 10.0.2.1 is on fastEthernet2/0.

32
00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.620
Okay, so I've got my routing table built now, and the router should be able to route traffic between it's

33
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.520
directly connected interfaces. It should have reachability to the PCs as well. So if I do a

34
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:16.649
'ping 10.0.1.10' for PC1, this ping will hopefully be successful, Yeah it's good and I can

35
00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:24.510
also ping PC2 at 10.0.2.10. Sometimes it will miss the first ping as it's doing the ARP like

36
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.230
you see there.

37
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.970
So that looks all good.

38
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.570
Let's also check

39
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.060
connectivity between the PCs as well. So I'll go on PC1, and I'll ping the default gateway first, which

40
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.660
is at 10.0.1.1. I know for sure that this is going to work. It would be really weird

41
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.500
if the router could ping the PC, but the PC couldn't ping the router because a ping confirms 2 way connectivity.

42
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.400
the way the ping works is it sends an echo request to the destination address and then the

43
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.420
destination address will send a echo reply back again. We'll talk a bit more about the details of how

44
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.550
ping works when we do the troubleshooting section later.

45
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.780
Okay, so I've got connectivity between my PC and the default gateway, let's check for connectivity 

46
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.840
between 

47
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.940
PC1 and PC2.

48
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.430
So I'll ping 10.0.2.10 and this should be good too.

49
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.740
Yeah.

50
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.010
Okay.

51
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.460
So I've got connectivity there.

52
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.870
If I go to PC2, then I know for sure that if I ping 10.0.1.10 that's going

53
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.920
to work as well.

54
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.090
Okay so that is connectivity setup between the directly connected interfaces.

55
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:50.130
If I wanted to verify the path that the traffic is taking then I could do a 'traceroute' from the PC.

56
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.240
Let's just check the command syntax on my virtual PC here on GNS3.

57
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.750
Okay,

58
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:05.930
so it's 'trace' on here. So I will trace the path to 10.0.2.10 and this verifies that it

59
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.860
is going through just a single hop which is my default gateway to 10.0.1.1 and it then

60
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.890
routes it to 10.0.2.10.

61
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:23.530
Okay, so that was connected and local routes, I'll see you in the next lecture where we'll move on to static

62
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.030
routes.
