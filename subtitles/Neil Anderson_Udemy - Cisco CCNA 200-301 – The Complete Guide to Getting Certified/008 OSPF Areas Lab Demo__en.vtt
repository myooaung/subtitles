00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.520
In this lecture, you'll learn about multi area OSPF through a lab demo.

2
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.590
So in the previous OSPF labs, we've had all our routers in Area 0,

3
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.900
as you can see in the topology diagram here. We've got five routers, R1 to R5. All of their interfaces

4
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.660
are in IP subnets that begin with 10, and previously, all the routers were in Area 0.

5
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.960
Let's see, this scenario now is that our network has been growing and we want to convert it to a

6
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.860
multi area network.

7
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.130
So we're going to have the same physical topology, but rather than having all of the interfaces in Area 0,

8
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.760
We're going to segment into an Area 0 and an Area 1.

9
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.590
Now, normally you would have multiple normal areas hanging off of Area 0, but because we've only got five

10
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.610
routers here,

11
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.690
I'm just going to have an Area 0 and an Area 1. So, routers R3 and R4 are going to be

12
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:20.200
backbone routers in Area 0. Router R2 and R5 are going to be ABRs with an interface in Area 0

13
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.370
and Area 1, and router R1 is going to be a normal router in Area 1. So the routers are already

14
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.830
configured all in Area 0. R3 and R4 are going to remain backbone routers in Area 0,

15
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.520
So we don't need to change any of the configuration on there, but we need to change R2 and R5.

16
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.030
On R2, we need to put interface FastEthernet0/0 on the right, into Area 1, and we need to

17
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.320
do the same for FastEthernet3/0 on R5, and on R1, we need to put all of its interfaces

18
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:08.250
into Area 1. Okay, so let's go on to the routers. So I've got all my routers configured with OSPF,

19
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.260
if I do a 'show IP route', you'll see that all the routers have got routes to all of the destinations and they're all

20
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.820
showing up as a type 'O' which is an intra area route. Meaning, it's in the same area, so that was on R1.

21
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:32.280
Over on the other side, R4, it's routing table is going to look similar. Again, with intra area routes.

22
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:45.080
So let's configure our ABRs first, so that was going to be R2 and R5. If I do a 'show run | section ospf'

23
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:53.090
on R2, I can see that it's being configured with Process 1 and I've

24
00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.680
got a network statement that's putting all its interfaces into Area 0. So let's have a look at the topology again,

25
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:10.290
and I need network 10.1.0.0 to be in Area 0, and 10.0.0.0

26
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:24.900
to be in Area 1. So, let's fix that up. On R2, so back on to the command line, I'll go 'config t', 'router ospf 1',

27
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.430
and I'm going to remove this network statement. So I'll say 'no' and then copy and paste that in, and

28
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.700
then I'm going to say 'network 10.1.0.0

29
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.820
0.0.255.255'.

30
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.040
So all the interfaces that begin with a 10.0, and then we don't care what's after that, are going

31
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.480
to go into Area 0 and then,

32
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.060
network 10.0.0.0,

33
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.490
and again, I need to be careful with the wildcard mask here, and make it 0.0.255.255.

34
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.400
So anything beginning with 10.0 will go into Area 1, but I've been careful to make sure that my network

35
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:20.720
statements are not overlapping there. 10.1.X.X goes in Area 0, 10.0.X.X goes in Area 1. I'm getting

36
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:29.000
an error message about a mismatched area ID. The reason for that is if we go back to the network topology

37
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.010
diagram again, I haven't changed R1 yet. Its interfaces are still in Area 0. So on FastEthernet0/0,

38
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.780
on R1, it's Area 0, on the other side of that link, on FastEthernet0/0 on R2, it's Area 1.

39
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.120
So that's a mismatch right now, until I finished configuring R1 as well. That's why I'm getting

40
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.560
the error message. Before I do R1, I'll do my other ABR which is R5. So FastEthernet2/0

41
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:06.670
is the 10.1.0.0/16 the network and FastEthernet3/0 is the 10.0.0/16, so let's

42
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.220
configure that next.

43
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:21.160
So I'll go onto R5 and I'll do a 'do show run | section ospf', and give this a second to give me

44
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.730
the output. Then 'router ospf 1',

45
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.590
and I'm going to remove this old network statement because it's putting all of the 10.X.X.X networks into Area 0.

46
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.420
I don't want that, so I'll get it to that networks statement and I'll put in my new network statements,

47
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:46.650
which were for 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255, a /16, goes into Area 0,

48
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:54.690
and network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255

49
00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:02.560
goes into Area 1, and I'll get the error message again here. Again, coming from R1. There it is.

50
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.130
Okay, so that's my ABRs configured.

51
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.680
Lastly, I'll go into R1. I don't need to check the topology diagram again because I know that all

52
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:22.520
its interfaces are going to go into Area 1. So let's do a 'show run | section ospf', and I'll remove

53
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:33.630
the old network statement that is putting the networks into Area 0 again. So 'router ospf 1', 'no'

54
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.340
and then copy and paste,

55
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.280
and the new network statement will be, I want all of the interfaces, so they all begin with a 10, so I

56
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:54.710
can do 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 again, and now I'm going to put them into Area 1.

57
00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:01.530
And now because the area does match on both sides of the link, I see the adjacencies coming up. It forms an adjacency

58
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:11.520
with R5 and it also forms an adjacency with R2. Okay now, if we look at our old 'show ip route', so this is

59
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.580
when I brought up earlier on R4, and you can see that all of my OSPF routes are intra area routes.

60
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.830
They all show up as a type 'O' because they all came from other routers in the same area. Now that I have

61
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:35.460
configured my multi area OSPF, if I do a 'show ip route', I expect that I'll see the 10.0.X.X networks

62
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:44.430
on R4 showing up as an inter area route because R4 is in Area 0, that was 10.0.X.X networks are in

63
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:54.540
Area 1. So you see the difference now, they are showing up as inter area routes, but right now, I haven't

64
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.980
configured summarization. So before I had

65
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:11.310
my 1, 2, 3, 4 networks that were coming from 10.0.X.X, and now, I've still got 4 networks coming

66
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.910
from 10.0.X.X.

67
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.940
So configuring different areas doesn't actually do us any good until we do the manual summarization

68
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.270
as well,

69
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:28.540
so let's do that next. So our summarization gets done again on our ABRs.

70
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.750
So looking back at the topology diagram, on R2, I'm going to summarize all of these individual

71
00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:42.789
10.0.X.X/24 networks, into a 10.0.0.0/16 and advertise that into Area 0.

72
00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:49.230
I'll do the same thing, from right to left, on R5 as well. Coming back in the other direction,

73
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.670
all of the individual 10.1.X.X/24 networks,

74
00:08:53.670 --> 00:09:00.160
I'm going to summarize that to 10.1.0.0/16 and advertise that into Area 1.

75
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.770
So let's do that next,

76
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:19.600
so I'll jump on to my ABR router, R2. So on R2, The command is 'area 0 range 10.1.0.0',

77
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.560
and when we put in our network statements, we use a wildcard, but when we do our summary addresses,

78
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.570
we use a normal subnet mask.

79
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.810
So Area 0, I'm going to summarize 10.1.0.0/16,

80
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:39.720
and in the other direction for Area 1, the range is 10.0.0.0,

81
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.700
and again, 255.255.0.0.

82
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:50.910
And I need to do exactly the same commands on my ABR of R5,

83
00:09:51.270 --> 00:10:08.580
so it's going to be 'area 0 range 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0', and 'area 1 range 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0'.

84
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:16.410
And what I should see now is that change on R4. So before, when I wasn't doing summarization, for all

85
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:22.380
of the routes that were coming from Area 1 into my R4 router in Area 0, I was getting an

86
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:31.200
individual /24 route for each of those. If I do a 'show ip route' now, then there you can see

87
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.260
the difference.

88
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:38.790
I don't have four individual /24s, I've just got that one /16 summary route.

89
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:45.630
So it's taking up less space in my router, less memory, taking up less resources on there. That's the

90
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:53.310
benefit we get from doing our multi area OSPF, and finally, I'll show you on R1, it's going to

91
00:10:53.310 --> 00:11:00.240
be the same thing. If I do a 'show ip route' here, I'll just have a single summary route for the

92
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:06.280
10.1.0.0/16 routes, which are over in Area 0.
