00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.790
In this lecture, you'll learn about the format of an IPv6 address.

2
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.100
So you already know that

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.450
it is 128 bits long compared to IPv4's 32-bit address.

4
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:30.320
The IPv6 address is written as 

5
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.610
X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X.

6
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.180
So it's a great, big, long address.

7
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.650
But when you start working with IPv6 addresses, don't get freak out by the length of the address.

8
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.710
It's still just an IP address.

9
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.750
So whatever you're working with, IPv4 or IPv6, everything about that address works pretty much

10
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.700
exactly the same.

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.610
So the routing and the switching is going to work no matter whether you're using IPv4 or IPv6 in

12
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.950
the same way.

13
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.460
It's just a different and longer address that is used in IPv6.

14
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.340
But it's not like you have to learn a completely new technology or a completely new way of doing things.

15
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.310
It's just a longer address that is on your hosts. With the IPv6 address,

16
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:29.300
each X is a 16-bit hexadecimal field and hexadecimal means values are 0-9 and

17
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.810
A-F.

18
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.560
So an example of a valid IPv6 address would be

19
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.690
2001:0DB8:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001.

20
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.730
2001:0DB8:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001.

21
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.310
2001:0DB8:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001.

22
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.460
2001:0DB8:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001.

23
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.530
You can see that it is a big long address compared to IPv4.

24
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.740
So our IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long and they're written as X.X.X.X. Each of those segments

25
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.580
in between the dots is 8 bits long.

26
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.260
We've got four of them.

27
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.470
So 4x8 gives us our 32-bit long address.

28
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.050
And each part of an IP address is known as an octet.

29
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.240
It's an octet because it's 8 bits long.

30
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:31.130
IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are 128 bits long written as a string of X's with colons

31
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.020
in between. Each segment there between the colons is 16 bits, but there isn't an official name for

32
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.350
them

33
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:47.120
like we have the octets with IPv4. The equivalent of an octet for 16 bits would be hexadectet.

34
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.430
But that's just too hard to pronounce.

35
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.480
So nobody uses that when we're talking about IPv6 addresses. What the different pieces of the IPv6 address

36
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.060
are commonly known as is a hextet, or a piece, or a quartet.

37
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.080
But there's no official name. When you hear me talking about it during the section,

38
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.440
I'll either call it a hextet, or a segment, or a piece.

39
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.680
OK, so you've seen already the IPv6 addresses very long. It took me about a minute to read out that big,

40
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.810
long address before. There are,

41
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.850
however, thankfully, a couple of ways that we can shorten it to make things more convenient.

42
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.280
Address shortening is a standard convention and it's supported by all vendor's devices.

43
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.170
The first way that we can shorten the addresses is that leading zeros in each field can be removed.

44
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.410
So if we had that same example address that I was using before, that you can see on the screen now,

45
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.740
it can be as 2001,

46
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.830
and then the second hextet of 0DB8, we can write that as just DB8.

47
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.890
We can strip off the leading zero. And then colon 0,

48
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.770
the next hextet is 0000.

49
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.290
So we can strip off the three leading zeros and just write it as 0. The next hextet

50
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.620
0001,

51
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.720
we can write that as 1 and so on.

52
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:19.360
So whenever you look at IPv6 address and you see a hextet, if there's not four hexadecimal characters in

53
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.210
there, for example, if there is two, you know, the first two characters must have both been 00

54
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.340
because we can strip off the leading zeros.

55
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.870
The other thing that we can do is shorten the address is that successive all zero fields can be

56
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.480
shortened to colon colon.

57
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.660
So the middle bullet point you see here, that's the same as what we did just there in the last slide.

58
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.740
We're that big long address can be shortened by removing the leading zeros, but we can take it on a

59
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.720
step further as well.

60
00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.850
So after removing the leading zeros, we had 2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:1. zero one one one

61
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.430
2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:1.

62
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.290
Well, we can change that to

63
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.710
2001:DB8:0:1::1.

64
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:22.550
So those three hextets near the end, which are always zero,

65
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.560
we can just write that as double colon.

66
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.650
So in the example that you see here, there's three different ways that we could write that same IPv6

67
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.590
address. The big, long, complete one up at the top,

68
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.550
that's valid.

69
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.330
We could take that in and that is acceptable.

70
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.520
The second one where we've removed the leading zeros, we could also type that in when we're configuring

71
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.990
an IPv6 address in the router and that would be accepted too. Or we can write it the third way where we've removed the leading

72
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.040
zeros and we've also removed successive all zero fields.

73
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.380
And again, that is a valid address. So the three IP addresses that you see there, they're all exactly the same.

74
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.140
There's just different ways of writing the same thing.

75
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.320
And they're all valid . We can use either of the three.

76
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.870
The standard way to do it is of course the shortest way, the last one you see, because that's the

77
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.340
most convenient way to do it.

78
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:25.550
Now, with removing successive all zero fields, that can only be done once in an address to avoid

79
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.450
confusion.

80
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:36.090
So, for example, if we had 2001:0:0:1:0:0:0:B,

81
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:46.220
that could be shortened to 2001::1:0:0:B or it could be shortened

82
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:54.770
to 2001:0:0:1::B. Because you see in the example, there's two different parts

83
00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:02.720
of the address which have got successive all zero fields. But we can't shorten it to

84
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.470
2001::1::B. Because if we did that, you see it in the original address,

85
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.090
on the left hand side, we've got two zeros and then to the right of the 1, we've got three zeros.

86
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.270
Well, if we shortened it to 2001::1::B, we wouldn't know which side of

87
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.410
the 1 had two zeros and which side of the 1 had three zeros.

88
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.840
So we wouldn't know what the actual address was.

89
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.700
So stop that from happening.

90
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.340
You can only put in a double colon once during the entire address.

91
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.530
OK, so what was it for our IPv6 address format.

92
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.790
I'll see you back in the next lecture where we'll talk about the different address types in IPv6,

93
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.000
and we'll actually start configuring this on our router as well.

94
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.410
So you'll also see how we put this IPv6 address on your router. See you there.
