00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.220
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure S.H. with lab Damul, the topology is very simple.

2
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.530
I've got my ah one with IP address tandoor order order one and I'm going to be accessing it from my

3
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.220
PC PC one at ten or ten.

4
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.190
So let's go on our one first.

5
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.070
And if I do a IP interface brief here, you can see the IP addresses already configured on there.

6
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:47.610
If I just show Ron, you see that I have not configured my telnet or SFH access the line level yet,

7
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.490
so I'll do that now.

8
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.910
So I'll go to global configuration and will use a username this time rather than waiting.

9
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.140
Wabo execute a salkey username.

10
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.880
I'll have username Blackbox with a secret of lock box one and then I'll configure telnet access first.

11
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:24.390
So I'll go line vte y zero to 15 and I'll see log in local on there to use the local usernames.

12
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:35.640
Now if I go on to my PC, if I tell that to tandoor order order one I can put in my username all flag

13
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.700
box on my password of Xbox One and I'll try to do it without putting a typo in while I'm talking.

14
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.360
There you go.

15
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:55.740
And you can see that I can log in as black box if I exit back to the command line on my workstation

16
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:07.140
again, if I try to S.H. Dash L to specify the username, which is Black Box and its hand or one, this

17
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.920
is going to fail.

18
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.190
I can see that the connection is closed because I've enabled telnet oxer so that I erm but I haven't

19
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.890
any ibold ss h oxazepam so let's do that now.

20
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.960
So I'll go back onto our one.

21
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.770
The first thing that I need to do is specify a domain name because that's going to be used in the certificate.

22
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:38.370
So I see IP domain name and I'll use flat box dot com for the example then I need to generate a certificate.

23
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.920
So I see crypto key generates and it's using RSA that will ask me what do I want.

24
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.280
The key link to be it defaults to 512.

25
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.720
Do accept the minimum you can use for associate just seven, six, eight.

26
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.860
So I will use seven, six, eight here and that is now association the Ibold.

27
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.470
If I do, I do.

28
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.950
Sure run again.

29
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.180
You can see that I haven't added anything else to my virtual terminal lines.

30
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.430
These control both telnet and associates access and the default is they allow both to right now, both

31
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.330
telnet and ASIC should work.

32
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.380
So if I go back to the PC again and I try to access H again now it does prompt me for a password.

33
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.410
It doesn't prompt me for the username because that was included in the assets command and I can enter

34
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.790
my password in there.

35
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.300
No, I'm getting into the reserve with SFH.

36
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:48.030
If I exit out of here and I try telling that again, you see that telnet access is still enabled as

37
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.560
well.

38
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.520
So right now I can get in with either tail it or with SS age.

39
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.200
I don't want that.

40
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.030
I want to disable the telnet access because it's an insecure protocol.

41
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.610
The traffic all goes in plain text.

42
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.930
So do that.

43
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.050
I will go back onto Rohter ah one again and I'll go to my virtual terminal lines configuration again

44
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.070
and I'll transport input.

45
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.400
I'll do a question mark here and you can see I can do all which enables both associates on telnet about

46
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.120
to default.

47
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.860
None will do neither or I can enable just associates or just telnet.

48
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.000
I'll transport input SS age and that is going to only only S.H. access.

49
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.660
Another thing I should do that is best practice is a global config.

50
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.790
Si Ipsus each version two to only accept the latest version.

51
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.310
It's a bit more secure doing this as well.

52
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.100
OK, so that is SFH configured.

53
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:58.860
Now if I go back to my PC and I try telling that you see that Telnet is going to feel now because I've

54
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.330
disabled telnet on the right.

55
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.910
Ah but if I try to access H.

56
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.300
S H is working and still get.

57
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.980
To me and to the writer, OK, it's about how you configure, assess each and disable telnet.

58
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.420
So it's typically going to be done in the real world.

59
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.850
OK, another thing about real world configuration is that you're not going to be using local usernames

60
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.810
like you saw there.

61
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.520
We're actually going to use an external server to make this more scalable.

62
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.410
We'll cover that in the next lecture.
