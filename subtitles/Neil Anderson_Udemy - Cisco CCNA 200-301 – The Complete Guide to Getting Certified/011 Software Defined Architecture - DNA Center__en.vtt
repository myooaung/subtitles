00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.940
In this lecture, you'll learn about DNA Center, which is Cisco's SD and controller for enterprise

2
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.210
environments on the slide.

3
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.530
I've put in the definition from Cisco's website about what DNA is DNA.

4
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.370
It stands for digital network architecture.

5
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.790
So DNA enables you streamline operations and facilitate I.T. and business innovation.

6
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.660
Internet based networking IPN Built on Cisco DNA takes a software delivered approach to automating and

7
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.940
a shooting services across your wine and your campus and branch networks.

8
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.140
And I've highlighted in bold the key terms there to what DNA is, is when you're using Cisco software

9
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.820
defined services to help automate your network.

10
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.020
I'll explain more about what intent based networking is on the slides coming up.

11
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.410
Three of the main building blocks, just good DNA and software defined architecture are DNA center,

12
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.430
which will be talking about here and again, the access and the one which I'll cover in the next couple

13
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.370
of lectures.

14
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.080
So DNA Center, it's a Cisco SD and controller which is designed to manage enterprise environments.

15
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.400
It's a campus branch on one as opposed to the APIC controller, which monitors data center environments

16
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.600
with Nexus switches.

17
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.710
You can think of the DNA center as an upgrade to the older enterprise as the controller from Cisco,

18
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.360
which was the APM.

19
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.680
So the DNA center, it runs as an appliance on Cisco Yuk's server hardware, the underlying operating

20
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.820
system is Lennix and it can be clustered for redundancy.

21
00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.760
OK, so I mentioned IBM intent based networking earlier, this is a key part of the concept of the software

22
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.020
defined architecture.

23
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.039
So intent based networking transforms a traditional manual network into a controller wide network that

24
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.860
translates to business needs and policies that can be automated and applied consistently across the

25
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.370
network.

26
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.550
The goal is to continuously monitor and adjust network performance to help assure the desired business

27
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.240
outcomes.

28
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.680
Joyce worked through some examples to see what this really means.

29
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.300
First example is going to be a KUOW policy rollout across the entire network.

30
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.210
So what is the intent here?

31
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.400
What do we want to do?

32
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.500
Well, the network policy is first defined, for example, providing guaranteed service to voice and

33
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.480
video across network locations.

34
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.810
Company wide vouchered intent is what we want to do.

35
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.890
If we were going to do this the traditional way, the network team would research and plan implementation

36
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.130
so they would see what the different sites are.

37
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.120
They would see what the different device modules are in each site.

38
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.230
They would look at what the content bandwidth is in each of the locations.

39
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.570
They would do the design to figure out what configuration to be applied to all of the different devices.

40
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.340
So that voice and video were given the guarantee quality that they required.

41
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.360
Different network device models require different commands.

42
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.450
So when you do a query configuration, the config you do is different on routers than it is on switches.

43
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.530
And also it can be different on different models of switches as well.

44
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.530
So in a normal, large network environment, you are going to have different models of equipment and

45
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.240
this makes it complicated to implement your Kyosuke configuration.

46
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.930
The method is very time consuming and also because you are configuring the devices one by one it's liable

47
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.710
to mistake's.

48
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.760
Let's see how it works when we use Internet based networking now with the DNA center.

49
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.240
So when we're doing it this way, the network team creates an application policy and DNA center specifying

50
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.950
voice and video as business relevant applications and wants it so we don't have to do the huge planning.

51
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.480
We don't have to check all our different network devices are we don't have to have different configurations

52
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.329
on different devices, on in different locations.

53
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.860
We can just quickly specify in our application policy that voice and video are business relevant applications.

54
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.950
DNA center will then automatically configure the best practice settings on the network devices.

55
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.030
So we don't need to get involved in the command line.

56
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.490
We don't need to figure out the different commands for the different devices.

57
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.180
DNA center does all of automatically for us, and that can reduce the total deployment time to implement

58
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.750
Kuo's company wide from more than two minutes.

59
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.040
Here is a screenshot of doing that she can see here.

60
00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.520
This is on the DNA center of Common ePolicy of the new application policy.

61
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.020
And in there I specify what my business relevant applications are and what my business is.

62
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.170
Relevant applications are the business relevant applications are going to be down.

63
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.630
So you're going to get very limited bandwidth.

64
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.560
So the impact on our actual important applications and our important applications are going to get vehicular

65
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.940
settings they require based on what the best practice settings are.

66
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.400
So, for example, voice on video are going to get put into the priority queue.

67
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.580
OK?

68
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.050
That was our first example.

69
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.340
Looking at another example of policy here, we want to check your traffic flows in the compass.

70
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.250
So for the content, we've got users in Department eight of our users in Department B, they must have

71
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.170
connectivity to other users in their own department and also through the company servers.

72
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.640
They must not have connectivity to users in the other department.

73
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.650
So we would do this with traditional networking over network team would plan on IP subnet, obnoxious

74
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.210
control implementation, and then they would configure each switch individually.

75
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.450
Users are expected to put to stay plugged into the same access part because the way this is controlled

76
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.710
is there on the switches.

77
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.790
We've configured our switch parts with an axis view on when a user plugs into their departments.

78
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.820
OK, just VLAN.

79
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.780
They can then communicate with the server and get an IP address in their subnet and we then go access

80
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.750
control where that control the traffic flows between the different IP subnets to verifying the view

81
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.610
on in an IP address based on Vernette for on their physical location, not who they actually are.

82
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.080
Again, the method is very time consuming, liable to mistakes because we're configuring devices individually

83
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.900
and it does not support mobility because users are expected to be plugged in into a particular physical

84
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.350
part.

85
00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.190
When we do this with DNA and are now using Internet based networking, the network team creates a group

86
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.380
based access control policy and DNA center, which specifies Vilo traffic flows.

87
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.440
Users will all gain from and can move to any physical location on campus so they are no longer tied

88
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.210
to a physical part on a switch.

89
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:19.750
The users are authenticated by Cisco ISP Identity Services engine and assigned a security group TAG

90
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.860
which controls their access, which moves away from being based on the physical part to being based

91
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.440
who the user is and the user can move anywhere within the campus.

92
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.420
Looking at how this is configured in DNA center, so again, we're into policy, we can figure out a

93
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.350
group based access control policy.

94
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.460
We have got our user groups in here.

95
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.100
This is information from the ISP Identity Services Engine, which is Cisco's Tripoli authentication

96
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.570
server.

97
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.100
And then in here, we can specify the yellow traffic flows between the different groups.

98
00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:03.780
OK, so those are a couple of quick examples of how DNA center can make your life easier as an administrator

99
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:11.340
with the intent based networking, having a look in some more detail now, the user interface for DNA

100
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:11.790
Center.

101
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.960
So when you log in, you will land on the dashboard up at the top.

102
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:23.870
You will see this page here and you can see the main parts of DNA are our design policy provision and

103
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.550
assurance design is where you end urban design of your networks of at different sites.

104
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.059
You have that kind of information policy.

105
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:38.580
You show examples where earlier where we configured a security policy and execute policy provision.

106
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.929
This is where you can set up the configuration on your devices.

107
00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:48.150
Plug and play is also supported as well for when you're first adding a new device to the network.

108
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.280
Talk about that in some more detail later.

109
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.210
And assurance, this is where with the intent based networking.

110
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.940
So you've configured DNA center with good intent.

111
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:03.210
How you want the network to work assurance insurors is actually working, how you intend it to do so.

112
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:10.700
Further down on the dashboard, we've also got the tools, tools in here, our discovery where DNA center

113
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.150
will discover your network devices do then get added to the inventory.

114
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.290
You can also look at that in a typology view.

115
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:25.040
Image repository is where you configure the operating system versions that you want for your different

116
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.770
network devices, command run or you can run SQL commands directly from DNA center.

117
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.750
This makes it more convenient.

118
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:39.950
And having a log in to the individual devices, you can manage your licenses from DNA center for pushing

119
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.530
configuration to your devices.

120
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.400
You can use templates for as a template.

121
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:49.460
Add to our network plug and play is when you first add a device to the network, it can automatically

122
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:56.030
Deanwood as configuration from DNA center and telemetry is used for gathering statistics from your devices

123
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.880
with the statistics that are gathered that helps with the troubleshooting tools and DNA sensor.

124
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:08.150
So it will report if it if it sees any issues, it can also correlate those statistics between the different

125
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.810
devices.

126
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.760
OK, so let's have a look at each of us starting off with the design.

127
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:19.660
So when you first install DNA or you're ready to get everything set up, the first thing you want to

128
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.210
do is your network design.

129
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.610
So in here you go, the design page and then the network hierarchy and you specify your different locations

130
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.000
in here.

131
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.340
So you can see in the example, up at the top level, we've got global and then under there we've divided

132
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:34.420
the continents.

133
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.260
Under there we would have our different offices in each continent, our country as well.

134
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.130
So get your sites added.

135
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.190
Then again, under design, we've got network settings.

136
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:52.990
So in here we can set properties such as the triple A server for users, administrators, logging into

137
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:59.770
our network devices, the A.P. server system log, etc. and you can have different settings at different

138
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.390
levels here.

139
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.860
So that's why we had the hierarchy on our sites, because it's possible that there's a different A.P.

140
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.290
server, for example, in Asia than there is in Australia.

141
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:15.520
So if you can figure something at the global level that will apply to all sites, but unless you overwrite

142
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.400
it with a more specific setting at the site level.

143
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:26.850
Then we've got discovery, so we want to have all of our network devices to be newin by DNA center,

144
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:34.650
so as discovery that does not to discover the devices, you can use GDP or you can specify a range of

145
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.450
IP addresses to be scanned.

146
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.520
So you put that information in also and are in the login credentials as well.

147
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:48.540
The DNA center will then go discover your network devices, log into them and pull information and DNA

148
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.810
center about those network devices.

149
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.470
Once that is being done, you can see the information in the inventory.

150
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.100
You can see in my example here, I've got all these different devices.

151
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.580
It knows the IP address, the mock address, what operating system version is running on that device,

152
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.870
the platforms of the actual hardware model, the serial number, etc..

153
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.550
You can also see your configuration if you push the configuration to the device from here to.

154
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.930
And also, from our information, you can view an anthropology view, so this gives you a nice graphical

155
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.670
representation of Hiva devices in your network are connected to each other.

156
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:35.430
Another thing we can do with DNA center is we can manage the operating system versions running on our

157
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.510
network devices.

158
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.750
You'll have a different iOS devices in your DNA center.

159
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.790
Already knows about all the different models of equipment that you've got in your network.

160
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.460
It will recommend the U.S. image to use on them.

161
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.880
And in here, under the golden image, you can specify the U.S. image that you want to use and then

162
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:59.310
DNA center can push that version to your devices and make sure they are running the correct version

163
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.320
of iOS.

164
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.030
Next picture I want to talk about is network plug and play, which I mentioned earlier.

165
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.490
The network plug and play allows your viewers switches and wireless access points to be deployed in

166
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:18.330
remote offices with zero touch configuration, meaning it doesn't need a network administrator to physically

167
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.790
take the device, the box and configure it.

168
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:26.790
The way it works is the device is physically installed in minimal office and connected to the network.

169
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:33.750
It then discovers the DNA center and various methods are available to do this, including the option

170
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.850
for E3 or the NSA.

171
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:44.340
So what happens is the device gets plugged into the network, then gets to the server and from the DHP

172
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.910
server, it learns its IP address, subnet mask, default gateway.

173
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.200
And another thing is through the IP option for E3, the IP address, the DNA center.

174
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.040
So this is built into Cisco devices.

175
00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.390
Now that when you first plug them in, when you first connect them to the network, they will look to

176
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.430
see if they have a DNS and are.

177
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.400
SDI and Control are controlling them.

178
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.700
It can discover the DNA center either through DHP or through DNA.

179
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:18.520
So if in your DNA you've added a host entry there for PvP server Dalt, your domain name again, the

180
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.500
switch when it comes out, the box is set out by Cisco.

181
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:29.220
They will look for Horsh name and DNS if it finds it will use it to connect to the DNA center, then

182
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.480
registers with and downloads its configuration from DNA center.

183
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:39.420
So that ensures consistent configuration of your remote office devices with no need for a network engineer

184
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.040
on site.

185
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.720
The way that we used to do it is when you ordered a new era switch, a wireless access point, it would

186
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.250
have to be sent to the physical location the network engineer is in.

187
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:55.920
They would then take the box, connect to do the configuration and then ship it to the final site and

188
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.110
it would need somebody there to plug it in as well.

189
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.350
Now, you don't need to go through those two steps.

190
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.490
It can be just shipped directly to its final location, plugged in.

191
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.480
It will connect to DNA center and it will download its configuration from there.

192
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.670
So it makes sure that you've got that correct configuration on there also saves you time and money.

193
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:22.460
Next thing is assurance assurance guarantees that the infrastructure is doing what you intended it to

194
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:28.910
do, the DNA sent or received information from all of the different network devices or your switches,

195
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:36.950
etc. Also the IIS, the Tripoli server, etc. and DNA center has got a built in correlation engine which

196
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.720
can identify over 150 different types of network and client issues.

197
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.120
And because it's getting all this information from your different devices, it can correlate between

198
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.880
them and if it sees that things are related but is going to give it better information to report to

199
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.680
you as well.

200
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:59.490
The DNA center then reports the problem and it will also provide recommended remediation options.

201
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:07.100
So looking at an example of got we're now on the assurance page in DNA Center, we can see an overall

202
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.720
summary of the network health.

203
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.070
And also on the main page, we will see the top 10 issues.

204
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:18.080
And you can see here one of the issues is the USPSTF adjacency is filled on one of our writers.

205
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:24.890
So we can then click on the link there and I will drill down further and we can see there further details.

206
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.050
And it also gives us the remediation, which is first up, check that we can ping the neighbor, verify

207
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:36.710
according to the benchmark NPF neighbors, etc. and you can actually run the commands directly from

208
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.780
DNA center.

209
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.560
So it's very useful.

210
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.630
It gives you reports in the issues that are happening in the network and it also walks you through how

211
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.040
to troubleshoot them as well.

212
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:53.870
And because DNA center has got system wide view the network, it gives you that global visibility and

213
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:59.030
what is happening and also troubleshoot rather than having to do it one device at a time.

214
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.849
So it's all there that you can drill down into the health status of network devices and clients.

215
00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:09.650
And as well as seeing what's happening now, you can also view historical information that's useful

216
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.770
to troubleshoot problems, which is happening at.

217
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:22.109
Random times are issues which occurred in the past, so a screenshot of what you can see here that we

218
00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.240
have got a client here.

219
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:30.810
So this is a users and machine and we can see that they have got intermittent connectivity problems

220
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.110
here.

221
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:37.140
So there's been a couple of drops and you see the times go in the bottom there so we can view back what's

222
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.430
been happening over time.

223
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:43.110
We can click in here on the timeline and we can see what the problem is then.

224
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.520
So if this user has been saying that they've had connectivity problems with the network, but it's working

225
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.250
fine now with the traditional networking, then you would just have to wait until the next time it happens

226
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.510
and then go troubleshoot then.

227
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.970
But with DNA sent, or you can go back in time and see what was happening when they actually had the

228
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.450
issue.

229
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.160
Another troubleshooting tool is pathways.

230
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.240
So this is similar to Trace.

231
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:06.500
Right.

232
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:12.000
But it gives you more information because that you'll see the IP addresses Pocker is going through,

233
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:17.460
but you would have to investigate further to learn what those devices actually are and DNA sent, or

234
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.380
it gives you a graphical view of all the network devices that a packet is passing through.

235
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:28.050
So you specify the source IP address and part of the destination IP address.

236
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.330
Important that you want to test traffic between.

237
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.980
And it will tell you here, Thoughtworks or not, it will should give you more information.

238
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:40.110
Like if it's if it's an e-mail which is blocking the traffic, it will show you that information here.

239
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:49.440
So you saw there how to use DNA sent her using the guey, so you don't need any kind of programming

240
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.960
skills, obviously, to do that because it's owned by the user interface for you bought DNA sent or

241
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.740
does also support APIs as well.

242
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:03.630
So everything that can be done through the Google can also be done via a northbound API.

243
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:10.230
DNA center also supports East and westbound APIs for integration with other services such as reporting

244
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.550
and analytics servers.

245
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:17.910
So with SDM, we don't normally talk about East and West APIs, which is just something the terminology

246
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:23.680
that Cisco use to explain DNA sensor can also integrate with other services as well.

247
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:30.900
So if we look at our Estienne hierarchy, we can see the DNA center is our SDM controller, so it sits

248
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.530
in the middle.

249
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:38.070
It can integrate via northbound APIs to other Web based front ends and it's going to use it southbound

250
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:43.890
APIs, typically Netco and Associates for DNA Center to communicate with the network devices.

251
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:50.480
OK, so that was everything about DNA Center Ilchi and the next picture for SD access.
