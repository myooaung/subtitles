00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.410
We've now covered everything you need to know for the Shishani exam about network programmability and

2
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.980
automation, it is a much deeper subject, though.

3
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.100
So if you do want to go deeper and learn more about it, there's actually another certification from

4
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.030
Cisco, which is the Cisco certified DeVontï¿½ associate that goes into much more detail and his focus

5
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.210
specifically on network programmability and automation.

6
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.280
There's also a lot of free resources available on the Cisco website for further training.

7
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.900
I've looked at some of them here and giving you a link so you can go and have a look at these later.

8
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.320
First up, we've got the network programmability basics video.

9
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.600
Of course, there's also the definite sandbox and a definite learning labs.

10
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.240
So let's have a look at those.

11
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.550
So starting off with the network, programmability basics course, of giving you the link to get to

12
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.910
that.

13
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.010
You go there, you will land on.

14
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.550
This page is all free to see this video as it covers really the same information that I covered in the

15
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.240
section.

16
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.160
But it does go deeper.

17
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.010
It's a longer course and it does have a lot of lab examples as well.

18
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.430
The presenters great as well.

19
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.900
So check out the next one I mentioned was the definite sandbox.

20
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.460
You actually saw this earlier in section because I used it when I gave you the demonstration for the

21
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.430
rest API with post in the sandbox you see in here.

22
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.860
But there's loads of different lab environments.

23
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.220
So you can practice with programmability and automation with lots of different Cisco products.

24
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.990
You can see that DNA center is in here.

25
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.780
So I actually advise you to come in and have a look in this lab just to get to know your way around

26
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.780
DNA center a bit better before you do the exam.

27
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.990
This always on lab here is always available.

28
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.540
You can also reserve an instance as well as this one is also available as well.

29
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.760
And if I do a search in here for GSR yeshivas, also, I was actually on GSR lab environments.

30
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.570
These are great for testing, configuring Cisco routers with the various APIs.

31
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.970
Other things to tell you in here.

32
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.820
This is the lab environment, but it doesn't actually give you lab walkthrough of telling you how to

33
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.990
use the lab environment.

34
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.020
For that, you can go to the definite learning labs.

35
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.000
So that will land you on this page here.

36
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.770
You can then click on get started on each of these different domains down at the bottom.

37
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.290
And that will land you on this page here.

38
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.560
And you can see on the left, but it covers things like the DNA center.

39
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.540
Jason is in here as well.

40
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.330
It Rascon Post, Von Python, etc., SD Wan.

41
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.300
So nearly everything that I covered in section, if you do want to learn it to more advanced level,

42
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.820
you can use these free learning resources which are available on the school website.

43
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.650
Now, don't do that right now.

44
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.350
Get your exam passed first.

45
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.310
Then when you've done that, you can come back here and you can on it to a deeper level.
