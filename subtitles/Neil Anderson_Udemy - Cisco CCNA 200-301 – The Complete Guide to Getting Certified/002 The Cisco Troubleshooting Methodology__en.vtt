00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.700
This is the official Cisco troubleshooting methodology diagram, and this is the recommended way by

2
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.280
Cisco to work through troubleshooting a problem.

3
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.920
Now, to be honest, as you get more experienced, you'll be able to troubleshoot naturally without having

4
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.810
to think about it using a diagram like this.

5
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.090
But this is quite useful if you're new to networking, to layout in a logical fashion about the steps that

6
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.210
you can follow to figure out what's causing a problem.

7
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.030
So up at the top, the first thing to do is to define a problem. So, clearly specify exactly what the problem

8
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.080
is.

9
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.570
Once you've done that, you then move into gathering information, so find out information about the problem.

10
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.120
For example, let's say that we've got a connectivity problem.

11
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.180
We would check to see if we can ping from the source to the destination.

12
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:15.000
If not, we would find out, is it just affecting that one host, or is it affecting other hosts in the same

13
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.810
area?

14
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.120
If it's only affecting that one host, the problem is probably with that host. 

15
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.800
If it's affecting everybody on that IP subnet, then it's probably not a problem at the host level.

16
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.180
It's probably something in between the host and the destination.

17
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.980
So, we would then find out other information, like asking has anything changed recently,

18
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.600
if it was working before?

19
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.520
If it was working before and now it's not, find out what's changed, and that's probably going to tell

20
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340
you what the problem is.

21
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.650
The next thing to do is to analyze that information. Ask all of the relevant questions, not just asking

22
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.210
questions to people, but also using show and debug commands on your devices to get the information.

23
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.570
And then, analyze that information and look for clues about what's causing the problem.

24
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.740
You can then move on to eliminating potential causes.

25
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.270
For example, if we're troubleshooting that connectivity issue from a source to a destination, and there are

26
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.130
several routers between the source to the destination if we check the first hop router, and the configuration

27
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.940
all looks good there, we can eliminate that as the cause and then check the next hop router along the path.

28
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.610
Next thing to do is to propose a hypothesis,

29
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.970
so taking all the information into account. You will determine what appears to be the most likely cause

30
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.050
of the issue. Then you test the hypothesis where you actually put the commands in or do the thing that

31
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.040
would fix that problem.

32
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.750
Then if the problem is fixed, you've solved the problem. We're down at the bottom now.

33
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.960
The last thing to do is to document the solution.

34
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.900
Now, this is something that's not fun to do, but it's important to do it.

35
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.190
And if you do get into the habit of doing it, you'll thank me later because, sooner rather than later, you

36
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.090
will run into a problem that somebody else ran into the exact same problem before.

37
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.750
If you've got proper documentation in place in your organization, it should be very easy and quick for

38
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.210
you to find a solution because somebody's documented that problem and the solution. If you're not

39
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.050
doing any documentation,

40
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.320
if it took an hour to fix it the first time, it's going to take you an hour to fix it this time

41
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.850
as well.

42
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.710
Whereas, if you had documentation, maybe it's only going to take a few minutes.

43
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.290
Also, this is not just for other people that may be facing the same problem as you afterward.

44
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.770
It's for yourself too. 

45
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.520
Maybe you run into the same problem but a year down the line, and you can't remember exactly what the

46
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.640
issue was.

47
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.760
But if you've got the documentation there, you'll be able to quickly look it up and quickly find a solution.

48
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.010
Okay,

49
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.140
That's your standard way to troubleshoot from start to the end, but you'll notice there are some other

50
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.260
arrows and arrows going in different directions as well.

51
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.640
So sometimes, we can move straight from the gather information stage straight to propose hypothesis. If

52
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.100
this is a problem that you've seen before, and you're pretty confident it's the same thing again,

53
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.810
you don't have to spend time gathering additional information. Just put in your solution that you think

54
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.230
is going to work and see if it works or not.

55
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.500
Also, often we can move back to an earlier stage if we don't manage to fix a problem

56
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.490
the way that we thought we were going to.

57
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.250
Okay, so that is the Cisco troubleshooting methodology. For troubleshooting methods,

58
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.310
again, experience is really going to help you here.

59
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.510
Sometimes it makes sense to do a Top Down approach, sometimes a Bottom Up approach, and sometimes Divide

60
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.450
and Conquer.

61
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.590
What I'm talking about here is, as it relates to the OSI stack. Some problems,

62
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.410
it just makes more logical sense to start off at the Application Layer and troubleshoot it moving down

63
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.630
through the layers.

64
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.800
Other times, it's easier to do it the other way around, where you start troubleshooting at the Physical Layer

65
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.920
and then move your way up through the layers, and other times again, you can Divide and Conquer.

66
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.940
For example, if you see a problem like a connectivity problem, you've seen similar problems of this before,

67
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.730
and it's always been caused by an issue at the Network Layer. You could go straight to the Network Layer

68
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.700
and start troubleshooting there. Based on what you find,

69
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.750
you could then move up or down through the OSI stack.

70
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.080
And remember, as we said before, having a good understanding of how IP networking works, as we covered

71
00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.920
in the life of the packet section, and also how the OSI model works, is going to really help you understand

72
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.680
what's going on. And when you understand what's going on, that makes it easier to troubleshoot problems.

73
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.640
Some methods we can use in our troubleshooting.

74
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.700
The first one here, we can compare configurations.

75
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:23.740
If you're in an organization, often, you will use templates for configuring your routers and switches.

76
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.600
In an existing organization, you've already

77
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.960
got existing routers and switches there,

78
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.280
so rather than doing a new configuration from scratch, you'll do it based on a template.

79
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.430
So if you are doing this, and there's a problem, you think it's on a particular router, you can compare

80
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.440
it with another router which should have a similar configuration and look for any differences there.

81
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.740
Maybe you've got a typo or maybe a missing command.

82
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.220
By comparing it with a known good configuration,

83
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.290
this can help you find the problem more quickly. For connectivity issues,

84
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:02.770
what we're usually going to do is trace the path. And as a network engineer, a lot of your day-to-day

85
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.770
job is going to be troubleshooting connectivity problems. So, you will do this very, very often.

86
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.710
The best way to troubleshoot connectivity problems and tracing the path is start off at the source and work

87
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.420
your way towards the destination.

88
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.760
In the slide coming up, we'll cover some of the commands we're going to use here.

89
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.000
The last one mentioned here is swap out components.

90
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:34.460
If you think that you have narrowed the problem down to a particular device, but you can't see a configuration

91
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.960
error on there, a way you can confirm it is by swapping out with some known good hardware. 

92
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.230
A problem might be down at the physical level or something like that,

93
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.020
or maybe it's just something you're missing.

94
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:51.610
For example, a really simple one would be a cable. If you think it's possibly a cable issue because

95
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.960
all the configuration appears okay,

96
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.430
but there is some kind of Physical Layer problem,

97
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.880
just swap out the cable and see if that fixes it.

98
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:07.380
Okay, so I just mentioned about some of the common commands that we will use to troubleshoot connectivity.

99
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:14.900
A really super common command to use is ping. That checks connectivity between two devices.

100
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:23.920
When you send out a ping, it uses ICMP, and it sends a packet from the source to the destination. The destination

101
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:31.000
will then send a ping reply back again. So, ping verifies two-way connectivity.

102
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.549
If you've got connectivity from the source to the destination, but the return path from the destination

103
00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.320
back to the source isn't working,

104
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.110
then the ping will not work either.

105
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.720
So, this verifies two-way connectivity between a source and a destination,

106
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:50.740
and this is often one of the first commands that we'll use if we've got what looks to be a network connectivity

107
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.670
issue.

108
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.180
The next command we'll probably use after a ping

109
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.110
if a ping fails is a traceroute.

110
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:03.550
If you've got multiple routers between the source and the destination, what you can do is you can troubleshoot

111
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:10.510
it from source to destination. Say we've got routers R1, R2, R3, and R4. You could check

112
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.730
R1 first, if it all looks good, you move on to R2, then onto R3, and so on.

113
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.210
Well, a traceroute can sometimes speed this up a bit.

114
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:28.240
A traceroute does a ping, hop by hop, from the source to the destination, and it will often indicate

115
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.140
which router along the path has got the problem.

116
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:39.340
Finally, we can use telnet. Telnet is normally used for managing your network infrastructure devices,

117
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.120
like your routers and switches.

118
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.440
We can use that to get onto a command line on the device, but another thing that it can be used for is

119
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:54.670
checking to see if a port is open on a destination. Rather than using telnet to the default port of

120
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.710
23,

121
00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:04.750
we could, for example, telnet to port 80. That will verify if port 80 is open and receiving communications

122
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.910
on the destination.

123
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:16.180
Okay, so next up, let's have a look at this in the lab, and I'll do that using this topology here in the

124
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.960
next lecture.
