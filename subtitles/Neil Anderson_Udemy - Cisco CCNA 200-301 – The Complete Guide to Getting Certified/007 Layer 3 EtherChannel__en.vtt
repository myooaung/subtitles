00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:14.070
In this lecture, you'll learn about layer 3 etherchannels. In the earlier lectures in this section,

2
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.400
you saw how to configure layer 2 etherchannels.

3
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.550
We can configure layer 3 etherchannels as well.

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.050
You can see that with the configuration example here. And the configuration is actually exactly the same.

5
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.940
The only difference is that we make the ports a layer 3 port with the no switchport command.

6
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.270
So that's a standard command you can use on a layer 3 switch whenever you're using etherchannel

7
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.390
or not to say that the port is a layer 3 port so that you can put an IP address on there.

8
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.800
So let's look at the configuration. So at global config, I've said interface range

9
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.770
gi1/0/1 - 2

10
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.470
And then I say no switchport to make those layer 3 ports and then I'm going to configure them

11
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.400
as a port channel.

12
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.320
So I say channel-group 1 mode and then the same options as we had for layer 2.

13
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.210
It can be active, auto, desirable, on, or passive, depending on whenever you want to make it

14
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.860
a static etherchannel with on,

15
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.610
or we can use active or passive for LACP or we can use auto or desirable for PaGP.

16
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.500
So that will group the ports together into an etherchannel. We can then put our other configuration

17
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.670
on our etherchannel.

18
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.080
That's where we're going to put our IP address.

19
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560
So we say interface port-channel 1, the one ties up with the channel group number.

20
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.060
And then in this example, we'd say ip address 192.168.0.1

21
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.550
255.255.255.252.

22
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.060
And remember to do a no shutdown on the interface.

23
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.710
OK, so that is a layer 3 etherchannel. That's the complete config.

24
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.740
So this could have been a really short lecture, but there's another implication of this. Something else I

25
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.790
want to talk to you about here, and that is the network design.

26
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.920
So looking at our traditional campus design with the core distribution and access layer. And the way

27
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.790
that this would be done originally would be there would be layer 2 links between the access layer

28
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.210
switches and the distribution layer switches.

29
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.550
And the default gateway for the end hosts would be on the distribution layer switches and we would have

30
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.450
spanning-tree running between the access and the distribution layer because they are layer 2 links.

31
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.220
Well, a trend that you can see increasingly now is actually putting layer 3 links in everywhere.

32
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.230
And the benefit you get from doing that is it means that you're not using spanning-tree anymore.

33
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.800
Spanning-tree is a necessary evil.

34
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.160
The bad side of spanning-tree is that it tends to shutdown half of your links and it's also very

35
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.920
slow to recover from failure as well.

36
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.550
So it's bad, but it still does good things.

37
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.500
You still need it because it would be way worse if you had a layer 2 loop in your network, because

38
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.830
that would just basically bring your network down.

39
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.580
So we make sure that we don't have layer 2 loops by having spanning-tree enabled.

40
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.490
But the bad side is that it's slow to recover from failures and it does shutdown half of our links.

41
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.910
So it would be better if we could have layer 3 links everywhere and not use spanning-tree anymore, right?

42
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.660
Now, you may be wondering, well, OK, well, why didn't we always do that?

43
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.890
Why did we used to have layer 2 links between the access layer and the distribution layer?

44
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.840
Now, in a lot of modern networks

45
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.340
we still do have layer 2 links from the access to the distribution layer.

46
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.420
But an increasing trend that you'll see now is that layer 3 is everywhere

47
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.270
andd the reason it's possible is that layer 3 switches have come down in price a lot.

48
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.720
Back in the day, layer 3 switches were a lot more expensive than layer 2 switches.

49
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.480
And your access layer switches where you had a high port count, where you had all of your hosts plugged

50
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.690
in,

51
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.270
so you had a lot of access layer switches and it just wasn't possible from a cost point of view to

52
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.930
layer 3 switches in on all your access layer switches.

53
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.680
But because time has moved on now and the prices have come down for layer 3 switches, it is more

54
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.260
feasible to do that now.

55
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.960
So if you do put in layer 3 switches everywhere, including in the access layer, now you actually

56
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.240
have the layer 3 links from the access layer to the distribution layer. Meaning you've got an IP address

57
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.480
on this port here and an IP address on this port here.

58
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.780
So because everything is layer 3, you don't have spanning-tree running anymore. Spanning-tree

59
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.450
only works on layer 2 links.

60
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.870
So the way that you do have the paths being determined between your switches is not being determined

61
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.070
by spanning-tree anymore.

62
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.950
It's being determined by your routing protocol.

63
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.620
So when you're using layer 3 links everywhere, you will configure a routing protocol on here

64
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.800
as well,

65
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.620
and it's up to the routing protocol to handle the path determination. With your routing protocols, they

66
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.150
support equal cost load balancing, so you're not going to have links being shutdown.

67
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.830
All your links will still be available and traffic will be load balanced across all of them.

68
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.800
Also, your routing protocols recover from failures.

69
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.610
They converge a lot faster than spanning-tree does.

70
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.790
So that's a benefit you get there. Now, when you do this, last thing I will tell you about it, is that the default gateway

71
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.380
is not going to be on the distribution layer switches now as it would be with layer 2.

72
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.140
On the access layer, the default gateway for your end host is going to be on the access layer switches.

73
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.710
And if you think about it, it has to be because we're going to have an IP subnet down here and we're

74
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.370
going to have a different IP subnet here. And the default gateway for your hosts has to be in the same

75
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.270
IP subnet.

76
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.280
So your default gateway is now going to be configured on your access layer switches and you're going to

77
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.480
have routing everywhere,

78
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.500
layer 3 links everywhere above that.

79
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.260
OK.

80
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.780
Oh, and I've put this in the etherchannel lecture because very often when you're doing that, you

81
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.320
are going to have etherchannels going up between your switches and when you've got layer 3 everywhere,

82
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.900
of course, there are going to be layer 3 etherchannels.

83
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.450
OK, that's everything I needed to tell you

84
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.190
here. See you in the next lecture.
