00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.940
In this lecture, you'll learn about Layer 2 of the OSI reference model, which is the Data-Link Layer. At Layer 2,

2
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.110
frames are encoded and decoded into bits, ready to put onto the Physical Layer, on the physical wire.

3
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.440
Error detection and correction for the Physical Layer can be provided here,

4
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:35.280
depending on the protocol that we're using, and Ethernet is the Layer 2 medium that is used on Local Area

5
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.330
Networks. Ethernet is pretty much ubiquitous on the LAN, and that's the Layer 2 media that we're going

6
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:49.650
to focus on in this lecture. In later lectures, when we get to the Wide Area Network section, we'll talk

7
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.990
about the Layer 2 protocols that are used there. But before we start getting into Ethernet,

8
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.390
let's actually have a look at some of the different Layer 2 protocols. So you can see on my slide here, I've

9
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.770
got a link going to a page on Wikipedia where there's a list of network protocols. Let's open that up now,

10
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.780
so here I am, and up at the top, it lists some of the common Layer 1 protocols like ISDN, DSL. There's

11
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.050
a lot of legacy protocols that are still listed here as well, like ISDN isn't used so much these days. Then,

12
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.720
you can see the list of the Layer 2 protocols as well, so Ethernet is in here,

13
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.580
most commonly used on the LAN. There's a legacy WAN protocol in here, a Frame Relay. Other kind of

14
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.590
protocols we've got in here are FDDI and the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) that we'll be talking about later when

15
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.680
we get to the WAN section. Okay, so that's where you can see the different protocols, they operate at the different

16
00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:01.620
layers. Let's go back to the slides. The next thing I wanted to do was just clear up any misunderstanding

17
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.729
you may have about the terminology because this has been mentioned a few times as we've been going through

18
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.210
the OSI lectures, but I just want to really make it clear here.

19
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.350
So you've seen this slide several times before, and we're going to look at the terminology now.

20
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.340
When a packet is composed, obviously, it's composed by the sender, and it's going to put it on the wire

21
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.220
and send it to the receiver.

22
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.680
And as we go down through the OSI model, the sender will start off at the top layer, the Application

23
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.820
Layer, and it will compose that part of the PDU. Then, after it's done that, Layer 7 will get encapsulated

24
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.910
in the Layer 6 header. At Layer 7,

25
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.460
at that point, it's called the data.

26
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.510
We then encapsulate it in the Layer 5 header and then in the Layer 4 header. When we put the Layer 4

27
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.620
header on there, at that point, it's called a segment. Then, the Layer 3 header goes on. At that point,

28
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.250
it's called a packet, and then finally, the Layer 2, the Data-Link Layer, will go on, and at that point,

29
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.750
it's called a frame. But when the sender is sending traffic to the receiver, it's not like it sends segments,

30
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.410
packets, and frames separately. They're all part of the same PDU. So really, just terminology that we're

31
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.610
talking about here.

32
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.670
So, we send that one PDU. When we're looking at it from the point of view of the Layer 4, we call

33
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.080
it the segment. From the point of view of Layer 3, it's a packet, and from the point of view of Layer 2,

34
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.780
it's a frame.

35
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.880
Moving on, let's look at that Layer 2 Ethernet header if it is Ethernet that we're using as our Layer 2

36
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:56.310
protocol. At the start of the header, we've got the preamble. That's used to help the sender and the receiver

37
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:04.260
to synchronize. We then have the Layer 2 destination and source address. That's the MAC address when we're

38
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.850
using Ethernet. We then have the ethertype, which is used to specify what is encapsulated inside the

39
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:19.790
Ethernet header, so that will typically be IPv4. We then have the data and the FCS. The FCS

40
00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:27.180
is the Frame Check Sequence. That's a cyclical redundancy check which is used to check for the integrity

41
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.360
of the frame, to check that it has not been corrupted during transit.

42
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.200
So, lastly, let's look at that Layer 2 Ethernet address, which is the MAC address. MAC stands

43
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:45.060
for Media Access Control. The MAC address is a 48-bit hexadecimal address. If we look back a slide,

44
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.900
6 Bytes, each Byte is 8 bits, so 6 times 8,

45
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.520
that's where we get the 48 bits from. And the MAC address is split into two different halves, as concerns

46
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.440
what makes up the MAC address. The first half,

47
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:07.860
so the first 24 bits, is the OUI. That's the Organizationally Unique Identifier, and that identifier is

48
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.580
the manufacturer of the Ethernet port.

49
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.390
So if you've got a Cisco router or switch, and it's got an Ethernet port on there, it will have a MAC address,

50
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.740
and the first half of the MAC address is Cisco's identifier.

51
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:32.760
If you had a network card, and that network card came from IBM, for example, the first half of the MAC

52
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.600
address is going to be IBM's identifier.

53
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:44.100
The second half of the address, so the last 24 bits, that is assigned by the manufacturer. The burned in

54
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.510
MAC address on every NIC port in the world is globally unique.

55
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:56.580
The actual number of potential addresses is 2 to the power of 48, or if you have a look at

56
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.020
the slide, this absolutely huge, big number 281,474,976,710,655. That's a lot of

57
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.590
possible MAC addresses,

58
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.730
so that makes it possible for every Ethernet port in the world to have a unique MAC address.

59
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:19.230
An important point that I want to make here is that there is no logical addressing with your MAC addresses.

60
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.840
It's just one big flat address space. Well, we could have a PC with a network card from IBM,

61
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.650
so it's going to have an IBM MAC address on there. That could be in New York.

62
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.460
We could have another one also from IBM in Beijing and another PC from IBM in London.

63
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.230
So they're not grouped together. There's no kind of a logical order with your MAC addresses.

64
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.330
It's just one big flat address space.

65
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.390
And that's why this section is a lot shorter than the section where we were talking about IP addresses.

66
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.940
With IP addresses,

67
00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.180
there is a logical order there, and that's how we, as administrators, are going to control our networking.

68
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.050
Last thing to do in this lecture is I wanted to show you how to get information about the MAC address.

69
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.840
I'm on my laptop here, which is on Windows, so let's see how to get the MAC address on a Windows machine.

70
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.260
I'm going to open up a Command Prompt here,

71
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:24.540
I type in CMD, and then the command is 'ipconfig', a space, and then '/all', to get the MAC address.

72
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.910
I've got a whole heap of output here because I'm running VMware on my laptop, so I've got a lot of

73
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:41.010
virtual adapters. If I scroll back and then find my Wireless Adapter, which is going to be in this list

74
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.740
somewhere, and we just keep scrolling through until I find it.

75
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.160
Okay,

76
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.820
here it is, so my Wireless Network Adapter, because I'm on wireless

77
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:58.380
now. Both wireless and wired Ethernet both uses a MAC address, and the entry here, Physical Address,

78
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.470
that is the MAC address.

79
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:06.330
So my MAC address on my laptop is 68:50:43:24:58:01.

80
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:06.650
Okay,

81
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.060
so that's how to find it on Windows.

82
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.200
Let's have a look at Linux next.

83
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:19.570
So I'm going to open up Putty, and I'm going to SSH into a Linux box that

84
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:29.820
I've got running, so I'm in a Secure Shell in here. Enter my username and my password, and I'll get the

85
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.350
Command Prompt in Linux.

86
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:38.330
So on Windows, it was 'ipconfig', and you have to use '/all' to get the MAC address. In Linux,

87
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:46.260
it's 'ifconfig' for Interface Configuration, and I'll scroll up a little bit here. You can see here's my

88
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.910
Ethernet interface that I'm using here. The MAC address is the Hardware Address (HWaddr),

89
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.040
so that's, 00:0c:29,

90
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:01.470
is the OUI portion, and then the vendor assigned portion, c4:e8:7e.

91
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.690
Okay,

92
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.820
so that's how we find the MAC address on Windows and Linux.

93
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:12.030
Finally, let's have a look on a Cisco router or switch.

94
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:23.220
So I'm going to open up another Putty session, and this time I'm going to SSH onto my router.

95
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:33.920
I need to enter 'enable' to get to the enable prompt, and then the command is 'show interface'. This is going to

96
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.210
give me a heap of output about all my different interfaces.

97
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.570
I could also have just entered one interface if I wanted to there to more target the output.

98
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.430
I can see on FastEthernet 0/0,

99
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:58.550
the address is 0018.7374.8d56. In brackets here, it tells me the BIA, that's the Burned In Address,

100
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.400
and it's exactly the same value here.

101
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:07.130
The reason there's a difference, it is possible in software to change the MAC address on an interface, but

102
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.400
normally, we won't do that.

103
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.770
Normally, we'll just leave it at the burned in address from the manufacturer.

104
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.170
Okay, so that was everything I needed to tell you about

105
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.710
MAC addresses. See you in the next lecture.
