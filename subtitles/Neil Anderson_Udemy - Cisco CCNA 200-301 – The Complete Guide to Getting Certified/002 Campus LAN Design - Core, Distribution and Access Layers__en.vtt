00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.240
In this lecture, you'll learn about design for Local Area Networks (LANs). So, that could be for a single building

2
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.590
or it could be several buildings within a few hundred meters of each other on the same local campus.

3
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.800
We're not talking about a Wide Area Networks (WANs) here,

4
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.290
like if you've got a building in New York and another one in Houston or Singapore. We'll talk about

5
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.540
Wide Area Networks in a later section.

6
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.670
So, just the Local Area Networks in this section.

7
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:47.310
The campus LAN should be designed for scalability, to support growth, also for performance and

8
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.690
security. And to aid in best practice design process,

9
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.280
the network topology is split into access, distribution, and core layers

10
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.550
when we're doing the design. The layers have their our own design principles and characteristics that we'll

11
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.990
talk about in this lecture.

12
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.320
So first up, the Access Layer. So you can see in the example Local Area Network here, I've got a Main

13
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.690
Building in my campus and I've also got separate Building 1 as well.

14
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.010
Both of those buildings will have multiple access layer switches, and the access layer switch is where

15
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.830
your end hosts plug in.

16
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.630
Now, in the diagram, I've just got one host plugged into each switch just because I've only got so

17
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.100
much room on the slide here.

18
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.730
Obviously, in the real world, you would have multiple hosts plugged into the same switch.

19
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.330
So maybe in the main building we've got four switches there.

20
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.170
Maybe a couple of them are on the ground floor,

21
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.410
Switch 3 is on the first floor, and Switch 4 is on the second floor, for example,

22
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.450
and we are going to have multiple hosts plugged into their local switch, and we're going to have the

23
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.650
same kind of thing in Building 1. So your

24
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.940
end hosts such as your desktop computers, your servers, and IP phones always connect into the network at

25
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:24.360
the access layer. It is designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost to support lots of end hosts.

26
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.230
Desktop computers typically have only one network interface card, so they can only connect into one

27
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.800
switch.

28
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.650
Or maybe if they're on wireless will connect into one

29
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.840
Wireless Access Point (WAP). Servers, however, will often have dual NICs to give them some extra redundancy.

30
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.610
So they will connect into a pair of redundant access layer switches,

31
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.500
and your client access security measures, such as port security that we'll discuss in a later section,

32
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.110
are enabled at the access layer.

33
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.890
The next layer up is the Distribution Layer. So you can see when we're doing our Campus LAN design,

34
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:14.350
we follow a hierarchical model. So the end hosts plug in at the access layer, and then the level above the

35
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.340
access layer, we have our distribution layer switches, and the access layer switches uplink to the distribution

36
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.890
layer switches. Notice that the access layer switches are not usually connected to each other.

37
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.490
They connect upstream to the distribution layer switches.

38
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.960
The distribution layer switches serve as an aggregation point for the access layer and provide additional

39
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.950
scalability

40
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.420
in our Local Area Network.

41
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.410
They are typically deployed in redundant pairs.

42
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.110
We don't want to have a single point of failure at

43
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.160
the distribution layer. That would maybe be acceptable in a very small campus, but any kind of normal

44
00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.690
size of campus, you're going to want to have redundant distribution layer switches organized in pairs.

45
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.300
So if one of them goes out, your clients have still got connectivity. The downstream access layer

46
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.340
switches are connected to both of the pairs of the distribution layer switches. If I could go

47
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.300
back a slide,

48
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.640
you see all my access layer switches here.

49
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.430
They've got uplinks to distribution layer switch 1 and distribution layer switch 2,

50
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.460
and you see that both buildings are designed the same.

51
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.430
So my Main Building has got it's access layer switches and it's redundant distribution layer switches, and

52
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:41.950
I've got the same thing in Building 1. Your end hosts connected at the access layer, end hosts do not typically

53
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.580
connect into the distribution layer switches directly.

54
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.920
And what we do at the distribution layer, most software policy, such as Quality of Service (QoS) policies,

55
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.600
is enabled at the distribution layer.

56
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.940
The next layer we have up is the Core Layer.

57
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.350
So, your distribution layer switches uplink to the core layer.

58
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.160
Notice that we had our access layer and our distribution layer switches in both buildings. The core layer

59
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.610
switches are just going to be in one building and it's the core layer switches that link all of your

60
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.720
buildings together.

61
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.370
So here, we've got a pair of redundant core layer switches in the main building,

62
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.450
and obviously, your distribution layer switches uplink there. Your core layer switches, just like your

63
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.150
distribution layer switches, are typically deployed in redundant pairs with your downstream distribution

64
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.960
layer switches connected to both. Traffic between different parts of the campus travels through the core,

65
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.680
so is designed for speed and resiliency.

66
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.620
Software policy slows the switch down, so it should be avoided in the core layer.

67
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.680
That's why we did things like our QoS policy at the distribution layer. Any kind of software

68
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.670
policy that you've got enabled on your switch causes the switch to have to think to enable that policy,

69
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.920
so it slows it down. The core

70
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.740
layer, the main thing is speed and resiliency.

71
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.990
We don't want anything slowing it down,

72
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.960
so we minimize software policy on our core layer switches. In a

73
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.040
smaller network, you could have a Collapsed Distribution and Core layer.

74
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.480
That is common, because smaller campuses don't need the scalability of three separate layers.

75
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.690
So in most cases, a Collapsed Distribution and Core layer is used where the Distribution and Core layer

76
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.350
functions are performed on the same hardware device.

77
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.740
So, this is what a Collapsed Distribution and Core looks like.

78
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.360
We don't have separate physical devices for the core and the distribution Layer.

79
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:59.500
We have a pair of switches here in our Main Building, and they are being used as both the distribution

80
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.580
and the core layer switches, so they fulfill the functions of both.

81
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:10.540
So to summarize that, our end hosts plug in at the access layer. Our access

82
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.970
layer switches are designed to support a high port count at an affordable cost,

83
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.560
and we implement our LAN security policies on our access layer switches. Our access

84
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.900
layer switches uplink to our distribution layer switches.

85
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.250
We're going to have those organized in pairs to give us redundancy.

86
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.280
We don't want to have a single point of failure, and our software

87
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.510
policies are enabled at the distribution layer. The distribution layer switches form an aggregation point

88
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.460
for all of our access layer switches.

89
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.610
And finally, we have the core layer.

90
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.900
The core layer is designed for speed and resiliency.

91
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.100
The core layer is what connects all of your different buildings'

92
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.440
distribution layer switches together.

93
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.500
We don't want to slow our 

94
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.110
core layer down with software policies. Okay, that's it for the LAN design.

95
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.800
See you in the next lecture,

96
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.420
where we'll start talking about VLANs.
