00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:09.540
In the last lecture, you learned how to configure an version three in lecture, you'll actually see

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.630
how you do it with a lab Damul.

3
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.020
So I've got my lab topology open here, you can see it's really simple.

4
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.430
I've got my Rohter are one which is got the S&P agent running on there.

5
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.960
It's got IP address 10 zero zero one, which is facing towards the S&P Monongah, which is my enmasse

6
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.350
server.

7
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:50.070
My S&P manager has got IP address handle one hundred Sunnism IP subnet, and that's actually the computer

8
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.290
that I'm working on right now.

9
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.810
So on my S&P manager, I've installed my S&P software on there.

10
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.750
I'm using the network monitor, which is well known and EMAC system.

11
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.730
You can use this yourself if you want to.

12
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.980
Israel, if you want to have a play about with it, there's a few where version of it.

13
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.560
Well, I've done so far as I've installed the software and then I've tried to connect to my right,

14
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.010
are it Tandoor or the other one via S&P to manage it?

15
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.630
And you can see that Vyse field.

16
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.970
I've got my error message here right now.

17
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.230
The reason is that I've not configured S&P on my router.

18
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.630
I'm going to be using S&P version three.

19
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.580
I haven't configured my S&P the username on the server here either.

20
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.870
So that's why it's feeling.

21
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.880
So let's get that set up.

22
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.690
So I will jump onto the right where you can see it right now.

23
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.880
You're the only configuration I've got on there as I've configured the IP address on the interface facing

24
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.080
towards the server.

25
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.500
So let's configure S&P version three.

26
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.350
So I do that Google config.

27
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.660
So the command is config T to get there and then I'll configure my S&P group first through the S&P commands.

28
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.480
Oh, start with S&P Dosch Server.

29
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.940
My right isn't actually an S&P servers and S&P S&P agent, but these are the that are going to communicate

30
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.870
with an S&P server to S&P dot server.

31
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.280
And I'm going to create my group.

32
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.890
I'll call the Squawk Box Dosch Group for my example.

33
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.470
I'm going to be running S&P version three and I'm just going to go with the default settings here where

34
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.660
I'm going to set a security level of off priv to the right.

35
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.770
You're on the right.

36
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.000
And the Annemasse system are going to authenticate with each other and the next system is going to have

37
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.220
will read only access to my right.

38
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.740
I'm not configuring any views or any access list or anything here at the group level.

39
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.090
So I hit Enter there and that is my S&P group for version three set up.

40
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.360
The other thing I need to do is to configure my user, which is going to be a member of this group and

41
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.050
it's the user.

42
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.350
It's also going to get configured on the S&P server.

43
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.990
So to do that, I start off with SCMP server again.

44
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.430
Now I'm configuring the user, the user name I'm going to use for this example is flat box the user,

45
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.770
then actually the group it's going to be a member of, which is the one I just created, which is flat

46
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.100
box the group.

47
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.600
Then I specify the S&P version three and then I need to configure my authentication settings.

48
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.120
So I start off with keyword of auth.

49
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.620
I'm going to use Char rather MP five authentication.

50
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:04.230
I'll use a password of of password in all caps and that's my authentication settings done.

51
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.020
Next, I need to configure my encryption settings.

52
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.050
That starts with priv for privacy.

53
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:19.709
I will use Ayesh 128 bit encryption and I'll use a password of priv password.

54
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:28.740
So done touch my S&P server group on my S&P server user configured on the router.

55
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.980
You can see I get a confirmation message.

56
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.670
They're seeing that it's being encrypted.

57
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.990
Next thing I need to do it, I need to configure matching settings over on my MP manager.

58
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.520
My server is well so let's jump back over there.

59
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.910
I will cancel out the old error message and go to my devices here.

60
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.070
Here's what I heard here.

61
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.570
And I need to advocate Ranchos.

62
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.830
So I'm going to do five subnet level for this example.

63
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:12.360
So I will click on the original and then go to the settings and scroll down here.

64
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.720
And I'm looking for the credentials for S&P devices.

65
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.570
Obviously, the way that you can figure this is going to be dependent on the.

66
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.360
Software that you're using for your S&P server, and that's not going to be tested on the Shishani exam,

67
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.340
I'm just using this as an example here.

68
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.540
So I'll go to the S&P credentials in default using version two.

69
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.560
We are using version three.

70
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.450
So I will select that for the authentication we'd configured to right to use QA authentication.

71
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:55.690
And the user is flac box dash user and the password was all caps off password.

72
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:06.200
The encryption type reconfigured was a eshe and the priv key was priv password duni.

73
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.970
It configure any contacts and I can see the defaults for everything else, so I will save now.

74
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:24.340
And then if I go back to the Rohter again and I'll try to advocate S&P Sancerre again so that it can

75
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.600
gather information from S&P.

76
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.990
So the essential types I'm looking for S&P traffic so that my server here can gather networking information

77
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.470
from right or via S&P.

78
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.510
I'll click on it.

79
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.180
Now, this is where it was feeling before when I didn't have matching credentials configured.

80
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.870
And now you can see that my Annemasse system has discovered that over it.

81
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.660
She's with four different five different interfaces on there.

82
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.940
And I could now go and complete the configuration and it would monitor the traffic going through that.

83
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.260
OK, so that's it.

84
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.630
That's how you configure S&P version three.

85
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.150
See you in the next lecture.
