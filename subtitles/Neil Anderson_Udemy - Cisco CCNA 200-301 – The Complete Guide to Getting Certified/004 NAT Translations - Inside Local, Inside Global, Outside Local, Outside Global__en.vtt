00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.660
In this lecture, you'll learn how to understand the output of the show ip nat translation command and

2
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.870
strap yourself in for this one, it's going to get a little bit hairy.

3
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.230
If you've already watched a few lectures in a row, now is probably a good time to grab yourself a coffee

4
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.790
before we get started with this one.

5
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.310
You can see here we've got Inside Global, Inside Local, Outside Local and Outside Global.

6
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:45.300
Now this is one of the most confusing and complicated things you're going to have to learn for the CCNA.

7
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.450
So you probably will find this a bit confusing if it's the first time you've seen it before. Actually, even

8
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.250
if it's the second time you've seen it.

9
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.040
To be honest, I've been working with this stuff for years and it still sometimes makes my head feel

10
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.830
like it's going to explode when I'm figuring out what Inside Global, what's Inside Local, Outside

11
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.810
Local and Outside Global is.

12
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.130
So let me give you a definition. And my definition is a little bit different for some of these than

13
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.860
you'll see in the official material.

14
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.700
And the reason is I'm trying to make it easier to understand here.

15
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.660
The official material makes it super complicated.

16
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.810
So hopefully this will make it a bit easier to understand.

17
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.250
So the definitions, Inside Local address, that's the IP address actually configured on the inside hosts

18
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.450
operating system.

19
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.830
So if we go back to the output from the show ip nat translation again, you see the inside local is

20
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.170
10.0.1.10.

21
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.370
If I go back to the network diagram again all the way back here, that is the IP address of

22
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.070
INT-S1 10.0.1.10.

23
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.880
That's actually configured in the Windows operating system.

24
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.440
Moving on to the next one.

25
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.610
The next definition is Inside Global address.

26
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.060
That is the NAT'd address of the inside host as it will be reached by the outside network.

27
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.420
So if somebody in the outside network is sending traffic in, what address are they going to be using

28
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.980
as their destination address?

29
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.870
So in our example, the inside global address is 203.0.113.3.

30
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.000
So Inside Local, that's the private address on the inside.

31
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.300
Inside Global is the public address that is used to reach the inside host.

32
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.150
Next one, Outside Local address.

33
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.030
That is the IP address of the outside host as it appears to the inside network.

34
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.810
So if I was a user and I went on to that server INT-S1 and sent some traffic to that host on the

35
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.330
outside, what IP address would I use?

36
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.050
Well, in that example, I would be using 203.0.113.20.

37
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.650
The last one is the Outside Global address.

38
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.450
This is the IP address assigned to the host on the outside network by the hosts owner.

39
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.090
So in our example here, it's the same again, 203.0.113.20.

40
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.700
But you may be thinking, well, OK, no, it's probably using a private IP address as well.

41
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.560
So it's not actually going to be that.

42
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.570
But the thing is, from R1's point of view, it doesn't know anything about that.

43
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.930
So router R1 in our example, knows one address to reach the outside host 203.0.113.20

44
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.890
and it does not translate that address.

45
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:54.020
So for one-way NAT, the Outside Local and Outside Global addresses will be reported as being the

46
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.410
same.

47
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.550
So looking back at the output again from our show ip nat translation command, Inside Local is the

48
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.850
private address in the inside 10.0.1.10. Inside Global is the NAT'd address

49
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.630
203.0.113.3 and then Outside Local and Outside Global are both

50
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.050
203.0.113.20 because R1 is not translating that address.

51
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.550
So it both shows up as being the same.

52
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:32.260
So now, you're probably wondering, well, when would the Outside Local and Outside Global address

53
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.890
ever be different then?

54
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.860
And here's an example of where that would happen. And it's where we're doing two-way

55
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.240
NAT. Now for the CCNA exam,

56
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.290
I'll tell you now before we get into this, that you don't really need to know 2-way NAT.

57
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.430
I'm just telling you this because if I didn't, you would be wondering about those Outside

58
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.150
addresses.

59
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.310
So you don't need to know how to configure this for the exam, but you do need to know those four

60
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.230
definitions and this is going to help you really understand about it.

61
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.620
So with 2-way NAT, where that is most commonly used is if we have a merger between two companies.

62
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:21.140
So here we've got company A and Company B, and they're both using the private IP addresses

63
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:29.930
10.10.10.0/24. So what we would do long term here is we would do IP readdressing because

64
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.150
within the same company you never want to have duplicate IP addresses on the inside.

65
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.520
But because in our scenario here, we've only just done the acquisition,

66
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.990
we haven't had time to do the IP readdressing yet, but we need immediate connectivity between most

67
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.200
hosts. To be able to do that,

68
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.920
we're going to have to do

69
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.610
2-way NAT. Now in the previous example, Static NAT, the way that that is most commonly used and it's

70
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.720
super commonly used,

71
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.630
is it's one-way NAT. When we've got, when we are sending traffic from the inside to the outside,

72
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.050
we need to NAT the private IP address to the public IP address. And that's the source address

73
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.720
we're changing, but the destination address did not need to change. When we do

74
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.240
2-way NAT, we actually change,

75
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.890
we NAT both the source and the destination address and where it's needed is for just this exact scenario

76
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.280
here where we've had a merger between two companies.

77
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.310
We need connectivity to each other and they're using the same IP addresses.

78
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.610
If they weren't using the same IP addresses, we wouldn't need to do this.

79
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.730
So in our example, 10.10.10.10 on the left and on the right as well.

80
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.960
So we're going to do NAT here.

81
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.580
And for Company A on the left, the 10.10.10.0 network,

82
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.780
we're going to NAT it to 10.10.20.0.

83
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.710
So it looks like 10.10.20.0 to the hosts on the right. And Company B on the right,

84
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.050
we're going to NAT their address to 10.10.30.0 so it looks like 10.10.30.0 to the hosts

85
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.110
on the left.

86
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:20.750
So when we send traffic from host A1 to host B1, on R1, it will translate the source

87
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.260
address from 10.10.10.10 to 10.10.20.10.

88
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.150
This is similar if we were just doing our standard NAT.

89
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:37.900
But we also need to translate the destination address from 10.10.30.10 to 10.10.10.10.

90
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:46.140
We need to translate the destination address as well because if host A1 tried to send traffic

91
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.400
to host B1's real

92
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.740
IP address 10.10.10.10,

93
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.240
well, that's itself.

94
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.550
So it would never actually get there.

95
00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:00.150
So we need to translate both the source and the destination as well for connectivity to work.

96
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.330
That is 2-way NAT. Now in the real world,

97
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.090
hopefully this is quite obvious,

98
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.010
it's very rare that you would ever need to do this.

99
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:13.230
It's really just that one scenario that I gave you, an acquisition between two companies.

100
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.720
You haven't had time to do readdressing yet and you need to have immediate connectivity.

101
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.590
So it's a very rare situation.

102
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:29.880
When we do this, so the Inside Local source IP of A1 on the left is going to be

103
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.720
10.10.10.10. The Inside Global source IP will be 10.10.20.10.

104
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.260
That's the address that we're Natting it to and that it will be presented to B1 because we can't send traffic

105
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.090
that gets to B1 that shows up is coming from 10.10.10.10 because that would be a

106
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.750
conflict.

107
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:57.120
So we're changing A1's source address to 10.10.20.10 when it communicates with B1. The Outside

108
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.260
Local destination IP, with 10.10.30.10.

109
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.020
That is the IP address that the host A1 actually sends traffic to.

110
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.980
And as far as A1 is concerned, that is the destination address.

111
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:18.180
But we also need to translate the destination address as well from 10.10.30.10 to

112
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.560
10.10.10.10, which is B1's actual IP address.

113
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:29.160
OK, so that's how to understand the output of the show ip nat translation command.

114
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:36.030
You'll actually see me using the command in the next lecture where we're going to do a lab demo of

115
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.860
how to configure Static NAT.
