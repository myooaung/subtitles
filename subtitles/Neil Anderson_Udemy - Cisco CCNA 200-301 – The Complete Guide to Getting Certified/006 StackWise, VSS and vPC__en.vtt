00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:16.510
In this lecture, you'll learn about Cisco's multi-chassis etherchannel options of StackWise, vPC and

2
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.370
VSS.

3
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.400
Matching etherchannel settings have to be configured on the switches on both sides of the link.

4
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.800
You know that already.

5
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.360
You can configure separate port channels from a switch to redundant upstream switches like you see in

6
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.710
the diagram here,

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.050
I've got my access layer Access3 switch and it has got a port channel with bundled links going up to

8
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.400
CD1 and it's got another separate port channel with other physical interfaces that are bundled in a port

9
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.500
channel going up to CD2. The problem with

10
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.959
this is that spanning-tree would see those separate port channels as two separate interfaces and it will block

11
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.670
one path if a loop is formed like it is here.

12
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.450
So in our example,

13
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.640
CD1 is the root bridge.

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.430
So the port channel from Access3 to that is going to be Forwarding.

15
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.950
But the port channel going up to CD2, would form a potential loop. So spanning-tree is going to

16
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.040
block that port channel.

17
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.090
So I've got four physical interfaces configured as uplinks here, but only two of them are Forwarding,

18
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.890
so I'm only getting half of my possible bandwidth.

19
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.750
So that brings us back to the same problem of only using half of our available physical bandwidth

20
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.290
again. We configured that same topology in the lab in the last lecture.

21
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.310
So things were better after we configured etherchannel.

22
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.060
This is how it was before we did it.

23
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.259
So again, CD1 is the root bridge and you see from Access3, it's got those four physical uplinks,

24
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.770
but only one of them was forwarding traffic, which was the interface connected to CD1 and exactly

25
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.850
the same on Access4 as well.

26
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.940
So four physical ports, only one of them forwarding traffic. After we configured etherchannel,

27
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.520
we have two out of the four forwarding traffic now rather than one.

28
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.810
So it's better.

29
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.670
And actually I've still got the lab running, so let's go on there and just verify that.

30
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.040
So I'll go on to Access3 and do a show etherchannel summary.

31
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:52.730
And you can see that I've got my two port channels, one is going up to the first core distribution

32
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.690
layer switch. The second one is going up to the second. They're both up.

33
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.910
Then I do a show spanning-tree vlan 10, which is a VLAN that my PCs are in.

34
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.100
I can see that out of those 2 port channels,

35
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.070
one of them is forwarding traffic.

36
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.660
This is the port channel connected to the root bridge and the other one is blocking because it's forming

37
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.180
a potential loop.

38
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.720
So it's still not perfect.

39
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:32.420
If we go back to the slides, there is a way that we can get this configured so that we are actually

40
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.190
forwarding on all of our physically connected uplinks.

41
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.630
And the way that we do that is with Multi-chassis EtherChannel.

42
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.520
So some switches will support that. When we configure it, the switch supports a shared etherchannel

43
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.770
from different switches.

44
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.270
So you see the diagram I've got here now. If I go back one slide, a couple of slides,

45
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.810
normally, we would have 2 separate port channels, one going up to CD1 and another one going up to

46
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:16.329
CD2. When those core distribution layer switches support multi-chassis etherchannel though, I can do a single port channel

47
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.950
which goes to both of them.

48
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.740
Now, again, the switches must be configured with matching settings.

49
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:31.030
When you configure etherchannel, you need matching settings on both sides of the links. So here,

50
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.010
Access3 has got a port channel going upstream and switches

51
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:43.420
CD1 and CD2 have got a shared port channel going downstream. So CD1 and CD2 need to be

52
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:51.290
advanced level switches that support talking to each other and having a shared port channel going downstream.

53
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.200
So that is supported on some models of Cisco switch.

54
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.310
When you do configure this, spanning-tree is still enabled, but it only sees a single logical interface

55
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.570
on both sides. It sees a port channel going upstream from Access3 and it sees a single port channel

56
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.380
going downstream from CD1 and shared with CD2.

57
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.870
So it sees that as just a single link.

58
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.520
So there's no loop there.

59
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.600
Spanning-tree does not block any of the ports.

60
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.470
We have all of them forwarding.

61
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.190
We get the full use of all of our physical bandwidth, supports full load balancing and redundancy across

62
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.270
all the interfaces.

63
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.760
If any of the interfaces goes down, it will fail over to another available interface.

64
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:50.630
So the technologies that Cisco have available that support this are StackWise, VSS and vPC.

65
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.250
Now, a single switch is not going to support all of these. Different platforms of switches, support

66
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.390
different options.

67
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.660
And if a switch does support one, it will only be one. So the switch will either support StackWise or

68
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.650
it will support VSS or it will support vPC, not two or three at the same time.

69
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.270
And this is only on the higher end switches.

70
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.390
If you've got one of Cisco's lower end switches, then this is not going to be supported.

71
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:28.940
So which option is supported on which family of switches? Well, StackWise is on Catalyst switch platforms,

72
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.140
including the

73
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.770
Catalyst 3750,

74
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.360
3850 and

75
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.500
9000.

76
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.870
Because Cisco comes out with new models of switches very regularly

77
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.080
and when we do come out with a new model of switch, it's likely to support one of these three options.

78
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.190
So this will be updated over time.

79
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.630
If you have a look at the picture here, this is a stack of switches that are being configured with StackWise.

80
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.970
StackWise uses special proprietary cables at the back of these switches.

81
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:10.070
When you do configure a StackWise stack, the separate physical switches all operate as if they are

82
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.330
one switch and they are configured as if they're one switch as well.

83
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:21.890
That is similar to the next option, which is VSS, the Virtual Switching System. That's supported on

84
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.910
the Catalyst 4500 and 6500 families.

85
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.580
And the last option is one of its own,

86
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.150
a little bit different is vPC, Virtual Port Channel. That is supported on the Nexus switches.

87
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:42.170
And rather than stacking the switches together and then being managed as if it's a single switch, when you

88
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:48.950
use this on the Nexus, they're still configured as two separate switches, but you do a matching configuration

89
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.390
on them and that allows for a shared port channel from those switches.

90
00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:00.080
OK, so those are the MCE options. At the CCNA exam level,

91
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.990
Cisco expects you to know a broad overview of them, but they don't expect you to know how to configure

92
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:13.610
these. If you go on to CCNP level or one of the other CCNA tracks like Data Center, you'll learn

93
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.660
then how to configure and monitor these technologies.
