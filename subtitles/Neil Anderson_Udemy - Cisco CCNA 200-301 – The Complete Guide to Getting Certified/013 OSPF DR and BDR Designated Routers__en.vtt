00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.680
In this lecture, you'll learn about the OSPF DR and BDR designated routers. You saw in the last letcure

2
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.200
that when you enable OSPF on a router's interface, the router will send Hello packets out that interface,

3
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.550
trying to discover other OSPF routers

4
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:36.060
that it can form an adjacency with. When two OSPF routers on the same link send Hello packets to each

5
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.670
other,

6
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.000
they will first off move into the two-way state, where they've discovered each other.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.420
They will then move into the exchange state, where they will agree to exchange routing updates with each

8
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.280
other, will then move through loading where they're exchanging the updates.

9
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.990
And finally, they'll be at the full state where they are fully adjacent and they've shared all of their

10
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.940
routing information with each other, and on point-to-point links, OSPF router pairs will always form a full

11
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.570
adjacency.

12
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.640
So point-to-point links, there can only be two routers there, so of course, they're going to want

13
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.410
to share their full information with each other. But on multiaccess segments, such as Ethernet, where there

14
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.990
can be multiple routers,

15
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.030
it's inefficient for all routers to form a full OSPF adjacency with each other.

16
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.200
If you look at the example here, you can see I've got an Ethernet segment,

17
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.410
all 4 routers are plugged into the switch, and on their interfaces connected to that switch,

18
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.490
they're all in the same IP subnet. So I've got R1 with 10.0.0.1/24, R2 with

19
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.330
10.0.0.2/24, R3 with 10.0.0.3/24, and R4 with 10.0.0.4/24.

20
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.630
So in the example, they've all got OSPF enabled on their interfaces, so they're going to be sharing OSPF information

21
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.330
out on this link here.

22
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.690
And if you think about it, it would be inefficient if that was a full mesh,

23
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.890
if they were all sharing the full information with each other, because there would be a lot of repetitive

24
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.590
information there being sent

25
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.410
out to the same link. So a better idea would be if one of these routers could be elected as a type of

26
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.320
master, and then all the routers could share the information with the master, and then it could reflect

27
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.810
that information out to the other routers.

28
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.460
So rather than having a full mesh, they just send the information to the master, and it's up to the master

29
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:38.070
to reflect it out and that is exactly what happens, and what the Master is called is the DR, the Designated

30
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.390
Router. Now, because we do have a master there,

31
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.490
obviously, that could cause a problem if the master goes down. Particularly, if a router, say, has just sent

32
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.650
an update to that master and then the master was down before it can send the update to the other routers,

33
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.850
well, that information would be lost. That would be a problem.

34
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.330
So because of that, we want to have some redundancy here. So as well as having the master, the DR, the Designated

35
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.010
Router,

36
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.780
we're also going to have a BDR, that's a Backup Designated Router as well,

37
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.990
just in case the DR goes down.

38
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.380
Okay, so let's look and see how this works. As I just said, a DR, Designated Router, and a BDR, Backup Designated

39
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.440
Router, are elected on each multiaccess segment.

40
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.920
If I go back to the diagram again here,

41
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.300
you can see all my routers, they've got an interface connected to the same multiaccess segment. So the DR

42
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.990
and the BDR, it acts at the interface level, not at the entire router level.

43
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.850
If, for example, R1 had another interface, which was also connected to an Ethernet segment,

44
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.380
that separate segment would also have its own DR and BDR elected as well.

45
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.280
So the DR and BDR, it's at the interface level and it works like this on all multiaccess segments,

46
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:05.600
such as Ethernet. The router with the highest priority becomes the DR and the router with the second highest priority,

47
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:13.150
not surprisingly, becomes the BDR. The default priority on the routers is 1, and the higher the number,

48
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.440
the better, the more preferred. The possible values are 0 to 255, with 255 being the best possible

49
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.079
value.

50
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.750
If you configure a value of 0, that means that that router will never be the Designated Router, and the

51
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.030
highest router ID is used in the case of a tie.

52
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.220
So if you don't explicitly set the priority, all the routers on the link are all going to have the same priority

53
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.980
of 1.

54
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.680
We still need to have a DR elected. The one that is going to be elected as the DR is the one with

55
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.350
the highest router ID, and in the real world, that is what will typically happen. Because if you've got

56
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.530
routers that are connected to the same link, they're probably going to be very similar model of routers

57
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.470
anyway.

58
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.390
This just really not put a lot of load on routers,

59
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.070
so normally, you're not going to really care which one is the DR.

60
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.500
You just need to understand how this works,

61
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.110
so that if you do have problems, you can troubleshoot it. But as far as configuring anything, typically, real world,

62
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.400
you'll just leave the routers to figure it out themselves as to which one is going to be the DR.

63
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.370
In the CCNA exam, you might be asked to configure one as the DR though, so you need to understand how

64
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.130
this works, and you need to know how to configure priority as well.

65
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.840
Okay.

66
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.630
When this happens on multiaccess segments, such as the Ethernet, the routers elect the DR and BDR

67
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.780
at the 2-way stage,

68
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.450
if you remember of stages from the last lecture. When the routers have not discovered each other

69
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.710
yet,

70
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.550
the OSPF state is down.

71
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.420
They then send Hellos when they discover each other through the Hello messages,

72
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.170
then they move to the 2-way stage.

73
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.540
So at the 2-way stage, they have not started exchanging any routing information yet.

74
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.220
They then move through the exchange, the loading, and the full states. So with the DR and the BDR election,

75
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.890
that happens at the 2-way stage before the routing information has been exchanged.

76
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.370
And if you think about it, that makes sense because we don't want all the routers exchanging the full

77
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.610
information with each other, just with the DR and the BDR.

78
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.420
So, we need to have this set up before routing information is exchanged between the routers. Now, the

79
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.650
election just happens on multiaccess segments. On the router, it knows that that interface is an Ethernet interface,

80
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.090
so it knows that there needs to be a DR elected there.

81
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.290
If there was another, say, a Serial interface with a point-to-point link, then the router knows that is a

82
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.340
point-to-point link, and there's not going to be a DR elected on that link.

83
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.090
There are a few types of connections which could be either point-to-point or multipoint, like that can

84
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.950
happen with Frame Relay, which is not covered in the CCNA anymore.

85
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.480
Some of those older legacy interfaces, you do need to specify whether it is point-to-point or a

86
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.600
multiaccess segment. But for the CCNA exam, you don't need to know that. Okay,

87
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:09.040
so if we do want to manually set which of the routers is the DR, we use the command,

88
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.800
again, this is at the interface level,

89
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.240
so I've got 'interface FastEthernet 0/0', 'ip ospf priority 100'.

90
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.120
As long as you set it more than 1, that is going to be the preferred router. If you wanted to configure

91
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.940
a DR and a BDR, you could configure the DR with 100, for example, and the BDR with 50,

92
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.850
for example. If you want to specify that a router will not become a Designated Router, then you can set

93
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.130
'ip ospf priority 0' on the interface.

94
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.370
Now, after you've configured this command on the interface, it's not going to actually make anything happen.

95
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.330
It's not going to take effect until OSPF has been restarted on that interface.

96
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.560
So, how could you do that?

97
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:54.920
Well, you could reboot the router, or you could shutdown the interface and and bring it back up again, or at the enable

98
00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.960
prompt, you could use the 'clear ip ospf command' to restart the OSPF process.

99
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.570
Obviously, all of those would be disruptive,

100
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.790
so be careful if you're going to do it in a production environment.

101
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.930
The DR and BDR establish full neighbor state with all routers on the network segment.

102
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:20.550
The neighbor state of other routers remains in a two-way state and they do not directly exchange routes

103
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.870
with each other.

104
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:28.770
So for example, on the example topology we had at the start of the lecture where we had R1, R2,

105
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.760
R3 and R4,

106
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.150
let's say that R1 is the DR and R2 is the BDR. Well, R1 and R2 will go to the full

107
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.309
state with all of the other routers. On R3 and R4,

108
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:47.220
they will go to the full state with R1 and R2 because those are the Designated Routers.

109
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.800
But if you look at the state between R3 and R4, because neither one of those is a Designated

110
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.580
Router, they will just be in the two-way state with each other.

111
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:02.770
So routers which are not a Designated Router will just have a two-way relationship with each other.

112
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.410
They're not exchanging full routing information directly with each other.

113
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.810
The R3 and R4 will still learn each other's routes though, because that will be reflected

114
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:19.610
down from the Designated Router. So when a link state changes on a router, if there's a new link comes up

115
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.580
or if a link goes down, and that's connected to multiaccess segment,

116
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:31.690
it sends a multicast LSU, Link State Update, packet to 224.0.0.6, which is the multicast address

117
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:38.720
for all Designated Routers. So it's just to the DR and the BDR that are listening in for packets that is sent

118
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.270
to that address. So again, with our example, if any of the routers, R1, R2, R3, or R4, sees a

119
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:51.890
link state change, it will send an update about that to 224.0.0.6, and both the DR

120
00:09:52.010 --> 00:10:00.460
and the BDR will learn about that change. Then, just the DR, not the BDR as well, the DR multicasts the update to

121
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:07.250
224.0.0.5, all OSPF routers, so all OSPF routers on the link will learn about it. So that's why

122
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:14.540
when there is any changes, it's just sent to the DR and the BDR. The DR then sends that out to the other routers on

123
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:20.840
the link, so if there's any change anywhere, all the routers on the link will still learn about it. Okay, so that's

124
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:28.280
how the DR and the BDR work. In the next lecture, I'll show you how to verify what's happening, which

125
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.160
routers are the DR and the BDR, also how to influence what ones they will be if you want to do that,

126
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.360
with a lab demo.
