00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.780
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure inter-VLAN routing using a Layer 3 switch with a

2
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.810
lab demo.

3
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.710
So here's the lab topology,

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.920
it's the same as usual.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.720
We've got SW1 through to SW3, and we've got our Engineering and our Sales PCs plugged

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.250
in there.

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.980
I've already configured all of the Layer 2 VLAN configuration, so I've configured trunks going

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.440
through from SW1 to SW3.

9
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.870
I've configured my Sales and Engineering VLAN and I've configured my access ports to put the correct PC

10
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.950
into the correct VLAN. Let's verify that first.

11
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.470
So I'll go on to SW1,

12
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.070
and if I do a 'show interface gigEthernet0/1 switchport',

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:09.900
I see that that is configured as a trunk and it's using Native VLAN 199, and if I do a 'show vlan brief',

14
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.150
I can see that my VLANs are being configured, and I've put the correct ports into the correct VLANs.

15
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.980
Let's check that everything is working okay

16
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:28.240
at Layer 2, so I go onto my ENG PC, I'll ping ENG2 at 10.10.10.11, which is on the same switch

17
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.460
and that's working fine, and ping 10.10.10.12 over on the other side on SW3,

18
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:44.020
and that's all good too. Obviously, if I try to ping 10.10.20.10, a PC in the Sales VLAN,

19
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.100
that's not going to work because I haven't configured my routing yet. So, let's do the inter-VLLAN

20
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.260
routing first.

21
00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:03.840
So if we have a look back at the topology diagram, I'm going to use SW2 as my Layer 3 switch.

22
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:12.030
I'm going to configure SVIs on here for VLAN 10 and for VLAN 20,

23
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970
so, let's do that now.

24
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.770
So on SW2, I'll go to the enable prompt and then global configuration,

25
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.890
and let's just check what we've got on here already.

26
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.120
So if I do a 'do show ip interface brief',

27
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.720
you see that I've only got the physical interfaces apart from I do have my one VLAN interface, which

28
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.610
is VLAN 1.

29
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.390
If I do

30
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.060
a 'do show vlan brief',

31
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.640
I have already configured the VLANs on here.

32
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.630
I don't have any access ports on this switch.

33
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.710
Okay, the first thing I need to do is to enable IP routing on the switch, to allow it to route between

34
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.330
different IP subnets. The command to do that is just 'ip routing'.

35
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.620
Next, I need to configure my SVIs for my Engineering and Sales VLANs.

36
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.930
So to do that,

37
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.370
I create 'interface vlan 10', which is the Engineering VLAN.

38
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.170
It's a logical interface, so I see

39
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.340
it comes up immediately, and I'm going to add IP address 10.10.10.1 with

40
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.350
a /24 subnet mask.

41
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:38.530
I also need to configure my interface for VLAN 20 and it's going to be IP address 10.10.20.1

42
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.490
25.255.255.0.

43
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.650
So that's all I need to do, enable IP routing and create my SVIs,

44
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:58.030
and now my PCs should be able to route to each other. So let's go on to on ENG1 and try pinging

45
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.050
over to the Sales

46
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.210
VLAN at 10.10.20.10 again.

47
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.530
Again, it will probably drop the first ping or two, and there we go,

48
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.180
it's now working.

49
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.800
So that's all I had to do to configure my inter-VLAN connectivity using a Layer 3 switch.

50
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:26.500
But if we go back to the topology diagram again, I also want to have external connectivity as well.

51
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.760
Right now, my PCs, so Engineering and Sales PCs, inside the campus have got connectivity to each other,

52
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.690
but I want them to have connectivity outbound as well.

53
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:46.870
So I need to configure routes from SW2 up to R1, and from R1 up to the Service

54
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.560
Provider, SP1.

55
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.100
So we were already on the switch, let's do the switch again.

56
00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:00.000
So that's going to be on interface fastEthernet0/1, so on SW2, if I do a 'show ip interface brief',

57
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.750
I see that my VLAN interfaces will show up in here now, but I haven't configured the IP

58
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.900
address on fastEthernet0/1 yet.

59
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.170
Let me show you what happens if I try to do it

60
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:27.870
while it's a Layer 2 switchport. So I'll go 'interface fastEthernet0/1' and say 'ip address 10.10.100.1 255.255.255.0'.

61
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.160
It's going to give me an error message saying you can't configure an IP address on here.

62
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:42.250
What I need to do first is say 'no switchport'. That converts the physical port to a Layer 3 port,

63
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.740
meaning that I can put an IP address on it.

64
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.310
So if I now try the IP address command again, I don't get the switch complaining, and I'll do a 'no shutdown' 

65
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.030
on here, and then a 'show ip interface brief',

66
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.960
and I can see that the interface is configured. It's down, down right now because I haven't configured

67
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.170
the interface on the other side over on R1.

68
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.350
So, let's do that next.

69
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:22.310
So I'll go onto R1, 'config t', and what most places normally do is if you've got a fastEthernet0/0 and

70
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.870
a fastEthernet0/1, use fastEthernet0/0 as the outside because the '0' looks

71
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.670
kind of like an 'O', and use fastEthernet0/1 as the inside because the '1' looks like an 'I' for

72
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.200
inside.

73
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.070
This keeps things a little bit more logical.

74
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.510
So this is going to be interface fastEthernet0/1 on the inside, and I'll configure IP address

75
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.470
10.10.100.2, because it was 10.10.100.1 on the switch.

76
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.290
I'm using a /24 mask here,

77
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.830
real-world,

78
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.640
you'd probably use a /30, and do a 'no shutdown'.

79
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:03.200
I also need to configure my outside interface, which was fastEthernet0/0, IP address

80
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:13.340
203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0 and 'no shutdown' here as well.

81
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.270
Let's check that

82
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.700
the interfaces have come up

83
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.050
okay, so I'll do a

84
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.880
'show ip interface brief'. They're up, up, so that's looks good.

85
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.600
I'll check

86
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.260
I can ping out to the Service Provider from R1, so ping

87
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.220
203.0.113.2, 

88
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:41.460
and that's working okay as well. Let's check I can ping my PCs on the inside from R1, so I'll ping Eng1

89
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:48.240
at 'ping 10.10.10.10', and that is working okay.

90
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.810
Alright, so I still need to check I can ping from the PCs on the inside to the outside.

91
00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:00.300
So from ENG1, I'll ping 203.0.113.2.

92
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:12.670
Okay, I'm getting a destination unreachable from the default gateway, which is SW2, so I've probably

93
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.750
forgot to put the route on SW2. Let's check that.

94
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.000
So on SW2, I'll do a 'show ip route'. I should have a static default

95
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.360
route

96
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.160
pointing upstream to R1,

97
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.180
and that's the problem,

98
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.910
I forgot to put the route on SW2. So let's fix that, I'll say 

99
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.929
'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

100
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:46.130
and actually point out to R1 at 10.10.100.2. I'll check I can ping out

101
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:52.870
to the Service Provider from SW2 now, so 'ping 203.0.113.2',

102
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.310
and that's looking good.

103
00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.860
So, I think we should be okay now. I'll try the ping again from the Engineering PC and yep, it can ping

104
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.720
out to the Internet.

105
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.920
So we're all good,

106
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:13.750
we've got connectivity going everywhere, and we've got the Layer 3 switches switched to acting as

107
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.890
the default gateway for all of the PCs.

108
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.190
Okay, so that was all of our different inter-VLAN routing options.

109
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.080
See you in the next section.
