00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.540
In this lecture, you'll learn about the different Spanning Tree versions.

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.130
There have been a few different versions over time, which have improved on the previous versions.

3
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.910
Now, when I was first learning about this from other sources, it was super confusing.

4
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:35.480
But there is actually a simple way to explain it, which is by breaking it down into the open standards

5
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.340
and also into the Cisco proprietary versions.

6
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.000
So that's what I'm going to do for you here,

7
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:52.780
starting off with the open standards. The first original implementation of Spanning Tree was 802.1D.

8
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.620
That uses one Spanning Tree for all of the different VLANs in the LAN,

9
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:08.240
so just one instance for everything. That was improved with version 802.1w, which is

10
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.680
Rapid Spanning Tree.

11
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:19.280
So that improved Spanning Tree by significantly improving the convergence time. With 802.1D, it can

12
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.740
take up to 50 seconds for an interface to make sure that there's no loops there and transition into

13
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:36.170
the forwarding state. With Rapid Spanning Tree, that gets down to typically a few seconds. Rapid Spanning

14
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.410
Tree also uses one Spanning Tree instance for all

15
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.780
VLANs in the LAN.

16
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.390
The latest of the industry standards is 802.1s, which is Multiple Spanning Tree. That

17
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.740
enables grouping and mapping VLANs into different Spanning Tree instances, which allows you to

18
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.580
do load balancing.

19
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.940
To summarise, 802.1D, the original implementation,

20
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.690
it's got very slow convergence time and it doesn't support any load balancing. 802.1w

21
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.230
came out after that, which improved the convergence time, but also did not support load balancing.

22
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.280
The latest one, 802.1s, builds on Rapid Spanning Tree by keeping the improved convergence

23
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.700
time

24
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.910
and it also enables load balancing as well.

25
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.610
So let's have a look and see how the load balancing works.

26
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.510
The Access Layer switches in our example here, have got PCs which are attached in multiple different VLANs.

27
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.280
We're going to make CD1, the Core Distribution Switch 1, the Root Bridge for VLANs 10 to 19.

28
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.890
So now, traffic for those VLANs is going to be forwarded on the link to CD1 and blocked on the link

29
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.970
to CD2.

30
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.120
So we're looking at it from the point of view of our Access Layer switch, Acc3 here. So when we configure

31
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.420
this, traffic for VLANs 10 to 19 are going to go up the uplink to CD1.

32
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.380
CD2 is going to be made the Root Bridge for VLANs 20 to 29.

33
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.860
So traffic for those

34
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.570
VLANs are going to go up the link to CD2, and it will be blocked on CD1. So half my traffic goes in

35
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.010
the uplink to CD1, half the traffic goes in the uplink to CD2.

36
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.140
If either one of those uplinks fails, then all traffic will failover to using the one link, and with

37
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.860
MSTP, Multiple Spanning Tree, we're going to have two Spanning Tree instances running, one for each

38
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.420
group of VLANs.

39
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.060
So that's how it allows us to do load balancing,

40
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.760
and those were the open standards.

41
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.860
Okay, next up, we'll look at the Cisco

42
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.300
proprietary versions.

43
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:05.770
The first one is PVST+. This came out around the same time as 802.1D, but it included Cisco's

44
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.940
enhancements.

45
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.560
The main enhancement is it uses a separate Spanning Tree instance for every VLAN.

46
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.240
So Per VLAN Spanning Tree+ (PVST+) allows you to do load balancing, the same as Multiple

47
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.330
Spanning Tree does.

48
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.390
But because this came out about the same time as the original 802.1D, it's got the same issues

49
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.450
with having a very long convergence time.

50
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.290
PVST+ is the default on Cisco switches. So the default on Cisco switches,

51
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.680
you've got a separate Spanning Tree instance for every single VLAN and it's got slow convergence time.

52
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.950
The next Cisco version was Rapid Per VLAN Spanning Tree+ (RPVST+).

53
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.520
This came out at around the same time as 802.1w which, if you remember from the open standards

54
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.050
was the second implementation, which had a faster convergence time.

55
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.840
So Rapid PVST+ also significantly improves the convergence time over PVST+. Like PVST+,

56
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:19.090
it uses a separate Spanning Tree instance for every VLAN. Now MST, the industry standard,

57
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.620
with that, you can group multiple VLANs into the same Spanning Tree instance.

58
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.360
But with the Cisco versions, PVST+ and RPVST+, they use a separate Spanning Tree

59
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.430
instance for every single individual VLAN.

60
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.200
So looking at the load balancing with PVST+ or Rapid PVST+, same example that we covered before,

61
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.930
and again here, CD1 is going to be made the Root Bridge for VLANs 10 to 19.

62
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.060
CD2 is the Root Bridge for VLANs 20 to 29. So VLANs 10 to 19

63
00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.570
go over the left hand path up to CD1, VLANs 20 to 29 go over the right hand path 

64
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.470
to CD2.

65
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.560
So far, it's looking exactly the same as MST.

66
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.170
The difference is with MST, we grouped the VLANs. So with MST,

67
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.050
we had one group going up the left hand side,

68
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.600
we had another group going up the right hand side.

69
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.810
So we had two Spanning Tree instances. With PVST+ and Rapid PVST+,

70
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.550
you can't group the VLANs.

71
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.590
You have a separate instance for each one.

72
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.370
So rather than having two total instances like we had with MST, here we're going to have 20 separate

73
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.930
instances, one for each individual VLAN.

74
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.680
So the Cisco versions PVST+ and Rapid PVST+, they put a bit more load on the switch because

75
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.710
it has to calculate Spanning Tree instances at the VLAN level rather than being able to do it at

76
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.640
the group level.

77
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.970
Okay, so those are the different versions of Spanning Tree.

78
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.330
For which versions will be supported on your switch,

79
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.440
it depends on the particular model of switch that you're using.

80
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.800
PVST+ will always be supported.

81
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.180
That will be the default.

82
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:16.560
It will usually also support Rapid PVST+ as well and possibly, depending on the model of switch,

83
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.930
it may also support MST,

84
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.970
the open standard Multiple

85
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:28.350
Spanning Tree. One last thing to tell you, PVST+, which is the default on Cisco switches will assign

86
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.580
the Root, Designated, or Alternate role to ports.

87
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.800
We spoke about our Root, and our Designated, and our Blocking ports in the last lecture,

88
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.660
just giving you terminology here.

89
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.430
The Alternate ports are your Blocking ports with PVST+.

90
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.240
Okay, that was the whole thing. We'll look next at

91
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:53.250
how to actually monitor and verify Spanning Tree in the next lecture.
