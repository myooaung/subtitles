00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:17.030
In this lecture, you'll learn about ACL, Access Control List. An ACL identifies traffic based on characteristics

2
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:26.540
of the packet that's going to go through the router such as its source IP address and/or its destination

3
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.500
IP address and/or the layer four port number. The router or switch can take an action

4
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.870
then, based on the result of the ACL. ACLs are supported on both routers and switches.

5
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.710
But if I say router or switch, router and switch, every time in this section, I'll be saying it 500 times

6
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.310
a lecture.

7
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.590
So I would just refer to routers.

8
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.790
But whenever I say routers, it applies to switches as well.

9
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.379
The original use of ACL was a security feature which helped decide if traffic should be allowed to

10
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.370
pass through the router or not. And if you talk to somebody about ACL, that's still normally the first thing

11
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.450
they will think about. By default, a router will allow all traffic to pass between its interfaces and by default,

12
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.840
ACLs are not applied.

13
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.220
But when ACLs are applied, the router identifies traffic and then decides if it will be allowed or not.

14
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.050
But ACLs are not just used for security nowadays, but are also used in many other software policies

15
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.210
when traffic has to be identified. For example, to identify traffic, to give better service to in

16
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.110
a QoS, Quality of Service policy, or to identify traffic to translate to a different IP address

17
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.030
and a NAT, Network Address

18
00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.830
Translation policy. We'' be covering both QoS and NAT in later sections and you'll see how to use ACLs

19
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.880
to control them then.

20
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.710
Access control lists are made up of Access Control Entries, ACE, which are a series of permit or

21
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.610
deny rules. And each ACE is written in a separate line that makes up the ACL.

22
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.520
So here's an example of an access control entry. The command syntax is access-list to start, then a number

23
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.610
such as 100. There's actually special meaning to the numbers. We'll get to that in the next lecture.

24
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.820
Then the action, which will be a permit or deny, then the protocol such as TCP or UDP or ICMP.

25
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.540
Then we get to the source section and there is a field for the IP, and then for the wildcard mask, then

26
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.050
a qualifier such as a less than or greater than or equal and then the source port number.

27
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.920
Then the next section is about the destination.

28
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.960
We've got the destination IP address, the destination wildcard mask, a qualifier again and then the

29
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.490
destination port.

30
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.630
So that is the syntax of an access control entry.

31
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.460
And when we're writing our access control list, it's made up of multiple access control entries.

32
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.280
So you can see here's an example of an ACL.

33
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.720
We've got access-list 100 deny tcp,

34
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.190
10.10.10.10

35
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.170
0.0.0.0.

36
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.240
So that would be the particular host. When the source port number is greater than 49151,

37
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.500
and it's going a destination 10.10.50.10

38
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.760
0.0.0.0, so it's going a particular host again and when the destination port number is 23. And then

39
00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.800
we've got three other access control entries and all of these together make up the rules that control

40
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.450
the traffic that's going to be allowed or not allowed going through the router.

41
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.870
OK, so that is an overview of access control list.

42
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.400
In the next lecture we're going to start digging deeper into the syntax of the ACL, starting with that

43
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.390
number at the start.

44
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.710
100 in this example and what that means.

45
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.920
See you in the next lecture.
