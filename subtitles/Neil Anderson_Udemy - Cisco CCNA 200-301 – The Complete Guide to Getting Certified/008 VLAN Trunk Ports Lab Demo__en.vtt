00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:15.690
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure VLAN trunk ports with a lab demo. So the lab topology now,

2
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.010
we've got SW1, SW2, and SW, and at SW1 and SW3,

3
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.510
we've got both Engineering and Sales clients.

4
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:37.020
The Engineering PCs are in the 10.10.10.0/24 IP subnet, and in the ENG VLAN, and the

5
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.160
Sales PCs are in the 10.10.20.0/24 IP subnet in the SALES VLAN.

6
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.230
Right now, we're carrying on from the last lab demo.

7
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.210
So I've already configured SW1,

8
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.510
I've put the Engineering PCs and the Sales PC into the correct VLAN.

9
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.370
I haven't configured the trunk port over to SW2 yet, and I haven't configured SW2 or SW3

10
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.000
at all.

11
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.340
So, let's have a look at that.

12
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.770
So I'll go on to SW1,

13
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.700
and if I do a 'show vlan brief', you can see that the correct ports for the PCs are configured to

14
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.060
put them into the correct VLAN.

15
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.970
But the interface that is going across to the other switch of Gig0/1 is not configured yet,

16
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.810
and if I do a 'show interface GigabitEthernet0/1 switchport', you can see it's got the

17
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:52.650
default configuration from modern switch, where it is currently an access port and it is in VLAN 1.

18
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.150
So, I need to configure that to be a trunk port.

19
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.720
So I'll go to global configuration, and actually, before I configure the interface, I'm going to want

20
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.880
to configure the Native VLAN on here and I don't want to use the default VLAN of 1 because there

21
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.950
are some security issues with that.

22
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.160
So, I'm going to create a dedicated VLAN to be used as the Native VLAN.

23
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm not going to have any actual production traffic in this VLAN though, so I will create a VLAN.

24
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.320
I'll use a number that I'm not using elsewhere in production, 199 for example, and you can

25
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.430
name it anything you like.

26
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.270
I will name this Native, to give it a descriptive name. Now, I'm ready to configure my interface.

27
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.850
So I'll go to interface GigabitEthernet0/1 and I'll say 'switchport mode trunk', to configure

28
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.440
it as a trunk port.

29
00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.140
Now, if this was an older switch, it would support both ISL and Dot1Q trunking, and ISL was

30
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.160
never used any more.

31
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:14.340
We always want to use Dot1Q. So to check that, I'll put in the command 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q',

32
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.900
and I'm getting an error message now because this is a newer switch.

33
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.940
It only actually supports Dot1Q,

34
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.690
but it didn't do any harm putting that command in to check.

35
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.860
I also need to set the Native VLAN,

36
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:39.510
so I'll say 'switchport trunk native vlan 199', changing it from the default of 1, and that's

37
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.790
everything I need to do on that port.

38
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.280
I need to configure the other side as well, also to be a trunk.

39
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.500
So that was on SW2, also an interface gig0/1.

40
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.320
So let's go onto SW2, I'll do a 'show vlan brief' on here.

41
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.880
You can see it's a brand new switch.

42
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.070
I haven't configured anything on it yet, so I need to configure my VLANs first.

43
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:13.000
So I'll go to global configuration and configure VLAN 10, which was named Eng; VLAN 20,

44
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.160
named Sales; and VLAN 199, named Native.

45
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.960
This has to have a consistent configuration with my other switches in the campus.

46
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.870
Then, I configure my interface.

47
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.080
So it was 'interface GigabitEthernet0/1', 'switchport mode trunk',

48
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.790
to set it as a trunkport.

49
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.070
I'm going to use the abbreviated command here.

50
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.070
I just say 'switch mode trunk' to save me typing in the whole word of switchport,

51
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:53.430
and it's currently set to trunk encapsulation auto, so I need to change this to

52
00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:04.560
'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q' to set it to Dot1Q trunking first, and then I'll try 'switchport mode trunk',

53
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.540
and it works okay now.

54
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:15.540
So this is an older switch, this supports Dot1Q and ISL. Before I can configure it as a trunk port, I need

55
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.420
to say 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q'. So, that's done. The last thing,

56
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.960
don't forget to also set the Native VLAN, the trunk won't come up properly if you don't do that,

57
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.510
so 'switchport trunk native vlan 199'.

58
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.970
So, that's the trunk configured going over to the left to SW1.

59
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.190
Another thing I could do here, real-world,

60
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.460
you'd want to do this is put a description on here, so I could say 'description Trunk to SW1'.

61
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.120
I also need to do the trunk on the right hand side

62
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.940
going to SW3.

63
00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:04.530
So that's on interface GigEthernet0/2, and I need to say 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q',

64
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.290
'switchport mode trunk',

65
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:19.480
and 'switchport trunk native vlan 199'.

66
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:32.860
Okay, so that is SW2 configured now. If I do a 'show vlan brief', I can see that all of my VLANs

67
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.600
have been configured,

68
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:45.070
and if I do a 'show interface gig0/1 switchport', I can see that rather than being the default

69
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:54.730
of an access port and VLAN 1, this is now administrative mode is trunk.

70
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.750
The operational mode is down right now, because the trunk hasn't come up.

71
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.290
Okay, let's do a 

72
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:10.150
'show ip interface brief' and I can see that

73
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:19.030
GigabitEthernet0/1 is, for some reason, administratively down.

74
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.690
So, there's a problem there.

75
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:29.940
So let's go to global config again, and 'interface gig0/1' and do a 'no shutdown',

76
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.610
and that should fix that problem. While we're here,

77
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.900
while we're waiting for our interface to come up properly,

78
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:44.590
you see we got an error message from CDP saying there's a Native mismatch discovered on gig0/2.

79
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.310
That's on the interface which is facing SW3.

80
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:54.580
It's because we haven't configured SW3 with the trunk port in the Native VLAN 199 yet.

81
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.730
Once we do that, the error message will go away.

82
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:04.990
Okay, so let's try the 'show interface switchport' command again for gig0/1,

83
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:14.290
and now I can see that the operational mode has come up as a trunk, it was down before, so it's a

84
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.280
trunk port and the Native VLAN is 199.

85
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.310
So, that is looking good now.

86
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.060
Lat switch that

87
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.400
we need to configure is SW3.

88
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.800
So let's go on there,

89
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.429
and we need to configure the VLANs again. So I'll go to global configuration, 'vlan 10', 'name Eng',

90
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:44.530
'vlan 20', 'name Sales', and 'vlan 199', 'name Native'.

91
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.210
So I've created my VLANs,

92
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.370
now I need to configure the trunk port

93
00:08:48.370 --> 00:09:01.930
going back to SW2. That was on interface gig0/2 on SW3, and I will say 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q'.

94
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.760
I get an error message because it's a newer switch,

95
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:20.360
that's no problem. Then 'switchport mode trunk', and 'switchport trunk native vlan 199'.

96
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.880
So that is my trunk port configured, and I see I get

97
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:33.390
the message, 'Port consistency is restored.' Let's just check that this one isn't shut down,

98
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:46.660
so I'll do a 'show ip interface brief' and gigEthernet0/2 is up, up, that looks good, and I'll do a 'show interface gigEthernet0/2 switchport',

99
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:56.580
and I can see that the operational mode is trunk and it's up, that looks good, and the Native VLAN is 199.

100
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.120
So, I'm trunking all the way end-to-end across my switches now.

101
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:06.440
The last thing I need to do is configure my access ports for my PCs on SW3.

102
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:12.300
So let's have a look at the topology and see which ports are which, 

103
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:20.480
so fastEthernet0/1 and fastEthernet0/2 are for the SALES VLAN and fastEthernet0/3 is for ENG VLAN.

104
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.940
So, let's configure that.

105
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:31.450
That was on SW3, back to global configuration, and I'll do interface range so I can configure

106
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:39.340
both of the Sales ports at the same time. So 'interface range fastEthernet0/1 - 2',
                                                                 

107
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:52.460
'switchport mode access', and 'switchport access vlan 20' was for Sales, and then 'interface fastEthernet0/3', 

108
00:10:52.460 --> 00:11:03.310
again, 'switchport mode access', and this one is 'switchport access vlan 10' for my Engineering

109
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.060
PC, and that's it. That's the configuration completed.

110
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:12.850
Last thing I need to do is check that it actually works and that we've got connectivity.

111
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.520
Let me just do some verification on the switch

112
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:23.200
first, so I'll do a 'show vlan brief' and I can see that my VLANs are created and the correct ports are

113
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.120
in the correct VLANs.

114
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.320
I already checked the trunk port going back to SW2, so that all

115
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.010
looks good.

116
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.580
So next, I'll go onto one of my PCs.

117
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:42.250
I'll go onto the ENG1 PC. I will ping ENG2, which is on the same switch.

118
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.540
So I don't need my trunks to be working for this, that's at 10.10.10.11,

119
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.200
and that is working okay.

120
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.160
Okay, the moment of truth.

121
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.310
Let's try pinging 10.10.10.12. If we look at the topology diagram

122
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:06.350
again, so I'm pinging from ENG1, which is connected to SW1, over to ENG3 at 10.10.10.12,

123
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.110
which is on SW3.

124
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.790
So, we need to have end-to-end connectivity now. So let's try the ping, and great,

125
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.370
the ping worked.

126
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.650
So that is all good.

127
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:26.770
I'll also check that the Sales VLAN is working, so I'll go on to SALES1. Actually, just before I go

128
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.650
onto SALES1, let's have a look at the topology diagram again.

129
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.470
So SALES1 is connected to SW3,

130
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.470
I'm going to ping across to SALES3 on SW1.

131
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:45.070
So I need to ping 10.10.20.12, so 'ping 10.10.20.12',

132
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.200
and that's all good as well.

133
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.440
If I look back at the topology diagram again,

134
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.070
notice 

135
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:59.410
that I don't have a router here, so I'm not going to be able to ping between my different VLANs, between

136
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.260
my different IP subnets. To be able to do that,

137
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.630
I would need a router. Just to prove it to you that, you know, this isn't going to work anyway,

138
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:14.170
so from ENG1, if I tried to ping a Sales PC, let's ping 10.10.20.11,

139
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.980
this is going to fail because there's no router there.

140
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:26.290
We're going to have a look in a later lecture in this section about how we do allow for inter-VLAN

141
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:26.970
routing.

142
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.600
Okay, see you in the next lecture.
