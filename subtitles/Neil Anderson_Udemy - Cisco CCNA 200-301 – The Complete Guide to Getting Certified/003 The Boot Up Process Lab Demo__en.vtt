00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.560
In this lecture, we're going to go through a demo in the lab of the boot up process, and letï¿½s talk

2
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.070
about the different memory locations there again as well. So, the lab topology,

3
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.560
we've got R1 on the left, which has got IP address 10.10.10.1.

4
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.970
It's connected to SW1, which has got IP address 10.10.10.2 on its VLAN 1

5
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.050
SVI,

6
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.800
and we've got a TFTP server on 10.10.10.10.

7
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:49.910
Now, I'm using Packet Tracer for this lab because if you use one of the other virtual labs, it doesn't

8
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.290
support playing about it with the different images in Flash, but Packet Tracer does. The other way

9
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.360
that you can do it is by using real devices,

10
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.180
but I didn't want to be messing around with the IOS images on real devices. It's easier to do it in Packet

11
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.720
Tracer.

12
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.510
So, I recommend you use Packet Tracer if you want to follow along with this as well.

13
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.080
Okay,

14
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.480
so that's what the lab topology looks like.

15
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:26.690
So let's jump onto R1 and have a look at the boot up process. So I'll do a 'reload' and hit Enter to

16
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.980
confirm.

17
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:39.430
You can see that Readonly ROMMON was initialized first, and then if I just scroll back a bit here

18
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.730
now after ROMMON, it self decompresses the image.

19
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.010
So this is the system image that is in Flash,

20
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.510
and it is decompressing it because it's in an archive format, kind of like a ZIP file.

21
00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:03.480
So it decompresses it, and it loads it into RAM memory. And then, the system will boot up. I press Return to

22
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.070
get started, go into the enable prompt, and that's the system booted up. After it finished loading the

23
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:19.290
system image, which you can see here, the next thing it did after that was it loaded the startup-config

24
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:28.110
from NVRAM, again into RAM, the working memory on the router, where it becomes the running-config.

25
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.240
So on the router here, if I do a 'show version,' I'll be able to see what the system image is. I just scroll

26
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.870
up to the top of that command, and I can see that this is on a 2900 series router,

27
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:56.130
and I'm running version 15.1(4)M4. And if I do a 'show flash', I'll see that the system image is in there.

28
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.550
There it is, and it's the only system image that is there right now.

29
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.460
Now, you can actually delete the system image out of Flash.

30
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:15.300
So, let's go ahead and do that. I'll copy the file name here and I'll enter the command 'delete flash:' and

31
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.700
then the name of the file. I'll paste it in and hit Enter. It asks me to confirm. "Are you sure you want

32
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.700
to delete that file name?" It asks me to confirm again, and I'll say yes. If I do a 'show flash' again

33
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.010
now, you'll see that

34
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.430
the file is no longer there. Now, the system is still up, I can still get to 'config t', I can still enter configuration

35
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.350
commands in here, and the router will still keep running just fine.

36
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.490
The reason is that when the system boots up, the system image is loaded from Flash into RAM, and

37
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.260
that is the working memory.

38
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.040
So as long as this system is up and running, I'm not going to have a problem.

39
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.180
A problem is going to come when the system next reboots.

40
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.270
So, let's do that.

41
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.890
I'll do a 'reload'.

42
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.300
Yep,

43
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.240
and it wouldn't be as quick as just in a physical router,

44
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.640
but you see, when it goes to boot up again, it can't boot up. It boots up into ROMMON mode because it wasn't

45
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.070
able to find a system image in Flash. So real world,

46
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.120
be very careful that you don't do that. Actually, on older routers and switches it's quite easy to do it

47
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.260
because on some of the older images, by default, if you copy anything into Flash, it will ask you, "Do you

48
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.960
want to delete everything that is already there?"

49
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.250
And if you're not really thinking and you go ahead and do that, and just copying some other file into

50
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.790
Flash, then you'll lose your system image that way.

51
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:52.050
So, just be careful. Do not delete the system image out of Flash, because if you do, it's a pain to recover it.

52
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.010
Let's have a look and see how you do recover it now.

53
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.600
So,

54
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.560
I'll go to a browser.

55
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.580
I've got Firefox open here, and in Google, you see that I searched for "Cisco 2900 ROMMON

56
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.800
recovery" because that's the model of router I'm on there.

57
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:19.590
And then, it's this file here for the 2900, which I've already opened in another tab.

58
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.460
In the section 'Recovering the System Image with the TFTP Download Command (tftpdnld),'

59
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:36.030
it tells you how to recover the image. So you will need a TFTP server to do this, which we do actually

60
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.420
have.

61
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.800
I'll show you the TFTP server in a minute.

62
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.030
So on the TFTP server, you need to have the system image on there, and then, the document that you'll get

63
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.000
from this Cisco website will tell you the commands to enter that I'm just scrolling here. And then down

64
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.110
at the bottom here, it gives us an example config.

65
00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.290
So, when you get to the ROMMON prompt, the router is not operational. It has not booted up, so it doesn't

66
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.370
have any IP addresses on there.

67
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.900
The startup-config is not being loaded, so you're going to need to configure IP connectivity at the ROMMON

68
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.630
prompt.

69
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.050
These are the commands to do that, so we enter an IP address for the router.

70
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.370
We also enter the subnet mask.

71
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:26.880
You also have to enter a default gateway. If the router is on the same subnet as the TFTP server,

72
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:35.160
then just put the TFTP server's IP address in here. Then the IP address of the TFTP server, and then

73
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.610
the file name, the system image that you're going to use to recover that is on the TFTP server.

74
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:49.510
Finally, you put in the command 'tftpdnld'. It will then connect out to the TFTP server and download

75
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.310
this file, and copy it into Flash.

76
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.930
The last thing you do after that is enter the 'reset' command, and that will reboot the router. And because you've now

77
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.270
got a working system image in flash again, it will be able to boot up.

78
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.460
Okay,

79
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.260
let's just have a quick look at the TFTP server in Packet Tracer.

80
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:19.100
So in Packet Tracer, if you go to the End Devices tab down in the bottom left here, and then you can drag

81
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:26.470
up this generic server which is the third one along in this version of Packet Tracer, and bring it up here.

82
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:35.600
If I click on this now and go to Services, you'll see that TFTP is enabled on that server by default.

83
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.390
So there's already

84
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:47.840
IOS system images on the TFTP server. In the real world, then you can download a free TFTP server, or

85
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.960
you can use a paid one. There's a lot of TFTP software available on the Internet.

86
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.760
Again, just Google for that, and you'll find something.
