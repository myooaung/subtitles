00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.580
In the last lecture, we covered the city of Tripoli, authentication, authorization and accounting

2
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.200
in this lecture.

3
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.510
You'll see how to configure it.

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.950
Now, in the latest version of iOS, it's moved to a different command syntax for configuring triple

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.200
aim.

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.240
But before this latest version for a long time, it used the old way of doing it that you can see on

7
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.140
this slide here.

8
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.160
And you'll still chevis being used a lot in the field.

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.860
So I'll cover the old configuration first and first.

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.220
I'll show you the radius config, then I'll show you the tax plus config verbal, very similar.

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.460
So the old way of doing radius, first thing that we want to do is to configure a backup username.

12
00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.420
When you use triple A, you tell the of a switch that whenever you need to authenticate somebody, whenever

13
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.020
you're checking their username and password, we're not using a locally configured username.

14
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.440
The user is on Metropol a server and you can configured it.

15
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.650
It will use only the triple E server.

16
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.430
But the problem with this is that if a device loses connectivity to the server, if there's an issue

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.100
with the server or if there's an issue with the network getting to the server and you've just configured

18
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.480
it to use triple A, only then nobody is going to be able to log in to that device at all.

19
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.120
So what you want to do is configure a local user name and that will be used just as a backup.

20
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.200
So if a server is available, if a switch can communicate with it, then users cannot log in with the

21
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.100
backup username.

22
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.960
But if you switch cannot communicate with the server, then it feels over to using the local username.

23
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.240
So this means that you can still get into the device.

24
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.730
It stops you from getting out of it.

25
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.090
So to do that, we need to configure Username Vista Standard Command for that.

26
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.980
So we see username here.

27
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.490
I've used that username of backup admin and then the password is flat.

28
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.120
Volks one is our backup user in case we lose connectivity to the server.

29
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.730
Then for the rest of our trip we can fake it.

30
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.660
Global config.

31
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.970
We say triple a new model.

32
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.390
There is no typically old model command to build a new model just means that we're enabling triple A

33
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.410
on this device.

34
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.790
Then we configure where our servers are.

35
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.100
We're using radius here too.

36
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.380
We see reduced server hosts.

37
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.090
We've got ten point ten dollars ten and then we see a key flat box.

38
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.640
One, you configure a matching password on the triple E server and on the router and not on why we seem

39
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.800
to use triple A with each other.

40
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.720
We don't want to just have one server.

41
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.000
We want to have only two for redundancy.

42
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.210
So here we've also configured readiest server who can handle Tandoor 11 and it's using key box to switch

43
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.810
our radius servers added.

44
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.870
Then optionally, we can put these into a group so you can have different groups of different servers

45
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.800
if you want to.

46
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.740
It's not really that common to use that, but the functionality is there if you want to, to do that.

47
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.940
We say triple a group server radius and then give it a name.

48
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.230
He'd have called it FBAR for flat box radius group.

49
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.620
Then under there you say the servers are going to go in the group.

50
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.650
So we've got server handwrote Tando Pendleton and server handle 10 11, the ones that we configured

51
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.150
earlier then to enable triple A for authentication.

52
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.540
We say triple eight authentication login default group radius local.

53
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.430
If you don't specify a particular group of servers, then this means it can use all of the radius servers

54
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.710
that you've configured or not particular device.

55
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.500
So that's the first way you can do it, the other way you can do it.

56
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.200
If you have specified a particular group, as you would say, triple A authentication login default

57
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.920
group FBG, the group that we configured and then local.

58
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.279
So with Boothville we've got radius and then local.

59
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.670
That means the first choice is to use Vaidya servers.

60
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.000
Only if the radius servers cannot be reached, it will fall back to using the local username.

61
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.010
So that's how you configure authentication.

62
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.270
You can configure authorization as well with a authorization.

63
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.330
If you go on to the S.P. level or you do the security track, you CVS's extra triple eight commands.

64
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.130
OK, so that is the old configuration, the new configuration.

65
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.440
It just came out with the latest version of iOS.

66
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.520
So on the latest version of iOS, if you see a radius server who to handle it and the old style of doing

67
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.920
it, it will give you a warning saying that that command line is going to be deprecated soon.

68
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.990
Please move to using radius surburban you.

69
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.580
So the new way of doing it at global config, same command.

70
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:13.440
Art with is triple a new model, then we see radius server, server one, so we give it a name and that

71
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.990
will take us to sub command menu for configuring the radio server in there.

72
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.560
We specify the IP address services, address IP before ten point ten dollars 10, for example, and

73
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.580
then key flat box one, which matches the key that we configured on the triple A server to authenticate

74
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.530
this particular vibrator or switch.

75
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.640
Then for redundancy, we've got a second server, so we've got radio server server to address IP before

76
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.230
tanjil 10 11.

77
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.000
And the key is flat box to the name that you give them.

78
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.280
Doesn't have to match the hostname of the server.

79
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.530
It's just a name so that it can be recognized in the U.S. Then we've got a group server radius of called

80
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:06.150
FBR G again and I say server name server one and server name server two to group Beauvoir's servers

81
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.980
that we configured into this group.

82
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:17.320
Then to enable triple e authentication, we've got triple eight authentication default group FBR G Local.

83
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.550
So again, it will use the radius service first.

84
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.170
If they're not available, then it will fall back to using the local username.

85
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.810
OK, so it's a new configuration that was for radius.

86
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.980
Let's have a look at our tax configuration as well.

87
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.010
This is going to be pretty much exactly the same.

88
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.090
But we used the key word of Takaaki server rather than the key word of radius.

89
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.950
So the same kind of config.

90
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.320
Again, we've got username, backup oddments, secret flat box one as our backup user in case we lose,

91
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.860
connect to the Vitacost server to a new model.

92
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.890
Takaoka server hosts tend not to entertain otan QIf Lightbox one and a second server for redundancy.

93
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.560
Tocchet server host to handle 10.1.

94
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.470
Keep Lightbox to then our group triple a group server tax plus Fattig.

95
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.650
I've called FBG for flat box tax plus group.

96
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:20.570
This time server can handle ten on ten point ten dollars and 11 and to enable the authentication triple

97
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:27.500
eight authentication login default group FBG as a first choice and then fall back to Morkel as a second

98
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.830
choice.

99
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.960
Just like with radius.

100
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.490
This is the old configuration.

101
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.280
We have a new configuration for Taqwacores as well, which again matches the new configuration for radius

102
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.360
to here we attack a server who tend not to understand.

103
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.390
The old command will get a warning, but it's being deprecated.

104
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:51.140
Then our new command syntax is username backup admin, secret blackbox, one same command as before

105
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.110
to configure the backup user to a new model.

106
00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.020
Takaaki server server one address IP before tend to handle ten and QIf Blackbox one.

107
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:08.210
We repeat voice commands for server two with its IP address, then triple a group server tax plus FBG.

108
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.460
I've called it for Benim.

109
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:16.550
Specify those to servers, server one and server two and then finally triple a authentication default

110
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.940
group.

111
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.730
First choice is the group FBG.

112
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.980
The second choice is local.

113
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:29.090
OK, so that is how we do our triple E configuration.

114
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.320
I'll see you in the next lecture for some best practice security.

115
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.789
Come on.

116
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.130
We want to do on our various on switches.
