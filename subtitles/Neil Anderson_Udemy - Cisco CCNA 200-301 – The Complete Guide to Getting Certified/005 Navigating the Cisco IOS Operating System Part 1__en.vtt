00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.310
In this lecture, you're going to learn about how to navigate the Cisco IOS Command Line.

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.070
Now, the way it's going to be done is through a live demo in the lab.

3
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.450
And because I've got a heap of tips and tricks to show you for how to make your way around the Command

4
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:34.220
Line, to save you taking your own notes as we go through here, I'm also going to attach a PDF, which

5
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.370
is a summary of everything that we're going to cover here.

6
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.410
The scenario you see here is I've got a brand new router.

7
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:50.330
I've taken it out of the box, and I've hooked up a console cable, and then I've powered the router on, and it's currently

8
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.270
going through the bootup process.

9
00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.260
And because it is a brand new router, it's going to ask me, "Would you like to enter the initial configuration

10
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.890
dialogue?"

11
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.380
If I entered 'yes' here, it would take me to a Command Line-driven wizard, which would help me do

12
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.630
the initial setup.

13
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.690
It's not commonly used, normally we'll enter 'no' here.

14
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.370
So, that's what I'll do here.

15
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.570
It asks me, "Would you like to terminate autoinstall?"

16
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.530
Yes, I would like to terminate that.

17
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.430
I'll see my interfaces on the router are coming up, and then I land at the user exec prompt.

18
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.650
Now, we're not commonly going to be working at the user exec prompt because there's a very limited

19
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.840
set of commands that we can enter here.

20
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.730
If I want to see what those commands are, I'll enter a question mark '?'.

21
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.750
So I just hit a question mark '?' on the keyboard there, and it shows me all of the commands that are available

22
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.430
at user exec mode. Notice down at the bottom,

23
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.940
I see 'more' here.

24
00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.180
This indicates that there's additional commands, additional output that I could see. I can hit the

25
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.050
Enter key, and that will scroll through it line by line.

26
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.520
But, this would be a fairly tedious way to scroll through a lot of output.

27
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.800
What I'll do instead is I'll hit the Spacebar, and that's going to scroll through it page

28
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.620
by page. So, I can just hit the Spacebar multiple times until I get to the end of the output there.

29
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.980
Notice in Putty over in the right here.

30
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.130
I can scroll back through the previous output. Now, by default in Putty, it doesn't include a lot of lines

31
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.740
of scroll back. So what I can do to improve that is, go up in the top left here, right click, and Change Settings.

32
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.060
If I then go to the Window tab, I can set my Lines of scroll back here to 2000.

33
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.530
I've done that already.

34
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.100
By default, you're going to see a much smaller value here,

35
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.080
and that can be annoying because sometimes you do need to scroll back through quite a few lines of output.

36
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.680
I'd recommend that you set this to a high value. Okay, so you saw that I can hit the question mark to see

37
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.980
all of the available commands that are available at this level in the command hierarchy.

38
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.340
And as I said earlier, there's not really a lot that I can do at the user prompt.

39
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.530
So, I'm going to go to privileged exec mode. To get there,

40
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.970
the command I need to enter is 'enable', so I hit 'enable' and notice the command prompt changes.

41
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:39.270
When I was in user exec mode, the prompt showed the name of my router, which is just Router, the default right

42
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.310
now, and then a greater than symbol '>'.

43
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.510
But when I go to the privileged exec mode with the enable command, it changes to show the hostname

44
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.910
and then a hash '#'. So, you can tell by the command prompt what level you're currently at.

45
00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.240
If I want it to drop back down to the user level, which normally you wouldn't want to do, I can enter

46
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.470
the 'disable' command.

47
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.550
Okay, so now I'm going to go back up to the privileged exec mode, which is also known as the enable

48
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.000
prompt,

49
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.600
and I'll show you that we can use command abbreviation here.

50
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.500
So rather than typing in the full command 'enable', I can just say 'en' and hit Enter, and that will

51
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.399
bring me back up.

52
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.140
I could also use an abbreviated command to go back down to the user prompt again.

53
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.050
So I'll try entering 'di' and hit Enter,

54
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.830
but what I see now is this is an ambiguous command.

55
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.520
The reason for this is whenever you use command abbreviation, there has to be just one possible unique

56
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.090
match.

57
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:47.190
So if I now enter 'di' and a question mark '?', it will show me all of the possible commands that

58
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.340
begin with 'di', and you can see that there are three possible commands here dir, disable, and disconnect.

59
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.750
So when I typed in 'di', it didn't know which one I meant.

60
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.610
If I wanted to actually put in the abbreviation for disable, I'd have to enter 'disa', and it would

61
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.020
know now.

62
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.040
Okay, there's only one possible command.

63
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.780
I must mean disable.

64
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.010
I don't need to go back

65
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.830
down a level, though.

66
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.120
So, I'll just stay at the enable prompt for now.

67
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.430
Next up, I'm going to check what all commands begin with 'sh'.

68
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.780
So I'll enter 'sh' and a question mark '?', and I can see there's only one possible command which is 'show'.

69
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.120
On Cisco routers and switches,

70
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.540
you will use the

71
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.500
show command a lot because we use it to get information about the device.

72
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.140
The shortest way we can type that is just 'sh'. If you want to see what the available show commands are,

73
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.330
I'm going to put the same command in, but I'm going to have a space now.

74
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.510
So it's 'sh', space, and then question mark '?'.

75
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.770
When you include a space, it shows you all of the possible

76
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.450
keywords for that particular command. This is the context-sensitive help now.

77
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.320
So, I can see all my different show commands there. I'll hit the Spacebar to scroll through

78
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.010
all the different options. If I want it to break out of a command output without scrolling all the way

79
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.810
to the end, I can hit the Control button and 'C'

80
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.010
at the same time. That will break out the command.

81
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:22.440
And if I scroll back, you'll notice the first available option there was show aaa, so let's use

82
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.420
that for our example, and show you how you can figure out commands with the context-sensitive help.

83
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.430
So if I type in 'show aaa', space,

84
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.360
question mark '?',

85
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.510
it shows me all of the available options that would be available after 'show aaa'.

86
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.970
So if you need to enter a particular command, but you can't remember exactly what command you needed

87
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.540
to enter, this can be really helpful in that situation.

88
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:55.110
Similarly to the command abbreviation, we can also do Tab completion as well.

89
00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:02.580
For example, you see my first option here is 'show aaa acct-stop-cache' that's quite long to type

90
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.100
in.

91
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.450
So what I'm going to do instead, I'm going to say 'show aaa acc', which makes it a unique match, and now,

92
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:15.650
I can hit the Tab key, and that will autocomplete the entire word for me. While I'm at the Command Line,

93
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.180
I can use the Backspace to delete what I'd entered already.

94
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.270
So that's what I'm doing here, and let's deliberately put in a typo here.

95
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.060
So, notice I've put 'show aaa acct-stop-ciche', that should be cache.

96
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.290
I've put in a typo.

97
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.340
If I hit enter, you see I get the error message, "Invalid input detected." When you get this error,

98
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.920
it's usually because you put a typo in, and I can see the marker here shows me exactly where that typo was.

99
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.480
Let's have a look at another error.

100
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:55.080
So if I do 'show aaa' and hit enter, you see the error I now get is "Incomplete command."

101
00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.230
I have to carry on with the command by putting in one of these additional options here.

102
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.690
If I do a 'show run ?'

103
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.680
as an example, carriage return ,

104
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.350
that means that I could hit Enter.

105
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.460
These are all optional keywords.

106
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.350
I don't have to enter one.

107
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.690
I could actually hit an Enter here to get some output.

108
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:22.110
So the enable prompt, that's where we'll most commonly be using show commands.

109
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.120
The other main command we'll use here are debugs.

110
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:31.380
So I could enter 'debug', space, question mark '?', and now see all of the possible debugs here.

111
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.140
The difference between a command and a debug,

112
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.350
when you enter a show command, it gives you point in time information, information about the state

113
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:50.040
right now. When you do a debug, what will happen is that the output will be updated in real time.

114
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:56.910
So, for example, if you were debugging OSPF and an OSPF packet came in, you would see it show up

115
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.860
as and when the packet came in.

116
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:05.370
Okay, next thing I want to show you is how to actually make configuration changes on the router or switch. At the

117
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.330
enable prompt,

118
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.460
that's mostly for information there.

119
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.900
To actually make changes,

120
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.230
we go to global configuration. To get there,

121
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.140
it's 'configure terminal'.

122
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.680
Now, the abbreviation for this is you can just type in 'conf t'.

123
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.620
You'll use this command a lot,

124
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.420
so you'll be using 'conf t' a lot as well.

125
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.060
Okay, while we are in global configuration,

126
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.440
let's hit the question mark '?',

127
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.570
see all the available commands here. So, we can do that the same as we did at the enable prompt.

128
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.820
I hit Control+C to break out of this.

129
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.060
Another thing to notice is that the prompt changed again.

130
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:49.470
So when we were at the enable prompt, the prompt showed our hostname and then a hash '#'. When we're at global

131
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.490
configuration, it's Router and then config in brackets '(config)'.

132
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.430
So the hostname, config in brackets, and then a hash.

133
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.870
Okay, we're up to the ten-minute mark in this lecture.

134
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:06.630
I know, when I'm learning, I don't like to sit too long. I like to take frequent breaks.

135
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.520
So, what I'm going to do for this lecture is I'm going to split it into two parts which are going to

136
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.990
be about ten minutes each.

137
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.040
So go get yourself a coffee, and I'll see you back here for part two.
