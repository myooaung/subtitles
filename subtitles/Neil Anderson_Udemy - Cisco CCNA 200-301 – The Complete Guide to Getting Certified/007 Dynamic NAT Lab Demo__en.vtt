00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:15.020
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure Dynamic NAT with a lab demo. So this lab's following on

2
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.620
from the previous one where we configured Static

3
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.090
NAT. When we did that,

4
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.330
we configured a Static NAT entry, for our host in the inside at 10.0.1.10.

5
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.710
And that was being NAT'd to the outside address of 203.0.113.3.

6
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.920
In this lab, we're going to configure another NAT rule to allow our PCs on the 10.0.2.0 subnet

7
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.500
to get out to the Internet.

8
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.860
And those PCs don't accept incoming connections so we don't need to configure static rules for

9
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.190
them.

10
00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.770
We can configure a Dynamic NAT rule, which is going to give them public IP addresses on a first come,

11
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.360
first served basis. So, let's look at the existing configuration with this Static NAT rule first.

12
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.220
So I've got that configured on R1.

13
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:19.640
So if I do a show run on here and scroll down, you'll see that I've already got NAT interfaces configured

14
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.760
for that Static NAT rule. So fa0/0,

15
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:30.610
that's from the outside. It's got ip nat outside on there. And fa1/0,

16
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.520
that is the interface facing the internal server. That is configured as ip nat inside. Fa2/0,

17
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.920
that is the interface which faces the PCs on the 10.0.2.0 subnet.

18
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.180
So I need to configure that as ip nat inside as well.

19
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.860
You can have multiple interfaces configured as ip nat inside or ip nat outside, and whenever traffic

20
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.140
goes between them, it's going to get NAT'd.

21
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.660
You can also see a little bit further down there is that Static NAT real as well.

22
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:13.040
So the first thing I need to do is configure that interface facing the PCs for ip nat inside. So I'll go to

23
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.780
global configuration.

24
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.470
It was interface fa2/0 and I'll say ip nat inside.

25
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.810
So that is the interface configured.

26
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.870
The next thing that I need to do is configure my pool of addresses that the internal hosts can get NAT'd

27
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.260
to.

28
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.830
So the public IP address below. The command for that is ip nat pool.

29
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.250
I'll call this Flackbox for this example. And the range of addresses is 203.0.113.4

30
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:56.720
going up to 203.0.113.14 at the top of the range.

31
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.930
And I say that the netmask is 255.255.255.248. That's the subnet mask on

32
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.340
that public facing interface.

33
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:18.260
Next thing I do is I configure an access list where I'll specify the range of IP addresses of the host

34
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.640
on the inside that are going to get mapped to these public addresses.

35
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.630
So I'm just looking at them based on the source IP address. So I can use a standard access list here.

36
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:39.040
So I'll use access-list 1 and permit and the subnet that the hosts are on is 10.0.2.0

37
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.240
with a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255.

38
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.720
So I've got my pool of addresses configured.

39
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.400
I've got my access list specifying my inside host configured.

40
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.060
The last thing that I need to do here is tie them together.

41
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.130
And the way I do that is I'd say ip nat inside source.

42
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.600
And rather than being static for a Static NAT entry, it is a list.

43
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.100
And I say 1, to say that it is access-list 1 and pool Flackbox.

44
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.209
So that ties the access list and the pool together. And that is it. Done.

45
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.190
So that is my configuration done.

46
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.490
All I need to do now really is check that it is working.

47
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:35.540
So I'll do a debug here to watch it working. So I'll just debug ip nat and I'll go on to my first PC,

48
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.250
which is PC1, and ping the host on the outside. Let's

49
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.740
just check what its IP address was.

50
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.940
So I'm on 10.0.2.10 and I'm going to ping 203.0.113.20 on the

51
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.170
outside and PC1 should be NAT'd to the first address in the pool, which is going to be

52
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.500
203.0.113.4.

53
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.260
So let's just verify that.

54
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.490
203.0.113.20.

55
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:14.520
So ping 203.0.113.20 and the ping works. So connectivity is good.

56
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.860
And if I jump back onto R1, I can see my debug output there that was happening in real time.

57
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:29.980
The source 10.0.2.10 and it was NAT'd to 203.0.113.4 as expected.

58
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.430
And the outside address 203.0.113.20. Let's put some lines in here

59
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.330
so we can see a gap and I'll ping from PC2 as well.

60
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:49.390
So ping 203.0.113.20 on the outside and then jump back on to R1.

61
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.250
And you can see there's a source 10.0.2.11 has been NAT'd to the next address in the pool, which is

62
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.260
203.0.113.5.

63
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.790
And the outside address 203.0.113.20. I can also do a show ip nat translations.

64
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.750
And if I've done this quick enough, I can see both entries in the NAT translation table as well.

65
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.470
OK, so that's how we can configure and verify Dynamic NAT.

66
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:26.460
If I want it to clear these translations, the ones we see in the table there.

67
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.920
Let's just ping again to make sure that it doesn't time out on its own. So I'll ping from PC1 and

68
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.700
PC2. And I'll do an undebug all to get rid of the debug

69
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.450
output, and a show ip nat translations again.

70
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.730
And if I wanted to clear these because I was doing troubleshooting, then I can do a

71
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.420
show ip nat translation and then a star for all.

72
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.440
And if I now do my show command again, I can see that they have been removed.

73
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.330
I've just got these static entries still in there. Now, the dynamic ones have been removed.

74
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.880
OK, so that was everything I needed to show you.

75
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.690
One last thing.

76
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.700
Let's look at the statistics command as well.

77
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.880
So show ip nat statistics.

78
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.280
And there you can see how many NAT hits

79
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.850
we've got. Not so many packets being sent through

80
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.930
our NAT rule.

81
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.140
We verified everything's working, so we're all good.

82
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.080
But a potential problem with this is that you've got a limited number of addresses in your pool.

83
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:38.170
And once you hit that limit, then other hosts won't be able to get to the outside because they won't

84
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.210
be NAT'd to an IP address.

85
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:47.140
So the way that we can expand that range is by using PAT, Port Address Translation.

86
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.090
We'll cover that in the next lecture.
