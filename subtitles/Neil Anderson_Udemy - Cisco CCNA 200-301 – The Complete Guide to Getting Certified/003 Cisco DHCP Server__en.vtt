00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:14.230
In this lecture, you'll learn about the first option for configuring a DCHP server, which is using

2
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.129
a Cisco router.

3
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.690
You've really got two main options for your DHCP server.

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.080
You can use a Cisco router or you can use an external server, which is probably going to be running on Windows,

5
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.270
or maybe Linux or Unix.

6
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.160
So we'll take a look at the first option here, which is using a Cisco router.

7
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.870
If you're going to do this, it's most likely to be a small network, like a branch office where you

8
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.430
don't want to go to the expense of putting in a dedicated server to act as your DHCP server.

9
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.920
You're already going to have a Cisco router in that office anyway for doing the routing,

10
00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.000
so you can also use it as the DHCP server as well, and there's not going to be any additional cost to do that.

11
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.720
So, we're going to have a look at this in the lab in a second.

12
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.650
In our scenario, we've got small branch office.

13
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.880
We've got R1 there, which is configured with IP address, 10.10.10.1 /24 on its

14
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.520
fastEthernet0/1 interface,

15
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.070
and there are DHCP clients on that network that it's going to give IP addresses to.

16
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.730
So, we need to configure a DHCP pool for the 10.10.10.0 /24 subnet.

17
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.300
We've also got a DNS server in the office as well at IP address 10.10.20.10,

18
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.580
and we also want to give the client PCs that information as well. So the commands to configure

19
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.890
this,

20
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.260
first off, we're going to specify our excluded addresses.

21
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.080
Typically in a subnet,

22
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.110
you might have some hosts there that you're going to want to have a fixed IP address. For example,

23
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.640
printers, or the router itself, other network infrastructure devices.

24
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.110
So usually, you're not going to give out every single address in the entire IP subnet for DHCP clients.

25
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.500
You're probably going to have a few addresses that are reserved.

26
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.560
You'll usually have the reserved addresses either at the start of the scope or at the end of the scope,

27
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.740
For example, 1 to 10 or 240 to 254.

28
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:38.710
In our example here, we're going to exclude addresses 10.10.10.1 to 10.10.10.10 from the DHCP scope, and it's a good idea to put this command

29
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.880
in first before you configure the DHCP scope, so that way, clients won't get them before you exclude

30
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.060
them.

31
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.240
So the command to do this is at global configuration,

32
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.620
'ip dhcp excluded-address' and then the starting IP address, 10.10.10.1, for our example,

33
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.460
and then a space,

34
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.480
and then the ending address in the range, 10.10.10.10.

35
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.200
So, 10.10.10.1 to 10.10.10.10 will not be given out to clients.

36
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.490
We then need to configure our DHCP pool.

37
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.760
So again, at global config, we say 'ip dhcp pool' and for our example, I've called it '10.10.10.0_Clients',

38
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.140
but you can call it anything you like.

39
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.820
We could have called it 'ip dhcp pool MickeyMouse' if we wanted to.

40
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.850
That will then take you to your DHCP configuration.

41
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.510
The next command, we say 'network 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0'.

42
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.950
That's where we specify the IP range of addresses that we're going to be giving out and also the

43
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.390
subnet mask as well.

44
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.230
So clients will be given an IP address from this range and that subnet mask, and the addresses will be given

45
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:58.990
out on a first-come first-serve basis. Next command, 'default router 10.10.10.1', to tell the clients

46
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.700
where their default gateway is,

47
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.110
and finally, we've said 'dns-server 10.10.20.10' to also tell them where the DNS server is.

48
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.120
So, that's our configuration.

49
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.980
To verify it, we can say 'show ip dhcp pool', and for our example here, you can see that leased

50
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.660
addresses is 2.

51
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.010
So, we have given out 2 addresses in this range. To see the addresses that were given out and who they

52
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.060
were given out to,

53
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.860
we can say

54
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.160
'show ip dhcp binding'

55
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.810
and here, I can see that 10.10.10.11 was given out to the client with MAC address

56
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.440
ending D116, and then 10.10.10.12 was given out to the client with MAC address ending

57
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.210
A359.

58
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.020
So, you can see it started giving out addresses starting with 10.10.10.11 because we'd excluded 10.10.10.1 to

59
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.890
10.10.10.10.

60
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.780
Okay, so that's it.

61
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.980
Pretty simple configuration.

62
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.930
And for the lab demo, we're going to use that exact scenario again.

63
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.470
So, we'll configure R1. We'll configure it with a DHCP scope

64
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:15.740
for the 10.10.10.0 subnet. So let's go on to R1, you can see I've already got my interfaces

65
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.700
configured there.

66
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.580
I'll go to global configuration,

67
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.860
I want to exclude the addresses first

68
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.080
that I don't want to give out.

69
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:32.180
So that's 'ip dhcp excluded-address 10.10.10.1 10.10.10.10'.

70
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.580
Then, I configure my pool. So I say 'ip dhcp pool',

71
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.770
I'll call this one Demo, and then the network that I want to be assigning addresses for,

72
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:55.430
so 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0. The default router

73
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.000
is this router itself at 10.10.10.1,

74
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:07.970
and I also want to specify the DNS server, which was at 10.10.20.10.

75
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.790
Okay, so that's it all configured,

76
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.620
and then to verify it, I can do a 'show ip dchp pool'.

77
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.910
Let's see if the clients have taken their IP addresses yet.

78
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.130
Looks like they have, 2 of them of being leased. To verify, 'show ip dhcp binding',

79
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.070
and there I can see that my two clients have picked up their IP addresses from DHCP.

80
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.750
The first one got 10.10.10.11 and the second one got 10.10.10.12.

81
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.520
So, that's how you configure a Cisco router to be a DHCP server.

82
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:48.350
In the next lecture, we'll look at how to configure the Cisco router to support an external DHCP server.
