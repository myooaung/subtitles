00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:14.420
In this lecture, I'll wrap up the cloud computing section by summarizing the advantages, first one

2
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.890
is scalability.

3
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.220
Cloud computing provides businesses with the ability to regulate the service in accordance with their

4
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.570
current requirements.

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.590
They can scale the capacity up and down as needed.

6
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.490
Service comes about from the elasticity of cloud.

7
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.670
It's very easy to provision new servers when they're needed and when they're no longer needed.

8
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.140
It's easy to turn them down.

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.920
This is different than what you would get with an on premises solution.

10
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.370
Imagine that the customer comes to you looking for a solution and you can do it, but you would need

11
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.480
to buy additional servers and need to buy additional network infrastructure, etc. And you look at to

12
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.080
see if this is actually going to make money in the long run or not.

13
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.090
A problem you're going to have is if it's just a one time project that's going to run for a few months

14
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.520
after the project is finished, you're still going to have hardware sitting there and it's not going

15
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.040
to be doing anything anymore.

16
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.710
So you had large upfront capex cost anyway.

17
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.300
It's wasted money after the project is finished.

18
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.730
If you were deploying in the cloud, then you can just spin up those servers oswin when they're needed.

19
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.840
So when the project starts, you spin them up.

20
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.800
When the project finishes, you bring them back down again.

21
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.770
Also, if you already had your own on premises solution, you don't have to move everything into the

22
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.220
cloud.

23
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.170
You could keep everything on premises that you were running already and for your temporary solutions

24
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.410
you could run those in the cloud so that scalability is a big advantage.

25
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.320
Also, it gives you infinite computing capacity on demand if you can't run out of room in your data

26
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.200
center and what can happen with an on premises solution, there's unlimited capacity with cloud providers.

27
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.199
Also, you get flexibility through cloud bursting, which is similar to what I was seeing before.

28
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:16.370
But if you've got your own on premise solution, then you can scale out in the cloud as and when needed.

29
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.730
And as we mentioned in the last lecture as well, another possible reason for doing this is maybe you've

30
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.130
got your own onsite data center for your disaster recovery solution you could use cloud for.

31
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.650
That would also be a form of cloud bursting.

32
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.580
Next advantage is business agility.

33
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.940
Cloud gives you the ability to handle expected or unexpected changes and would again, which similar

34
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.370
to what we were just talking about, where if there's a sudden demand for additional servers, you can

35
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.960
get them provisioned very quickly and you servers can be up and running in around 15 minutes.

36
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.700
That's reduced time to deploy an application into production.

37
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.290
So it's very scalable.

38
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.590
It's also very fast to make more scalable changes as well.

39
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.560
Next one is cost efficiency.

40
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.160
As a customer, you paid just for what you need right now, resulting in directly proportional costs.

41
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.640
You don't have to overprovision and then pay for extra capacity that you're no longer using.

42
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.350
You avoid provisioning and paying for the peak as a permanent fixture.

43
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.200
If you think of an e-commerce application, they're going to be busier at Christmas.

44
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.190
So if you were running an on premise solution, you would need to buy enough hardware and enough infrastructure

45
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.380
to support your busiest time of the year.

46
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.880
The rest of the year that extra capacity is sitting wasted and you've already paid for that as a capex

47
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.310
cost to do with the cost efficiency.

48
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.120
You're moving from that large upfront CapEx cost to a comparatively small and more manageable monthly

49
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.990
OpEx cost.

50
00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.580
And your ice sheet costs are more transparent or more manageable to the business as not fixed monthly

51
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.030
cost.

52
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.720
You do not have depreciable hardware assets.

53
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.430
So when you're using on premises, you buy what is only as hardware.

54
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.730
Now, a few years down the line that is going to be out of date is depreciated.

55
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.280
And you're going to have to do a technology refresh, replace it with new hardware, which again is

56
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.430
another big upfront CapEx cost.

57
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.070
The provider passes the hardware maintenance costs on the customer as part of that predictable monthly

58
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.460
fee.

59
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.520
There's no unexpected costs.

60
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.750
Next advantages.

61
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.800
This can give you a competitive advantage, reducing the capital spend with large upfront capex on infrastructure

62
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.330
releases funds to invest in innovation or other priority areas.

63
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.500
Organizations can respond quickly to evolving market fans and focus on growing their core business.

64
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.250
So this can give your company an advantage over other companies that are not using cloud.

65
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.820
Productivity, I teach that this is a big one for us, I teach staff can focus more on strategic decisions

66
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.510
in developing and improving core applications rather than maintaining or troubleshooting hardware infrastructure.

67
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.640
Now, if you're going to be cynical about it, you could think that's a nice way of saying that you're

68
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.400
not going to need as many I.T. staff anymore to be looking after the hardware infrastructure.

69
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.390
But as network engineers, just something I hear quite a lot is people worry about, well, because

70
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.800
everybody's moving a cloud.

71
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.300
Does this mean there's going to not be a role for me anymore as a network engineer?

72
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.490
But that is not the case at all.

73
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.400
So when I did the case study with the e commerce application and we had to have that network design

74
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.870
for how it was going to be deployed, well, the cloud provider isn't doing that for you.

75
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.640
You need to have your own in-house I.T. who are going to do the design.

76
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.280
Also the provider.

77
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.780
If you're using infrastructure as a service, they provide the infrastructure, but from the operating

78
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.400
system, an app that is managed by your own in-house staff.

79
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.410
So you need to have in-house staff have got the skills to do that.

80
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.150
So your own staff need to do the design.

81
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.530
They also need to do the configuration from the operating system up.

82
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.660
They need to be able to maintain it as well.

83
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.590
So cloud does not mean that normal in-house I.T. staff are going to be losing their jobs, which still

84
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.310
require them.

85
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.850
In fact, when you use cloud and you're doing the planning to go over the planning is just like if you

86
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.450
were moving, if you were creating a new in-house location.

87
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.350
So you still need the same staff to be able to do that.

88
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.530
Next advantage is the availability and reliability.

89
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:53.560
All major cloud providers facilities are located in hardened data centers with redundant power, no

90
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.290
single points of failure and on site security.

91
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.290
The service will be certified to of an industry standards such as ISO nine thousand and one and two

92
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.970
seven zero zero one.

93
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.180
And the data center is built by facilities, server networking and storage qualified specialists according

94
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.260
to best practice.

95
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.410
So when you use cloud services from these public cloud providers, you know they are data centers are

96
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:22.540
really well designed for already proven because we've got all those of our customers that are already

97
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.260
running in there.

98
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.920
One thing in check, the service level agreement to see what is guaranteed and the compensation if the

99
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.720
SLA is not made.

100
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:40.200
Next one is cost Hiraman, not so much talking about an advantage, although cost can be an advantage,

101
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:46.020
but you need to check if it is going to be or not to avoid the advantages are all great to have.

102
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.500
But when you make a decision whether or not to deploy cloud computing, it's usually going to come down

103
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.610
to the overall long term cost.

104
00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.960
The total cost of ownership of maintaining an on premises solution should be compared to the TCO of

105
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.170
maintaining a cloud equivalent and the advantages and disadvantages of each factored in when making

106
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.340
the final decision.

107
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:15.090
However, it's not an either or decision you don't have to go with purely on premises or purely cloud.

108
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:21.180
In fact, the majority of companies who are using heart services will have a mix of both on premises

109
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.840
and cloud solutions.

110
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.730
OK, that was everything I needed to tell you about cloud computing.

111
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.840
I'll see you in the next section.
