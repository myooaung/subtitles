00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:14.660
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure S&P on a Cisco device using a lab, Damul.

2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.520
I've got the same topology again.

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.130
I've got my Rotar, one at Tando or the one and the S&P server is my Annemasse system at hand or the

4
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.230
one hundred, which is the PC that I'm working on right now.

5
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.070
So I just go going to our one to configure it for S&P.

6
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.850
So I'll go to Google config.

7
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.450
I see.

8
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.890
Just one thing to tell you before I do.

9
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.050
This is the right word is just being Reshat.

10
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.200
It doesn't have any login configuration on it at all.

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.900
No, everything's the default.

12
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:57.350
So WhatsApp, S&P, so a global config and or the combined S&P Dyche server contact is me.

13
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.330
That's Neil Flat Box, dot com and S&P Dosch server location.

14
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.290
I'll sit in the flat box wab.

15
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.640
So that's purely informational information, but that will show up on the next system and identify the

16
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.090
system.

17
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.080
So it's useful when I'm looking at the logs later are on next I need to set my communities.

18
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:35.210
So what is S&P MP Server Community and for my read-only community I'll call the flat box one and say

19
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.530
are all for Read-Only and I want to configure my read right community session and P server community

20
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.800
and I'll make this one flat box too.

21
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.680
And that's going to be the read write community string.

22
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.130
Then I'll show up where the SNP services.

23
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.240
So SNP the server, the host is it tandoor old one hundred.

24
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.320
And when I'm sending troops to that SNP server I want to use my read-only community string which is

25
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.940
blackbox one.

26
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.110
And let's try that with a typo in there, I missed an hour in the middle.

27
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.390
I will spare no and then I need to specify what actual props I want to send to that server, as well

28
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.990
as the S&P server traps and must be a question mark.

29
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.120
And I've missed out the hidden able command.

30
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.730
OK, I'm tape working today.

31
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.180
All right, let's try that again.

32
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.170
She can Sï¿½vres a whole bunch of options you've got on Tropp messages that will be sent to the S&P system.

33
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.630
For example, if something changes with WCF, you can send troops about that.

34
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.900
If it's ISIS, ISDN, etc..

35
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.250
The one I'm going to use for this example is tromps config and that will send an S&P shop a message

36
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.070
to the S&P server when somebody invokes configuration mode on the router.

37
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.880
So let's open up my animes system.

38
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.380
I'm using the Kiwi server for this again and I'll go back to the router and window a bit smaller so

39
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.530
we can see both.

40
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:34.390
And in my Rohter window, I will exit out of the configuration mode and then I'll re-enter global configuration

41
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:44.470
again, and this should send a trap to my S&P server seeing I've entered global configuration and there

42
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.970
we go.

43
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.420
It took a few seconds to come in, but I can now see that Tropp is showing up in my S&P server.

44
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.970
OK, that was how it can figure S&P.

45
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.740
See you in the next lecture.
