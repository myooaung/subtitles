00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:15.640
In this lecture, you're going to learn about the final layer in the OSI model, which is Layer 1, the Physical

2
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:23.640
Layer. OSI Layer 1 conveys the bit stream, meaning it puts the actual bits onto the wire.

3
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:33.100
That could be electrical impulse over copper cables, or light over fiber optic cables, or radio signals

4
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.310
over wireless.

5
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.910
So, it does that, and it takes control of the network at the electrical and mechanical level.

6
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.880
It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data, including defining the cables that will

7
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.920
be used,

8
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.370
the interface cards, and the Ethernet ports or the WAN port types in there, and the physical aspects

9
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.530
of the network. In this lecture,

10
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.920
just like in the last one, we're going to focus on the Local Area Network.

11
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.060
So, we're going to be focusing on Ethernet again.

12
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.720
Again, we're going to cover Wide Area Network in a later section. Our Ethernet LAN connections can

13
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.120
be carried over coaxial cable, which was the original implementation, but that's not used anymore.

14
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.770
What we have nowadays are twisted copper pair cable, or fiber optic, or wireless.

15
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.820
Starting off with our copper cables, so we use UTP cables for this, Unshielded Twisted Pair. They're commonly

16
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:48.730
used to connect desktop computers to switches. The connector type is RJ-45, and the maximum length

17
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.130
of the cable is 100 meters. If you have a look at the picture on the slide here, I'm

18
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.160
sure you've seen a standard network cable before.

19
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.210
This is the copper cables we're talking about here. A standard network cable is an RJ-45 connector at

20
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.050
the end.

21
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.410
Let's have a look at the link I've got on this slide as well to get some more information on UTP cables.

22
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.360
So the link is on Wikipedia, and you can see with our standard UTP cables, they've gone through several

23
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.900
different iterations. Cat 5 was pretty popular

24
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.420
not that long ago. We're up to Cat 7 now, and Cat 8 is in development.

25
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.480
The difference between the Cats, it's the Categories, the difference between the Categories, well, newer

26
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.580
Categories have got support for higher bandwidth connections. Back when Category 5 first came out,

27
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:55.260
we didn't have 10 Gigabit, 40 Gigabit, or 100 Gigabit Ethernet back then. So Category 5 was fine for carrying

28
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.170
the maximum bandwidth connections that were available then, and you still will find some offices that have

29
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:11.760
got Cat 5 cable in there. If you want to carry 10 Gigabit Ethernet, then the minimum is Cat 6 cable.

30
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:22.410
Cat 5 and Cat 5e can go up to Gigabit Ethernet. Cat6 supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet. For the newer standards,

31
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.070
which are 40 Gigabit and 100 Gigabit Ethernet, now, I say they're standards because they're standardized,

32
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.550
but they're not really in all that common implementation yet. They haven't been out for all that long. You'll

33
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.030
find in a lot of enterprises now that they go up to 10 Gigabit Ethernet, but for 40 Gigabit Ethernet and

34
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.310
100 Gigabit Ethernet is going to see more common deployment as time goes on.

35
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.260
Okay, so those are the different category of cables. The next thing to tell you about is that the copper

36
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.000
cables, they can be either straight-through or crossover UTP cables. The receive and transmit wires

37
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.070
can be wired to the RJ-45 connector as either straight-through or crossover.

38
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.630
I go back a slide, you see on the end of the cable there, that's the RJ- 45 connector, and those individual

39
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.370
receive and transmit wires in there, they can be cabled either as straight-through, is more common,

40
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.590
or the wires can be reversed, which makes it a crossover cable. Straight-through cables are used to connect

41
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.260
an end device like a PC or a router to a switch,

42
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.180
so they're more commonly used. Crossover cables are used to connect devices together directly.

43
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.870
They're most often used to connect to devices of the same type, for example, two computers to each other

44
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.060
or two switches to each other. Cabling two computers to each other is not a normal thing to do.

45
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.410
It's not a very big network if you've only got two computers there.

46
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.770
So if you are in a pinch, and you needed to copy some files from one computer to another, and you had

47
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.750
no other way of doing it, you could actually, you could connect them back to back with a crossover cable,

48
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.900
and you could transfer the files that way. But we've got things like USB sticks nowadays, and in a normal

49
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.630
office, we'll have a switch there that we could connect them through.

50
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.570
So, it's very rare you would ever consider connecting computers back to back with each other like that.

51
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.660
What is common though, is connecting your switches to each other.

52
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.900
Say, we've got our building at work. We've got the bottom floor, and everybody on the bottom floor is connected

53
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.510
to our bottom floor switch. And then, we've got the first floor, and everybody on the first floor is going

54
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.030
to be connected to our first floor switch.

55
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.840
Well, we want our staff on both floors to be able to communicate with each other on their computers,

56
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.260
so we're going to need to connect the switches together as well.

57
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.250
The standard way to connect two switches together is using a crossover cable.

58
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:07.080
However, modern switches support Auto MDI-X, where the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured automatically

59
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.950
to get the expected result.

60
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.480
So with modern switches, you don't have to use a crossover cable.

61
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.760
You can use a straight-through cable as well, and that will still work.

62
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.550
So the normal way to do it is a crossover, but really, modern switches, a straight-through will work just

63
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.360
fine as well.

64
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.890
But if you are going to use a straight-through, do check that it does support Auto MDI-X. Okay, so that was

65
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.640
our copper cables.

66
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.750
Moving on to fiber.

67
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:43.740
Fiber supports longer distances and higher bandwidth than is possible with copper.

68
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.900
The kind of places where you use fiber cable would be if you're connecting between two separate buildings

69
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.570
within the same campus.

70
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.920
So again, we're still talking about the Local Area Network here.

71
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.870
So all of our PCs in the Local Area Network are going to be in the same building or within the same

72
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:11.210
campus at most. When we are in a campus kind of environment, like maybe a university, and we want to

73
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.010
cable our buildings together,

74
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.070
typically, the connections between switches in different buildings will use fiber optic cables.

75
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:27.350
Another reason for using fiber is for those switch to switch connections inside the building because we'll

76
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:33.950
typically require higher bandwidth between direct connections between switches in the building, and copper

77
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.980
might not be able to carry it. With fiber,

78
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:46.750
we've got two different types. There's Single Mode and Multi Mode Fiber. Single Mode supports higher bandwidth

79
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.280
and longer distances than Multi Mode, but it's more expensive.

80
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:59.540
Let's have a look at the link here now. I've got this on my second tab.

81
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:06.930
So this is the Wikipedia page for Multi Mode Fiber, and you can see just like we had the different Categories

82
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.380
were released over time for copper cable,

83
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.720
there's different standards for our fiber cable as well.

84
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:23.910
This is on Multi Mode, so you can see for 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Depending on the type of cable we're using,

85
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.380
it can go up to 400 meters.

86
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.309
100 and 40 Gigabit Ethernet are supported on fiber as well. They're not supported on copper yet,

87
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:40.980
and that can go up to 150 meters. So looking at Multi Mode Fiber, you're looking at a maximum length of a

88
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.850
few hundred meters. Single Mode can go much further.

89
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:52.740
It can go up to several hundreds of Kilometers, again, depending on the cabling type and the other physical

90
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.480
hardware you're using.

91
00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:01.410
So our last slide here, this is a picture of some of the different fiber connectors that are available. There's

92
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:07.950
a lot of different types of fiber connectors. Depending on the type of cable you're using, whether

93
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.830
it's Multi Mode or Single Mode, the kind of distance it's going over as well,

94
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.050
there's going to be different connectors there.

95
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.140
Another difference between fiber and copper is that the copper

96
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:26.850
RJ-45 Connector will plug directly into the switch. But fiber connectors, they'll normally go into

97
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.150
a transceiver, which then goes into the switch.

98
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:37.590
So you've got the switch with an open port in it, a small transceiver goes into port on the switch. You choose

99
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:44.620
the correct type of transceiver that matches the connector and the type of cabling that you're using.

100
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:52.650
There is one last thing that I want to tell you about here, and that is PoE, Power over Ethernet, which

101
00:09:52.650 --> 00:10:02.070
you can use as a convenient way to get power down to your PoE-capable devices, such as IP phones and

102
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.970
Wireless Access Points.

103
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:11.370
You can see in the slide here, we've got an office, and they've got IP phones on their desks, and they're

104
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.630
also using Wireless Access Points as well.

105
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:23.430
And the traditional way to have those on the network is that they would all be connected into a standard

106
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.330
switch.

107
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.840
And if you're using a standard switch, meaning it does not support Power over Ethernet, then you're going

108
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.520
to need to have power supplies plugged into all of your devices as well.

109
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.060
So if there's, say, 100 IP phones on the desks there, then every single one of those IP phones is going to have

110
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.280
a network cable plugging it into the switch for the network connectivity,

111
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:54.460
and it's also going to have a power supply plugged in as well, plugged into a wall socket.

112
00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:01.620
But there is a more convenient way that we can do this, and that is using a PoE, Power over Ethernet

113
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.250
switch.

114
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.180
They look the same as standard switches,

115
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.800
but they have the added PoE functionality. When you use a PoE switch,

116
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:18.570
the power is sent down to the device over the standard network cable, so that saves you having to use

117
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.590
a separate power supply for all those different devices.

118
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:28.160
So, in our example, in the office with the 100 IP phones, then that is a hundred phones

119
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:34.140
now that are not having a power supply plugged into the wall port, so there is less cabling. It's just

120
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:41.070
a whole lot more convenient for your users as well. So when you do have an office which has got IP phones

121
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.360
deployed in there,

122
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:49.490
it is most often used that you're going to have a PoE switch there rather than standard switches.

123
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:55.410
Another thing that you'll sometimes see with PoE, but not as commonly, is if you're not using

124
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.880
IP Phones, but you do have just Wireless Access Points there.

125
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:07.230
Well, if you've got a Wireless Access Point, which is in a location where it's hard to get power to.

126
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:13.560
For example, maybe it's in the roof in a warehouse, and there's no power points near there, and then what

127
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.320
you can do is you can use a power injector.

128
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:22.350
So rather than putting in an entire Power over Ethernet switch, if you've already got a standard switch

129
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:29.400
in there, what you can do is buy a power injector. The power injector gets plugged into power, and then it

130
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:36.720
supplies Power over Ethernet over the Ethernet cable towards the Wireless Access Point. The Ethernet

131
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.860
cable can go up to 100 meters,

132
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.610
so it's a way that you can get power to a Wireless Access Point in a location that it would be normally

133
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.040
difficult to get power to.

134
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:46.770
Okay,

135
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:54.110
that's everything I needed to tell you here, and that was the last lecture on the OSI model.

136
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.710
See you in the next section.
