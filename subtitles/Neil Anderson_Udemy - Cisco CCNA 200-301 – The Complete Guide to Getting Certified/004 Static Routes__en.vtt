00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.160
In this lecture, you're going to learn about static routing.

2
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.400
You saw in the last lecture that when you add an IP address to a router's interface, it automatically

3
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.420
adds a connected route to its routing table and it's able to route traffic between its different connected

4
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.830
interfaces.

5
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.860
But if a router wants to send traffic to a subnet that it's not directly connected to, then it's

6
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.270
going to need some way to know how to get there.

7
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.710
So you need to get that route into the routing table.

8
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.520
You can either do it manually as an administrator by adding a static route, or the router can learn it

9
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.770
dynamically through a routing protocol. In this lecture,

10
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.400
we're going to cover how to add it with a static route.

11
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.160
You see the example here down at the bottom,

12
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.280
I've got R1 is directly connected to the 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0.0/24 and

13
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.450
10.02.0/24 networks. So, it can route traffic directly there just by configuring the IP addresses.

14
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.460
But there's another network of 10.1.0.0/24, which is behind the router, R2.

15
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.250
So right now, R1 doesn't know how to get there.

16
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.440
I'm going to need to add a route to tell it how to get there. And R2 is directly connected to

17
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.900
10.1.0.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24, so it can send traffic to them directly as soon as I've configured

18
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.400
the IP addresses.

19
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.920
It's going to need routes to 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 behind router R1.

20
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.710
So the command to add a static route is 'ip route'.

21
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.860
Let's look at R1's route to get to the 10.1.0.0 network first.

22
00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.000
The command that I need to add is 'ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.0',

23
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.330
so the subnet I need to get to including its subnet mask.

24
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.720
Then, I say the next hop IP address that I need to send traffic to

25
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.310
in order to get there.

26
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.030
So for R1, to send traffic to the 10.1.0.0 network, it needs to send it out of its fastEthernet0/0

27
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.240
interface and send it to 10.0.0.2 on router R2, so I add the route for

28
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.790
that. And it should be obvious how I do the routes on R2 now it's going to need two routes, a route

29
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.100
to 10.1.0.0 and a route to 10.0.0.2.

30
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.950
So the commands are 'ip route

31
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:52.960
10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0' going in the next hop 10.0.0.1 on R1. And 'ip route

32
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.180
10.0.2.0 255.255.255.0',

33
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.820
the next hop is the same again,

34
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.060
it's still the 10.0.0.1 interface on router R1.

35
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.070
Once you've done that, you'll be able to route traffic between all of the networks in the network there.

36
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.190
Okay, let's take it up a notch and add another router.

37
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.540
So it's the same topology as before, but I've added an additional router, which is R3. So R3 has got

38
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.040
routes to 10.1.1.1 and the 10.1.0.0 1 network because it's directly connected to them.

39
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.900
But right now, it doesn't know how to get to the network 10.0.0.0/24 behind R2, and 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24,

40
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.820
which are behind R1.

41
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.540
So I'm going to need to add routes to those networks.

42
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.200
So first up, the route to get 10.0.0.0 behind R2.

43
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.580
The command would be 'ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0',

44
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:03.100
and the next hop is 10.1.0.2, which is on router R2. Then the commands to get to the routes

45
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.970
behind router R1 would be 'ip route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0'

46
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.010
and the next hop address is 10.1.0.2.

47
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.640
Okay, so those routes are behind R1, but I don't point the route at R1 because R3 is not directly

48
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.890
connected to it.

49
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.700
When I add the target for the route, it has to be reachable on a directly connected interface. So R3,

50
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.290
to get to R1,

51
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.760
it sends a traffic via R2 which it is directly connected to. So the target for the ip route.

52
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:50.730
10.0.1.0 is 10.1.0.2 the same address again on R2. And to get to 10.0.2.0,

53
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:58.220
it's going to be the same again, 'ip route 10.0.2.0 255.255.255.0' next hop is again

54
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.270
10.1.0.2 on R2. The route on R2,

55
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.760
it needs a route to get to 10.1.1.1 behind R2.

56
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.290
So the commands is 'ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0' and the next hop is 10.1.0.1,

57
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.970
that is out

58
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.800
the interface that is directly connected to R3. And then to get to the two routes behind R1, I've got IP route

59
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:36.080
for 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.2.0, they're both a /24, so 255.255.255.0,

60
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.910
and the next hop for both of them is the directly reachable link to R1 which is 10.0.0.1

61
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:51.190
And finally, we need to do routes on R1 to get to 10.1.1.0 and 10.1.0.0,

62
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:59.650
they are both reachable via R2 at 10.0.0.2. Once we've configured all of these routes,

63
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.670
we're going to have reachability between all of the different subnets on our network there.

64
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.910
Next up we'll do the usual,

65
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.510
we're going to configure this in the lab. I'll see you in the next lecture for that.
