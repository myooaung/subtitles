00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.790
In this lecture, you're going to learn about subnet masks, and you can see what I've done here is I've opened

2
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.140
up a command prompt on my Windows laptop again, and I've entered 'ipconfig'. You can see where I have

3
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.400
highlighted it that my IP address is 192.168.10.15,

4
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:39.750
my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the default gateway is 192.168.10.1. So, every

5
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.820
host in your network is going to know what its IP address, its subnet mask, and its default gateway is.

6
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.190
Let's now see how it's going to use that information,

7
00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.680
so onto the slides now. A host can send traffic directly to another host on the same subnet via the switches

8
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.300
they're attached to. But for a host to send traffic to another host in a different subnet, it must be

9
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.240
forwarded by a router.

10
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.390
So our routers are our devices that link our different subnets together and route the traffic between them.

11
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.310
The host, therefore, needs to understand if the destination is on the same or a different subnet in order

12
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980
to know how to send it.

13
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.870
If the destination is on the same subnet, it will send that there directly.

14
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.810
If it's on a different subnet, it knows that it has to send it to the local router, which is the default

15
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.950
gateway. And the way that the host knows whether the destination is on the same subnet or a different

16
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:58.010
subnet is by comparing the IP address of the destination to its own IP address and the subnet mask.

17
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:08.009
The subnet mask, just like the IP address, is also 32 bits long, and it can be written in dotted decimal notation,

18
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949
the same as our IP addresses,

19
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.140
or it can be written in slash '/' notation.

20
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.030
You'll see how that works a bit later in this lecture.

21
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:26.550
A host's IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion, and it's the subnet mask that

22
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.850
defines where the boundary is between the network part and the host part of the address.

23
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.110
The easiest way to explain how this works is by giving you an example.

24
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:47.850
So, let's say the host's IP address is 192.168.10.15, and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.

25
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.320
That's the IP address and subnet mask that's actually on my laptop. To figure this out,

26
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.890
we write the IP address out in binary notation, like you learned in the last lecture, and then the subnet

27
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.430
mask

28
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.630
also in binary notation underneath. So our example was 192.168.10.15, subnet mask

29
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.620
255.255.255.0.

30
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.180
You see the top part here,

31
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.090
I've written 192.168.10.15 out in binary,

32
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:33.260
and then underneath 255.255.255.0 out in binary as well. The IP address is compared or masked with

33
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.690
the subnet mask. A '1' in the subnet mask indicates that bit in the IP address is part of the network address,

34
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.650
and a '0' indicates

35
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.460
that the bit is part of the host address. So very quickly, you can see here, all the 1's on the subnet mask

36
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320
go up to here.

37
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.490
Everything in the IP address above that is part of the network portion of the address.

38
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:07.740
The 0's above that in the IP address, those are part of the host portion of the address.

39
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.440
Let's make this a little bit clearer. So, subnet mask 255.255.255.0. With the

40
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.950
subnet mask, it's always going to have contiguous 1's, and you see the 1's come up to this part here,

41
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:29.810
so I put a line in. That line is the border between the network portion and the host portion of the address.

42
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:38.600
In the example, the network address portion is 192.168.10 because on the IP address from here

43
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:47.360
on the left all way up to the line, that is 192.168.10 part of the IP address. Whatever is after

44
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.900
the line is the host portion of the address,

45
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:58.160
so in our example, it is the .15 is the host portion of the address. I've highlighted it there. There is the

46
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:07.240
network portion. If the host wants to communicate with another host with an IP address which also begins

47
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.780
with 192.168.10

48
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.720
in our example, so say, for example, this host wants to send traffic to a destination address of

49
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.820
192.168.10.20, it knows it's on the same subnet and it can send the traffic directly, because

50
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.360
the destination also begins with 192.168.10.

51
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.700
If this host wants to communicate with another host on any other network, anything that does not begin

52
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.330
with 192.168.10, then it knows it has to send the traffic via a router. So if it was sending traffic

53
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.070
to destination

54
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.310
192.168.11.20, for example, it doesn't begin with 192.168.10.

55
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.440
It's a different subnet, it sends it via the router. For a destination address to be on the same subnet,

56
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.170
the network portion has to be exactly 192.168.10.

57
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.520
Anything else means a different subnet,

58
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:16.890
we have to go via a router. The subnet mask always begins with a contiguous block of 1's.

59
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.900
This is different than the IP address.

60
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:26.130
You see our example IP address here, it's 1100000010101.

61
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.240
So with the IP address, the 1's and 0's can be mixed about in pretty much any order.

62
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:39.850
The subnet mask is a block of 1's, and then a block of 0's always. We never mix the 1's and 0's

63
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:52.870
up with each other in the subnet mask. So, 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000 is a legal subnet mask.

64
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.670
11101101, mixing up the 1's and 0's,

65
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.630
we can't do that.

66
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.480
That is not a valid subnet mask.

67
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:10.540
The host portion of the address is available to be allocated to the different hosts on that particular

68
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.550
subnet,

69
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:19.780
for example, your PCs, Servers, Printers, Routers Interfaces, Switch Management Addresses, etc.,

70
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.530
with two exceptions that you'll see coming up after the next slide. So, there's the host portion of the address

71
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:34.290
for our example highlighted. The host portion of the address specifies the individual host and must be

72
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.930
unique on that subnet.

73
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.470
Your hosts do not need to be numbered sequentially.

74
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.700
For example, we could have a subnet with two hosts on it. One could have address 10.10.10.10.

75
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.520
The other could have addressed 10.10.10.20.

76
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.230
We don't need to number them .1 and .2.

77
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:58.500
You can't have two different hosts, both with the same IP address.

78
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.540
For example, we couldn't have two hosts, both with address 10.10.10.10. That would be

79
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:10.800
a duplicate address, and whenever any traffic was sent to 10.10.10.10, your network devices

80
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.080
wouldn't know which host to send it to.

81
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.860
So that's illegal, you can't have duplicate IP addresses.

82
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:23.700
You could have host 10.10.10.10 on one subnet and host 10.10.20.10

83
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.050
on a different subnet. They're different subnets, so it's not a duplicate address.

84
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.910
That's just fine.

85
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:39.179
All 0's in the host portion designates the network address and is not allowed to be allocated to a

86
00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:39.630
host.

87
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:46.230
Remember, we just said a minute ago that there's two particular addresses that can not be assigned to

88
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.070
a host.

89
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:54.000
The first one of those is all 0's in the host portion. That designates the network address of the

90
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.650
network ID. In our example, the network address would be 192.168.10.0, so we fill

91
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.550
in the bit pattern in the network portion.

92
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.770
So, that was

93
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.900
192.168.10, and then in the host portion, we put all 0's in there. So all 0's, you can't assign it to

94
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.040
a host.

95
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:22.290
It signifies the network address, which is the bottom address in that particular subnet.

96
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.410
There's I highlighted there, you can see we've used all 0's.

97
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:33.080
The other address which can not be assigned to a host is all 1's in the host portion of the address.

98
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:39.150
All 0's signifies the network address, which is the bottom address in the range. All 1's, which

99
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.220
is the top address in the range, that is the directed broadcast.

100
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:51.090
Whenever you send traffic to the directed broadcast address, it goes to all hosts in that subnet.

101
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.880
Not to an individual host,

102
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.400
so we can't assign that address to an individual host. And there it is highlighted, the host portion, I've put

103
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.380
all 1's in there.

104
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:10.270
So that leaves 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.254,

105
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:16.990
in our example, available to be allocated to our different hosts. So all the different PCs, other kinds

106
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:22.750
of hosts, maybe you've got some Windows PCs, some Linux PCs in that subnet, I can number them from

107
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:28.690
192.168.10.1 all the way up to 192.168.10.254.

108
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.390
They're all in the same subnet. Whenever they send traffic to each other, they can do that directly without

109
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.270
going via their default gateway router.
