00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.310
In this lecture, you'll learn about unique local and link local IPv6 addresses. We'll start off

2
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.590
with unique local.

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:26.410
Those are similar to IPv4 RFC1918 private addresses. So

4
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.060
10.X.X.X, 172.16-172.31.X.X,

5
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.410
and 192.168.X.X,.

6
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.560
The private addresses, they are not publicly reachable.

7
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.870
They are assigned from a range FC00::/7 and as always host should

8
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
be assigned /64 addresses.

9
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.360
So that's it for our unique local addresses.

10
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.040
Not so much to tell you about

11
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.500
them. They're pretty simple.

12
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.880
There is more to tell you about

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.990
the link local addresses. So link local addresses are valid for communications on their particular

14
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.300
link only. They cannot send traffic out to another link.

15
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.470
They're assigned from the range FE80::10 to 

16
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.970
FEB0::10.

17
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.010
And again, as always, hosts should be assigned /64 addresses.

18
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.310
So that might seem a bit confusing for now.

19
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.860
So let's have a look and see what we mean by link local and not being able to send traffic off their

20
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.610
own link.

21
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.000
In the example here in the diagram, we've got routers A, B and C and they're all connected to the same network

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.840
segment through

23
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:54.180
the switch on the left. On that segment, router A has been assigned IP address FE80::1/64

24
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.660
as its link local address on that interface.

25
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.890
Router B is FE80::2 and router C is FE80::3.

26
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:14.250
There's also another link here as well which is going between B and D. B and D have also got link local

27
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.220
addresses on that link. B is FE80::4 and D is FE80::5.

28
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.240
Now because these are link local addresses,

29
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.300
FE80::1, FE80::2 and FE80::3

30
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:42.340
on that link between routers A, B and C, they can communicate with each other. And FE80::4 and

31
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.140
FE80::5 on the link between routers B and D,

32
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.020
they can communicate with each other as well.

33
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.300
But FE80::1, FE80::2 and FE80::3 do not have any connectivity

34
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.030
to FE80::4

35
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.630
or FE80::5. So link local addresses,

36
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.030
you can send and receive traffic from them, but it's only valid on that local link.

37
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.740
It will not get routed out another interface on the other side of a router.

38
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.970
So you're maybe thinking, well, why am I ever going to use a link local addresses, if they can only

39
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.850
send traffic on their local link? They can be used for communications, which should not be forwarded

40
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.520
beyond the local link like routing protocol,

41
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:37.580
Hello packets and updates. And the link local addresses are mandatory on your Cisco router interfaces if IPv6

42
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.780
is enabled on them.

43
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.430
So they're mandatory and local addresses are automatically generated with the EUI-64 addresses

44
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.830
whenever you enable IPv6 on an interface. But that automatically generated EUI-64 address

45
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.800
can be overridden by manually configuring a link local address on there.

46
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.280
So let's see how this works. The example here, we've got a new router, which has got no IPv6 configuration

47
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.520
yet.

48
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.220
So we do a show ipv6 interface brief, and we see that we've got no addresses.

49
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.209
We then configure our global unicast addresses on this

50
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:20.420
router.

51
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:28.280
So first off, IPv6 unicast routing to enable IPv6 routing on the router, then on interface fa0/0,

52
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:37.100
we say IPv6 address 2001:DB8:0:1::1.

53
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.200
So that's a global unicast address.

54
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.810
And we've also put a global unicast address on interface fa2/0.

55
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.650
If we then do a show ipv6 interface brief, I can see on fa0/0.

56
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.750
I've got that global unicast address that I just configured,

57
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.860
2001:DB8:0:1::1.

58
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.630
And the router has also automatically generated a link local address on that interface as well.

59
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.140
It's given it the IPv6 link local address, FE80:C801:2FFF:FE24:0.

60
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:23.240
And also on interface fa2/0, because we configured

61
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.990
a global unicast address on there, the router has also automatically configured a link local address on there.

62
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.910
You can easily see which are the link local addresses because we begin with FE80. Notice on interface

63
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.000
fa1/0 and fa3/0,

64
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.560
there is no link local address on there because IPv6 was not enabled on those interfaces yet.

65
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.920
The local addresses are valid only in local link as we covered before, so you can use the same

66
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.990
address on multiple interfaces because it's unique at the interface level.

67
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.090
It doesn't create a conflict if you use the same address on a different interface.

68
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:15.010
So you can see that right here on R1, we've got IPv6 address FE80::1 link local

69
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.480
on fa0/0 and we've also configured it on fa2/0 as well.

70
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.410
You can also see here how to configure the link local address manually.

71
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.080
If you do this, it will override having the EUI-64 address.

72
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.910
So this can be useful if you want to have a more logical fix,

73
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.530
the link local address on your router.

74
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:51.040
Now, let's talk about multiple addresses on our interfaces. It's different in IPv4 than it

75
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.390
is in IPv6.

76
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.920
You see in our example here, we've gone on to R1. On interface fa0/0,

77
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.410
I've said IP address 10.10.10.10.1.

78
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.550
It's a /24.

79
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:11.140
And then I hit enter and then I configure IP address 192.168.10.1/24.

80
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.890
Well, if you now do a show run, you can see that the IP address on the interface is

81
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.300
192.168.10.1.

82
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.000
When we entered the second IP address, it wrote over the first IP address.

83
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:33.580
So if you configure multiple IPv4 address commands on a router, it's the latest one that will take

84
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.490
effect. The older ones will be removed.

85
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:44.110
If you do want to have multiple IPv4 addresses on an interface and the  router, the way you do that is you can

86
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:51.940
see down at the bottom. Interface fa0/0, IP address 172.16.0.1/24.

87
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:59.920
And then I use the secondary keyword. That will allow you to have two IPv4 addresses on an interface.

88
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
But the maximum that you can have is two.

89
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.700
If you do configure this, then you see the example here.

90
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.610
We've got IP address 192.168.10.1 is the primary and 172.16.0.1

91
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.870
is the secondary.

92
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.420
Whenever you send traffic from the router itself and it's sourced from that interface, it will use the primary

93
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.790
IP address.

94
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.910
It's not normal to configure secondary IPv4 addresses.

95
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.210
This is very rarely done.

96
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.280
OK, so that's how it works in IPv4.

97
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.750
You can have a maximum of two IP addresses on an interface and to do that, you have to use a secondary

98
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.289
keyword.

99
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:48.400
It's different in IPv6. In IPv6, you can have multiple IPv6 addresses on the same interface

100
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.430
on a router and it's quite happy for you to do that.

101
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.480
To see an example, here we've got an interface fa0/0.

102
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:02.500
I've got IPv6 address FE80::1 and I say that's the link local address. Then IPv6

103
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:12.100
address 2001:DB8:0:0::1 and IPv6 address

104
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.030
2001:DB8:0:1::1.

105
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.100
And if this was an IPv4, the second one would have overwritten the first one.

106
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:26.080
But in IPv6, we do a show run interface fa0/0f and I can see that all of my IP addresses

107
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.710
are on there.

108
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:33.790
So I've got IPv6 address FE80::1 link local and I've also got the

109
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.370
2001:DB8::1 and the 2001:DB8:0:1::1.

110
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.490
So you can see it will take multiple IP addresses.

111
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:49.000
You can also see from the example here as well that on that same interface, I've also got my IPv4

112
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.440
addresses on there too.

113
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.930
So that will work just fine.

114
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.520
This is a dual stack router, meaning that it's running both IPv4 and IPv6.

115
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.850
If a packet comes into the router, which has got an IPv4 destination address, it will use its IPv4

116
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.720
routing.

117
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:12.250
If a packet comes in with an IPv6 destination address, then it will use its IPv6 routing. Whether it's

118
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.320
going to be IPv4 or IPv6,

119
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.730
depends on the application on the end host that's sending traffic through the router.

120
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:28.700
OK, so to summarize our multiple IPv6 addresses, link local addresses, are mandator on IPv6

121
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:34.700
enabled interfaces. Global unicast and unique local addresses are optional.

122
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:41.210
You can have multiple addresses on the same interface and one link local address for routing protocol

123
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.870
traffic and one global unicast address for normal routing is typical on your routers.

124
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.550
OK, so that was our other types of addresses.

125
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.660
In the next lecture, we'll take a look at this with a lab demo.
