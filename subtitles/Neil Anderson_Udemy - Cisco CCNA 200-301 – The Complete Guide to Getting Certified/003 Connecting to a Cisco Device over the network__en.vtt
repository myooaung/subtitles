00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.550
In this lecture, you'll learn how to connect to the Command Line on Cisco routers and switches over the corporate

2
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.900
network. Before we get started, I want to make it clear that with the lab exercises work in this

3
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.600
course is different than connecting to real routers and switches.

4
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.740
The lab exercises use the free Cisco Packet Tracer software, which is a standalone software that runs

5
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.850
on your PC.

6
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.640
So when you're doing the lab exercises on the course, you're not connecting to real routers and switches.

7
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.830
You can see Section 2, How to Set Up the Lab, for step by step instructions on how to set up and use Packet Tracer

8
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.140
for the course lab exercises.

9
00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.400
After you've passed your CCNA, you're going to be working as a network engineer on real networks

10
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.430
with real routers and switches.

11
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.740
So, of course, you're going to need to know how to connect to those real routers and switches as well,

12
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.140
and that's what we're going to cover here.

13
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.210
So when you are connecting to real routers and switches, you're going to use some software on your laptop to do

14
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.510
that,

15
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.000
and the most commonly used software to use is Putty, which is free software.

16
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.870
But again, for the lab exercises in this course, you're not using Putty, you're not connecting to a real device,

17
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.390
you're using Packet Tracer.

18
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.520
So for this course, you do not need to install or use Putty.

19
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.230
Okay, so let's carry on and see how this is going to work.

20
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.180
So in your day to day tasks as a network engineer, you're not actually going to be physically touching

21
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.030
the network devices.

22
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.560
What's going to be happening is you're going to be sat at your desk, working on your PC, and the device,

23
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.660
the router or switch that you're working on, is going to be in another location.

24
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.660
It's going to be in a locked cabinet, either in the same office that you're in, or the office could

25
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.400
be anywhere in the world,

26
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.750
and you're going to be connecting to that device over the network.

27
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.580
I'm going to show you how to do that now.

28
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.600
So, for example, let's say that you're working as a network administrator, you are over here on

29
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.530
this PC in London, and you're going to be connecting to this router in New York to work on it.

30
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.510
So, how are you going to do that?

31
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.030
Well, you're going to use software on your PC,

32
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.460
so you're going to open, you're then going to connect to the router over the network all the way over in

33
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.030
New York.

34
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.770
You'll get to the Command Line, and you'll be able to work on that router.

35
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.090
So, to get to the Command Line Interface for your day to day management of Cisco devices, the protocol that you're

36
00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.140
going to be using in that software is called Secure Shell (SSH), and you're going to connect to the management

37
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.260
IP address of the device.

38
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.880
There is also another protocol supported, which is Telnet but it's very not recommended to use that

39
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.520
because it is insecure.

40
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.560
So with both SSH and Telnet, they look and work exactly the same way,

41
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.350
but the difference is that when you're entering commands in SSH, those commands are encrypted.

42
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.850
When you enter commands in Telnet, they're unencrypted.

43
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.610
So if anybody is sniffing your traffic over the network, they can see those commands, including your

44
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.680
username and password.

45
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.940
So, Telnet is not used in real networks.

46
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.860
It can be handy in a lab environment, but on a real corporate environment, you're going to be using SSH.

47
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.410
As well as using SSH

48
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.540
also for security, secure login is going to typically be enforced, meaning that you have to enter

49
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.290
a valid username and password.

50
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.050
So, we've got usernames and passwords to log in our devices.

51
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.080
Your company's maybe got 100 different devices.

52
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.930
You don't want to have to configure all your administrators' usernames and passwords on all 100 of those

53
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.270
devices separately.

54
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.410
You want that to be centralized.

55
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.490
So what you'll have is a centralized AAA server. That stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.

56
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.940
It's got access to the central database of all your usernames and passwords, so you'll be having them

57
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.620
on each separate device.

58
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.150
We're going to be covering SSH and AAA, including how to configure them, in later lessons.

59
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.030
I'm not going to cover it here because we need to have all the other settings on the device set up already

60
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.740
as well.

61
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.450
We haven't even configured an IP address yet, so I need to go through all of those other basic settings first.

62
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.450
I'll show you how to configure SSH and AAA in later lectures in the course.

63
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.610
Okay, but I can show you right now how this is going to actually work.

64
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.440
So, let's have a look at that.

65
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.080
The first thing we need to do

66
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:15.570
is to actually download and install Putty. To find Putty, it's very easy. We can just go Google, and I'm going

67
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.940
to Google for Putty download,

68
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.570
and then it's this first entry here

69
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.840
at putty.org.

70
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:31.660
I will click on that, and then I can see I can download Putty here. I will click on the link, and then

71
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.270
I'm on a 64-bit Windows machine here,

72
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.130
so I am going to download the 64-bit Windows file.

73
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.530
So I will click on that,

74
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.230
and it's very small.

75
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.460
I can see that it has downloaded already.

76
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.800
So, I will go to my Downloads folder.

77
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.170
I will double click on the Putty installer here.

78
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.930
I click Next on the welcome screen. I'm happy to install it into Program Files\Putty, click Next

79
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:13.310
again. I'll accept all the defaults here, and click on Install, and then click on Finish.

80
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:23.520
So, that was in Program Files and Putty. I could create a shortcut for this on my desktop.

81
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.570
I'm just going to run the Putty executable file there, and this is what Putty looks like,

82
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.990
and you can see in here that I've got my different connection types.

83
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.710
So for connecting to Cisco device, you can use Telnet or SSH or Serial, that I'll cover in the next lecture.

84
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.140
We don't want to use Telnet because it's insecure.

85
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:51.910
We're going to be using SSH, and I need to enter the IP address or hostname of the device I'm connecting to.

86
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.580
So my router is at 192.168.1.254,

87
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:06.910
I'll enter that IP address, and then I will click on Open, and because SSH is a secure protocol,

88
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.260
it's giving me this warning message here about the exchange algorithm.

89
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.260
I just click Yes to say that I do want to continue, and then I get another warning message,

90
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.180
I click Yes on that as well.

91
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.920
And I can see that it says up here, who do I want to log in as?

92
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.930
Now, I know that this can look very small for you,

93
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.500
so let me also show you how you can customize the Putty settings.

94
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.430
I'll click on the Putty icon up here in the top left, I right

95
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.580
click on there, and then I'm going to go Change Settings, and you can see you can change things like the

96
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.830
colors, the appearance, and so on

97
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.830
in here. I'm going to go to Appearance, and for the font, I'm going to change that, and I'm going to

98
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.140
bring it all the way up to 22 just to make it easier for you to see, and then click on Apply.

99
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.500
So I'm going to log in as the user I already created on this real router, which was neil,

100
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.540
and then, I've also configured a warning message that it's only for authorized users.

101
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.620
I also entered in my password there as well,

102
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.600
and you can see I am now connected on to the New York router.

103
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:20.200
So, very simple to connect to real Cisco devices over the network,

104
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:26.890
just download Putty, then open Putty, enter the IP address of the device that you want to connect

105
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.130
to. Enter in your username and password

106
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.230
if it has been configured in your corporate network, which it most likely will be. You're now on the

107
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.679
Command Line of the router, and you can start configuring it.

108
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:45.820
Okay, one last thing that I want to talk about here, and that is Out of Band Management.

109
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.360
So, let me go back to the slides again,

110
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:59.020
and you saw in that example there that I was the administrator over on the PC here, connecting over the

111
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.820
corporate network onto the router in New York,

112
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.020
and that traffic was going over the Production Network.

113
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:16.030
What the Production Network means is the network that is being used for your normal user traffic,

114
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.370
the network that is used for your staff in their normal activities.

115
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:28.470
So, for example, we've got a normal staff member on their laptop here, and they are connecting to an

116
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.930
email server, for example, over in New York.

117
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.490
Well, when they connect to it, they're connecting over this network path here.

118
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.140
That's the Production Network,

119
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:44.230
and that was the same path that you went over when you were connecting to the router.

120
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.990
You can connect to the router for management over the normal Production Network.

121
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:58.960
What you'll find most the large companies do is they'll also have a separate dedicated network for management

122
00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.500
as well,

123
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:07.120
so it looks like this. The reason that they put in a separate dedicated Management Network is maybe there's

124
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.630
a problem with the router in New York over the Production Network, and you're not able to connect to

125
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.500
it over there.

126
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:21.820
So by having a separate dedicated Management Network, that gives you a backup path that you can use

127
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.110
to connect to your network devices if they have any problems.

128
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.630
It's also more secure having a separate dedicated path as well, so now we've got two paths that

129
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.600
we can use to get to our router.

130
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:41.740
When you do have a separate Management Network set up, if you're connecting over the Production Network,

131
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.700
we call that In Band Management. You're going In Band over the Production Network, going over the same

132
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.750
cables that your normal users are using to connect between offices.

133
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.680
If you connect over that separate Management Network,

134
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:03.560
we call that Out of Band Management. It's Out of Band, not over the same path as your normal staff traffic.

135
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:09.720
Okay, so that was everything I needed to show you here about connecting over the network.

136
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:18.600
In the next lecture, I'll show you how you can connect to a router over a direct console connection.
