00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:16.510
In this lecture, you'll learn about port security, which we can use to secure our ports on our switches.

2
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:26.130
First thing I'll talk about while we're on this subject is its best practice to shutdown any unused interfaces.

3
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.570
So if you've got any parts in your switch that don't have anything plugged in to them right now, then

4
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.670
you should shutdown those parts.

5
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.450
The reason for this is it stops somebody unauthorized coming along, plugging into the port and getting

6
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.530
onto the network.

7
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:51.230
OK, so on to port security. Port security enables an administrator or you to specify which MAC address

8
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.070
or addresses can send traffic into an individual switchport. So that can be used to lock a port down

9
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.430
to a particular host or hosts.

10
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.170
So see the example in the picture here. I've got PC1, which has got MAC address 1.1.1

11
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.900
and on port fa0/2 on the switch, which is where it's plugged in,

12
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.340
I configure port security on there and actually the only MAC address 1.1.1 is allowed

13
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.380
to send traffic into this port.

14
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.400
So port security,

15
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.110
it works on MAC addresses.

16
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.460
So we do that,

17
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.100
and then if somebody comes along and wants to connect into the network and they disconnect PC1 and

18
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.320
they plug a different PC into the same cable, it's going to have a different MAC address.

19
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.170
So this one's got MAC address 2.2.2 that then send traffic into the network, comes in

20
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.740
with a source MAC of 2.2.2 which is not the allowed

21
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.700
MAC address of 1.1.1. So the switch will drop that traffic.

22
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:06.270
But, it's easy to spoof a MAC address. That scenario that I just gave you there, if this was an attacker doing

23
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.360
it and they knew the MAC address of the existing host was 1.1.1, they can easily

24
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.420
change their MAC address to 1.1.1.

25
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.120
You can do that in software in a few seconds.

26
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.460
So locking ports down to a specific host is not

27
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:31.260
what port security is actually usually used for in production networks. There's a different thing that we

28
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.070
can use it for.

29
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.630
Port security can also configure individual switchports

30
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.290
to allow only a specified number of source MAC addresses to send traffic into the port and it can learn

31
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.020
the MAC addresses that are coming in.

32
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.980
Of course it can do that.

33
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.680
It's a switch.

34
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.440
It's what switches do. So what we configure here is on that switchport again on the switch fa0/2,

35
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.350
we say that we're going to allow only one MAC address to send traffic into this port.

36
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.370
We don't specify what the MAC address is, but because PC1 is connected in right now, the switch

37
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.030
will learn

38
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.480
that the current MAC address is 1.1.1.

39
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.600
And what this allows us to do, why it's useful, is it prevents users from adding wireless access points

40
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.350
or other shared devices on to your network.

41
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.910
So we've got the same network again here where we've got the switch on port fa0/2. We enabled

42
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.350
port security on there.

43
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.550
We're going to allow one MAC address and it learned 1.1.1.

44
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.380
And then what happens is that one of your users says there's not enough wall port in this part of the building.

45
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.460
There's too many people.

46
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.110
We can't get them all connected into the wall and the IT helpdesk take too long to fix things and

47
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.920
get back to me.

48
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.450
So I'm going to do it myself.

49
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.050
And the user goes and takes a wireless access point from home and they plug that into the port.

50
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.610
And hopefully it's obvious that this is a big problem because a user doesn't really know much about

51
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.240
networking.

52
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.350
They're not going to put the correct security settings in a wireless access point.

53
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.620
Maybe that part of the building is right next to the car park and they go and put a wireless access

54
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.220
point in

55
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.090
there that has got unrestricted access on it.

56
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.650
Now, anybody can pull up in your car park and get onto your network.

57
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.990
So that's a huge security concern.

58
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.450
Well, port security can stop that from happening.

59
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.190
So say the user does do that.

60
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.870
They connect another wireless access point or maybe it's another switch into that switch.

61
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.970
And now we've got PC1 with MAC 1.1.1 and PC2,

62
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.450
with MAC 2.2.2, both trying to use that physical port fa0/2 on

63
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.640
the switch, but it's only allowed one MAC address, which is 1.1.1 right now.

64
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.260
So now, when that additional PC with MAC 2.2.2, tries to send traffic into the network, the switch

65
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.770
is going to drop it. That's what port security is most commonly used for in production networks.

66
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.340
To configure this, very simple if you don't add any additional parameters, it's configured at the interface

67
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.820
level.

68
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.980
So we would say interface fa0/2 and then switchport port-security.

69
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.320
It's configured at the interface level.

70
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.900
But obviously, typically you would enable this on all ports on your switch, not just one.

71
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.430
If you do configure port security like we did just there with no additional parameters, then only one

72
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.360
MAC address is allowed to transmit on the port by default.

73
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.070
These are all the default settings.

74
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.130
With that, the current MAC address can be disconnected and replaced.

75
00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.290
The port is not locked down to a particular MAC address. So save it,

76
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.260
host MAC address 1.1.1

77
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.840
is currently plugged in and transmitting.

78
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.500
That's fine.

79
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.820
It's only one MAC address.

80
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.660
If, you then disconnect that host, well, the port will go down because there was nothing on the other

81
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.940
end.

82
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.660
You then plug in another host with MAC address 2.2.2. the port goes

83
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.350
live again.

84
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.890
The switch will learn the new MAC address of 2.2.2 and that host can transmit now.

85
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.630
So when you do it like this with the default setting, it locks it down to just one MAC address.

86
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.520
So you can't have multiple people behind a wireless access point or a switch.

87
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.630
But the actual MAC address that is on

88
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.830
there can be changed.

89
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.900
So if a shared device is connected and multiple hosts are trying to transmit, the port will be shutdown.

90
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.310
But if it's only ever one at a time, doesn't matter which one it is, that will be allowed.

91
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.860
To verify your port security settings, the command is show port-security and then the interface that

92
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.450
you want to check. Here we're checking interface fa0/2.

93
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.770
I can see here that port security has been enabled. The violation mode is shutdown.

94
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.560
Meaning if I get more than one MAC address transmitting on this port, I'm going to shut the port down.

95
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:23.730
We'll cover the other violation modes later in this section. The maximum MAC addresses

96
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.030
allowed is one. That's the default and total MAC addresses,

97
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.210
that's how many have been discovered right now, is also one.

98
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.380
The current MAC

99
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.020
address is ending A359.

100
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.670
It's in VLAN 1.

101
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:42.570
The security violation count is zero because I've only got that one MAC address. At no point has more

102
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:49.260
than one MAC address tries to transmit. So because there is no violations, the port status is secure,

103
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.410
meaning that port security has been enabled on here,

104
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.690
and it's up right now.

105
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.110
It has not been shutdown.

106
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:05.030
OK, so I just mentioned the security violation options. There's three options. You select one of the

107
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.950
three. The default is Shutdown. With this,

108
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.560
the interface is placed into the error-disabled state.

109
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.220
If there's a violation and it will block all traffic. The next option is Protect.

110
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.890
When you do this, traffic from unauthorized addresses is dropped.

111
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.890
Traffic from allowed addresses is forwarded.

112
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.170
So it's not going to shut the interface down.

113
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:32.419
So your legitimate host can still keep transmitting on there, but it's going to lock out any unauthorized

114
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.020
addresses.

115
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.890
The last one is Restrict, which is similar to Protect.

116
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.559
Again, traffic from unauthorized addresses is dropped, but with restrict, there will also be a log and

117
00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:49.190
the violation counter incremented. Again, the same with protect traffic from allowed addresses is forwarded.

118
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:57.990
To change the violation action from the default of shutdown, at the interface level, switchport

119
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.890
port-security violation, and then either protect or restrict.

120
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:12.190
OK, if the valuation option is left at the default, which is shutdown and a violation occurs like more

121
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:17.710
than one MAC address tries to transmit on the interface, the port will move into an error-disabled

122
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.040
state. When it's in an error-disabled state,

123
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:26.300
the port is down. To bring an error-disabled interface back into service,

124
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:33.190
first off, remove those MAC addresses, the offending ones that are causing the problem in the first

125
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.580
place.

126
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:39.310
After that, you need to do a shutdown and then a no shutdown on the interface.

127
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.860
That's how you bring it back into service again.

128
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:52.780
So doing it that way is manual. You can also do it in an automatic way as well. So you can specify a time

129
00:09:52.780 --> 00:10:00.460
interval after which a port that has been error-disabled will automatically move back into service again.

130
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.580
The time interval is configured in settings. The example configuration here and this one is done at the

131
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.250
global config level rather than at the interface

132
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.490
level. I've said errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation.

133
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:21.340
This means how to, what we're going to do to recover from an error-disabled interface if the cause, the

134
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:27.310
cause it to go error-disabled was a port security violation and then errdisable recovery

135
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:34.990
interval 600 means that after it first goes to error-disabled, after 600 seconds, it will automatically

136
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.350
come out of error-disabled and start forwarding traffic again.

137
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:43.620
Obviously, if the offending hosts are still there, it will just go back into a violation state again.

138
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.760
So more commonly, we would be fixing this manually with the shutdown and the no shutdown.

139
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.860
OK, so that is port security.

140
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.560
Next up, we will have a look at how to configure it in the lab.
