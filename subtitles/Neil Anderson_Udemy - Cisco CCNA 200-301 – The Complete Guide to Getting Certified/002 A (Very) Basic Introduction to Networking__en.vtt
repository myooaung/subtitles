00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.780
In this lesson, I'm going to give you a very basic introduction to networking.

2
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.080
If you already know about switches and routers and network topology, you can just skip right on ahead

3
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.420
to the next lesson.

4
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.240
But if you're brand new to networking, then I'm going to give you a quick overview here. So, let's say that we've

5
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.560
got an office which is in New York for our company. In that office,

6
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:42.460
I'm going to have end hosts like PCs, a server, and a printer like you can see here, and they're going

7
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.450
to need to be able to communicate with each other.

8
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.230
So for that, I'm going to put in a network switch, and I'm going to cable my devices to that switch with

9
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.110
Ethernet cables, and that's what a switch looks like.

10
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.540
There's a Cisco switch, you can see it's got a lot of ports in there so that I'm going to be able to

11
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.620
connect in a lot of devices.

12
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.000
The switch is what allows connectivity on my Local Area Network (LAN). In that office in New York,

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.550
maybe I've also got a laptop which is going to connect in over our Wireless Network.

14
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.700
So for that, I'm also going to have a Wireless Access Point which is also going to connect in to our switch,

15
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.540
and that's what a Wireless Access Point looks like.

16
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.470
So I've got all my devices in New York now,

17
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.200
they can all talk to each other.

18
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.120
I've built a Local Area Network. A Local Area Network is a network that connects devices which are in

19
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.440
the same local area,

20
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.200
like in a single office or maybe a university campus.

21
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.130
Okay, I don't just want my end hosts in my office to be able to talk to each other,

22
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.570
they're going to want to communicate with other devices out on the Internet as well.

23
00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.560
So for connectivity out there, I'm going to need a bit more of an advanced device which is a router. A router

24
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.150
is able to make advanced routing decisions to route traffic between different areas of your network.

25
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.620
That's why it's called a router, and this is what a router looks like.

26
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.750
You can see it's pretty similar to a switch,

27
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.110
same kind of size.

28
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.370
Typically it will have the less physical ports on there, and it will support different types of ports

29
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.760
so that it can connect different types of networks as well.

30
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.640
Next thing we know that there's going to be bad guys on the Internet, hackers who are going to try to

31
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.550
attack us,

32
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.060
so we need to guard against that.

33
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.900
So we're going to put a firewall in place, and this is what a firewall looks like.

34
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.350
Again, you'll see that our different network devices tend to look very similar to each other, but they fulfill

35
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.620
different tasks on the network. The firewall secures the different parts of our network from each other.

36
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.780
Okay,

37
00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.790
so that was our New York office, the Local Area Network and it's connected to the Internet. In a larger

38
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.870
company, we're not going to just have one office in New York. In our example here,

39
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.110
let's say we've also got an office in Boston as well. In Boston, we're going to have a similar kind of

40
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.700
setup, the same kind of devices in there. We're going to have a Local Area Network in Boston,

41
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.410
and we've also got local connectivity to the Internet from Boston as well.

42
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.160
Now, because we're the same company, I'm going to want to have connectivity between my New York and my

43
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.510
Boston offices.

44
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.650
I want the end hosts in both those sites to be able to communicate with each other.

45
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.000
It is possible that they could communicate securely over the Internet

46
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.960
If I set that up, but another way of doing it is I could maybe put in a dedicated connection between my two

47
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.860
routers in both sites,

48
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.610
and that's going to give me my Wide Area Network (WAN) connection between my different offices.

49
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.900
Okay,

50
00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:02.110
so that's a really quick overview of networking, and the point of networking is to allow that connectivity

51
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.160
between our different end hosts on the network.

52
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.100
So looking now at the characteristics of a network, we've got the topology.

53
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.150
Let's just go back to that previous slide.

54
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.010
This is an example of a network topology diagram.

55
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.780
The topology is how the devices are connected up to each other. Other characteristic is the speed

56
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.310
of the network.

57
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.940
Typically, the faster the network is, the more it's going to cost you,

58
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.770
and cost is itself a characteristic as well.

59
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.070
Things that will affect the cost are the type of devices you have in there, the size of a network,

60
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.270
the different technologies you're using, etc. Other characteristics are security, I mentioned the firewall

61
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.710
in the previous slide.

62
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.650
We're not going to just have security in our firewall, though.

63
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.150
We also have security features on our routers and on our switches, and we can have other security devices

64
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.290
such as Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) as well.

65
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.940
Next, we have availability.

66
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.280
We're going to want to make sure that our network always stays up, and for mission critical components

67
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.240
in the network,

68
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.330
typically, we don't want any single points of failure.

69
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.930
So, we will double up on those components so that if anyone fails, we've got an alternative component

70
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.550
that will still be up and running. Scalability is also important.

71
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.270
We want to design the network in such a way that it's easy for it to grow with our company without requiring

72
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.270
a redesign. And reliability,

73
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.850
similar to availability, where we want to make sure again that the network is going to be reliable, but it's

74
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.130
going to continue to work.
