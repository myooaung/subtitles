00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:16.480
In this lecture, you'll learn about firewalls, intrusion detection systems and IP intrusion prevention

2
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.590
systems, so I'll tell you about the characteristics of each.

3
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.670
The differences between them and how they best work together to provide security for an organization.

4
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:37.180
So starting off with the IDs on the IPS, ID stands for intrusion detection system and IPS is an intrusion

5
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.440
prevention system.

6
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:48.370
The IDF, or IPS, uses signatures to inspect pockets up to layer seven of US iStock looking for traffic

7
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.830
patterns which match new wing attacks.

8
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.730
We can also use anomaly based inspection to look for unusual behavior such as the host, which is sending

9
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.470
a lot more traffic than usual.

10
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.440
That would indicate that it has been infected by a worm.

11
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.750
So your IDs and IPS actually are quite similar to the antivirus software that you'll find on your Peachy.

12
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.860
And they use signatures to look for Nouwen attacks.

13
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.280
They can also use heuristics to look for characteristics which would indicate an attack to something

14
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.830
out of the normal or something which looks similar to another NGUON attack.

15
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.050
The IDF and IPS require skilled staff to tune them to their own particular environment and minimise

16
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.810
false positives and false negatives.

17
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.670
A false positive is when the IPS triggers because it thinks there's been an attack when actually that

18
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.200
was legitimate traffic and a false negative is worse, but is when there is an attack.

19
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.800
The IPS does not recognize it and does not trigger your ideas in your IPS.

20
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.190
They do need tuning because each separate environment has got its own separate traffic patterns to something

21
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.790
that might be in your organization would maybe indicate an attack and a different organization.

22
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.710
So it does take some time to tune the IPS when you first install it to tune out to fill or Ibos false

23
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.420
positives and false negatives.

24
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.350
And as things can change in your network over time, it requires the IPS to be updated to reflect that.

25
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.080
The difference between an idea and an IPS, an idea, an intrusion detection system sits alongside the

26
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.050
traffic flow and informs security administrators of any potential concerns, anything that looks like

27
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.980
an attack, an IPS, an intrusion prevention system.

28
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.700
So it's in line with the traffic flow and it can also block attacks as well as new.

29
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:04.480
If I knew about them and I'd ask may also have the capability to tell a firewall to block attacks if

30
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.990
the firewall was in line with the traffic flow.

31
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.950
But the IDF is not.

32
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.140
Obviously, you would need to have an I.D. and a firewall which are compatible to be able to do that.

33
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.250
The Cisco Ideas and Firewall can do that.

34
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.700
OK, so here's a diagram showing the difference between the IPS and the ideas, and you can see we've

35
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.710
got the IPS on the top here it is in line with the traffic flow to the traffic flows going through it.

36
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.600
So if it detects an attack, it can stop.

37
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.170
It can block traffic.

38
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.970
An idea, on the other hand, is off to the side of the traffic flow.

39
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:49.010
So here we're going to be using mirroring to send a copy of the traffic to the IDF because with traffic

40
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.950
is actually going through a different path.

41
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.150
We're just sending a copy to the IDF.

42
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.110
The IDF itself cannot drop the traffic in line.

43
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.240
But if it was a firewall here and it was a compatible firewall, the IDF could send a message to the

44
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.310
firewall telling the firewall to do it.

45
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.740
The reason that we have the two different options here is that an IPS can sometimes be a bottleneck.

46
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.680
If there's not enough throughput on the eyepiece to handle the amount of traffic going through it.

47
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.390
You don't want it to slow down the network traffic.

48
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.700
You could use an IDF instead.

49
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.150
In that situation, there are other things we can do to help with that, such as clustering as well.

50
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.700
I'll talk about Costarring a little bit later on.

51
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:42.080
OK, about was the idea and the IPSC comparing them with Firewall's now John IPPs and an use the signatures

52
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.590
to inspect pockets up are seven iStock looking for traffic patterns which match Nunatak.

53
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.820
So IPPs uses signatures, firewalls, block or permit traffic based on rules such as destination IP

54
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.970
address and part number two, an ipsus of signatures.

55
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.740
A firewall uses rules.

56
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.240
Organizations will always deploy firewalls on their Internet age, there's no way an organization would

57
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.270
connect to the Internet without having a firewall there to protect themselves.

58
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.350
They may also deploy firewalls at security points inside their internal network.

59
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.570
So for sure, they'll have a firewall between them and the Internet.

60
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.170
They may also have a part of their network which has got sensitive servers there.

61
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.880
Maybe we would have another separate firewall there.

62
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.150
Also as well, eyepieces are typically seen as an option to where firewalls are in danger.

63
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.560
You're always going to have a firewall between you and the Internet.

64
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.390
Ipsus are traditionally seen as optional rather than they may be deployed in conjunction with your firewalls.

65
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:59.550
Now, the lines have blurred in recent years between IPS and firewalls, so the things they do are separate,

66
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.280
but you can now get All-In-One devices, you get firewalls which have also got IP capability built into

67
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.170
them as well.

68
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.360
And that is becoming particularly prevalent since the emergence of Next-Generation Firewalls.

69
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.500
So modern firewalls do also often have IP capability as well as the firewall capability.

70
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.930
They're also often capable of acting as the endpoint of VPN term tunnels as well.

71
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.530
I'll talk about VPN tunnels.

72
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.810
We are in the section.

73
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.760
So organizations have a choice they can deploy and all in one solution with a firewall, which also

74
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.570
has IP capability, or they might split those functions to provide better scalability, specialized

75
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:51.410
devices to separate firewall and IPS may also have more advanced features than would be available within

76
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.770
Allwyn.

77
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.560
One solution, another option for scalability and higher throughput is clustered devices.

78
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.600
She saw in the diagram earlier.

79
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.460
I had inline IPS and so that it's possible that it could become a bottleneck if it doesn't support enough

80
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.720
for the amount of traffic going through it.

81
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:16.250
Well, a solution that will often resolve the issue is by putting in multiple hardware devices there

82
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.630
and sending the traffic through those multiple hardware devices.

83
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:26.660
If the devices support clustering, then the act as a single solution for management and also for all

84
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.880
of her features as well.

85
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.870
But because you've got multiple devices there, they now support higher throughput and it also gives

86
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.200
you redundancy in case one of them fails as well.

87
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.660
OK, let's wrap up this picture with a look at an example.

88
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:50.360
Network topology showing how firewalls and ISPs can work together to in the example network here, we've

89
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.870
got a couple of departments on the inside department and department be very connected into a layer free

90
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.180
switch, and then it's connected to the inside interface on the firewall.

91
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.300
The outside interface on firewall is connected out to the Internet.

92
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:14.360
We also have a DMZ here that's a demilitarized zone where we're going to put our sensitive internal

93
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.910
servers there by having the servers in a DMZ rather than on the inside.

94
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:27.710
That allows us to have a more suitable policy, separate policies for our servers and for our normal

95
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.880
internal hosts.

96
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:36.500
So you can see here we've also got an IPS as well, which is protecting those internal servers.

97
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.360
Now, some things to say here.

98
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:46.460
If this firewall was an all in one solution, Next-Generation Firewall, which also had IP capabilities

99
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:53.150
such as the Cisco AC with firepower, then we wouldn't need to have a separate IP here.

100
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.210
And that would also protect the inside hosts as well as the internal servers.

101
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:05.930
Right now, if this firewall is just fulfilling the firewall duties, it doesn't have any IP features

102
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.410
on there.

103
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.150
And we've got the IP down here.

104
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.380
Well, right now the IP is just protecting our internal servers.

105
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.400
We don't have an IP protecting the internal hooks.

106
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:22.600
Depending on your particular situation and environment that might be acceptable, she can see is just

107
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.160
an example of one way that you could do it.

108
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:33.320
You're always going to have a firewall protecting yourself from the Internet and IP is typically seen

109
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.340
as optional.

110
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:40.350
The IP ash can be a separate device or it can be built into the firewall.

111
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.180
OK, that's everything that I needed to tell you here.

112
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:50.960
In the next lecture, we'll have a look at how firewalls work in some more detail and also compare them

113
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.250
to packet filters.
