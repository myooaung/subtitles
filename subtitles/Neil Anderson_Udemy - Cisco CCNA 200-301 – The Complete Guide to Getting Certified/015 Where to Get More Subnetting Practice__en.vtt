00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.250
We've finished everything about IP addressing and subnetting.

2
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.320
And if you're like me and not very good at Math, you're probably going to be glad to hear that.

3
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.120
Don't worry.

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.680
Everything else that we're going to cover is not Math-based, and you're not going to be having to count

5
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.630
anything up in your head.

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.130
Everything else that you're going to get tested on is about the different features that are available,

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.260
what they do,

8
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.600
how to configure them, and how to troubleshoot them.

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.970
But if you are not sure about subnetting and you want some more practice with that, then there are some good

10
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.760
resources that I've put on the screen for you here.

11
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.230
So, let's have a look at these. The first is www.subnettingquestions.com, so I'll click on the link here. And what

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.620
this is it's a website that has questions, the same type of questions that you could see on the CCNA

13
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.300
exam, and every time you refresh it, it will come up with a new question.

14
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.800
For example, what's the first valid host on the subnet that the node 192.168.2.5/27 belongs

15
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:23.140
to? Another one, which is similar, is www.subnetting.org.

16
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.660
So same kind of thing, every time you refresh, it will give you a new question.

17
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.330
Again, same type of question, and it's really

18
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.390
variations on everything that we covered earlier in this course.

19
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.300
So, you should be confident that you can answer any of these questions now.

20
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.430
Check the question, when you figured that out, you can click on 'Reveal answer.' It tells you the answer,

21
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.810
and then you can go on to the next question.

22
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.360
This is really good for practicing subnetting, and again, if you're like me, you're not going to just learn

23
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.260
this in one go and then have it down.

24
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.010
You're probably going to want to practice it a little bit. Don't spend hours on end

25
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.140
practicing subnetting. That's no fun for anybody. But to get ready for the exam, you could

26
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.390
just come on here and spend 5 or 10 minutes a day just working through a few problems. And if you

27
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.670
do that for days or even weeks before the exam, you'll be fine when you get going subnetting questions.

28
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.270
Another thing to tell you is on the real world, people don't do subnetting in their head, typically,

29
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.920
if it wasn't obvious already. What we do is we use a subnet calculator.

30
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.060
So what you can do is you can go to Google, and in Google search, just search for subnet calculator,

31
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.750
and you'll see there is a heap of results that you will get.

32
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.000
I'll just click on the top one here to show you an example. So what this is useful for is if you are

33
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.590
doing subnetting in the real world,

34
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.030
if you need to figure anything out.

35
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.800
Also, if you're doing exam practice and you want to check that you got the answer right,

36
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.260
you can just come in here, plug in the numbers, and it will give you the answer. Okay,

37
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.900
that's it.

38
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.150
Subnetting done.

39
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.740
Let's move on to some of our features now.
