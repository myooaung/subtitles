00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.020
In this lecture, you'll learn how to do a password recovery from watching a lab

2
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.670
demo. When we talk about password recovery, we're talking about recovering from a lost enable password

3
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.220
or secret.

4
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.780
Now, I know we haven't spoken about those yet.

5
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.270
We're going to cover them in a later section when we get to securing your Cisco router or switch.

6
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.610
For now, all you need to know is that you can set a password that is required to get to the enable prompt.

7
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.640
So, let's actually do that on a router.

8
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.700
So I'll go to global configuration mode

9
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:55.740
and I'll say, 'enable password Flackbox1' and 'enable secret Flackbox2'. The difference between these

10
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.780
is 'enable password' is really a legacy command, 'enable

11
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.040
secret' is the new form of doing it. So if I go 'end' here, and do a 'show run', you'll see the difference is

12
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.610
that the 'enabled secret' is always in an encrypted form.

13
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.200
When you do look at the running-config, 'enable password' is unencrypted by default.

14
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.390
So, that could be a security concern.

15
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.720
If you've enabled both 'enable secret' and the 'enable password', then the 'enable secret' overrides the 'enable

16
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.290
password'.

17
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.910
So anyway, 'enable password' isn't used.

18
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.240
We're always going to use the 'enable secret'.

19
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.200
Okay,

20
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.150
so our scenario is that an 'enable secret' has been set on this

21
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.720
router,

22
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.700
and we come to work on the router,

23
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.000
so we need to get to the enable prompt.

24
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.810
We type in 'enable', it asks us for a password,

25
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.090
and the problem is that we do not know the password,

26
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.840
and nobody else in the company does either.

27
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.410
So, we need to recover the password.

28
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.880
The way to do it is to boot up the router first into ROMMON mode.

29
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.680
Now, the way you normally do that is you power it on, and within the first minute, you hit Ctrl + Break,

30
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.210
the break sequence, and that will break into the ROMMON prompt. Because I'm on Packet Tracer here,

31
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:25.030
it doesn't really give me much time to do that, so I'm going to do it from the normal config instead.

32
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.630
So, I'm going to log in here if I can remember what the password was.

33
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.920
Okay, got it, and I'll go to 'config t' and I'm going to set the config register here.

34
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.690
So, I'll set it to 'config-register 0x2120',

35
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.180
and that's going to boot it up onto the ROMMON prompt.

36
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.290
That's obviously, normally, if you're doing a password recovery, you're not going to be able to get to config

37
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.280
mode to do it here.

38
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.800
So you would be breaking in when the router first boots up, or switch.

39
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.700
Okay,

40
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.820
so I've done that. I'll 'end' and do a 'copy run start' and then 'reload',

41
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.510
and this is going to boot-up into the ROMMON prompt.

42
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:15.960
Okay, so this is how I would do my password recovery, and why I need to go here is tell the router to bypass

43
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.430
the startup-config when it's booting up. The command for that is 'confreg'.

44
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.830
So it's a little bit different than it is at the normal command prompt, and to bypass NVRAM, which

45
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:40.350
is where the startup-config is, it's 'confreg 0x2142'. Hit Enter and then 'reset' to boot the router, and

46
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.990
you'll see that when it finishes booting up, it's not going to ask me for an enable password to get into

47
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.460
the enable prompt because it's booted it up with a blank config. You can see that's happened because it's

48
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.510
booted up into the Setup Wizard. So I will say 'no' here to bypass the Setup Wizard, and now I can hit 'enable',

49
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.900
and because it's not using the enable secret from a startup-config, it's not going to ask me for a

50
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.990
password.

51
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.320
Okay,

52
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:20.430
next thing that I need to do is to copy the startup-config into the running-config. I do that, and it's

53
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.620
going to copy the startup-config in that was already there, with all of the commands that are already

54
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.950
there, including that enable secret. But I don't need to know it because I'm already at the enable prompt.

55
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.690
Next thing I need to do is 'config t', and I'm going to set a new enable secret, or for this lab exercise,

56
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.800
what I'll actually do is I'll just go 'no enable secret' to remove it. Real world, you would always

57
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.050
want to have a secret for the enable prompt on the router.

58
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.900
So, you wouldn't actually do that. You'd actually just set a different secret that you know now, so

59
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.830
you can get in

60
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.340
next time it reboots.

61
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.970
Okay, last thing I need to do is a 'copy run start',

62
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.060
and now I'm all good.

63
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.070
I've got my existing config on there

64
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.360
that was there before.

65
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.910
I've reset the password, and I'm in to the router.

66
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.360
And next time that I reload, actually, did I reset the config register?

67
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.910
No.

68
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.990
Okay,

69
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.590
I forgot that. This is super important too.

70
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:39.270
Okay, so also at the global configuration, do a 'config-register 0x2102' is for the default

71
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.900
boot.

72
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.580
Okay,

73
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.440
Not so deliberate mistake there.

74
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:50.070
If I'd done that in the real world, then what would happen would be next time that I rebooted, it would go

75
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.100
back into I think it was the ROMMON prompt again, which obviously would not be good.

76
00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.770
So don't forget to reset the config-register as well, 'end', and 'copy run start'. Actually, what you would

77
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.900
do in the real world at this point just to make sure that it will be good when it boots up again is

78
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.470
actually to do a 'reload'.

79
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.690
You're not causing an outage because you already had an outage right now anyway.

80
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.380
So once you've finished, just reboot it again. Take a couple of minutes, wait for it to boot up, and then check

81
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:27.060
that it loads correctly and that you can log in. So go to enable,

82
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.650
okay,

83
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.730
and it's asking me for a password.

84
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.870
I'll let you know a secret. I actually paused the video when this first happened because I was like, why

85
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.930
did that happen?

86
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.370
And then I thought,

87
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.030
okay,

88
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.240
and I realized. So what I want you to do now is pause the video and have a think about it,

89
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.280
because I did the 'no enable secret' command and I've rebooted.

90
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.550
I didn't forget to do the 'copy run start', I rebooted and it's still asking me for a password to

91
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.480
get into the enable prompt. So, have a think about why that is the case.

92
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.740
Stop the video for a minute if you have to.

93
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.890
When you start the video again, I'll tell you the reason why. Okay,

94
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:17.620
the reason why is that when we did the initial part of the lab, I set an 'enable password' and an 'enable

95
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.450
secret'.

96
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.830
When I did the password recovery,

97
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.470
I just did the 'no enable secret'.

98
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.970
I didn't do the 'no enable password', so there's still an 'enable password' there,

99
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.350
and that's what it's asking me for now.

100
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.810
Now,

101
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.060
in the real world, 

102
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.490
it's highly unlikely you would run into this problem because you wouldn't do a 'no enable

103
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.500
secret'. What you would do is you would set a new 'enable secret', which would override the 'enable password',

104
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.080
and when you reboot it, it would be asking you for the secret that you just set here.

105
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.980
If you remember what we set, it was 'Flackbox1' for the 'enable password',

106
00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:03.580
so I'm actually able to log in here. If I did a 'config t' now and set 'enable secret' as the new secret

107
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.620
of 'Flackbox2', and hit Enter,

108
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.580
'copy run

109
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.840
start' at the enable prompt, a 'copy

110
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.060
run start'.

111
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.160
This is what I should have done earlier in the lab, set a different 'enable secret'.

112
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.430
Then, when I rebooted, it would have asked me for that new 'enable secret', which I do know.

113
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.110
Okay,

114
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.180
hopefully, that entertains you watching me make a couple of mistakes there.

115
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.120
I'll try not to do it in the next lecture.
