00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.520
In this lecture, you're going to learn about the three main types of traffic that will send over an IP

2
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:24.170
network, which are unicast, broadcast, and multicast. Unicast traffic goes to a single destination

3
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.940
host. Broadcast

4
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.740
traffic goes to all hosts on the subnet, and multicast traffic goes to multiple interested hosts.

5
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.520
So, let's have a look and see how this works.

6
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.160
The first example here is going to be unicast traffic.

7
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.610
I've got the sender over on the left, and it sends some particular traffic to the PC, up at the top of

8
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.590
the picture there,

9
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.780
and it also sends some other traffic to the PC up at the top right.

10
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.490
So unicast traffic, it's coming from a sender, and it's going to one particular host, so unicast.

11
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.570
The next traffic type is broadcast traffic. With broadcast traffic, the sender sends one copy of the traffic

12
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.710
that will come into the switch, and then it gets flooded out to all other hosts on that particular part

13
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.460
of the network. So, see here, it goes to all of the different PCs that are attached to the switch.

14
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.100
There is only one copy of the traffic that gets sent everywhere. You'll see it all to hits the router in

15
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.480
the middle there, which has got an interface which is on that network.

16
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.310
What happens then is the router will drop the traffic, so routers do not forward broadcast traffic on.

17
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.110
You see the other two interfaces on the router.

18
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.940
We don't forward the broadcast traffic

19
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.720
out the other side of the router. This is a good thing because if you think about it, like with the Internet,

20
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.450
imagine if you sent a broadcast traffic and it got sent to everybody on the Internet. Well, there's a lot

21
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.760
of broadcast traffic, and that would really badly affect performance, and also we could see the security

22
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.970
concerns there as well. So broadcast traffic,

23
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.610
one copy gets flooded everywhere throughout that particular part of the network.

24
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.900
The next traffic type we're going to cover is multicast, but I want to just mention about how unicast

25
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.130
traffic works to multiple hosts first because this is going to help you understand why we have

26
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.420
multicast traffic. So, let's see the sender over on the left. It's going to stream out some video traffic,

27
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.070
and let say the bandwidth of the video stream is 1 Megabyte. So it sends it to the PC at the top,

28
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.620
it also sends it to the PC up at the top right, and it's sending separate copies of the same traffic

29
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.090
to each of those individual hosts.

30
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.820
It also sends it to the PC over in the middle on the right as well.

31
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.480
So we're sending a video stream, it's 1 Megabyte in bandwidth. We're sending three separate copies of

32
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.910
it,

33
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.140
so that would take 3 Megabytes worth of bandwidth from the host over on the left,

34
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.920
also throughout that part of the network as well. With multicast,

35
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.500
we send one copy that goes to multiple different destinations. So, you see how this works.

36
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.480
Now, the sender sends one copy of that same video stream, and then that one copy then gets sent out to all

37
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.020
of the interested receivers.

38
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.850
So now, rather than sending three separate copies taking up 3 Megabytes in our example, we send one copy.

39
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.160
It only takes up 1 Megabyte, so we've got good bandwidth savings there, but it goes to everybody that's

40
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.610
interested.

41
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.480
The difference between broadcast and multicast traffic is that broadcast traffic goes to everywhere

42
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.590
on that particular part of the network, whether the receiver has requested it or not. Multicast goes

43
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.020
through multiple receivers, but it's targeted.

44
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.240
They have to request it before they're going to actually get it. A good analogy for multicast traffic

45
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.980
is, you can think of it like tuning into a radio station. So all of the different receivers, they've tuned

46
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.160
in that particular station, they're going to get that particular traffic.

47
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.500
Okay,

48
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.030
that's it.

49
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.500
That's our unicast, our broadcast, and our multicast traffic.
