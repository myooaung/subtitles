00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.730
In this lecture, you'll learn about RF radio frequencies and channels, Wi-Fi services operate in the

2
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.650
two point four gigahertz and five gigahertz frequency spectrum that's allocated for exam industrial,

3
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.090
scientific and medical use.

4
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.780
You'll see more about what that means in a second.

5
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.550
Because of it's a radio operators license is not required and ystem, industrial, scientific and medical

6
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.450
use devices do not have regulatory protection against interference from other users of the band.

7
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.120
So what's she what this means?

8
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.610
So I will open up a chart here.

9
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.560
This is the radio frequency allocations in the U.S. So this is controlled by the government.

10
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.090
And here you can see all of the frequencies that are assigned to the different types of radio communication.

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.190
For example, you can see that for FM broadcasting, for radio, but is eighty eight to one it.

12
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.600
You can also see maritime communications in here, fixed satellite, etc. And right in the middle here

13
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.660
you see industrial, scientific and medical.

14
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.840
So it's the industrial, scientific and medical that is used for the wi fi communications.

15
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.940
But there's loads of other types of communications happening over the airwaves as well.

16
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.010
So taking the FM broadcasting as an example, if you want to set up a radio station in your area where

17
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.640
you can't do that and then just start broadcasting on a particular frequency in this range is regulated

18
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.480
by the government.

19
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.930
So you would have to apply for a licence to do that.

20
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.260
And one of the things that the local authorities will do is will check.

21
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.000
But nobody else is using that frequency, because if you think about if, for example, my local radio

22
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.729
station back home, they broadcast on ninety six point nine, if somebody else started broadcasting

23
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.810
on ninety six point nine, then the signals would interfere with each other.

24
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.410
You would be hearing both stations at the same time.

25
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.760
And of course, if you're hearing Bouvard at the same time, then neither one of them is going to make

26
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.110
sense.

27
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.810
So that's why there is the regulatory compliance in all of these other bonds to make sure that people

28
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.000
are not stepping on each other's toes.

29
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.830
But for wi fi networks, well, everybody's got a Wi-Fi network at home.

30
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.410
It wouldn't be practical for everybody to have to apply to the local authority to use a particular frequency

31
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.190
in their home.

32
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.050
So because of our view, it's unregulated and anybody can use any frequency that they want as long as

33
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.150
it is in these industrial, scientific and medical ranges.

34
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.680
So it's not regulated, which means it's easy to get set up, but it does mean that there's a pretty

35
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.990
high chance that we're going to get interference.

36
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.240
So let's talk about that more as we go through the lecture.

37
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.580
So I'll go back to the slides again before we talk about the radio frequencies more, let's talk about

38
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.810
the standards and how they have evolved over time.

39
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:32.640
So standard for wi fi communications is, I believe it to eleven, but first came out in 1997 and operate

40
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.950
in the two point four gigahertz frequency range and the maximum bandwidth was two megabits per second.

41
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.760
So it was pretty slow.

42
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.240
So not long after that, in nineteen ninety nine to 11 and eight to eleven B both came out eight to

43
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.840
eleven.

44
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.620
B also operates at two point four gigahertz or two to 11.

45
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.000
E is five gigahertz and the maximum bandwidth with eleven B is eleven megabits per second for it or

46
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.110
two to eleven eight.

47
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.390
It was fifty four megabits per second.

48
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.480
So that did give a pretty good speed increase.

49
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:20.370
Then in 2003, eight to 11 G came out but also operates at two point four gigahertz and because it's

50
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.320
operating at two point four gigahertz, this can be backwards, compatible with eight or eleven B,

51
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.700
which is also two point four gigahertz it or two to eleven is five gigahertz to A and G are not compatible

52
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.820
with each other with the backwards compatibility.

53
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:43.760
Maybe you had a wireless device which only supported it or eleven B did not support eleven G.

54
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.830
Well in that case, if you had some devices in your network which did support eight to 11 G, then they

55
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.150
could open it up to fifty four megabits per second.

56
00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.870
The old devices which only support eleven B they could operate up to eleven megabits per second in 2009

57
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.780
it to eleven and came out and it's capable of operating at both two point four and five gigahertz.

58
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.010
Big speed improvement there, up to 600 megabits per second because it supports two point four and five

59
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.490
gigahertz.

60
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.510
It's backwards, compatible with A B on G again.

61
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.120
If you've got older wireless clients, which only supported A, B or C, they would only get the speed

62
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.350
that was supported there.

63
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.470
But if you did have a wireless client with sporty, you don't 11 and up to 600 megabits per second there.

64
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.310
And finally in 2013, eight to 11, she came out.

65
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.760
It's at five gigahertz.

66
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:46.230
It supports up to five hundred megabits per second and is backwards compatible with a and and because

67
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:53.970
five gigahertz is not compatible with the older two point four gigahertz only standards, Sasko access

68
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.030
points support all standards.

69
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.540
If you've got a Screwtape, it's not like you have to pick and choose just one of these.

70
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.440
You can have multiple different options here, all enabled on the app at the same time.

71
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.750
OK, so let's look at the two point four gigahertz spectrum and the two point four gigahertz spectrum,

72
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.890
it's a spectrum, it is a range of frequencies.

73
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.600
It's not just exactly two point four gigahertz.

74
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.430
It actually ranges from two point four to two point four, eight three five gigahertz or two point forty

75
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.180
two point four nine seven in Japan.

76
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:36.800
And that spectrum support frequency range is divided up into smaller twenty two megahertz ranges of

77
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.280
frequencies, which are called channels.

78
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.320
So a channel is just a range of frequencies that can be used for your wi fi.

79
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:54.610
Each oxes point operates in one channel, and as you can see in the diagram here, some channels overlap

80
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.210
and can cause interference with each other.

81
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.580
Just like if we had two radio stations which were playing music at the same frequency, they are going

82
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.520
to be on top of each other.

83
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.150
It's causing interference.

84
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.150
So you can see here that Channel One is shown in blue.

85
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.220
It goes from there, there, and then Channel two goes from here to here.

86
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.910
So there's a lot of overlap between Channel one and Channel two.

87
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.000
Also, Channel three is overlapping there as well.

88
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.240
And you can see it's all the way until we get up to Channel six, where it is not overlapping with Channel

89
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.570
One.

90
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.320
So in the two point four gigahertz spectrum in the US was actually only three channels, which do not

91
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.590
overlap with each other.

92
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.760
Those are one, six and 11.

93
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:46.570
So if you've got neighboring EPWs, you want to use non overlapping channels to make sure that they

94
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.640
don't overlap with each other.

95
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:56.720
OK, looking next at the five gigahertz spectrum, 2.5 gigahertz channels are twenty two megahertz wide,

96
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.900
five gigahertz channels are 20 megahertz.

97
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.230
Right.

98
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.740
And they have less overlap than the two point four gigahertz channels.

99
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.470
So it's not such a problem here.

100
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.330
Neighboring apps should still be separated by at least one channel through to reduce the chance of interference

101
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:20.600
with the five gigahertz spectrum channels can be bonded to with single channel.

102
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.280
It is 20 megahertz, right?

103
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.820
You can bind two together to make it four megahertz wide.

104
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:31.850
You can bond four together to get 80 and you can bind it together to get one hundred and sixty.

105
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.020
And that multiplies the data rates by two, four or eight, depending on whether you're going for 80

106
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.179
or 160.

107
00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.500
So let's have a look at that G.

108
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.680
You can see the five gigahertz spectrum.

109
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.020
Here are all the different channels up here at the top.

110
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.910
So if we we're just using the single channels, we're not bonding at 20 megahertz.

111
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.110
You can see we've got channels.

112
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.680
Thirty six for a 44 and so on.

113
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.190
We could born's channels thirty six and forty together.

114
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.710
That would double it for a megahertz and that's going to give us more bandwidth, more throughput there.

115
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.120
We could double that again.

116
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.200
Eighty megahertz.

117
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.180
That would be channels 36 to 48 or we could go up to one hundred and sixty eight which would be thirty

118
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.520
six all the way up here.

119
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.860
OK, so that was the five gigahertz spectrum.

120
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:27.920
Now having talking in this lecture about the interference I mentioned about how the ESM bond is unlicensed.

121
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.440
So you do not have any guarantee that the frequency belongs to you.

122
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.690
In actual fact, it's unlikely that that is going to be the case.

123
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:42.770
And many devices can cause interference in the two point four gigahertz spectrum, such as microwave

124
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.410
ovens and wireless video cameras, fluorescent lights and baby monitors.

125
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:56.670
Comparing two point four and five gigahertz, two point four gigahertz is greater range, it goes further.

126
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.630
It's also got better propagation, meaning it gets through obstacles better as well.

127
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:08.040
But the two point four gigahertz range is more crowded with more things there, more chance of having

128
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:15.700
interference, five gigahertz, eight or 11 AC has higher throughput than is available with any of the

129
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.790
two point four gigahertz options.

130
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.920
So you might think, well, then for sure, I'm going to be using it to 11 AC.

131
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.020
But your client stations might not be compatible with it yet.

132
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.900
They may only be compatible with two point four gigahertz, which would force USRAP or to upgrade them

133
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.110
because of all the potential for interference.

134
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.700
Site surveys should be carried out for Wi-Fi networks.

135
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.270
The purpose is to find the best placement of access points for maximum coverage, all the required area

136
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.680
and minimum leakage outside it.

137
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.510
You want wireless to be available everywhere you want inside the building.

138
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.820
You don't want it going outside the building because that would be a security concern.

139
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.920
Site survey is also going to discover potential sources of interference as well.

140
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.740
So the way that you do this is you use some software on your laptop, you can walk around the building

141
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.850
and software.

142
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.090
It's going to detect any potential source of interference.

143
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.210
It can also help you with the app placement as well.

144
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:25.170
And a wireless one controller can manage your channel allocation under a power level of the apps to

145
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.390
get the best wireless quality.

146
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:34.380
And let's have a look at an example of using some software on my laptop, which can give me information

147
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.780
about the different wireless frequencies in my area here around about my house.

148
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:46.320
So I have got some free software called Insider Open here.

149
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.970
I've just opened it and you can see it is monitoring the wireless frequencies right around my laptop

150
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.360
here.

151
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.630
And you can see that I've got home Wi-Fi available.

152
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.420
That's my home wireless network here.

153
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.010
And that is supporting it to 11 each.

154
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.530
Such great.

155
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.690
It's standard.

156
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:13.560
And you can see it's available on both two point four gigahertz and five gigahertz and round about.

157
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.000
I mean, nobody else is operating at five gigahertz, so that's great.

158
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.980
I should get really good quality there.

159
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.060
But if I connected my laptop at two point four gigahertz, you can S�vres all these other wireless networks

160
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.980
round about me as well.

161
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.850
And you can see that the channels are all overlapping down here.

162
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.650
So it minimize the interference.

163
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.690
But I'm connected over wireless.

164
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.690
I'm using the five gigahertz range.

165
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.870
OK, but was everything I wanted to show you here.

166
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.310
See it in the next lecture.
