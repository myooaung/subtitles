00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.280
In the last lecture, I showed you how to install Cisco Packet Tracer.

2
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.530
So hopefully, you've got that done already.

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.480
In this lecture, I'll show you how to use the lab exercises that are included in the course.

4
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.710
First thing to tell you is where to actually find the lab exercises.

5
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.860
So as you can see here, I am logged in to the course, and to get the lab exercises, they're included at the end

6
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.730
of all of the technology sections. The first lab exercise is at the end of Section 4.

7
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.590
So if you see there, the Section 4 is the Cisco IOS Operating System.

8
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.330
Now, if I expand down that section, you can see that the last lecture is the IOS Operating System - Lab Exercises.

9
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.190
And if I click on that and scroll down a little bit, here in the main window, you can see I've got a link

10
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.390
there to download a zip file. So, I'll do that now. I'll click on the zip file and download it.

11
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.100
Okay,

12
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.910
while that is downloading,

13
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.160
let me show you where the other lab exercises are.

14
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.520
So the first few sections, a lot of them do not have lab exercises,

15
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.720
and the reason for that is that I cover the foundational information in the first few sections.

16
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.680
I need to do that to lay the groundwork for learning the technologies that are going to be covered later

17
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.580
in the course.

18
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.570
So, those first sections that are covering the foundational knowledge, there's no actual hands on component

19
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.240
to them.

20
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.150
So, there's no lab exercise.

21
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.890
It wouldn't be relevant to have a lab exercise in those sections.

22
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.020
So out of the first few sections, the first section that does have a lab exercise, is Section 4, the one that

23
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.550
I just downloaded.

24
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.770
The next one after that is Section 11, Cisco Device Functions.

25
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.509
So if I look at Section 10, for example, and expand that out, you'll see there's not a lab exercise at the end of that

26
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.010
section, because it wouldn't be relevant there. But from Section 11, if I expand that out, again, you can see

27
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.980
at the end of the section, there's a lab exercise there. You can click on it, and again, in the main window

28
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.100
here, if I scroll down, you see that there is the zip file to download the lab exercis. And every section after

29
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.950
Section 11, you're going to find a lab exercise there. So what to do, as you're going through the course,

30
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.860
just go through the course from start to finish. Watch the videos, and then at the end of each section,

31
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.250
that's got a lab exercise. Do that lab exercise before moving on to the next section.

32
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.820
Okay, so I've got that lab exercise downloaded now. They're really small, so it should only just take a few

33
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.290
seconds to download.

34
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.580
Let me have a look at that, and you'll see that it is a zip file.

35
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.140
So, if I open up this zip file and drag it over to my main window here, you see the first lab exercise.

36
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.650
There's just two files there which is the PKT file which will open in Packet Tracer, and there's

37
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.500
also the lab exercise PDF which is the instructions to do the lab exercise.

38
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.990
So, let's open the project first.

39
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.490
I'll double click on the PKT file, and that's going to open it up in Packet Tracer.

40
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.120
Now, when you open Packet Tracer, if you haven't opened it for a little while it's going to ask you for

41
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.280
your log in details, and you can see it's going to do that for me here.

42
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:43.410
So, I will enter the email address that I used when I installed Packet Tracer, and then on the next page,

43
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.060
it's going to ask me for my password as well, so I'll enter that, and then I can sign in. When I click

44
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.140
on Sign In,

45
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.320
it's going to open up Packet Tracer, and it's going to open up the project.

46
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.150
Now, this first project is just a walkthrough of the basic commands and IOS, so I've just got one router there.

47
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:12.840
And if I go back to the zip file, and if I'm going to open up the lab exercise PDF, inside the lab exercise

48
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.170
PDF, I'll drag that over my main window here as well,

49
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.030
it's going to give you instructions in here, step by step instructions of what to do to do the lab.

50
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.300
Now, the first couple of lab exercises, I tell you the commands to use because the first couple of lab

51
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.600
exercises are guided walkthroughs. In the later lab exercises, you're going to see that I don't tell you

52
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.450
the commands to do because you'll have learned them already in the videos that you watched in that section.

53
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.340
So when you do the lab exercise, it's going to be up to you to remember what the commands are.

54
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.250
I'll show you that in a bit more detail in a second, actually.

55
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.640
Okay,

56
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.890
so I've got the step by step instructions here.

57
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.220
I'm just going to follow the step by step instructions. As I follow them to access the router,

58
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.750
just click on the router that the lab exercise tells you to configure. And then in here, click on the CLI tab, and

59
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.890
that will bring you to the Command Line Interface.

60
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.040
I'll hit enter in here, that gets me into the Command Line.

61
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.570
I could then enter enable to get to the enable prompt and then config t to configure the terminal.

62
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.330
Okay, so that's how you access the lab exercises. Just download the zip file, then open up the Packet Tracer

63
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.740
file, and then follow the instructions in the lab exercise PDF. So, you saw there that the first couple of

64
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.820
lab exercises just have the Packet Tracer file and the lab exercise PDF because they're guided

65
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:53.520
walkthroughs. But if I go back on to the course again and I will download one of the other lab exercises here,

66
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.990
so I'm just choosing one here at random.

67
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.830
This is the Router and Switch Basics.

68
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.420
I will

69
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.750
download the zip file here as well, and then open it

70
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.430
from my Downloads folder. You're going to see here that all the lab exercises after the first two

71
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.280
are going to have more files in the zip file.

72
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.110
What you'll find in there is, starting off at the top, the startup configurations.

73
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.130
So, if you're interested in quickly seeing the configuration that is already been applied to the routers

74
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.920
and switches at the start of the lab, you'll find them in the Router and Switch Basics Configs here.

75
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.290
So there you go, you see, you'll find those as text files.

76
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.740
Then, there is the lab exercise

77
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.900
and the answer key. So in this later

78
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.500
lab exercises, the lab exercise PDF does not tell you the commands to enter. You should have learned

79
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.410
them earlier in the section,

80
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.450
so it's going to be up to you to configure the tasks in that lab exercise.

81
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.480
Now, if you get stuck or if you want to check your work,

82
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.140
I do also have the answer key there as well.

83
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.940
The answer key tells you all the commands,

84
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.260
everything that you should have done to complete that lab exercise successfully.

85
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.630
So when you're doing any of the lab exercises, if you get stuck at all, if you're not sure of anything,

86
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.180
just look in the answer key.

87
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.020
It's going to tell you everything that you should have configured there.

88
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:25.340
There is also the PKT file again to open it up in Packet Tracer,

89
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.470
and there's also a JPG there as well.

90
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.540
I'll just open up that, and that gives you the lab topology diagram.

91
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.400
So, what I recommend you do is you're going to need to open up the file and Packet Tracer to work in the

92
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.000
lab.

93
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.450
Also, open up the lab exercise PDF which is got the instructions of what to configure, and also open up

94
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:51.920
this lab topology diagram so you can quickly and easily see what the actual lab topology is.

95
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.880
Okay, so that is just about everything I have to tell you.

96
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:04.370
One other thing that I wanted to mention is that not all IOS commands are supported in Packet Tracer.

97
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.010
So, I'm going to go back to Packet Tracer here.

98
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.580
I'm going to go on

99
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.310
to my router,

100
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:19.520
and to give you an example, if I do a show run interface f0/0  it's going to tell me invalid

101
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.070
input detected at the marker.

102
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.990
So that is actually a valid IOS command,

103
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.460
it's just that the command is not supported in Packet Tracer.

104
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.169
So if you ever put a command in and you're sure of it that you've entered the correct command at the correct

105
00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.620
command level, but it's giving you that error message,

106
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.070
it's just going to be because it's not supported in Packet Tracer.

107
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.130
Okay,

108
00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:45.380
I think that was everything I needed to tell you here.

109
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:52.730
If you have any issues with Packet Tracer with the installation or with logging in or anything,

110
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:58.580
then check the Frequently Asked Questions document that I'm going to have at the end of this section.

111
00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.030
Thanks.
