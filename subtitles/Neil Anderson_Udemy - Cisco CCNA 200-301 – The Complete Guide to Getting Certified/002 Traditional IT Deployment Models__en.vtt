00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.840
Before you can understand what cloud solutions are, you need to know what we're competing to see in

2
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.920
this lecture.

3
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:26.180
I'll cover the traditional I.T. deployment models of on premise solutions and cool location or commercial

4
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.020
services.

5
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.630
First up on premises, solutions to this is your standard traditional set up where you own your own

6
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.650
building as a company and all of the equipment is hosted in your building and you've paid for all the

7
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.390
equipment and you own it all through with a traditional on premises solution.

8
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.180
All equipment is located in your building.

9
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.500
All equipment is owned by you and by you, I mean the company that are clear lines of demarcation.

10
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.610
Everything in your building is your responsibility.

11
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110
The connections between your offices are your service providers responsibility.

12
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.050
All of your equipment is CapEx with CapEx and OpEx, capex, capital expenditure and not anything that

13
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.540
you pay a one off upfront fee for all pictures, operational expenditure.

14
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.380
And this is anything that you're paying a recutting monthly fee for.

15
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.780
So when you're running on the traditional on premises solution, you buy your equipment upfront.

16
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.040
So that is a CapEx cost.

17
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.380
New equipment will typically take over a week to deploy.

18
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.080
You have to go through the approval process, then you have to order the equipment.

19
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.270
You have to wait for it to arrive on your site from whoever you bought it from.

20
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.030
You then need to get it to the server room.

21
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.590
You need to unbox it.

22
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.240
You need to get it rock up.

23
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.540
You then need to get it cabled.

24
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.660
You need to install the operating system and any patches and you need to install the applications on

25
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.800
there as well.

26
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.590
The networking team need to configure the networking configuration.

27
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.330
The server team need to do the installation and install software on there.

28
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.850
And if you're using external storage, the storage team will need to configure that.

29
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.730
So it's an involved process and typically it's going to take at least a week to deploy a new server

30
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.410
or other equipment like your your switches, firewalls, etc..

31
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.920
Another thing is you need to consider redundancy for any mission critical equipment.

32
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.400
You're not going to want to have any single points of failure.

33
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.430
So you're going to double up on those, which is again, going to add to the complexity and also they

34
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.940
cost.

35
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.220
So that's on premises, didn't need to talk about that so much because it's very intuitive, pretty

36
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.360
obvious what's happening there.

37
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.540
The next one that you might not be so aware of is Kulu or colocation facilities.

38
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.600
This is a data center location where the owner of the facility rents out space to external customers.

39
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.240
The facility owner provides power, cooling and physical security for their customers, server storage

40
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.860
and networking equipment.

41
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.090
As a customer, obviously your staff, your users are not going to be sitting in a data center to do

42
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.630
their work.

43
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.720
They'll still be sitting in your normal office.

44
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.990
The normal office has got network connectivity to the data center and that is where your centralized

45
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.460
servers are located.

46
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.050
Independent commercial providers such as Equinix is probably the best new and one they offer customers

47
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.420
multiple network connectivity options through a choice of network service providers.

48
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.690
So if you were in the U.S., for example, maybe AT&T and Verizon and a few other ones are connected

49
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.200
in there.

50
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.530
And when you put your equipment in the cool new facility, you can take your choice of network providers.

51
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.440
The network service providers will also typically peer with each other and cool facilities about how

52
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.149
Internet connectivity is built.

53
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:25.460
So the characteristics of a cool solution, the cool new provider owns the data center facility and

54
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.730
is responsible for providing highly available power, cooling and physical security according to the

55
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.600
terms of a service level agreement with you, the customer you own, your own server storage and networking

56
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.780
equipment, which is located inside the cool little facility.

57
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.290
So they're providing the building infrastructure.

58
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.540
The actual I.T. equipment is provided and owned by you.

59
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.250
The connections between your offices and Mikula are your network service providers responsibility.

60
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.360
So with this, it shares a lot of the characteristics of an on premises solution, your equipment within

61
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.040
the cool facility is owned by you.

62
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.890
And again, it's paid for as an upfront CapEx cost.

63
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.180
The monthly Coolmore hosting fees are a monthly recurring fee.

64
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.900
So that's an OpEx cost.

65
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.170
New equipment will typically take over a week to deploy because again, it's your own equipment and

66
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.910
you're configuring it all yourself.

67
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.660
You have to order it, do all the configuration, just like with on premises.

68
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.920
It's going to take over a week.

69
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.650
Equipment requires technology refreshes.

70
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:39.540
This was the same with on premises as well, meaning the hardware is going to get out of date and then

71
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.460
you're going to want to replace it with new technology, which again, is going to be another CapEx

72
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.880
cost.

73
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.490
You need to consider redundancy for the hardware that you own, the same as in an on premise solution.

74
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.060
You're not going to want to have any single points of failure.

75
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.780
OK, so that was on premises and Coolmore.

76
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.390
And a cool new facility is not a cloud solution.

77
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.720
You'll see why and you'll see what a cloud solution is as we go through the rest of the section.
