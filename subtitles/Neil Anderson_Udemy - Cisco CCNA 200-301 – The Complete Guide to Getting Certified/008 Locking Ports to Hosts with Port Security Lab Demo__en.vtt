00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.710
In this lecture, you'll learn how to unlock ports down to particular MAC addresses with port-security.

2
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.360
So looking in our topology

3
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.190
here, I've got Switch1 and right now PC1 and PC2 are plugged into ports one and two.

4
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:31.430
I've set the MAC addresses manually for this lab so that we can keep track of things a bit more easily.

5
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:40.750
So PC1 has got MAC 0.1.1. PC2 is 0.2.2 and PC3, the villain is

6
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.740
0.3.3.

7
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.090
So let's say that this is our bank and we want to lock our parts down to particular hosts.

8
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.820
So first up, I'll lock port fa0/1 down to MAC 0.1.1.

9
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.520
So I'll go on to the switch.

10
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.720
And go to global config.

11
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:12.810
And then it's interface fa0/1. I need to set switchport mode access first and then

12
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.620
switchport port-security.

13
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.530
So that's just enabled genetic default, port-security on there.

14
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.910
Next up, I want to lock it down to this particular MAC address.

15
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.930
So the command is switchport port-security mac-address.

16
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.700
And it was

17
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.690
0000.1111.1111.

18
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.840
OK, done.

19
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.600
And I'm also going to manually set it to one MAC address as well. So, switchport port-security. Let's

20
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.850
check the command and it's maximum of one.

21
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.010
That was the default anyway.

22
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:06.510
And if I now do show port-security for the interface fa0/1, I can see that port-security

23
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:14.940
is enabled and it does have a configured MAC address and that the MAC address is not being learned yet.

24
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.710
If I want to check what the Mac address is, I can do a show port-security address and I can see there's

25
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.580
the MAC address there.

26
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.420
That it is locked to interface fa0/1.

27
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.910
So it hasn't seen the MAC address yet because there hasn't been any traffic coming in yet.

28
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.000
So let's go on to PC1 and I'll ping over to PC2. So ping 10.10.10.11 to generate some

29
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.960
traffic.

30
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.550
And if I now do my show port-security interface again,

31
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.630
I can see that yes, there is a MAC address and the traffic went through

32
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.210
okay. So it's all good.

33
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.430
Now let's say the next thing that happens is we have an attacker that's trying to get onto the network

34
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:16.020
and what they do is they disconnect the cable that's connected to PC1 and they hooked that up to their PC

35
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.780
instead.

36
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.260
So that was interface fa0/1.

37
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.310
They connect their PC in, which is a different MAC address, which is 0.3.3

38
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.430
in this example. IP address is already configured on here, 10.10.10.12.

39
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.060
So let's see if port-security is going to work or not.

40
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:48.330
I'll try pinging PC2 from PC3, so I will ping 10.10.10.11 from here and the ping fails,

41
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.520
because port-security locks down the port, because it was not the correct MAC address.

42
00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.860
If I look back on the switch again and do my show port-security interface command, I can see that

43
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.550
I've had a violation and that I didn't actually change the MAC address.

44
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.940
And such MAC address is on PC3, which is violating.

45
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.920
It's not 0.1.1. Because it's violating port-security. It has shutdown the interface. So to fix this,

46
00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.250
I need to walk down there and then,

47
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.360
take that PC off the network. I didn't mean to delete the whole thing.

48
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:45.470
Let's try it, delete just the link so I'll uncable it and then cable fa0/1 back up

49
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.670
to PC1.

50
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.260
PC1 is not back on the network yet.

51
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.450
I need to do a shut and a no shut to take it out of error-disabled.

52
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.900
So I go to config t,

53
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.720
interface fa0/1, shutdown,

54
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.290
no shutdown.

55
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.560
And then I will check the state of the interface.

56
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.120
Now for port-security, I can see that it is back up with the correct address of 0.1.1. And let's

57
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.060
just check connectivity as well.

58
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.760
So from PC1, I'll ping PC2 again. We're all good.

59
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.260
We're back where we started.

60
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.890
So that's how you can manually configure the MAC address and interface to lock it down to that one MAC

61
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.280
address.

62
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.430
Next thing to look at is using a sticky address.

63
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.060
But before I show you how sticky address works, I want to demonstrate how this is different

64
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.170
to not putting a MAC address at all, on the interface.

65
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.540
So let's go onto Switch1.

66
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.870
And I'm just going to enable default port-security on here. So I go to global config, interface fa0/2

67
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.430
and then switchport port-security.

68
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:10.870
And as usual, I forgot to say switchport mode access first. So i'll do that and then try the command again and it will

69
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.820
work. OK.

70
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.710
We now do our show port-security interface fa0/2.

71
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.900
It's going to have the default settings because I didn't configure any of our parameters. And by default,

72
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.500
it only allows one MAC address.

73
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.770
But it doesn't care what that MAC address is because I didn't manually set the MAC address and I haven't

74
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.690
said MAC address sticky.

75
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.620
So you saw in the last couple of lectures

76
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.830
that if I plug a hub or a switch or a wireless access point in here, then there's going to be more

77
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.980
host trying to transmit and it's going to lock the port down.

78
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:53.010
So what this does is it stops unauthorized devices from getting put on your network, but it doesn't

79
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.880
lock it down to a particular host. To demonstrate that,

80
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.350
let's,

81
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:10.030
the way the interface, the link going to PC2 and then hook it up to PC3 instead. So fa0/2

82
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.050
connected to PC3 instead.

83
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.870
And if I now go on to PC3, I'll just open that up.

84
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.190
So I go into PC3 and I will ping,

85
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:31.470
ping 10.10.10.10 which is PC1. The ping succeeds. So it would work from PC2. It would

86
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:38.980
work from PC3. It would work from any PC. The switch doesn't care which host is plugged in as long as it's only one

87
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.180
host at a time.

88
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.180
So let's say that now,

89
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:48.580
I do actually want to lock it down to this particular PC, which is PC2.

90
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.600
So let's move the cable back over again,

91
00:07:53.830 --> 00:08:01.150
without deleting that whole host accidentally. So I'll take my cable from fa0/2 in

92
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.210
the switch. Plug it back into PC2.

93
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:11.080
I've already got port-security configured on the interface, but now I'm going to set MAC address sticky.

94
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.510
So I'll go to global config, interface fa0/2,

95
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:23.980
switchport port-security mac-address sticky

96
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:31.340
And what will happen now is, it will learn the MAC address that is plugged in there. So I could generate some traffic

97
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:31.820
first.

98
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:38.870
So I'm going to PC2 and I will ping over to PC1.

99
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.120
The ping will work just fine.

100
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:51.470
And now if I go back on the switch and I do a show port-security for interface fa0/2,

101
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.320
I would see that I've allowed my one MAC address.

102
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.930
And I can see that it's a sticky MAC address now.

103
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.050
And here is the MAC address that was learned, 0.2.2.

104
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.990
So by using sticky, it saves me having it manually figured out what the MAC addresses and manually

105
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.230
type in all of my interfaces, which would be a heap of work.

106
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.100
It automatically learns it, but it doesn't lock it down to this one port now.

107
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.480
So you saw that PC2 is able to communicate.

108
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:30.650
But if we go back and do the same thing that we did earlier, which was unplug PC2 and then move

109
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.330
the network cable over to PC3.

110
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:43.040
Well, because I set sticky, it's in, it's only 0.3.3 MAC address that is allowed to talk

111
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.780
on this port.

112
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:52.820
So if I go on to PC3 and I try to ping PC1 now. So ping 10.10.10.10. The ping is going

113
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.620
to fail.

114
00:09:53.900 --> 00:10:03.850
And then if I go on to Switch1 and do a show port-security interface fa0/2, I see that

115
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.360
there was a violation.

116
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.430
It's not the sticky MAC address

117
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.300
that was learned.

118
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.790
So the port has been shutdown.

119
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.990
OK, so that's it. That's everything about port-security.

120
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:21.830
You've seen how we can use it to prevent unauthorized devices on the network. Also how we can use it

121
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:29.000
to lock the port down to our particular MAC address, how we can do that by manually adding MAC addresses,

122
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:35.060
how we can do it more conveniently by using sticky and also the difference between using a sticky MAC

123
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.460
address and not configuring a MAC address at all.

124
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.670
So that's everything.

125
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.100
See you in the next section.
