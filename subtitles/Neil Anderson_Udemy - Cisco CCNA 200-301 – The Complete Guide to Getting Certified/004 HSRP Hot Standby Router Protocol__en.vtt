00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:17.280
In this lecture, you'll learn about HSRP, Cisco's Hot Standby Router Protocol. HSRP uses a Virtual IP (VIP)

2
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.410
and MAC address to allow for automated gateway failover.

3
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.790
So you see in the example here, we've got R1 and R2, which are going to be redundant default gateways

4
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:38.440
for our PCs in the 10.10.10.0 subnet. R1 and R1, they both got interface gigabitEthernet0/1

5
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.940
facing the PCs, and HSRP is configured at the interface level.

6
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.290
R1 has got physical IP address 10.10.10.2 and R2 has got physical IP address

7
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.330
10.10.10.3.

8
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.970
We configure a virtual IP address of 10.10.10.1

9
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.100
in the example. The two routers will negotiate for HSRP, one will become active and one will be

10
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.120
the standby.

11
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.460
The active router will be active for the virtual IP address of 10.10.10.1 and the associated virtual

12
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.450
MAC address.

13
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.350
They send keep alives to each other, both routers.

14
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.120
If R2 stops receiving those hellos, it will realize that R1 has gone down, and it will then take over

15
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.500
ownership of the 10.10.10.1 virtual IP address and the MAC address.

16
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.570
So on the PCs, we just configure them to use 10.10.10.1 as their default gateway.

17
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.930
They're completely unaware about HSRP. It's transparent to them. As far as they're concerned,

18
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.320
they just have one gateway at 10.10.10.1.

19
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.080
They don't know that there's redundant gateways there.

20
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.670
They don't know if there's a failover and the failover all happens automatically.

21
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:09.150
Both routers have a normal physical IP address and MAC address on their HSRP interface. Unique addresses

22
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.540
are used for the physical addresses on both routers.

23
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.950
If you wanted to check that, you could do a 'show interface' on the interface,

24
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.600
you'll see the IP address and the MAC address is going to be different on both.

25
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.410
They both also have the HSRP, virtual IP, and MAC address configured on that interface.

26
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.670
The same addresses are used on both routers here.

27
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.780
When they come online, one is elected the HSRP active router, the other is the standby.

28
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.200
So, HSRP does not do load balancing for PCs that are in the same IP subnet.

29
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.410
The active router owns the virtual IP and MAC address and responds to ARP requests coming from the PCs.

30
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.170
So all traffic for the virtual IP address goes through the active router.

31
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.990
The routers send hello messages to each other over their HSRP interface.

32
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.370
So going back to our example, when they're sending those hello messages to each other as keep alives,

33
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.900
when R1 sends it to R2, it uses 10.10.10.2 as the source address, 10.10.10.3

34
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.410
is the destination address, and vice versa for the hello packets coming from R2 to R1.

35
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.110
If the standby router stops receiving those hellos from the active, it realizes that it's gone

36
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.740
down and it will transition to be the new active router, and it will then take ownership of the virtual IP and

37
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:48.220
MAC address, and it will now respond to the ARP requests from the PCs. So looking at the configuration,

38
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.380
it's very simple.

39
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.350
On R1, for example, we say 'interface gigabitEthernet0/1'.

40
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.550
The physical IP address 10.10.10.2

41
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.910
255.255.255.0, 'no shutdown',

42
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.720
so that's just standard interface configuration. For HSRP,

43
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:16.110
we just want to enter one additional command, which is 'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1'. HSRP uses the

44
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.370
standby command.

45
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.150
We do a matching configuration over on R2. It's also an 'interface gigabitEthernet0/1'.

46
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.720
Here,

47
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.570
the IP address is 10.10.10.3,

48
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.060
'no shutdown', and 'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1'.

49
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.080
So a different physical IP address on both routers, the same standby address on both routers.

50
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.740
So, that is the configuration. To verify it,

51
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.440
we do a 'show standby'.

52
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.600
I'll come out of fullscreen mode,

53
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:57.180
so I can highlight some of these entries that you see under the 'show standby' command.

54
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.290
So 'show standby'

55
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.860
will show what the virtual IP address is,

56
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.310
you can see that the state is currently active.

57
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.020
You can also see what the virtual MAC address is here as well.

58
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.180
Remember, if you want to see the actual physical MAC address, as you would do a 'show interface', the physical

59
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.710
MAC and the virtual IP address are going to be different IP addresses.

60
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.350
In here, I can see them on R1.

61
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:30.180
R1 is currently the active router. The standby router is R2 at 10.10.10.3.

62
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.030
Okay, so that's the theory,

63
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:41.250
and the configuration and verification. Let's actually do the configuration in the lab.

64
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.310
It's the same example that I used in the slides there.

65
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.530
So let's jump on to R1 first,

66
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:59.940
and if I just 'show ip interface brief', you'll see that there's no configuration on the gigabitEthernet0/1 port yet,

67
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.970
I've done the rest of the upstream configuration though. So I'll go to global config, and on interface

68
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.130
gigabitEthernet0/1,

69
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:19.060
the physical IP address is 10.10.10.2, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and 'no shut',

70
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.340
so my standard interface configuration. For HSRP,

71
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.090
I say

72
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.930
'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1'.

73
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.570
So that's R1 configured,

74
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:45.070
I need to do a matching configuration on R2. So I'll go to global config and interface gigabitEthernet0/1.

75
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.430
IP address is 10.10.10.3 here,

76
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.460
so the physical IP addresses have to be different,

77
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.640
it's /24 subnet mask again,

78
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.930
'no shut'.

79
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:07.830
And then the same command for HSRP, which was 'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1'.

80
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.240
So, that's all my configuration done.

81
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:23.160
It does take a little while for HSRP to come up. Up to about a minute when you've got the default timers.

82
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.530
So rather than waffling on for a minute, I will pause the video.

83
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.910
Oh, I don't need to pause the video.

84
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.160
It just came up. Okay,

85
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.090
that was convenient.

86
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.210
So let's go back to the enable prompt and do a 'show standby',

87
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:50.520
and I can see that it shows that HSRP Group 1 is active and the active router is local,

88
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.850
so it came up as active on R2.

89
00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:05.550
That's because the higher IP address will be preferred by default and the standby router is R1

90
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.850
at 10.10.10.2. If I go on to one of my PCs,

91
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:21.900
so I have to go on to Packet Tracer for this, and I'll go on to PC1, and go to the Desktop, and open up a command

92
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.890
prompt and I can ping 10.10.10.1,

93
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:36.809
and that is successful. And if I do an 'arp-a' to see the MAC address, the MAC address being

94
00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.580
used for the default gateway ends in ac01.

95
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.880
Let's go back on to R2,

96
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.580
and I can see that that is the HSRP MAC address.

97
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:58.950
If I do a 'show interface gig0/1', you'll see that the physical MAC address is different.

98
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.280
Okay, so that was HSRP,

99
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.810
how to the configuration, how to verify it.

100
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.130
See you in the next lecture where we'll cover some more advanced HSRP topics.
