00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.710
Let's talk about how things are actually done most commonly today then. Back in the early 2000s, a lot

2
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.150
of industry experts predicted that everybody would be using IPv6 within a few years because of the shortage

3
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.300
of IPv4 addresses. But it hasn't actually worked out that way.

4
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:36.150
And in today's networks, most enterprises are actually using RFC 1918 IPv4 addresses with NAT.

5
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.410
So if you go and you work for a company, the chances are you're going to see something very similar to

6
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.890
the previous slide where you're using private IP addresses in all of your inside hosts, and you're

7
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.320
translating them to the public IP address on the outside when they go out to the Internet.

8
00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.550
Reasons for this are RFC 1918 actually has a security benefit of hiding your inside hosts by default

9
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.500
because those private IP addresses are not routable on the Internet.

10
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.190
If you send traffic to a private IP address and it gets out to the Internet, the Internet router is just

11
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.670
going to drop that traffic. Okay, so your private IP addresses, you can route between your hosts on the inside

12
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.540
network, and you can route between your hosts over your own Wide Area Network, but you can not send

13
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.730
traffic to a private IP address on the Internet. Because all the different companies are using those

14
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.930
private IP addresses, the Internet would not know which one to send it to.

15
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.520
Therefore, internal use within the organization only. Another reason that there's been a slower than

16
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.230
expected uptake of IPv6 is that IPv6 address format is completely different.

17
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.050
We've actually got a section that focuses on IPv6 later, and you're going to see that, but it's completely

18
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.850
alien to the IPv4 format. And all of the network engineers that are around today are very, very

19
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.800
comfortable with IPv4. They're used to working with it day in and day out,

20
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.460
but a lot of them are not comfortable with working with IPv6 because their organization isn't using

21
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.000
it yet.

22
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.080
So if you go and speak to one of these engineers and say, "Hey, we need to convert to IPv6." They're probably

23
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.480
not going to be too keen on the idea because it's something completely new for them, but already comfortable

24
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.090
with IPv4, and they can give you the answer,

25
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.890
"Well, we're already using private addresses and NAT. It's not causing any issues. Everything's working

26
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.880
just fine,

27
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.540
so why put all the time, effort, and money into converting IPv6?"

28
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.360
So, that's why it's been slower for everybody on the Internet to move over to IPv6 than was originally

29
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:58.540
expected. But IPv6 is still found in a lot of places, mostly in service provider networks. The majority

30
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.440
of service provider networks will support both IPv4 and IPv6. You'll also see it being used for

31
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.920
mobile services, like on your mobile phone, because there's lots of mobile phones and they're a relatively newer

32
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.820
technology. So IPv6 was already out, there was already a shortage of IPv4 addresses.

33
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:25.000
So for mobile services, they're mostly on IPv6. Where you'll also see it is in larger countries which

34
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.360
had a late adoption of the Internet, such as India and China.

35
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.890
Last thing, spare public IPv4 addresses were exhausted in 2011, so IPv6 is still the future path.

36
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.320
So you see that most companies today are using the RFC 1918 addresses and NAT, but it will slowly move

37
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.390
over to IPv6. Other points,

38
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.810
you still need to understand subnetting. So don't think, "Oh well, if we don't have that IPv4 address

39
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.390
space problem, why did I have to spend all that time in this section learning about subnetting?"

40
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.930
You're still going to do subnetting even when you're using private IP addresses on the inside because you still

41
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.649
need to do your logical addressing, and you also need to be able to understand and troubleshoot IP.

42
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:23.980
So, everything that you have learned in this section is very applicable to the real world and also, of course,

43
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.420
for passing your CCNA exam. Because we have the entire private IP address space to work with,

44
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:40.210
it's common to see today's real world enterprises using /24 subnets for their end hosts, a /30

45
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.890
for a point to point link, and a /32 for the loopbacks.

46
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.020
Remember, we'll talk about loopbacks more later.

47
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.500
They're not complicated anyway, it's just a management address on the router or the switch. Complex VLSM,

48
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.060
remember we did that VLSM lesson earlier, where I give you this scenario, and I said work out

49
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.550
what the subnet mask sizes will be for the different departments in New York and Boston, and say where

50
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.280
the network addresses are going to begin at?

51
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.730
That would be complex VLSM where we've got one subnet, and we're dividing it up into smaller subnets

52
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.180
with different size subnet masks.

53
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.680
And it's quite complicated when you do that too because you have to think, "Okay, well, where does the actual

54
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.580
network portion of the address beginning and end? What's the broadcast address? etc." If you're using

55
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.090
a /24, it's super obvious. You just look at it, and you know that up to the end of the 3rd octet

56
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.270
is the network address, and the 4th octet is the host address.

57
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.000
So it's very simple to use a /24 when we're using private addresses on the inside.

58
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.480
We don't have a problem with the lack of IP addresses. We can use the entire private address space.

59
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.700
It's very common to use a /24 just because it's the easiest thing to do. And easy is good because

60
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.120
it makes less mistakes, and it makes troubleshooting easier. Where you will see VLSM being used is

61
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.450
if an organization is actually using public IP addresses in the inside, which does sometimes still happen,

62
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.240
and they need to maximize the use of their public IP addresses. They don't want to waste any

63
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.550
because they're paying for them, then you might see more complex VLSM being used in that kind

64
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.500
of scenario. Okay, this is the last thing to tell

65
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.770
you here about using contiguous addresses.

66
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.670
So when you are using private addresses in the inside, like you see here. You're still going to want to do

67
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.910
route summarization for the same reasons that we spoke about when we did the CIDR lecture earlier,

68
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.330
which is that you're going to compartmentalize the different parts of your network. From one part of

69
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.360
your network to a different part of your network,

70
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.820
you're only going to send a summary address rather than every single route.

71
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.260
So the example here, we've got Region A on the left, and it's using 10.0.0.0/24,

72
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:07.910
10.0.1.0/24, etc., up to 10.0.255.0/24. Region B within the same organization on the right

73
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:15.230
is using 10.1.0.0/24, 10.1.1.0/24, and so on. We connect the two routers between Region A and

74
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:23.330
Region B. And from Region A, we can advertise 10.0.0.0/16, and from Region B, originate,

75
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.720
we advertise 10.1.0.0/16.

76
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:33.230
So rather than advertising all 256 routes in both directions, we only

77
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.640
advertise one route.

78
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.560
So it takes up less memory on the routers because we've got less routes that are known to the

79
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:47.150
routers, and also, if there's a problem, the impact, there's a little call to that particular region. To be able

80
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:54.080
to do this, you need to be careful with the way that you plan your network addressing, and you need to make

81
00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.830
sure that you allocate them in contiguous blocks like you see here. A mistake would be doing it like

82
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:07.550
you see here. So here, on the left, I've got 10.0.0.0/24, 10.1.0.0/24, then 10.0.2.0/24,

83
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:13.100
and then 10.1.3.0/24, and on the right, I've got 10.1.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24,

84
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.870
etc. So, I'm mixing up my 10.0's and my 10.1's.

85
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:24.230
Because of this, I can't advertise 10.0.0.0/16 from left to right because some of the 10.0's

86
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.710
are already on the right.

87
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:31.520
If you made a mistake with your network address planning like it is being done here, you'd need to advertise

88
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.659
all of the routes everywhere.

89
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.750
That's going to end up taking a lot of more resources in your routers, and it's going to make the network

90
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.480
a lot less stable and harder to troubleshoot.

91
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:49.460
So be careful when you're doing your network addressing design, and carefully plan out at the start, and make

92
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:55.330
sure that you're addressing is done in contiguous blocks so that you can do your summarization.

93
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:55.910
Okay,

94
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:56.850
that's it.

95
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.730
That is us done on the IP addressing and the subnetting.

96
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.250
I just have one more lecture to tell you where you can find additional resources.
