00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.750
In this lecture, you'll learn about S&P, which is this simple network management protocol.

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.370
It's an open standard for network monitoring and you'll see it being used on nearly all vendor's devices,

3
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.200
not just viruses and switches, servers, everything else as well.

4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.600
The terminology for S&P there is an S&P manager, which is the S&P server, and it can collect and organize

5
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.820
information from an S&P agent, which is S&P software, which runs on managed devices such as routers

6
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.720
and switches.

7
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.060
So that's the official terminology.

8
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.560
But real what you won't hear people talking about S&P manager and S&P agent, the manager will be called

9
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.530
an S&P server or an anonymous system is commonly used, which is network management system.

10
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.950
And Dimanche device is just an S&P managed device.

11
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.210
The S&P manager of a server can pull information from the device with a get command or the device can

12
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.760
push it to the server with a trap.

13
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.840
So, for example, the manager could query to get traffic statistics from the device or the device could

14
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.760
report an accident.

15
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.040
And HRP, the change, for example, of one of the errors in an HRP pair went down.

16
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.020
The router could push a notification, push a trap to the Annemasse server about that.

17
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.530
The standard also includes support for modifying agent information from the S&P manager to change device

18
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.250
behavior.

19
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.380
But that's not used to commonly show.

20
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.160
Most often the Annemasse server will pull information from the devices or the devices will send a Tropp

21
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.790
to notify the S&P manager that something happened.

22
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:08.090
There is an MIB is used as the database for the information, the variables on S&P managed systems,

23
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.670
for example, the state of an interface or vista of WCF or RIP, etc. Those variables are organized

24
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.930
into an Milby, the management information base, which is the database of things that you can gather

25
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.810
information about on your different devices.

26
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.400
The S&P manager and agent need to share the MIB so they know which variables can be reported on.

27
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.160
And different types of devices will have different MIBS because the kind of information you would want

28
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.860
to gather from a Windows server would be different type of information you would gather from a router

29
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.610
or a switch.

30
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.420
This diagram shows the architecture.

31
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.340
We've got the S&P manager, which is our Annemasse server, and in the example was a couple of managed

32
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.910
devices and they're both running the S&P agent software.

33
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.900
So we've got a switch on the router.

34
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.190
They've got Milby, which includes variables that are relevant to that type of device.

35
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.520
The S&P manager understands which might be Israel and the S&P manager can send queries to the devices

36
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.200
to gather information from them.

37
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.500
The devices can also send Tropp notifications to notify the S&P manager that something happened.

38
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.840
OK, so you've got that third option where the S&P manager can actually push and change information

39
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.060
on the devices not used as commonly.

40
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.740
With the SNP versions, there's been three major versions, the first version was SNP version one that

41
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.750
uses plain text authentication between the manager and the agent.

42
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.570
So the authentication is not encrypted and nobody can read it if they're sniffing that traffic.

43
00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.640
The method is used for the authentication is community strings, which act like a password SNP version.

44
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.060
She also uses plain text community strings for the authentication.

45
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.780
The main advantage of Version Tucci over version one is it supports bulk retrieval.

46
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.910
So rather than having to send a new message for every piece of information it wants to get, it can

47
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.320
send a request for multiple pieces of information at the same time makes it more efficient.

48
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.740
And the latest version is SNP version three.

49
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.510
It does support strong authentication and encryption with the use of usernames and passwords.

50
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.140
It is the preferred version because it is secure, but it's not supported on all devices.

51
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.850
You'll find a lot of devices still out there today.

52
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.270
Don't have support for SNP version three yet, so not case you would have to use SNP version to see

53
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.340
if you did want to enable SNP.

54
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:59.310
So talking about the authentication and version one and version two, it uses community strings rather

55
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.460
than the normal username and password that you're used to.

56
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.490
So the community string is used to authenticate the S&P manager and the agent to each other.

57
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.260
It acts just like a password.

58
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.050
And the same community string value has to be set on both the agent and their manager.

59
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.040
That's how they authenticate to each other.

60
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.340
There is of read-only and read right community string's.

61
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.130
The read only community is used by the manager to read information and the read rate community is used

62
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.900
if it wants to set information.

63
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:40.660
So here's a configuration example, and for the Shishani exam, this is the same with the log as well,

64
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.110
you don't need to know how to set up the social observer or the S&P server because lots and lots of

65
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.390
different vendors are all for software products.

66
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.030
That's all obviously out of school for the exam.

67
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.420
The exam is testing you and how to configure Vista School and switches, nor any external software.

68
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.730
So this is how we would configure the configuration on a regular for S&P.

69
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.390
The two.

70
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:13.180
First up, we see a global config S&P server contact Neil at box dot com, my email address, then S&P

71
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.550
server location, black box VoIP.

72
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.370
So that's just purely informational when it's optional, if you want to set up, but you're an P server

73
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.430
is going to be monitoring lots of different devices.

74
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.400
So it's good if you've got some descriptive information about the device that will be sent to the manager.

75
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.670
Next part of the config is our community strengths, which are used for via authentication.

76
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.390
And we're configuring Boulevard Read-Only and a rewrite community saying we've got S&P server community

77
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.760
flat box one, which is we're using as our read-only string and S&P server community flat box to which

78
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.620
we're going to use this very right string.

79
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.420
Then we need to configure where our S&P server is.

80
00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.700
So we say S&P server host TANDOOR Order 100 is where the server is.

81
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:08.440
And for communicating with the server when we're sending TROMPS, we're going to use our read-only community

82
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.630
string, which was blackbox one.

83
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.870
Then we put in a command to actually send troops to that server.

84
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.860
This is optional.

85
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.130
If we did not have the S&P server enabled, Chop's config command to server would still be able to query

86
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.350
this router to pull information from it.

87
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.350
But because we're configuring Trappes, we're also going to push information to the server as well.

88
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:38.110
UESHIBA When we do the lab, Damul differs in lots of different types of Tropp so you can sense you

89
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.500
can send information about a change in the WPEC, a change in the state of an interface, etc..

90
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:50.070
Here we're doing Trappes config, which means whenever anybody else goes to global configuration by

91
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.760
entering the conflict command, it's going to send a notification about that to the server.

92
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:56.690
OK.

93
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:04.320
The last thing I tell you here is some S&P, CICU to a best practice we said before the S&P is an open

94
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.130
standard supported by nearly all vanders devices.

95
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:15.240
Most devices will use a default read-only community, string of public and a default rewrite community

96
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:22.500
string of private and attackers can use this to read or set information on your devices.

97
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:29.850
If an attacker has got IP connectivity to the device and it's being set up with S&P and Nable using

98
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:35.610
the default community strings of public and private, then the attacker can use that to pull information

99
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.600
about the device.

100
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.090
There's likely to be sensitive information, but they can then use to launch an attack against your

101
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:42.690
devices.

102
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.960
So you do not want to leave that as the default.

103
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.420
Saying best practice is to disable S&P on devices if it's not being used.

104
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:58.920
And if you do want to use S&P, use S&P version three with secure passwords, because that is a secure

105
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.000
way of implementing it.

106
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.580
However, quite likely you will have devices that do not support version three.

107
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:11.730
So not kiis use S&P version to see but use non default communities.

108
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.100
Things don't use public and private.

109
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.350
OK, that was it for S&P.

110
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.930
See you in the next lecture.
