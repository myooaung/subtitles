00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:16.160
In this lecture, you'll learn about SS age, Shakya shall there's a problem with tallness in that all

2
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.620
traffic between your workstation under our door switch goes in plaintext text.

3
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.010
So if anybody's sniffing about traffic, you'll see all of the commands that you're sending to the device

4
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.570
and worse will be able to see what your username and password is.

5
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.290
So they'll be able to log in as you later on.

6
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.410
So we don't want to do that.

7
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090
We don't want to use telnet.

8
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.910
We want to use MSH instead.

9
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.210
S.H. works just like Telnet.

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.160
It gives you command line access to the switch.

11
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.330
But unlike telling it all with atrophic is encrypted.

12
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.950
So even if somebody is sniffing your traffic, they're not going to be able to read it.

13
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.560
They won't be able to read what commands you're sending or be able to see your username and password.

14
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.270
So best practice is to enable SFH and disable telnet.

15
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.990
To enable assess each, it needs a way to encrypt the traffic, so it uses a digital certificate for

16
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.760
this and one of the attributes are not digital certificate is a domain name.

17
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.770
So you need to set the domain name first.

18
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.650
The command provider is IP domain name.

19
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.070
And in the example here, I'm using black box dot com.

20
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.520
You can use your organization's domain name if you want.

21
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.470
It doesn't really matter.

22
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.840
You can use anything to be configured with the main name.

23
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.690
Then we need to generate the certificate.

24
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.740
The command for what is crypto key generate RSA.

25
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.910
Oddisee stands for Reversed Shamir and Adelman Bosavi guys that invented this.

26
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.020
So you do that.

27
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.000
The record will then ask you how many bits you want to use for a certificate.

28
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.240
The lowest value you can use underwriter's 512.

29
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.080
But for SS age, the lowest value that is allowed is seven, six, eight.

30
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.650
So you use 760 or higher for your associate certificate.

31
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.370
So that is our certificate generated.

32
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.190
Now we just need to make sure the SS H is enabled on the V lines was VTI.

33
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.710
Virtual terminal lines are used to control both incoming telnet and AC access as well.

34
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.980
And can best practices enable access each but disable tallness by default?

35
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.510
Bov are enabled.

36
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.720
So with SFH you cannot use a line level password for telnet.

37
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.250
You can either use a line level password or you can use individual usernames.

38
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.820
But for SSA it has to be individual usernames.

39
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.840
So our config here I've configured username blackbox with a password, a flat box one I should have

40
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.450
used secret Dobrev and password there.

41
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.700
It's Viniar where it's more secure.

42
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.870
But if I've enabled service password encryption, it will still be encrypted in the short running IP

43
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.290
anyway.

44
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.260
OK, so I've got my user there then I need to configure my lines.

45
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.630
So I've got Langkawi 015 and then transport in Peut S.H..

46
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.090
The default is transport input all which allows both telnet and associates.

47
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.630
We want to only allow SFH so we just chance transport input associates.

48
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.840
You don't mention telnet there then login Woolco to use your local usernames and I exit back out to

49
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.490
global config and I say IPSC.

50
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.650
Each version to that is optional.

51
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.890
That that means it will only accept association version two incoming, which is the latest version.

52
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.470
It's a bit more secure than the older versions.

53
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.220
OK, so that's how we can figure out when to actually use it.

54
00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:03.080
If we're at a Linux client, we can see S.H. Dosch URL for the username and our user name was Flat Box

55
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.190
and we're SFH to the device at Tand or dot org ten.

56
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.770
It will then prompt this for a password.

57
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.300
Won't ask us for the user name because we already included that in the SS H Command.

58
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.890
So when X has got support for associates by default, Windows does not show on windows.

59
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.990
Typically we will use Potti even if you're used to always using potty in real world, you still need

60
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.630
to know of command associates.

61
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.900
Dujayl username on then the IP address because this is what you can get tested on in the Shishani exam.

62
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.900
OK, so that was how we can figure.

63
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.100
S.H. see you in the next lecture where I'll show you doing it in the.
