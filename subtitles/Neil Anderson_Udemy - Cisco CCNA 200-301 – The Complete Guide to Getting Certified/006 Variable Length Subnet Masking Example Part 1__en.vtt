00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.940
In this lecture, we're going to carry on with our subnetting theme, and by the end of the lecture,

2
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:23.040
you will be able to carry out a Variable Length Subnet Mask design for a real world network topology.

3
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.460
Now, it's only a small network in the example that we're going to work through, but you can apply

4
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.250
the same things that you're going to learn here to larger networks in the real world.

5
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.200
The slide that you see here is the same slide that you saw at the end of the last lecture, where we

6
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.590
explained that back in the day, with early routing protocols, whenever you did subnetting, each of the subnets had to

7
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.280
be exactly the same size.

8
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.550
So if you had one subnet that was a /28, for example, they all had to be a /28.

9
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:06.080
You couldn't mix and match /27, /28, /29 within the same larger network, but that ended up wasting

10
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.320
a lot of addresses.

11
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.000
So with later routing protocols, they did have support for Variable Length Subnet Masks, and now we can

12
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.650
mix and match the size of our subnets within that greater network,

13
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.080
and we're going to work through an example here.

14
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.880
The things that we need to consider when we're going to do the design are how many different locations

15
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.340
do we have in the network that are going to need subnets and how many hosts are going to be in each

16
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.320
of those subnets?

17
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.700
What are the IP addressing requirements for each of the different locations?

18
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.260
So should different departments or types of hosts to be in different subnets?

19
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.410
For example, you might have one office, but within that office, maybe you've got a sales department,

20
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.740
a research and development department, and an accounting department, and you want the accounting department

21
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.020
to be secured from different departments. Well, in that case, you would definitely put it in its own separate

22
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.240
subnet. Because with different subnets, we have to route between them at a router. It's easy to secure them at

23
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.020
the Layer 3 level based on their IP address.

24
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.810
And the last question here, what size is appropriate for each subnet?

25
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.260
We don't want to waste addresses, but we want to leave some room for growth.

26
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.230
So, we need to have a bit of a balance there.

27
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.100
Don't make it too big

28
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.450
that we're wasting addresses, but don't make it too small that we're going to run out of addresses and

29
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.670
that going to have to do a redesign later. That would just be giving ourselves a big headache.

30
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.030
So, for our example, this is our network topology diagram.

31
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.950
We've got an organization, they've got an office in New York and a branch office in Boston.

32
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.570
New York is their headquarters, and they've got 28 hosts in the engineering department and 14 hosts in

33
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.400
sales. In Boston,

34
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.200
they've also got engineering and sales.

35
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.380
They've got 28 in engineering, the same as in New York,

36
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.180
and they've only got 7 hosts in the sales department.

37
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.340
So those are the different parts of the network that we need to apply IP addresses to,

38
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.250
and we've been allocated the Class C network of 200.15.10.0/24 from our Internet

39
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.210
Service Provider.

40
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.760
Another thing that we need to do is don't forget about our point to point links between the routers.

41
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.190
They need to have connectivity between each other, so they're going to need IP addresses too. It's a point

42
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.970
to point link,

43
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.000
so we've just got 2 host IP addresses there. The outside interface on the New York router is connected

44
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.470
to the outside interface on the Boston router.

45
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.920
So, that was our requirements.

46
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.840
Now, we need to think about how are we actually going to design this and the steps that you work through.

47
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.330
First off, find the largest segment and allocate a suitable subnet size for it.

48
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.100
You then create that subnet at the start of your available address space, and then that's it.

49
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.380
You just keep working your way down.

50
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.250
So you start off with the largest subnet.

51
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.560
You then move to the next one, the next one, and the next one until you've allocated addresses for all

52
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.940
of your different subnets.

53
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.880
Now, in a real world deployment, you want to have a scalable design.

54
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.560
So, you want to have room for growth in your networking design.

55
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.960
Let's say that I've got a subnet that has got 14 hosts on there.

56
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.120
You know that one of our subnet sizes is exactly for 14 hosts.

57
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.670
Don't give a subnet that size because maybe in a few weeks' time, a couple of extra people are going to

58
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.900
join the department.

59
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.200
Now, how are you going to fix that problem? So make the subnet size big enough that it's going to be

60
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.220
able to grow.

61
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.440
Another thing is because we're going to sequentially go from largest down to smallest,

62
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.860
maybe we're going to have a subnet with 30 hosts there, and then another subnet with 30 hosts, and then

63
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.720
a subnet with 14 hosts.

64
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.680
Well, leave a spare subnet with 30 hosts in it.

65
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.200
So don't just do 2 subnets of 30. Do 3 or 4 subnets of 30 because then if you do have

66
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.450
a new department that requires up to 30 hosts later, you've got a spare subnet there waiting for it,

67
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.390
and everything is still sequential and contiguous, logical, going from largest down to smallest.

68
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.950
So, hopefully, you got the point there.

69
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:36.720
Don't design for what is right, right now. Design for what is going to be the best fit in

70
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.870
the future. Leave some scalability there. Leave some room for growth.

71
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.180
So, that's what you do in the real world.

72
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.460
Don't do that in the CCNA exam.

73
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.750
Do not think about, "Oh, this is what I would do in the real world.

74
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.950
This would be best practice."

75
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.420
Do exactly what the exam question tells you to do, even if you think that would be a stupid thing to

76
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.660
do.

77
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.310
Okay, don't overthink things.

78
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.090
Don't think,

79
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.950
"Oh, well, it would be better to do it this way."

80
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.720
Do exactly,

81
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.460
black and white, what the question asks you to do, and then you're going to get the question right.

82
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:18.320
Okay, so for our example, we had the engineering departments in New York and Boston, and they have

83
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.060
got 28 hosts each, and that was the largest subnets we required. For our example,

84
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:31.760
let's say the exam question says that the departments will not grow, and we need to use the smallest subnets possible

85
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.670
to maximize our available address space.

86
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.050
Okay, so do not leave any room for future growth here because the question said, make it optimal, maximize

87
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.170
the use of the address space.

88
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.140
Okay, so that's the question. What I want you to do now is pause the video

89
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:56.030
here and calculate the optimal subnet mask for the engineering departments. So no bigger than is

90
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.380
necessary, but make sure it's at least big enough to support 28 hosts.

91
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.120
Once you've done that, you'll be able to determine the network and broadcast addresses.

92
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.180
Do that for both engineering departments, both New York and Boston, and figure out what the range

93
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.440
of host addresses will be.

94
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.540
Okay, so go on ahead and do that.

95
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.110
Please pause the video now.

96
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.550
When you come back in a second, I'll walk you through how to get the answer.

97
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:28.460
Okay, so let's look at how to get the answer. So, we'd been allocated 200.15.10.0/24.

98
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.570
We've been allocated a Class C, and we've got 2 different departments that we want 2 different

99
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:42.090
subnets for, and they had got 28 hosts each. A /27 supports

100
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.220
30 hosts. A /28

101
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.260
is 14,

102
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.190
so it's not big enough.

103
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.320
We can't use that.

104
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:54.060
The smallest that we can use, which is what we were asked to do, is a /27. Real world,

105
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.690
you might argue that you'd prefer to use a /26.

106
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.230
This is not the real world,

107
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.890
it's an exam question. We're going to use the smallest possible, which is a /27.

108
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:08.730
We wrote that in dotted decimal notation, it's 255.255.255.224.

109
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.000
Okay, so that was the first part of the question, figure out the subnet mask.

110
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.130
The next thing we have to do is actually divide up our address space.

111
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.140
The headquarters was in New York, so let's give them the first subnet.

112
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.900
So the network address is going to be 200.15.10.0/27,

113
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.890
and if we look at the line, we can see it's after 32,

114
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.600
so a /27 is going to go up in increments of 32.

115
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.740
So the next network address is going to be 200.15.10.32, which means that

116
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.540
the first subnet's broadcast address is going to be 1 less than that. It's going to be 200.15.10.31,

117
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:55.070
and that leaves addresses available for our hosts of 200.15.10.1

118
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.820
up to 200.15.10.30.

119
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.860
That's the engineering subnet.

120
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:05.340
Next is the Boston engineering subnet. Well, the last broadcast address used is 200.15.10.31,

121
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.160
so the network address we are going to be using is 200.15.10.32.

122
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:14.340
So network address, 200.15.10.32/27. Again, we're still using

123
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.640
that /27 where the line is after the 32.

124
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.770
So the next network address would be 200.15.10.64,

125
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.980
so our broadcast address must be 200.15.10.63, which is 1 less, and

126
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.190
our hosts are going to be what's between the network and broadcast address,

127
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:37.500
that's 200.15.10.33 up to 200.15.10.62.

128
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.330
Okay, so that was the engineering department taken care of.

129
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.350
Alright,

130
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.750
that's coming up to the 10-minute mark in this lecture.

131
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.670
So if you want to take a break, now is a good time to go and stretch your legs. When I see you

132
00:09:53.670 --> 00:10:00.420
back here for part 2, we'll go through the subnetting for the rest of the departments.
