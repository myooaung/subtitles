00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.060
In this lecture, you'll learn about client to site remote access VPN with the school, any connect

2
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:23.130
client to Cisco, any connect client is a remote access VPN application which uses the AC firewall.

3
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.810
You saw in the last lecture when we configured the site to say VPN, the site to say VPN tunnel can

4
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.690
terminate either on a firewall or a router.

5
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.610
The firewall would be the Cisco EMC with the attorney client that's going to terminate on the firewall,

6
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.600
not on a Cisco and where the site to site Tunnell's.

7
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.700
We're using IP sac the any connect remote access VPN users.

8
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.970
When you go figure you're going to see the option it has.

9
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.910
There is SSL because Clash and SSL are still somewhat used interchangeably.

10
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.720
SSL is they're actually deprecated is being replaced with Helus, but where else is used?

11
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.200
You'll often see that it's actually still described as SSL.

12
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.560
For example, if you buy a certificate for use on Internet, you'll see that it is being called an SSL

13
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.700
certificate, even though it is actually Tlisova is being used.

14
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.620
So just be aware, if you do see SSL being mentioned anywhere, that's fine.

15
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.930
You are actually going to be using Talash because TLC is the update for SSL.

16
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.360
And you can see here a screenshot of using the client, so with the example topology, we've got our

17
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.180
main site over here on the right.

18
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.710
And because any connect, it is a remote access VPN.

19
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.570
It's a client.

20
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.760
The site VPN, you can have this installed on your laptop.

21
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.720
So if you go traveling anywhere, if you're in a hotel or if you're working from home, you can fire

22
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.680
up the any connect client on your laptop, as you can see here.

23
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.100
And from there you can connect into the corporate site.

24
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.720
When you do that, the VPN tunnel is going to terminate on the firewall.

25
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.140
So this traffic is going to be encrypted all the way from your laptop over to the firewall.

26
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.050
So if you are working in a hotel or somewhere like that, that's fine, because it's not just from the

27
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.440
hotel, it's actually from your laptop.

28
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.340
The traffic is going to be encrypted because obviously the network infrastructure and hotel, you're

29
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.200
not going to be trusting that either.

30
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.070
OK, so that's why any connect VPN client.

31
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.630
Now, there's a couple of different ways that this can be enabled, and this is going to be chosen by

32
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.750
the network security administrator.

33
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.670
You can either use tunneling or fuel tunneling.

34
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.040
When you use split tunneling, the corporate traffic is going to go over the VPN tunnel to the corporate

35
00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.490
site.

36
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.580
Your public Web traffic, for example, when you're browsing normal sites on the Internet, that is

37
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.350
going to go out directly to the Internet but is not going to go through the tunnel.

38
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.900
So as you can see here, when we do have switched tunneling enabled for traffic, that is going to the

39
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.080
corporate website that is going to go through the VPN tunnel and that is going to be encrypted.

40
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.050
But when we're browsing through a normal Internet Web server that is going to go directly, it's not

41
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.420
going through the VPN tunnel.

42
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.800
The other way that we can do it is with full tunnel that we're full tunneling or corporate traffic.

43
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.990
And your normal Internet browsing from your client are going to go through the VPN tunnel.

44
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.960
So you can see the difference here now is traffic that's going the corporate office is going through

45
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.840
the VPN tunnel, traffic going to a public web server.

46
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.220
Our own Internet bot also goes through the tunnel as well.

47
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.530
And then it gets here, pinned back there out to the Internet.

48
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.470
So the reason why you would use one or the other if you implement full tunneling, but force is all

49
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.460
traffic to go through the VPN tunnel and go through the main site.

50
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.829
So that allows you to enforce security policies on your staff members.

51
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.360
Whenever traveling with their laptops, for example, you could specify the types of websites they're

52
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.620
allowed to go through.

53
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.430
So because everything is going through your centralized main site here, you can enforce security policies

54
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.600
at that point.

55
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:43.050
The downside of using full tunneling is that maybe the user is in Chicago, your head office is in New

56
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.540
York and you're browsing a website which is also in Chicago.

57
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.710
Well, if the were using tunneling, that would just go straight from Chicago to Chicago.

58
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.700
It wouldn't have to go all the way through the tunnel to the head office and back again.

59
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.440
So you would get better performance.

60
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.410
So you can get better performance if you're using split tunneling, but you can get better, more centralized

61
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.750
security if you use fuel tunneling.

62
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.540
OK, but everything as far as this exam is concerned for our remote access VPN to you in the next lecture.
