00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:15.120
In this lecture, you'll learn about the first of the access layer switch security mechanisms, which is DHCP

2
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:26.340
snooping. And you remember from the DHCP section that we covered before, that on our Cisco router, if

3
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.300
our clients are not on the same subnet as with DHCP server, we'll need to configure the IP helper address.

4
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.890
So that's what we've done in the example here in the diagram.

5
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.900
PC1 and PC2

6
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.470
are in the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet and their DHCP server is on the other side of the router at

7
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.080
10.10.20.10/24.

8
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.850
I've configured a scope on my DHCP server for the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet giving IP addresses starting

9
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.260
at 10.10.10.10/24, going up to 10.10.10.254/24 for a subnet mask of /24, default gateway 10.10.10.1/24.

10
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And a DNS server is also on the DHCP server, which is 10.10.20.1/24.

11
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.870
When the PCs send out a DHCP request, that goes as broadcast traffic so it will not be forwarded by the router

12
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.680
by default.

13
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.350
So on the router, I need to configure the IP helper address command on the interface, whose requests

14
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.570
come in on and that forwards the requests to the DHCP server.

15
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.790
So we covered all that configuration before, but we can have a problem in our network, which is a

16
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.890
rogue DHCP server. So you see

17
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:51.600
in our example here, that a DHCP server has been connected on the same side of the router as the PCs. Actually, it

18
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.330
doesn't matter where it was connected. It would still give us the same problem. And this server has

19
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.480
been configured to give out DHCP addresses.

20
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.500
It's also giving addresses in the range 10.10.10.0 with a subnet mask of /24.

21
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.860
But the default gateway is configured 10.10.10.254 and the DNS server is

22
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.400
10.10.10.254 as well.

23
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.440
So when the PCs send out a DHCP request, it will get the offer from this DHCP server here, which

24
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.580
has an invalid default gateway and DNS server address.

25
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.560
So the PCs won't actually have any connectivity to the network.

26
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.350
And in the example here, it's going to be quite hard to detect that because we're actually getting

27
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.450
an IP address in the correct subnet.

28
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.780
It's not going to be immediately obvious what the problem was.

29
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.850
So if you do get a rogue DHCP server, that can be, what it can do is drop your PCs off of the network.

30
00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.920
Now, more often than not, this is not actually going to be a malicious attacker who's doing this deliberately.

31
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.870
More likely at some end user who takes something maybe from home like a home router and plugs it in the network

32
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.660
and it's got a DHCP service running on there.

33
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.990
Or it could also be maybe one of your IT staff.

34
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.490
And they are running a lab, which has got a DHCP server in it, and accidentally they connect it to the real network.

35
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.860
So more likely it will be an accident,

36
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.720
but the impact is the same.

37
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.910
It's going to be devastating for those clients.

38
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.980
It's going to drop them off of the network.

39
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:41.340
So there is mitigation that we can take that will prevent rogue DHCP servers from being able to be active

40
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.240
on your network.

41
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.140
And this solution is DHCP snooping. With DHCP snooping,

42
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.030
you enable this on your access

43
00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:00.060
layer switches and you configure the ports that you're DHCP server is connected to as a trusted port.

44
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.720
So you see in the example here, if we can figure this out on Switch2, it would be interface fa0/2

45
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.970
that is directly connected to the DHCP server that would be configured as a trusted port.

46
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.050
From Switch1's point of view down at the bottom, the DHCP Offers are going to come in on interface

47
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.370
fa0/1,

48
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.980
so that also needs to be configured as a trusted port. So trusted ports are ports directly connected to the

49
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.230
DHCP server and also on your inter-switch links leading down to the PCs.

50
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.520
When any DHCP server traffic comes in on a trusted port, the switch will allow that traffic to go

51
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.880
through.

52
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.620
But if DHCP server traffic comes in a port that is not trusted, then the switch will drop it.

53
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.490
So here, we're trusting all the way through to our valid DHCP server.

54
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.590
If somebody plugs in a rogue DHCP server on any other port, then the DHCP offers that it gives are going

55
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.260
to be dropped by the switch. They are not going to get to the client.

56
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.960
So they're not going to get that invalid information.

57
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.920
The

58
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.640
configuration for this, we've done this on Switch1 globally, you say ip dhcp snooping.

59
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.250
You also need to enable it at your access VLAN level as well.

60
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.950
So we also say ip dhcp snooping vlan 10 for example, and then configure your trusted ports. So that's interface fa0/1

61
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.410
on Switch1. ip dhcp snooping trust

62
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.070
OK, so that is why we have DHCP snooping,

63
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.720
what it is, and also a quick look at the configuration as well.
