00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:14.980
In this lecture, you'll learn how to upgrade the IOS system image on your Cisco router or switch.

2
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.940
First thing that you need to do is get the new software image, so you get that from the Cisco Website

3
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.710
at https://software.cisco.com.

4
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.670
Let's have a look there. So, you'll land on this page.

5
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.730
Click on the link for software download, and then that will open up a new tab, and it's searchable in here.

6
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.890
So in the search box, put in whatever it is that you want to upgrade.

7
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.170
So, let's say we want to upgrade a 2960 switch.

8
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.310
I put that in, I then select my model of switch.

9
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:59.720
I can then select the IOS image that I want to download from there. So download it from the Cisco website,

10
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.920
and then copy it onto your TFTP server.

11
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.770
Then from the TFTP server, you're going to download it to Flash on the device.

12
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.940
Once you've got it on Flash, then either delete the old image, leaving just the new one there and the device

13
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.760
will now boot up from the new image, or if you want to keep both images on there just in case you need

14
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.380
to fall back to the old one, then to make sure that it uses the new image,

15
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.830
use the 'boot system' command. So, let's have a look at doing this in the lab.

16
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.570
Same lab as last time,

17
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.410
I've got a switch this time. We're going to use this switch at 10.10.10.2, and we're going to download

18
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:56.020
a new software image from the TFTP server at 10.10.10.10. So, let's go onto the switch

19
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.370
and check what software image it's running right now.

20
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.690
If I do a 'show flash', you'll see there's only one system image in there, which is running

21
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:17.630
c2960-lanbase-mz.122-25.FX.bin, and if I do a 'show version', not surprisingly because

22
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.930
that's the only system image in Flash that is confirmed as the software image that we are running. So we're going

23
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:36.280
to upgrade this to a newer version of IOS. So let's have a look at the TFTP server now, and I can

24
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:45.070
see I've got version 15.0 for the 2960. So this is the image that I'm going to use.

25
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.130
I need to download that to my switch. I'll go back to the switch again, and the command I want to use

26
00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:01.630
at the enable prompt is 'copy tftp flash'. The TFTP server is at 10.10.10.10. 

27
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.080
The file name, I've already copy this into my clipboard hopefully, so I'll try pasting it. Yep, there is it.

28
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.920
That was a 15.0 image. I want to keep it the same name when I copy it to Flash. So there it is, copied into

29
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:26.050
Flash now. I'll verify it's there with a 'show flash', and now I can see both the current and the new system image.

30
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.770
What I could do now is I could delete the old one, and that will guarantee it will boot up with

31
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.840
the new one next time, but let's say I want to keep the old one there just in case I need to fall

32
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.390
back to it. I'm going to keep it there to make it easier to do that in case I need to, so I need to

33
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:54.220
do the 'boot system' command now. So I will copy the name of the new system image, and then at global config,

34
00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:05.620
I will enter the command 'boot system', and it's on 'flash:' and then the file name, paste that in,

35
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:16.810
'end', and 'copy run start'. And I should be good to go now. Now when the system boots up, it loads the system

36
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:26.740
image into RAM memory, so I need to 'reload' into the new system image. I will do that now.

37
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.270
I will do a 'reload', and you can see the message there that yes, it is loading the new system image.

38
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.660
That looks all good but let's just wait for it to boot up so that we can confirm. Okay,

39
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.810
there we go.

40
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.260
I'll go to the enable prompt, 'show flash',

41
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.440
you'll see that both images are still there.

42
00:04:49.570 --> 00:05:00.020
And if I do a 'show version', I am now running version 15.0.

43
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.520
Okay,

44
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.600
so that's all that it's to it.

45
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.750
That's how you do an upgrade of IOS on your router or switch.
