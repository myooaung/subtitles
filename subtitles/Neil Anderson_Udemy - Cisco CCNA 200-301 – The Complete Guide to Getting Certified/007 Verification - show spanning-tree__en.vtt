00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:15.710
In this lecture, you'll learn how to verify the Spanning Tree Protocol. I'm using the same network

2
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.060
topology that I've been using throughout the rest of the section.

3
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.920
So we've got the Layer 3 part of the network up at the top with our routers, R1 and R2, and going

4
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.790
northbound,

5
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.530
and then we've got the Layer 2 part of the network with our Core Distribution switches,

6
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:38.960
CD1 and CD2, and our Access Layer switches, Acc3 and Acc4. There's obviously Layer 3 

7
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.190
connections going from the PCs up to the routers as their default gateways as well.

8
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:53.210
So what we want to do here is to map out how the Spanning Tree has been configured.

9
00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.530
In this example, the switches have been configured with VLANs but Spanning Tree has not been

10
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.850
configured at all,

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.370
so they're all going to be using the default priority.

12
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.330
So what we want to do here is to determine which is the Root Bridge first.

13
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.320
Then from there, we can figure out our Root Ports.

14
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.040
On the other switches, our Designated Ports, and our Blocking Ports, so we can then check that Spanning

15
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.660
Tree has eliminated any loops in the Layer 2 part of the network,

16
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.880
and we can also see the tree

17
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.540
that traffic is going to be traveling over.

18
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.860
Now, the diagram above is a screenshot from Packet Tracer. I've got the link lights enabled so you can

19
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.390
actually see easily where the Root Bridge is, and the path that traffic is going to go over. Just from looking

20
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.930
at it here,

21
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.350
you see that both Acc3 and CD2,

22
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.500
their links are all green.

23
00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.350
So, one of those two is going to be the Root Bridge, and on CD1, it's blocking a port

24
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.950
going towards CD2. So CD2 can't be the root bridge, it's going to be Acc3.

25
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.290
I can see on Acc3, all the links going to it are green on both sides.

26
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.280
I can also see from the diagram that the ports that are being blocked

27
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:27.680
are gigEthernet0/2 on CD1, and port fastEthernet0/21 on Acc4. So both of the possible loops, going

28
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.020
from CD1 to CD2, to Acc3, that has been broken by blocking gigEthernet0/2 on CD1, and the potential loop between

29
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:46.190
CD1, CD2, and Acc4 has been broken by blocking the port fastEthernet0/21 on Acc4.

30
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.980
Okay, so I can see all that from the diagram, but obviously, in the real-world, you're not going to have a

31
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.240
diagram which shows exactly how the Spanning Tree is configured.

32
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.640
So how do we figure out how the Spanning

33
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.710
Tree is laid out in a production network?

34
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.330
That's what we're going to cover here, using the same example topology.

35
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:18.830
So really, the Swiss army knife command for checking your Spanning Tree configuration is 'show spanning-tree'.

36
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.590
You already know that the default Spanning Tree version on a Cisco switch is PVST+, which runs

37
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.800
a separate spanning tree instance for every VLAN.

38
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.160
So, you also need to specify the VLAN as well.

39
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.390
In the example here, we're running the command first off on the Root Bridge, which was on Acc3

40
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.680
for our example.

41
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.250
So I say 'show spanning-tree vlan 1', 

42
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.890
well, if you don't specify the VLAN, it will show you the Spanning Tree for all of your different VLANs,

43
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.670
and if you've got a lot of VLANs on the switch, it's going to be very long output.

44
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.240
So, you want to specify the particular VLAN.

45
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.610
The next thing you can see here is the protocol is IEEE, and it's not actually using one of the

46
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.640
standard IEEE Spanning Tree versions,

47
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.420
it's using Cisco's proprietary PVST+.

48
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.850
It's just a quirk of the history of how this was developed, that Cisco called PVST IEEE when you

49
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.920
use the 'show spanning-tree command',

50
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.560
so using the default PVST+ here.

51
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.020
Next thing to tell you about the output of the command, there are two sections the Root ID section and the Bridge ID

52
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.650
section.

53
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.270
The Root ID gives you information about the Root Bridge.

54
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.730
The Bridge ID section gives you information about this switch.

55
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.030
So the Root ID information should be similar on all of the switches in your Local Area Network.

56
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.580
The Bridge ID section will specify the MAC address for that individual switch.

57
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.010
Next thing, we're on the Root bridge here,

58
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.130
we can see that very clearly, under the Root ID section,

59
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.560
it tells us this bridge

60
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:14.350
is the Root and that's why the MAC address is the same in the Root ID section and in the Bridge ID section,

61
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.990
because the switch is the Root Bridge. Notice for this example,

62
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.760
the switch's MAC address ends in D43D.

63
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.700
That's important when we look at the information coming up on the next switch we'll look at, which is a

64
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.480
non-Root Bridge, so D43D. We can see the priority in here.

65
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.760
The priority is 32768, which is the default priority.

66
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.820
This has been elected as the root bridge,

67
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.490
so I can see very simply from this information that all my bridges, all my switches, must be set with

68
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.840
the default priority, which is 32768, and this switch was elected as the root bridge

69
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.900
because it's got the lowest MAC address.

70
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:10.180
The last thing to see on the output of the command is it gives you the status of all your interfaces that are connected

71
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.750
to other switches. Because this is the root bridge,

72
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.040
all our ports are going to be Designated Ports and Forwarding.

73
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.030
Okay next, let's look at the output on a non-Root Bridge, so that was on Acc3.

74
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.980
Next up, look at the output on CD1,

75
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.600
and from, we can see that it is the diagram we can see  it is forwarding on interfaces fastEthernet0/24 and fastEthernet0/21, and

76
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.960
it's blocking on interface GigEthernet0/2.

77
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.130
So looking at the output on CD1, I do a 'show spanning tree for vlan 1' again, I can see that

78
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.980
this switch is also running PVST+.

79
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.720
You want all the switches in your network to be running the same spanning tree version.

80
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.650
Again, you've got the root ID and the bridge ID section,

81
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.980
and because this is not the root bridge, the two MAC addresses are different now.

82
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.090
Again, the root ID section gives you information about the root bridge.

83
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:20.170
You want all of the switches in your network for the same VLAN to be agreeing on which switch this

84
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.890
is on.

85
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.420
We can see that it is the same, D43D.

86
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.490
So that looks good.

87
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.850
And in the bridge ID section, I can see that this switch's unique MAC address ends in 3902

88
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.810
This switch's MAC address starts with 0090, which is higher than the root bridge's MAC address 

89
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.450
of 0001,

90
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.730
that's why the Root Bridge was preferred over this one.

91
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:50.470
Other information in the Root ID section, I can see that this switch's cost to get to the Root Bridge is 19, and

92
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.820
and the Root Port is interface fastEthernet0/24.

93
00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:02.740
That's the least cost path interface to get to the root bridge. And down at the bottom, I can see that interface

94
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.050
gigEthernet0/2, its role is alternate,

95
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.990
so it is a Blocking Port.

96
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:15.310
It's a port that has been selected to block a potential loop. Interfaces fastEthernet0/21 and fastEthernet0/24

97
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.830
are designated in a Root Port, and they are both Forwarding.

98
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.180
Okay, so that was the CD1, we'll look at the topology diagram again.

99
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:35.289
Let's also have a look at CD2, and on CD2, all its interfaces should be forwarding so let's jump in

100
00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.909
to the lab to see this.

101
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:47.410
I will go to my enable prompt and 'show spanning-tree for vlan 1' and in here, I can see that it

102
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.830
agrees that the Root Bridge is Acc3, ending with MAC address

103
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.050
D43D. This switch's

104
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.790
MAC address also begins with 0090,

105
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.090
so it's a higher MAC address,

106
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.670
that's why it was not selected as the Root Bridge.

107
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.500
All of my switches are running

108
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.030
the default priority of 32768.

109
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:17.260
For this switch to get out to the Root Bridge, it uses interface fastEthernet0/21, and

110
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.180
the cost is 19.

111
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:26.300
I can see all of my ports that are connected to other switches down at the bottom here, and fastEthernet0/21

112
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.720
again is the Root Port.

113
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.270
The other two ports are Designated Ports,

114
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.820
so all of these ports are Forwarding.

115
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.070
Finally, let's look at the topology diagram again.

116
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.830
The last switch to look at is Acc4, which is forwarding on FastEthernet0/24

117
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:51.490
That is the Root Port and it's blocking on fastEthernet0/21.

118
00:09:51.670 --> 00:10:00.070
So let's jump onto Acc4 in the lab, 'show spanning-tree vlan 1'.

119
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.930
I can see it also agrees that the Root Bridge is Acc3.

120
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:12.220
This switch's MAC address begins with 0060, which is higher than the Root Bridge's MAC address.

121
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.450
All of my switches are using a priority 32768. 

122
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:23.440
The Root Port is fastEthernet0/24, and the cost to get to the Root Bridge is 38.

123
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.610
We're forwarding on port fastEthernet0/24,

124
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.630
and we're blocking on port fastEthernet0/21.

125
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.670
So that's how you can check your Spannning Tree topology.

126
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:44.470
There's not really a quick way of doing this. If you just have a command line access to your switches,

127
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:51.190
jump on to one of your switches and do 'show spanning-tree' there. That will tell you which is the Root Bridge.

128
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:58.600
To find the entire topology and to see which ports are forwarding and which are blocking,

129
00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.000
you really

130
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.190
just have to map it out

131
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.630
switch by switch.

132
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.920
So it's handy

133
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.630
if you use a pencil and paper for this, you can draw it down in diagram everything.

134
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.590
Okay, so that was the 'show spanning-tree command'.
