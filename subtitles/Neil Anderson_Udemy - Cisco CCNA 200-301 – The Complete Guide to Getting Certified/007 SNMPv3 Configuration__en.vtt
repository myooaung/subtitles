00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.470
In the last lecture, we covered the configuration for S&P version two in this lecture, Ukichi, the

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.010
configuration for S&P version three.

3
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:30.110
Joe, you saw earlier that in S&P version one and two, the S&P manager, that's our Annemasse server

4
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.860
and the S&P agent or switch, they recognize each other through simple unencrypted community strings.

5
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.510
So it's not very secure baggage improved upon with S&P version three, which does support authentication

6
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.140
and encryption with S&P version three, the security model uses users and groups.

7
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.020
So we're going to configure a user on a switch and we can figure out a matching user on the Annemasse

8
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.420
server.

9
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.910
That's how they recognize each other.

10
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.160
There's also a group as well.

11
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.580
So most of the settings are configured at the group level and those settings are going to be applied

12
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.550
to the user depending on which group it's actually in.

13
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.570
There's three different security levels available and these are configured at the group level.

14
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.060
Normally you're going to just use one particular security level, but it is possible that you could

15
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.030
have one Annemasse server in one group if it's got one security level and a different Annemasse server

16
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.970
and a different group that's got a different security level.

17
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.540
That would be a pretty weird thing to do, but it is possible to do that.

18
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.940
The three different security levels.

19
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.940
The first one is new, all new priv, which means new authentication and new privacy with new ofthe

20
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.530
new prev new authentication password is exchanged and the communications between the agent and the server

21
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.090
are not encrypted.

22
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.570
So with no new priv, it still doesn't use a communication thing.

23
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.200
It still uses a username because it's an AMP version three.

24
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.030
But that username basically replaces works with Seema's, the Community String and S&P version one and

25
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.200
version two.

26
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.150
So there's not much point in doing that.

27
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.680
Doesn't really give you any advantage over the old S&P versions.

28
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.670
The next security level we've got is off new priv with all new priv.

29
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.810
Password authentication is used through the Annemasse server and the network device will securely authenticate

30
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.250
each other.

31
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.950
When we do that authentication, the authentication is encrypted.

32
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.940
So the username, username and password is encrypted is not go in plain text.

33
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.260
But after that initial authentication, no encryption is used for communications between the devices.

34
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.240
So if the server pooled some information from the device, that's going to go over the network unencrypted.

35
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.370
So the last one is one that we're most likely going to want to use, which is off prev with off prev.

36
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.640
Password authentication is used again, the same as it was in off no priv, but communications between

37
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.460
the agent and the server are also encrypted.

38
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.250
So with off prev, the Annemasse server and the device are going to securely authenticate each other

39
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.490
about does not go in plain text and also whenever they are sharing information that is also encrypted

40
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.820
as well.

41
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.710
So this is the most secure way of doing it.

42
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.180
If we're using S&P version three, most likely we're going to be using off PRIV.

43
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.280
OK, so let's look at the configuration she saw earlier in this picture.

44
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.180
We're going to have the group and we're going to have the user as well.

45
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.490
Let's configure the group first through a global config.

46
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.840
I see S&P Dosch Server Group in this example of called the group Blackbox Dosch Group, then actually

47
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.930
V three to see that we're using S&P version three and then the example of use the context of how I've

48
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.450
hit the question mark to see what the next keyword is.

49
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.270
And this is where we set the security level of either off North or PRIV.

50
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:16.420
Then next thing that we do so in an example, upset because I want the most secure level, then a question

51
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.790
mark and again, see what the next keyword is.

52
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.180
Next keyword, we've got access context to March.

53
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.560
No, if I read and write with access, you can send access.

54
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.170
Let's talk about that a bit more in the next slide context and March Bov apply to contexts and know

55
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.340
if I read and write are about views.

56
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.680
So let's see what that means to the first keyword available.

57
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.780
There was access.

58
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.020
What you can do is you can configure a normal access and access list under a switch where you specify

59
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.470
the IP address, the Annemasse server, and then when you configure your S&P saying here you can reference

60
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.120
my access list, which means you're locking it down, that this switch will only communicate with S&P.

61
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.860
With that particular IP address, you're looking at the IP address of your name server, the next keywords

62
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.520
we had in there.

63
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.810
What about context?

64
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.620
Contacts are used on switches to specify which Villines are accessible via S&P.

65
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.630
If you're configuring a switch, you might need to set that up so that uranium's system can access over

66
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.150
Villines, not just the default Bilan.

67
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.780
And then the last thing we said there were our views, views can be used to limit what information is

68
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:43.460
accessible to the Annemasse server and we had a review, a right view and a new if you are all available,

69
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.870
if you don't specify a review, then all MIB objects are accessible to read.

70
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.360
So by default, the anonymous server can get all the different S&P information from that particular

71
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.720
device.

72
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.600
So if you want to lock it down to only be able to govern, you may be able to pool a particular set

73
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.410
of information.

74
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.480
Then you would use a review for that.

75
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.280
Next one was the right view.

76
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.290
If you don't specify a right view, the new MV objects are accessible, right?

77
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.530
So this works the other way.

78
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.810
So by default, it can read everything, but it can write nothing.

79
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.280
So if you want to lock down and limit what it can read, configure a review.

80
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.700
If you want it to be able to write anything, then you have to configure it right.

81
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.590
Without explicitly configuring a right view.

82
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.160
It doesn't get any right access.

83
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.510
So by default, the Annemasse server gets read only access to all MIBS.

84
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.320
The last one was new or five.

85
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.320
You know, if a view is used to send notifications to members of the notification is a trap.

86
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.310
If you don't specify and even it will be disabled by default.

87
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.450
OK, so those were our views.

88
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.810
So when I configure the group here in this example, the fill command I use is an app server group,

89
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.810
black box group, V3 Prive.

90
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.470
So I haven't configured any access list and any views or anything here.

91
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:13.640
They are all optional and because I'm using the default here, the Annemasse server is in this group

92
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.030
will have full read-only access to the device.

93
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.750
Oh, yes, I've configured my group.

94
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:29.970
The next thing I'm going to want to do is configure my user to the first word I use again is an AMP

95
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.770
server, but I'm doing the user testing, so that's an app server user.

96
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.510
And then for my example user, I've called it Blackbox Dosch user.

97
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:46.320
Next, Expensify, the group that this user is in and I'm putting it in the flat box group that I just

98
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.350
configured a minute ago, actually, V3 for P version three.

99
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.430
And then off is where I'm going to specify the authentication algorithm.

100
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.200
I'm going to use I can either use AMD five or shot authentication.

101
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.140
Schaar is more secure, but it's a little bit slower.

102
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.590
Next up, so upset S&P server user, flatboat user in flatboat group S&P version, three of them using

103
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.100
Shaar.

104
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:19.250
And I'm using an authentication password of off password for this example.

105
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.480
You know, we talked about the three different security levels and there you specified authentication

106
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.010
and privacy separately.

107
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.240
But we can figure the authentication and the privacy separately as well.

108
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.840
So right now, I've already configured the authentication.

109
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.250
Next up, I'm going to configure the privacy.

110
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.360
So I say Priv and I use that question mark again, ishiba of options I've got here.

111
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:50.510
And I can either use Dare's triple Dare's or encryption is the most modern those it's the most secure.

112
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.780
It's a little bit slower.

113
00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:01.950
OK, after I can figure that through here and I won't read the whole county again, I've got up to I'm

114
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.660
using a yes encryption.

115
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:10.080
Next stop, Expensify, whether it's 128, one hundred and ninety two or two hundred and fifty six bit,

116
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.850
obviously the higher the number of and more secured it's going to be, but it's going to take more CPUSA

117
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.080
calls be a little slower.

118
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:25.620
So looking at the complete command, I've got S&P server, user watchbox user blackbox group using S&P

119
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.890
version three for authentication.

120
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.510
I'm using shop as my algorithm.

121
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.760
My password is off password.

122
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:38.990
And for Priv, I'm using a yes 120 encryption with a password of priv password.

123
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.110
So that is my user and my group set up on my switch.

124
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:49.230
Now what I would do next is I would go on to my Annemasse server and I would configure a user there

125
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.150
with matching settings here.

126
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.110
So I would set it with the same username of Flatboat user.

127
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.060
I would specify the password on reproved password and Nazmi done.

128
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.460
My Annemasse server is now going to be able to access my device and pull information from it.
