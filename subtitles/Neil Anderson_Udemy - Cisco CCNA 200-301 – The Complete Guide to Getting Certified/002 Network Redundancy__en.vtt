00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:15.290
In this lecture, you'll learn about network redundancy. You see in the diagram on the left on this

2
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:23.030
slide, we've got an example network and there's no redundancy at all in this network.

3
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.330
Everything is a single point of failure.

4
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.689
Looking at it from the enterprise point of view, you can see where I put in the red line, that shows the demarcation

5
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:41.510
point between the enterprise and the service provider. The SP router is the service provider router, R1 is the

6
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.060
enterprise WAN edge, Wide Area Network edge, router.

7
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.520
So from R1, we've got a single connection

8
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.130
going to a single service provider router. We've only got that one WAN edge router, R1.

9
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.440
We've got a single core distribution layer switch and our single access switches.

10
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.650
So if any one of those devices goes down, our PCs are going to lose connectivity. So no redundancy

11
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.940
there,

12
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.480
that's quite common

13
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:20.090
though for small branch offices where the cost of adding redundant devices wouldn't be justified. In larger

14
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.730
offices though, the cost will be justified because the cost of an outage would be more expensive.

15
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.200
So, we're going to want to have redundancy there.

16
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.500
The point of redundancy is to eliminate single points of failure.

17
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.300
So if any single device goes down, there's another device already in place which will take over.

18
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.040
So in the example you see on the slide now, we've got two WAN edge routers, R1 and R2, which

19
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.300
are connected to two service provider routers, SP1 and SP2, with separate links.

20
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.290
We've got a pair of core distribution layer switches and our access layer switches have got dual uplinks

21
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.260
going to them.

22
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.810
So if any of the service provider routers or the WAN edge routers, or the core distribution layer switches

23
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.400
goes down, or any of the links there go down, we still maintain connectivity.

24
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.580
Now, you might have noticed that we don't have redundancy

25
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.030
at the access layer. You see access layer switch 3 here,

26
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.620
if that goes down, then the PCs that are connected in will lose connectivity.

27
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.430
This is normal because desktop PCs typically just have one network card.

28
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.270
They can only connect into one switch anyway. An exception to this would be servers, which will often

29
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.650
have redundant NICs.

30
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.750
So for your servers, you'll usually put in redundant access layer switches.

31
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.050
But if an access layer switch goes down, it's only the PCs that are connected to that one switch which will

32
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.160
lose connectivity.

33
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.020
All of the other PCs in the building that are connected in different switches will still maintain connectivity.

34
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.470
If we compare that with the first slide, where if say, R1 or our core distribution layer switch went

35
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.860
down, everything in the building loses connectivity.

36
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.630
With the second example here, where we have built redundancy into the solution, we've got full redundancy on

37
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.550
our service provider links, our WAN edge routers, and our core distribution layer switches.

38
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.280
With the example topology I gave you,

39
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:44.030
we've got a clear demarcation point between Layer 3 and Layer 2. The links between our WAN edge routers,

40
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.800
R1 and R2, and going up to the service provider, they're all

41
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.010
Layer 3 links, meaning the interfaces have got IP addresses on them, and we're going to be running

42
00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:04.190
routing. The downstream links from R1 and R2, the downstream devices from there are Layer 2 devices.

43
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.420
The core distribution layer switches for the example are going to be Layer 2 only.

44
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.779
The reason I've done this is because it makes it easier to explain and to understand if I've got a clear

45
00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.450
boundary between Layer 3 and Layer 2.

46
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.890
But if this was a real world deployment, we probably would have deployed Layer 3 switches for our

47
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.710
core distribution layer switches. For everything I'm going to teach you during the section, that doesn't

48
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.000
really make any difference,

49
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.500
everything still applies.

50
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.320
It's just easier to understand what's going on with the routing and switching when we've got that clear

51
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.120
Layer 3 and Layer 2 boundary.

52
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:53.690
Okay, so in the example here, how are we going to configure the connectivity from our Wan edge

53
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.370
routers and going upstream and also down to our PCs?

54
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.290
Well, redundancy and failover are relatively easy to implement for Laye 3 routing.

55
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.850
If you look at our routes on R1 here, it's got a direct connection to the service provider

56
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.000
router at SP1. So, we'll have a default static route

57
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.470
pointing upstream there. So our route is 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

58
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.390
the next hop address is the SP1 router at 203.0.113.1.

59
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.720
Now, we want redundancy in case the SP1 router or the link to the router goes down.

60
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.810
So we have a backup route for that, which is going to point to R2.

61
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.830
So if the connectivity to SP1 goes down from R1, we can send traffic to R2, which will

62
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.140
then send the traffic up to SP2.

63
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.810
So our backup route is also going to be a static default

64
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.010
route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0

65
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.790
and the next hop address is R2 at 10.10.20.2.

66
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.800
Now, on this backup route,

67
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:14.450
we give that a higher administrative distance of 5 because I don't want to load balance my Internet bound

68
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.510
traffic to SP1 and to R2

69
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.020
when I send it from R1. I want it to always go up the direct link to SP1, unless that goes

70
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.840
down and then I want to send it to R2.

71
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.430
So, I need to make the route to SP1 a more preferred route than the route to R2. The way I do that

72
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.010
is by manipulating the administrative distance.

73
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.960
So on the first route to SP1, I don't specify an administrative distance.

74
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:49.910
It's a static route, so the administrative distance will be 1. On the backup route going to R2, I specify

75
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.640
an administrative distance of 5.

76
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.380
The lower the administrative distance the better,

77
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.940
so the second route with an AD of 5 is only going to come into effect if the first one goes down.

78
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:09.530
If the link to SP1 goes down, then the router will automatically failover to using that backup

79
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.070
route.

80
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.800
For traffic going downstream to the PCs on the 10.10.10.0 network,

81
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.220
well, R1 has got an interface on the inside, gigabitEthernet0/1, which has got IP

82
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.520
address 10.10.10.2.

83
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.040
So it's already got an interface that is in that subnet,

84
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.550
so I don't need to configure a route.

85
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:37.590
However, if interface gigEth0/1 goes down, I want to have a backup route

86
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.350
going down to the PCs.

87
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.150
So that's why I have

88
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:50.260
'ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0', with a next hop address of 10.10.20.2.

89
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.660
Again, pointing over to R2.

90
00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.050
I don't need to specify an administrative distance because the default administrative distance on a connected route

91
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.220
is zero.

92
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.110
It's always going to be the most preferred.

93
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.920
The default AD on a static route is going to be 1.

94
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.750
So this is going to be the backup route anyway, even without having to change the AD.

95
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:19.040
So, that's how we configure our routes and our backup routes on R1. On R2,

96
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.580
we're going to be doing the same configuration, except R2 will use SP2 as its preferred route

97
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.000
out to the Internet and R1 will be used for the backup

98
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.440
routes.

99
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:37.390
Okay, so that was our Layer 3 redundancy information, but we also need to worry about how

100
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.080
are the PCs going to send their traffic upstream and out to the Internet.

101
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.980
We're going to need to have redundancy configured there as well.

102
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.850
That's what we're going to discuss in the next lecture.
