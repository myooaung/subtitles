00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.280
In this lecture, I'll give you an overview of IPv4 address exhaustion and network address translation.

2
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.230
That's NAT. Now,

3
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.530
a lot of what we're going to cover here was already spoken about back in the subnetting section, but

4
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.390
that was a while back.

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.780
So I'll give you a quick review again here.

6
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.010
First off, our RFC1918 private addresses. The IETF document standards with RFC and

7
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.490
RFC1918

8
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.540
specifies private IP address ranges which are not routable on the public Internet.

9
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.310
So if you send traffic with a destination address, which is a private IP address out to the Internet,

10
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.690
then the service provider routers will just drop that traffic.

11
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.620
Private addresses were originally designed for hosts which should have no Internet connectivity. For

12
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.520
example, maybe it's a university and they need to have connectivity between the hosts internally, but

13
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.330
they don't want the students to have any Internet access.

14
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.830
Public IP addresses cost money.

15
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.110
And if an organization is a part of their network where the hosts need to communicate with each other

16
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.140
over IP but they don't need outside connectivity to the Internet, then they can assign those hosts

17
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.520
private IP addresses.

18
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.550
There is a range of private addresses in each address class - A, B and C. Our range in class A is

19
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.850
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, which can also be written in 10.0.0.0/8.

20
00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:01.980
The range in Class B is 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255.

21
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.090
That can be written as 172.16.0.0/12. And the range in class C is

22
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.490
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255.

23
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.820
That's 192.168.0.0/16. So the class A range of 10.0.0.0/8,

24
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.190
and the class C range of 192.168.0.0/16,

25
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.000
they're dead

26
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.290
easy to remember.

27
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.310
The one to commit to memory is the class B range, which is 172.16.0.0

28
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.600
172.16.0.0

29
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.080
to 172.31.255.255.

30
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.850
Now, the designers of IPv4 did not envision the explosive growth of its use and 4.3 billion

31
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.000
addresses seemed more than enough.

32
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.120
They didn't know that everybody would be wanting to get on the Internet and not just with one device,

33
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.560
but with their laptop, their mobile, their tablet, etc., and that's just personal users.

34
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.470
We've also got all the business users as well.

35
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.300
So 4.3 billion addresses seemed like it was going to be more than enough.

36
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.350
But of course, it wasn't. Also that 4.3 billion addresses,

37
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.540
that's just a theoretical limit.

38
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.680
It doesn't actually get anywhere near that with the usable addresses because the protocol is not particularly

39
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.010
efficient in its use of the available space.

40
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.600
And many of those addresses are wasted.

41
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.490
The Internet authorities started to predict address exhaustion in the late 1980s and IPv6 was developed

42
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.210
in the 90s as a long term solution to this problem.

43
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.660
IPv6 users are 128-bit address compared to IPv4's 32-bit address.

44
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.810
So the address is 4x as long when you write it down.

45
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.020
But it's not just a 4x bigger address space,

46
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.360
IPv6 actually provides more than 7.9x10 to the power of 28 times as many addresses

47
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.350
as IPv4.

48
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.950
So way, way more addresses than are available in IPv4.

49
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.540
And the idea is that the IPv6 address space will never run out.

50
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:32.650
But a problem is that there's not a seamless migration path from IPv4 to IPv6. IPv6 is not

51
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.500
backwards compatible with IPv4. There's not an easy way to change from one to the other.

52
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.780
So NAT, network address

53
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.920
translation, was implemented as a temporary workaround to mitigate the lack of IPv4 addresses until

54
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.520
organizations had time to migrate to IPv6.

55
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.520
So the original idea with using NAT for this was that it was just going to be temporary until everybody

56
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.440
had time to change to IPv6.

57
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.880
But it's actually turned out to be more of a long term solution in the real world.

58
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.970
An organization can use private IP addresses on their inside network when they're using NAT, but still

59
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.280
grant their hosts Internet access by translating them to their outside public IP addresses.

60
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.830
That's the translation.

61
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.090
Many hosts in the inside can share a few or a single public IP addresses on the outside. So let's look and

62
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.080
see how that works.

63
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:35.700
So we've got Office A, which is actually a company on the left, and Office B or Company B on the right.

64
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.220
And you can see that both companies are using the same private IP addresses.

65
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.790
They're using 192.168.10.0/24.

66
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.300
That's not a problem. There's no conflict because the private IP addresses are just used on

67
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.310
the inside.

68
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.850
They're not used for traffic when it's going between the companies on the outside.

69
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.220
You can also see that the companies are reusing public IP addresses here as well.

70
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.930
Company A, Office A,

71
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.560
they've got 200 hosts on the inside, but they've only got 14 public addresses,

72
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.620
that's the range 203.0.113.1/28. Company B, they've only got 6 addresses,

73
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.700
203.0.113.16/29.

74
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.020
203.0.113.16/29.

75
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.840
But they've got 100 hosts on the inside.

76
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:30.030
Your public IP addresses cost money, so it's good that we don't need to pay for a public IP address

77
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.440
for every host on the inside.

78
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.130
Also, that wouldn't work anyway because of the lack of IPv4 addresses. So NAT solves that because we

79
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:46.890
can use those private addresses on the inside and they can share multiple, the same IP, public IP addresses

80
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.850
on the outside.

81
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:56.630
Many industry experts predicted in the early 2000s that IPv6 would be ubiquitous within a few years,

82
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.920
that everybody would be using it, but it hasn't actually worked out that way.

83
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:10.370
Most normal enterprises today are using RFC1918 IPv4 addresses with NAT. They're not using IPv6

84
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.760
at all.

85
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:17.420
RFC1918 has the security benefit of hiding inside hosts by default.

86
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.990
But on a private IP address, they don't have a publicly available IP address, so it's not possible for

87
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.390
attackers on the inside to directly connect to them from the outside.

88
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.310
So that makes things more secure.

89
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.650
Plus, network engineers have more experience with IPv4 than IPv6.

90
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.640
Like I said, most places are just using IPv4 a day.

91
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:48.380
IPv6 is very different than IPv4 and people tend to not like change.

92
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:56.060
So engineers are comfortable already working with IPv4. NAT is working great as a workaround, as

93
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.840
a solution.

94
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:03.890
So that's why the uptake of IPv6 hasn't actually been as quick as people were originally expecting.
