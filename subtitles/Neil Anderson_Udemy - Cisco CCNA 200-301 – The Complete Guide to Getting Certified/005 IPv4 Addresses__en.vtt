00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.570
In this lecture, you'll learn about the format of an IPv4 address,

2
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.980
and when we write out the IP address, we write it out as a set of 4 octets in a dotted decimal format.

3
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.010
So you see an example of an IPv4 Address 

4
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.310
here,

5
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.130
192.168.10.15

6
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.930
Each of those sets of numbers is an octet. So 192 is the first octet, 168 is the second, 10 is the third,

7
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.350
and 15 is the fourth octet.

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.060
Each octet is 8 bits long. 8 bits,

9
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.460
that's why we call it the octet, and if you multiply 8 times 4, that gives you your 32 bits which

10
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.380
makes up the IPv4 address.

11
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.349
First thing I want to do is show you where you can find out the IP address on your different hosts and

12
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.550
devices.

13
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:13.620
So, let's look in Windows first. I'll open up a Command Prompt here, so CMD to open the Command Prompt,

14
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:24.660
and the Windows command to see your IP address is 'ipconfig', and I've got a load of output on here because

15
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.480
I'm running VMware on my laptop too, so I got a lot of virtual addresses on here. Let's scroll back a

16
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.080
bit until I find my wireless network.

17
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.970
This is the one I'm actually connected to my network on, and here,

18
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:50.550
if I mark this, you can see that my IPv4 address is 192.168.1.9. My subnet mask,

19
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:59.670
that you'll learn about in the next lecture, is 255.255.255.0, so that's also in dotted decimal format,

20
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.960
and the default gateway, which is the router that my PC would use if it needs to get out to a different

21
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.090
network, is at 192.168.1.1.

22
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.030
Now, I'm going to tie this all together when we get to the section later, which is called The Life of a

23
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.140
Packet, and in there, I'm going to detail how traffic gets from this source to the destination. For now,

24
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.240
I just want you to know that if traffic is going to another host on the same subnet, then it can go there

25
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.950
directly. If traffic is going to a host on a different subnet, it has to go there via a router. So you

26
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.150
can see my IP address is 192.168.1.9. That's the IP address on my laptop here.

27
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:56.010
The IP address on the router I would use to get out to other networks is at 192.168.1.1.

28
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.380
The other information you can see here as well is my IPv6 address and also the IPv6 default gateway.

29
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.900
We'll be talking about IPv6 in a later section. So in Windows, 'ipconfig' to get that information. Let's have

30
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.650
a look on Linux as well, so I'm going to open up an SSH session here to a Linux machine that I've got running,

31
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.210
and I'll get the command prompt on Linux. I'm going to enter my username and my password, and then the

32
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.920
command to see the IP information on Linux is 'ifconfig'. So 'ipconfig' on Windows, 'ifconfig' for interface

33
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:51.540
on Linux. You can see here that the IP address on this Linux host is 172.23.4.2,

34
00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:02.400
and the subnet mask, the same as it was on Windows, 255.255.255.0. In Windows, 'ipconfig' will show you

35
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.300
the IP address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway, which is the local router. In Linux, it shows

36
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.160
the IP address and the subnet mask. To get the default gateway, the command is 'ip route', and you can see

37
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.500
here the default route from my default gateway is 172.23.4.254. Okay,

38
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.870
that's how you get the IP address in Windows and in Linux. Finally, let's have a look and see how we get

39
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.100
it in

40
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.780
Cisco IOS.

41
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:42.180
I've already got an SSH session open here to a Cisco router. I'm going to enter the command

42
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.410
'enable' to get to the enable prompt, so I can see my show commands, and actually I don't think I've configured

43
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.940
an IP address on this router yet.

44
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.530
Let's just check. The command for that is 'show ip interface brief'. Oh, I have.

45
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.760
Okay.

46
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:06.670
So on interface FastEthernet0/0, you can see the IP address is

47
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:14.880
192.168.10.1. To get more information, because this is only giving me the IP address, I can't see

48
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.400
the subnet mask here, so let's do a 'show interface'. I could do a 'show interface' or a 'show ip interface',

49
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:35.220
and I can see for FastEthernet0/0, the Internet address is 192.168.10.1, and the subnet

50
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:43.780
mask is a /24. The subnet mask can either be written in slash '/' notation or in dotted decimal.

51
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.910
You'll find out about that in the next lecture. With my router, I don't have a default gateway on here.

52
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.820
Because our router, it's the device that knows about all the different networks, so it doesn't just

53
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.910
point at one other router. It's going to have lots of routes in here. You'll find out about routing on the router

54
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.920
in other sections a bit further on in the course. Okay, so 'ipconfig' on Windows, 'ifconfig' on

55
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:18.930
Linux, and 'show interface' on our Cisco IOS, it's the same commands for both of our routers and

56
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.100
our switches. Okay, let's go back to the slides.

57
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:34.630
Next thing to tell you about is static and automatic addressing. On our important devices, like our

58
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:42.060
fixed devices, like our servers; network infrastructure devices, like routers, switches, and firewalls;

59
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:52.230
also on our printers, usually we will manually assign the IP address on there. For our laptops and our

60
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.430
desktop PCs, they'll normally be assigned an IP address automatically through the use of DHCP,

61
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.470
which is the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

62
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.520
We're going to cover how to set that up later on.

63
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:13.290
The reason that you want your PCs to get their IP address automatically if you imagine we're in an office

64
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:19.590
with 6000 people for a large company, you're not going to want to have to go around 6000

65
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.050
different PCs and configure the IP address manually on all of them.

66
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.390
You can centralize that through the use of a DHCP server.

67
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:33.630
It's much more convenient. But for your fixed devices where you want to make sure the IP address is what

68
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.740
you think it is and it's never going to change,

69
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.150
like with your servers

70
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:42.920
and on your routers, you'll do it manually on them. You're going to have much less servers and routers,

71
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.810
so it's not so much hassle to manually set it there.

72
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:47.520
Okay,

73
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:56.490
to understand how the logical separation between our different IP subnets works, you need to understand

74
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.710
the IP address in binary.

75
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.670
That's why we had that binary lesson in the last lecture.
