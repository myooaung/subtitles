00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:16.140
In this lecture, I'm going to show you how to manipulate the OSPF metric, which is the cost in the lab.

2
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.760
We've got our usual lab setup of routers R1 to R5, all their interfaces are in networks beginning with

3
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.130
10.

4
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:34.650
And if we have a look at the configuration, I'll do a 'show ip route' on R1, you can see that I've already

5
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:44.220
got OSPF configured on all of my routers. Back at the lab topology, the 10.1.2.0/24 network

6
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:53.400
is available behind R4. So R1 could get there even along the top path via R2 and R3, or along

7
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.060
the bottom path via R5.

8
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.670
So, let's have a look and see which path it is taking.

9
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.340
So from our 'show ip route', I can see the route was learned via OSPF, to the 10.1.2.0/24 network.

10
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.500
It's going via 10.0.3.2, which is along the bottom path via R5, which is what

11
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.910
we'd expect because it's a shorter path, and Administrative Distance (AD) is 110, the default for OSPF, and

12
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.200
the metric, the cost, currently is 3.

13
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.510
So if we look back at the topology diagram again, the reason it's got a cost of 3 is that all the interfaces

14
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.020
are FastEthernet, so they all have a cost of 1.

15
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.170
So we've got the link itself has got a cost of 1, then the link from R4 to R5 is also a cost of 1,

16
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.050
then from R5 to R1 is also 1.

17
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.800
So we add up 1, 1, and 1 together,

18
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.440
that gives us our cost of 3.

19
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.930
So we're using the default reference bandwidth of 100 there, where the best possible interface

20
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.470
is a FastEthernet interface.

21
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.490
We had GigabitEthernet, or 10GigabitEthernet, etc., that would still have a cost of 1.

22
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.620
It would not be treated any better than the slower

23
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.940
FastEthernet interface. So we want to set a higher reference bandwidth, so that those newer, faster Ethernet

24
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.010
interfaces, like Gigabit and 10GigabitEthernet, will be preferred over the slower FastEthernet. So to

25
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.370
do that,

26
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.170
it's going to be the same config on all the routers. You want to configure this on all the routers in

27
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.170
your network or you can get unexpected results. You need them to all have the same consistent reference

28
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.000
bandwidth.

29
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:54.480
So I'm going to open up a text editor for this, and the commands I want to use are 'router ospf 1',

30
00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:03.720
and then the command is 'auto-cost reference-bandwidth', and I'll set it to a high enough

31
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.400
value that I'm future proofing myself as well. So I'll set this to 100000, and then I'm

32
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.410
going to copy and paste this in to all of my routers.

33
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:26.910
So there, I need to do a 'config t', so there is R1 and you see it gives me the warning, make sure you do this

34
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.500
and all of your routers.

35
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.130
And I'll also paste it into R2,

36
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.540
and why did that not take the command. Let me try pasting it in again. Okay, that's got corrupted somehow.

37
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:53.540
So let me go copy it again, so Control-C to copy it from my text document again, and then back on the router,

38
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.600
paste it in.

39
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.860
That took it okay

40
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.820
this time. That's also to show you as well that even when you are copying and pasting on a Cisco router, have a

41
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:12.700
look at the output and check it's taken the commands correctly. Do also on R3, on R4, and R5.

42
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.330
Okay, so that should be good

43
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.300
now.

44
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.220
So you saw when we did the 'show ip route' for the 10.1.2.0 network,

45
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.740
the cost was 3.

46
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.430
This should be updated

47
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.590
now.

48
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.710
So if I now you do a 'do show ip route',

49
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.250
you see for the 10.1.2.0 network, it's got a cost of 3000 now because 

50
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.020
100000 divided by 100 is 1000 and we had the 3 links,

51
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.370
so that gives us a total cost of 3000.

52
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.230
Okay, so that's

53
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.370
the effect of the reference bandwidth.

54
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.300
If we had another path, which had GigabitEthernet interfaces now, rather than each of those having a cost

55
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.010
of 1000, they would have a cost of 100,

56
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.100
so it would be preferred.

57
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.720
Okay.

58
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.470
Next thing to do is let's change the path here. So the traffic for 10.1.2.0 is currently going via

59
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.860
10.0.3.2, which is on R5 along the bottom path, with a cost of 3000.

60
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.550
Let's have a look at our network topology again, and what I want to do is change the traffic.

61
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.980
So rather than going along the bottom path, I'm going to move it to the top path.

62
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:36.020
I could either give the top path a lower cost, or I can manipulate it by giving the bottom path a higher

63
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.210
cost than what it is now.

64
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.810
So there's only two links along the bottom, so it's going to be quicker to change it along the bottom path.

65
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.660
So each link now

66
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:53.420
currently has a cost of 1000. Let's set these two links here, from R1 to R5 and from R5 to

67
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.690
R4, to have a cost of 2000 instead.

68
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.830
So that will give the bottom path the total cost of 5000, the 2000 here, the 2000

69
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.920
from R5 to R4, and a 1000 on the link itself,

70
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:15.140
so 5000 on the bottom path. Along the top path will be 1, 2, 3, 4000, so the top path will

71
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.750
be preferred.

72
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.040
And I want to do this on all the interfaces along the bottom path, so that I've got the consistent cost

73
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:29.980
on each link on both sides of the link, So I'll go on to R1 first, and that was on interface

74
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.780
FastEthernet3/0, is facing R5,

75
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.730
and I'll say 'ip cost ospf 2000',

76
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:50.120
and oh, it's because of missed out the OSPF. So 'ip ospf cost 2000' is the correct command,

77
00:06:50.120 --> 00:07:02.270
so that was on R1. Then on R5, it's on interfaces FastEthernet2/0, 'ip ospf cost 2000',

78
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:10.430
and I'll hit the up arrow a couple of times and change this to FastEthernet3/0, and 'ip ospf cost 2000'.

79
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:23.800
And finally, on R4, it's 'interface FastEthernet2/0', which is facing R5, and 'ip ospf cost 2000'.

80
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:31.070
So that bottom path should now be a higher cost than the top path, if I go back onto R1, and I do

81
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:41.020
a 'show ip route' now, you see previously, it was going via 10.0.3.2. Now, to get to  

82
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:48.540
10.1.2.0, the next hop is 10.0.0.2, that's R2 along the top path.

83
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.110
Okay,

84
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:55.850
so that's how we change the reference bandwidth, and also how we can manipulate the paths our traffic

85
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.610
is going to take, through the OSPF cost.
