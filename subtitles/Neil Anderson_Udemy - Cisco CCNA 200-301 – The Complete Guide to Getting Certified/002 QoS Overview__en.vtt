00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.440
In this lecture, I'm going to give you an overview of Kulash, which is quality of service, and when

2
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.830
people talk about cures in general, they're usually referring to cuing.

3
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.670
So that's going to be the main focus of this lecture.

4
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.830
The original driver for kulaks was voice over IP.

5
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.570
And the first thing I'll do here is explain why there was a need for quality of service to way back

6
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.150
in the day.

7
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.230
I'm sure you'll still see some networks doing this today.

8
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.390
And I was well, there was a dedicated voice, video and data networks, and maybe the company didn't

9
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.470
have video, but for sure they would have data and voice for their data network.

10
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.050
They would have a standard IP one like we covered in the wine section earlier for their food network.

11
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.460
They would be connected to the local telephone provider, the local phone company, and for that they

12
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.520
would have phones under desks in their offices and there would usually be PBX in the office as well,

13
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.680
which is used to control the phones.

14
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.610
And the PBX would be connected up to the telephone company for video calls if they had Viljoen points.

15
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.850
And typically that would be connected up over an ISDN network.

16
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.240
Integrated Services Digital Network is what it stands for and ISDN would be provided by the phone company

17
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.750
as well.

18
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:51.560
And you can see from the diagram here that for voice video on the three networks are completely physically

19
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.060
separate from each other.

20
00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.610
The data network is dedicated for the ISDN network, is dedicated for video and the phone network.

21
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.690
The Public Switch Telephony Network with the telco is dedicated for voice calls.

22
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.350
So because of this, if there's a problem with any of those, it's not going to affect the other two.

23
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.470
Now, what you'll find most often in modern networks is converged networks where the company is running

24
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.030
voice video and data all over the same underlying physical network infrastructure.

25
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.930
You can see the diagram here now that we've got IP phones on the desks and they're going to be connected

26
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.720
to an IP PBX like the Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

27
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.560
We've got IP video and points as well.

28
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.300
And we've got our standard IP servers and workstations and everything is connected to the same underlying

29
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.720
network which is running over an IP infrastructure.

30
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.980
Now, you maybe noticed something missing here in the last slide.

31
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.950
We were able to call external people like customers and suppliers through the phone company as well.

32
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.410
And this example here, you'll see that everything is on the company's corporate IP wan so they can

33
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.610
send data, voice video and make phone calls between offices.

34
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.660
But right now, they wouldn't be able to call customers or suppliers.

35
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.110
So we're going to still need to be connected to the local phone company as well for that connection

36
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.020
that could be using a traditional phone connection.

37
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:42.200
You would see in an office like Voice E 131 connection with a lot of modern phone providers will actually

38
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.020
offer voice over IP as well.

39
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.500
And it will be using a zip connection which ties session initiated protocol.

40
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.390
That's really not important here.

41
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.460
The thing that's important here is that the voice, the video and the data is all running over that

42
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.300
same shared network infrastructure between the different offices.

43
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.860
So the effects of this on old traditional networks, the voice and video had their own physically separate

44
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.130
network infrastructure and they did not impact each other.

45
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.769
If there's a problem on the data network that is not going to affect the voice network, people can

46
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:26.120
still make phone calls as normal on modern networks, however, data, voice and video run over the

47
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.600
same shared physical infrastructure.

48
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.370
And the reason that companies will do that now is because it enables cost savings, because rather than

49
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.510
having three separate networks, you can run everything over that same shared network.

50
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.920
And it also enables advanced features for voice on video.

51
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.600
For example, you'll see with modern video endpoints, they can integrate with other collaboration software.

52
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.730
They can do things like you, shared presentations over WebEx, over the network.

53
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.200
It can also integrate with your call center if you have one and stuff like that as well.

54
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.560
So lowered costs and increased features.

55
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.560
But a potential problem with this now is that the voice and video are all fighting for the same shared

56
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.590
bandwidth or not same shared physical network and voice and video.

57
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.960
You have got quality requirements for voice and traditional standard definition video packets.

58
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.860
The recommended requirements to be an acceptable quality call are that the latency, which is another

59
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.210
word for delay, should be up to 150 milliseconds.

60
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.720
No more of a not the jitter, which is variation in delay, no more than 30 milliseconds.

61
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.380
I'll explain.

62
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.600
Not a bit more detail in a second, but there's no more than one percent of your pockets are lost.

63
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:59.540
Now, those are one way requirements, meaning that a pocket sent from a phone in the HQ has 150 milliseconds

64
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.760
to reach the and the branch and vice versa.

65
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.290
So we go back in the diagram.

66
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.150
You see we've got our phones in the each cube.

67
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.920
I'm going to make a phone call from HQ to the phone in the branch.

68
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.810
Those packets coming from from the phone in the HQ are where your spoken voice is coded inside.

69
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.860
They've got 150 milliseconds to make it to the phone in the branch.

70
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.100
OK, so the jitter should be no more than 30 milliseconds.

71
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.680
Jitter is variation in delay.

72
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.540
So to give you an example of especially those packets, we've got multiple packets going from the HQ

73
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.920
phone to the branch for.

74
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.150
And they're arriving now.

75
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:50.570
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now.

76
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.550
That was variation in delay.

77
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.140
It's going to be multiple pockets.

78
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.900
And if a delay between the first, the second and the third packet varies, that is your jitter.

79
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.680
Your IP phones have got a built-In gifter buffer.

80
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.650
They don't immediately play the packets out to your ear because there's always going to be some gifter

81
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.950
there.

82
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.620
And it would literally sound jittery if the.

83
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:20.520
So the IP phones will smooth out the rate of packets being received to make it sound natural, but if

84
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.610
Jeter goes above 30 milliseconds, it's going to overrun Bill in Jerrard Buffer and it's going to make

85
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.900
a bad quality call.

86
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.110
Now, you've all seen bad quality calls.

87
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:37.260
If you watch a news report coming from a war zone or somewhere like that, usually they'll be using

88
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.360
a satellite phone and satellite is famously a highly she connection.

89
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.620
So that's why when you see the news report, they'll always make the apology, the star, about the

90
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.760
quality of the call.

91
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.580
And you'll see it will be choppy and the audio will be bad quality about the kind of thing that will

92
00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.820
happen if you don't meet those requirements for your voice on your video.

93
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.060
So that was for Standard IP Tiffany voice and standard definition video.

94
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:12.090
If you're using high definition video, it's got stricter requirements where it can handle less loss

95
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.780
with high definition video, it uses very high compression.

96
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.620
So if you lose any pockets at all, that will be noticeable in the video.

97
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.340
OK, so what are we going to do about this, or how can this cause a problem?

98
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:32.809
So first thing to tell you about here is the default queuing mechanism on a router and on switches as

99
00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.929
well, which is first in, first out.

100
00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:42.980
So whenever congestion is experienced on or off, switch packets are sent out in a first in first.

101
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:50.840
I just pfeifle minor by default and congestion can be experienced whenever it's possible for pockets

102
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.310
to be coming in quicker than they can be sent out to.

103
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:02.000
An example would be on your an age where you've got a fast interface on the inside and you've got a

104
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.890
smoother interface on the outside like you see in the example here.

105
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.370
So on the right here, it's got fast Ethernet on the inside, 100 megabits per second, the outside

106
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.850
interface.

107
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.650
And our example was an E one.

108
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.260
So its speed is two megabits per second.

109
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:24.230
It's possible for traffic to be coming in at a rate up to 100 megabits per second.

110
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.670
But the router can only physically send traffic out at a rate of up to two megabits per second.

111
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:38.390
So if traffic is coming in at a rate higher than two megabits per second, we can't send out as quickly

112
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.440
as it comes in.

113
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.670
And it's going to have to.

114
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.450
CUV was pocket's up another place where you would see congestion.

115
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.160
So this is a really common place.

116
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.960
You'll see it most likely place.

117
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.630
You'll see congestion is on your winegrowers because typically they will have faster speed interfaces

118
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.290
on the inside than on the outside.

119
00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:01.580
You can also see it in your compas on your switches as well, because you're going to have more workstations

120
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.130
connected in the axis layer when you've got uplinks going up to the top.

121
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:12.080
So engelen in your compas to believe it will be less congestion because there are high speed interfaces

122
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.970
there, but there can still be congestion there as well.

123
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.520
Another example, we're going to use a wide range right here because that's where you're going to see

124
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.790
usually there the main effect of congestion and also where QOL users can usually help the most as well.

125
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.640
So this is still an example where we had the HQ on the left in the diagram on the branch office in the

126
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.520
right, and this is the HQ and we're going to be sending traffic from left to right to the branch.

127
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.180
So let's look what happens first when we don't have congestion.

128
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:50.660
So we've got traffic coming in on the inside interface or not router, which is going over to our external

129
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.320
offices.

130
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:57.650
And because we're running a converged network here, we've got both voice and video on their pockets

131
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.090
are going to be coming in.

132
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:05.270
And the example you see, the deep pockets are blue and they tend to be bigger than your voice pockets,

133
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.870
which are usually small but always small pockets.

134
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.130
So our voice pockets are small green ones.

135
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:17.270
And the first example, traffic is coming in at a rate less than two megabits per second.

136
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.090
And what will happen when the office isn't very busy?

137
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.180
When that happens, we are concerned traffic immediately as it is received.

138
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.570
So in that case, there is no congestion at all.

139
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.340
Traffic is passing very quickly through the OR we're not going to have any problems there.

140
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:42.030
But we got a problem when traffic comes in at a rate higher than two megabits per second.

141
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:48.420
So you can see in the example here, we've got that larger pocket, the front, the blue one, a little

142
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.140
green voice pocket behind there than a couple of data pockets.

143
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.870
And then we've got a green voice pocket coming in again and we'll order our pockets going to come in.

144
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.610
Depends on what people are doing.

145
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.420
If somebody is making a phone call, voice pockets are going to be coming in.

146
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.050
If somebody's sending their data, pockets are going to come in and they're going to come in in whatever

147
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.540
order users are taking those options.

148
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:17.580
And because traffic is coming in at a rate faster than two megabits per second, as you see in the diagram

149
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.480
here, the router can't send out quickly enough.

150
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.950
It can't keep up.

151
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:30.900
So when that happens, we will buffer traffic, meaning it will queue up and pockets wait in the queue

152
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.620
to go out.

153
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:38.730
The default queuing mechanism is that traffic gets sent out in the same order, but it comes in its

154
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.200
first in, first out.

155
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.720
So you can see in the queue here we've got got the pocket that came in first is at the front of the

156
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:45.990
queue.

157
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.370
It's going out right now.

158
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.470
And then we've got the voice pocket, the two pocket and the other voice pocket behind their.

159
00:12:54.310 --> 00:13:00.130
And this is congestion in our right or whenever you've got park is being cued up, that is congestion

160
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.120
and this causes delay to the pockets as we wait in the queue.

161
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.740
Also, as the size of a queue changes, it causes jitter.

162
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:13.120
If the queues enlargement was going to be long, it's going to take pockets and longer to get to the

163
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.960
front of the queue.

164
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.750
And when the queue is, Shah is going to take less time.

165
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:22.510
So having pockets in the queue and variable size of a queue is going to cause Wichita to go up and down

166
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.010
as well.

167
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.230
And there's a limit to the size of the queue.

168
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.640
There's only so much memory.

169
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.820
And a writer, if a pocket arrives when the queue is full, then the voter is going to drop it.

170
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:42.220
So the congestion, it causes delay as pockets are waiting in the queue, it causes jitter as pockets

171
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:48.190
are waiting in the queue again in the queue is changing size and it's causing loss when the queue is

172
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.580
full and pockets are trying to get in, the back are getting dropped.

173
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:59.490
And our voice and video calls and also applications will be unacceptable quality if they do not meet

174
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:07.170
their daily jitter and loss requirements, and having heuzenroeder is going to cause our voice and video

175
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.270
pockets to not meet those requirements.

176
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.690
And it's going to cause bad quality calls when you're working in it.

177
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:19.350
This is going to give you a big issue, because way back in the day when voice and video were on their

178
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:25.050
own, separate dedicated networks users are used to, they can always pick up the phone and make a phone

179
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:25.440
call.

180
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.640
And it's always going to be a good quality call.

181
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.770
So you really you have to provide the same quality on modern networks as well.

182
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:37.560
So how can we mitigate congestion first way we can do it?

183
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:43.830
The easiest way is we can add more bandwidth if we had 100 meg interface on the outside as well as on

184
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.490
the inside.

185
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.310
And whenever traffic comes in, we can send it immediately.

186
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.410
There's not going to be any congestion.

187
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.470
So the best way to fix a congestion problem is by adding more bandwidth.

188
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.580
But the problem is that that costs money.

189
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.820
That outside interface is connected through your service provider.

190
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.000
And the more bandwidth you want, the more money they're going to charge you for it.

191
00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.510
So another way that we can help mitigate congestion is by using quality of service techniques.

192
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.670
And what quality of service does is it gives better service to the traffic that needs it.

193
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.900
So what we're going to do now is we're going to configure cuing on our router and we're going to give

194
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.990
better service to our voice pockets.

195
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:29.370
It's the same scenario before where we've got traffic coming in at a rate higher than two megabits per

196
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:29.940
second.

197
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.310
The data pocket comes in first, then a little voice pocket, then two data pockets and then the voice

198
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:35.810
pocket.

199
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.480
So we've got congestion, not traffic goes in the queue.

200
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:45.240
But the difference now is if I go back that one slide again, you see it was blue, green, blue, blue,

201
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.880
green.

202
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:52.470
Now, what we do with queuing is we put our voice pockets straight to the front of the queue whenever

203
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.670
there is a queue.

204
00:15:53.710 --> 00:16:01.890
And so the voice pockets jump in front of the data pockets, the recognize voice, voice pockets, and

205
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:06.000
it moves into the front of the queue and that minimizes their delay.

206
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.640
They're not further back in the queue for the front.

207
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.980
So they're going to be in queue for last time.

208
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.140
We're going to get out of it quicker.

209
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.830
That's going to minimise or delay the jitter on velocity.

210
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.040
So what are the effects of doing this?

211
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:26.190
Well, like I just said, it reduces latency, the loss for particular traffic.

212
00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:31.350
You're going to give better service to your voice and video traffic and maybe some mission critical

213
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.340
applications.

214
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:40.200
The original driver for us was voice over IP, but it can be used to give better service to important

215
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.550
the applications as well.

216
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.390
Thing is, if you're giving one type of traffic better service on the same link, the same bomb, if

217
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.830
you had before, then the other traffic types must get worse service.

218
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:58.080
We jumped that voice pocket to the front of the queue, but that's actually moving our data packets

219
00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.480
further back in the queue.

220
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.610
So voice is going to get better service, but they get worse service.

221
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.460
The point is to give each type of traffic the service it requires.

222
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:14.130
If a user is trying to open up a Web page on the Internet and not takes one second driver in half a

223
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:19.380
second to know as the user is not going, it is not going to even notice the difference.

224
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:25.440
It doesn't matter if you don't a phone call and somebody's voice start sending jerky and there's gaps

225
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.670
in it and you can't understand.

226
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.630
And that's a big deal, which means that the phone call doesn't work.

227
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.290
So it's important to give voice and video really good service so it gets equal.

228
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:41.550
It requires it doesn't matter if it gets a little less quality service because users won't actually

229
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.740
know for application anyway.

230
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:52.260
Kulash is not a magic bullet and it's designed to mitigate temporary periods of congestion.

231
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:59.820
If a link is permanently congested, then you're going to have bad quality voice video and applications

232
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.900
on that link.

233
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.050
So what you need to do is upgrade the link.

234
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.540
What you'll often see companies do is they'll have target utilization.

235
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.220
80 percent is not uncommon.

236
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.110
So they'll look for an average utilization of 80 percent on the link.

237
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:23.580
But you know that the network gets busier at some times of day, like on Monday morning at nine p.m.

238
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.060
It's probably going to be busier than it is at three p.m. on a Friday.

239
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.080
So you could put in enough bandwidth.

240
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.160
The link never, ever gets congested, but that would be really expensive.

241
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:42.120
And what you can do is balance the cost by having the link running, for example, 80 percent utilization

242
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:49.440
on average, you know that it will sometimes burst up to 100 percent and the link will be congested

243
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.390
for voice temporary.

244
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:58.860
Ease of congestion, unable kulash, see your voice and your video and the applications get the service

245
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:59.640
they require.

246
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.250
OK, that was an overview of.

247
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:07.680
I'll see you in the next lecture where we'll start getting a bit deeper.
