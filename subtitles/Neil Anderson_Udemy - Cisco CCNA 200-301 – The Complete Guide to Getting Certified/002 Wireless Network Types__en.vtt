00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.650
In this lecture, you'll learn about the different types of Wi-Fi networks that are available, Wi-Fi

2
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.090
services are defined in the, believe it, or two 11 standard and I triple E, I'm sort of institute

3
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.830
of electrical and electronics engineers in the Shishani.

4
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.870
The terminology that is used comes straight from the eight to 11 standard to vouchered terminology that

5
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.640
I'll be using throughout the section.

6
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.180
So the different types of wireless networks that we have, first up is IWP, that's a wireless personal

7
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.580
area network and a weapon.

8
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.990
The devices are very close together within 10 meters of each other.

9
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.610
And Bluetooth is often used for the connectivity here.

10
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.730
W line is a wireless local area network that provides access to a campus network.

11
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.420
But campus will typically be wired to network.

12
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.690
And having Wi-Fi also allows you to connect to it wirelessly as well.

13
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.370
It is possible that the entire network, the entire building, your corporate office, everybody is

14
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.750
connecting their wirelessly.

15
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.590
But more likely there is going to be a wired network there with a W on it allows you to connect to that

16
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.300
wired infrastructure without the need for a wire, a cable yourself.

17
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.540
And the devices are within 100 meters of a wireless access point with Adobe Ulen.

18
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.610
We'll be talking a lot more about wireless access points for the rest of the section.

19
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.930
Finally, we have a W, which is a wireless metropolitan area network that covers a large area such

20
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.740
as a city.

21
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:57.440
And for the Shishani exam, it really focuses on on wireless local area network for wireless access

22
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.910
to a corporate campus.

23
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.449
OK, looking at ad hoc networks now, so with ad hoc networks, two or more wireless stations communicate

24
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.930
directly with each other.

25
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.340
Your first bit of terminology there, whenever you've got a device communicating on the wireless network,

26
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.500
it's known as a station.

27
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.480
So with an ad hoc network, but is a peer-to-peer network where your wireless stations are communicating

28
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.400
directly with each other on Peer-to-peer network is known as an IBSA as an independent basic service

29
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.870
set.

30
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.540
So you can see in the example here, I've got free laptops for all communicating directly with each

31
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.810
other.

32
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.000
The circle in the left is the laptop on the lamp's coverage area.

33
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.130
You can see the coverage area for this laptop here and then the coverage area for this laptop here,

34
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.530
because we're all in each other's coverage area but only able to communicate directly with each other.

35
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.360
But it's probably pretty obvious.

36
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.010
You can see there's going to be a scalability issue with this, because what if we add another laptop

37
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.890
to the picture and now this laptop is in the coverage area of the two of our laptops needs to it, but

38
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.570
it's outside the coverage area of the laptop on the left.

39
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.250
So there's not a scalability issue with ad hoc network.

40
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.680
It only really works for a upon a wireless personal area network where the devices are all very close

41
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.340
to each other.

42
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.540
So this is where infrastructure mode comes in, which can solve scalability issue and infrastructure

43
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.360
mode, roggeveen the devices communicating directly with each other over wireless, they communicate

44
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.430
via a wireless access point.

45
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.590
So you can see the two laptops here.

46
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.730
When they're communicating with each other or anything else, they're going to be sending frames to

47
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.900
the wireless app.

48
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.330
And it's a wireless app that forwards voice frames on.

49
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.720
Now, if you look here, you know, the wireless app has also got its own coverage area.

50
00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.060
So how does this solve the scalability issue that we had in ad hoc networks?

51
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.910
Well, first reason is the wireless app can be connected to the wired network.

52
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.390
So this now gives your wireless devices access to the entire wired network and beyond it.

53
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.860
And also you can deploy multiple wireless access points so that you get coverage across the entire area

54
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.760
that you want.

55
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.760
Now, wireless stations work in either ad hoc or infrastructure mode.

56
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.940
They can't operate in booths at the same time.

57
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.460
So what if you're in the corporate office, you're connected to the wireless lan, but you also want

58
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.120
to connect to a wireless monitor as well?

59
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.560
Well, does that mean you can't do it?

60
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.140
Well, there is a solution for this, and that is Wi-Fi direct Wi-Fi direct.

61
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.450
Allow these devices to be connected to an access point, to build an infrastructure mode and also be

62
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.960
part of a peer to peer wireless network.

63
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.650
But I thought I just said that you can't have infrastructure more than ad hoc mode working at the same

64
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.950
time.

65
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.340
Well, that still holds because with Wi-Fi direct, it does not operate an ad hoc abscessed mode.

66
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.860
It's an extension to infrastructure.

67
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.480
So it's still infrastructure mode.

68
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.370
WPX Wi-Fi protected set up enables connections set up by pushing a button.

69
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.900
So it's very easy to set up.

70
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.710
And it's a wireless personal area network because for a peer-to-peer connection, the devices have to

71
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.610
be close together.

72
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.820
The predefine services are available with Wi-Fi, direct our Mimecast to a wireless external monitor

73
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.610
DL and a digital living networking alliance allows devices to stream music and video to each other.

74
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.490
And it can also direct print.

75
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.130
Another couple of things to tell you about wireless.

76
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.310
Bridges's is the first one where bridges can be used to connect areas which are not reachable via cable

77
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.300
to the network.

78
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.840
So any example here you can see over and over.

79
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.820
Maybe this is our warehouse and it's not possible to get a wired connection going in there from the

80
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.630
main building.

81
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.330
But what we could use to get connectivity to the warehouse is we could put a wireless bridge in there

82
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.270
and have a wireless connection going over to the main building.

83
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.670
So wireless bridge is often used to give connectivity between buildings where a cable is not possible.

84
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.430
And the last one is mesh networks.

85
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.750
Mesh networks are becoming very popular and home networks.

86
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.350
Now, this is another option to spread the coverage area of a wireless LAN.

87
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:36.300
One AP radio is used to serve clients and the other radio in the app connects to the back home network.

88
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.990
So you can see here we've got our main switch here.

89
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.440
It's connected to an app and we've got a black hole and a five gigahertz radio to another app and then

90
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.060
another back home to another app.

91
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.340
And this could go on as well.

92
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.390
So you can see that this can extend the coverage area, giving you a large wireless coverage area and

93
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.880
still connected to your wired network.

94
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.630
OK, that was everything I needed to tell you here.

95
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.090
See you in the next lecture for more wireless.
