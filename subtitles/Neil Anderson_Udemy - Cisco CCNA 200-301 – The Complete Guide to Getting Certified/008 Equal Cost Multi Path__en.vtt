00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.600
In this lecture, you'll learn about Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP). If multiple paths to a destination network 

2
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.660
have an equal metric, the router will enter all of those paths into the routing table,

3
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.340
and it will load balance the outbound traffic to that destination network over those available multiple

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.010
equal cost paths. And all routing protocols, all your IGPs, will perform Equal Cost Multi Path by default.

5
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.050
So RIP will do it,

6
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.910
IS-IS, EIGRP, OSPF, they will all do equal cost multi path by default. Meaning, if they learn multiple

7
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.380
paths to get to the same destination and those paths have got the same cost and it's the best path, it

8
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.200
will put them all in routing table and load balance across all of those paths. So they can all do Equal

9
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.610
Cost Multi Path, EIGRP is the only routing protocol that can do Unequal Cost Multi Path.

10
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.470
So they'll all do Equal Cost Multi Path by default including EIGRP, EIGRP will not do Unequal Cost

11
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.910
to load balancing by default but it can do it if you manually configure it to do so. So looking at our

12
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.720
example here, we have got R1 on the right, we've got R4 on the left.

13
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.450
The example is going to take a look at how R4 is going to get to the 10.0.1.0

14
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.860
/24 network behind R1.

15
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.770
If you look in our example topology, all of the links are in the same bandwidth. They're all 100 megabits

16
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.500
per second and it has to go through 1, 2, 3, 100 megabit lengths along the top path and also 1, 2, 3

17
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.640
100 megabit links along the bottom path.

18
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.820
So all of our different routing protocols would see these two paths, top and bottom, as being an Equal

19
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.130
Cost Paths.

20
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:15.250
So in that case R4 will install two routes into the routing table for the 10.0.1.0/24 network.

21
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.960
The same will happen for the 10.0.2.0/24 network in this example as well.

22
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.940
Half the traffic will take path R4 to R3 to R2 to R1, and the other half will

23
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.010
take the path R4 to R5 to R6 to R1.

24
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.330
You can also achieve load balancing with static routes as well. To do that, just configure two different

25
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:45.700
static routes both for the exact same subnet and the same subnet mask that put in two different next hops.

26
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.420
Again, that will install two different routes into the routing table and traffic will be load balanced over both

27
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.920
of them. You can have more than two routes if you wanted to. If you put in three routes, it would load balance

28
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.330
over all three. Again, something that we covered in the earlier lecture when we looked at load balancing

29
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.100
for static routing,

30
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.790
this is the same for our IGP routing protocols as well, the traffic is not going to be load

31
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.910
balanced the round robin for the same flow. Meaning, if you've got one particular source host that's talking

32
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.070
to a web server, for example, its traffic for that one flow is not going to go through the first packet,

33
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.960
R1, the second packet, R2, the third packet, R3, and so on. If it gets a load balance to R1,

34
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:40.120
all traffic for a single flow will go through the same router, R1, for our example. But if you've

35
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.110
got a different source host talking to maybe a different destination, that will be load balanced

36
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.170
onto a different link. So the same flow always goes through the same router, but different flows will get load

37
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.520
balanced through the different routers.

38
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.520
The reason it does this, is we don't want packets for the same flow going over different paths because

39
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.270
what could cause the packets to arrive out of order if there's is a longer delay on one path than there is on the other.

40
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.160
And that can cause some applications to fail.

41
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.870
So single flow always goes over the same path.

42
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.079
Okay, so that was our Equal Cost Multi Path.

43
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.320
In the next lecture, we'll have a look at a lab example.
