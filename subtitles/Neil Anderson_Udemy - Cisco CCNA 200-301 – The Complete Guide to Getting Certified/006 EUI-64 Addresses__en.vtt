00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:17.040
In this lecture, you'll learn about EUI-64 addresses. Rather than manually configuring the full IPv6

2
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.820
address on a regular interface, it can generate the full IPv6 address for itself,

3
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:33.570
if you enter the interface that you want to do this on and the /64 network prefix that is to be used. The

4
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.970
host portion of the address will then be derived from the interface's

5
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.410
MAC address. And the MAC address is always guaranteed to be globally unique.

6
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:53.360
But a MAC address is 48 bits long and the host portion of an IPv6 address is 64 bits long so

7
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.240
to derive the host portion of the IPv6 address from the MAC address,

8
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.870
we need to make the MAC address the longer. We need to extend it from 48 to 64 bits.

9
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.230
The way that that is done is FF:FE is injected into the middle of it.

10
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.520
Also, the 7th bit is inverted. So looking at an example with our network here,

11
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.380
let's say that we haven't configured any IPv6 addresses anywhere.

12
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.310
And for an example, we're going to use the EUI-64 addresses on R1.

13
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.110
So on R1, we're going to go on to the fa0/0 interface and say that network prefix

14
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.370
there is 2001:DB8:0:1::/64 and tell the router to generate

15
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.380
an EUI-64 addres. It will then automatically generate an address for itself on that interface with

16
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.810
the correct network portion of the address.

17
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.650
And in the second half of the address, the host portion will be derived from the MAC address.

18
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.900
So in the example here, we're not going to use one at the end.

19
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.980
We're going to just have it automatically generated from the MAC address.

20
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.810
We'll also do that on interface fa2/0 as well, which is on the

21
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.640
2001:DB8:0:0::/64 network.

22
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.220
So looking at the commands, we go on to interface fa0/0 on R1 and we say IPv6 address

23
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:42.330
2001:DB8:0:1::/64. So that's the network portion of the address

24
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.220
that is going to be on the interface. And a space, and then we say EUI-64. And for interface fa2/0,

25
00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:01.620
IPv6 Address 2001:DB8:0::/64 EUI-64. And the router will now generate IPv6 addresses

26
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.680
for itself on those interfaces. To check that it is working as expected,

27
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.280
we'll first of all, check the MAC address that was on those interfaces.

28
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.740
So with interface fa0/0, and we can see that the MAC address there is

29
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.780
CA01.2F24.0000.

30
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:32.010
If we then do a show ipv6 interface brief, I can see that the address on fa0/0 is

31
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.050
2001:DB8:0:1, which was the network portion of the address that we configured.

32
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.740
And when it's automatically configured the host portion derived from the MAC address, so that is C8,

33
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.080
because the 7th bit is inverted.

34
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:56.400
So it makes it C8 rather than CA and then 01, and then 2F, then the FFFE is injected,

35
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.470
and then 24:0.

36
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.250
You can see that it derived it from the MAC address and the same thing happened for interface

37
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.810
fa2/0 as well.

38
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.260
So that's how the EUI-64 addresses work.

39
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.329
If you configure this on a non Ethernet interface in the router like a serial interface, it will borrow

40
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.800
the MAC address from the first Ethernet port. And it's not recommended to do this.

41
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.220
Do not use EUI-64 addresses on your router interfaces, because if we look at the lab topology diagram here,

42
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.570
here is where we have configured manual address. So you can see

43
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.510
that R1 is using :1 at the end of its addresses. R2 is using :2.

44
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.420
This is going to make things much more logical and much easier for troubleshooting.

45
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:58.020
You don't want your routers to have random IP addresses, which is what's going to happen if you use

46
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.760
the EUI-64 addresses.

47
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.130
So if you're thinking, well, why tell us about EUI-64 if it's never used anyway?

48
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.530
It is useful is for your end hosts. If you've got an end host like a normal desktop PC that is going

49
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.610
to be running IPv6, you don't want to have to configure IPv6 addresses on every single end host.

50
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:30.080
So we can use DHCP for that like we do in IPv4 or we can use a feature called SLAAC which automatically

51
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.630
generates the address on the interface.

52
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.010
And we're going to cover that

53
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.840
in a lot more detail in a later lecture in this section.

54
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.240
OK, but for now, let's see how it configured it

55
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:51.080
on a Cisco router. So in the earlier lab demo, we configured the interfaces on the the link between R1

56
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:59.300
and R2. Let's now configure the interfaces between R2 and R3.

57
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.050
So on fa1/0 on R2 and on fa1/9 on R3, I will configure them with

58
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:13.120
an IPv6 address, but I'll use the EUI-64 rather than using a manually defined address.

59
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.700
So let's jump onto the lab.

60
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:25.760
I'm on R2 here. And if I do a show ipv6 interface brief, you see that.

61
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.900
OK, I've removed all of the IPv6 addresses for now.

62
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.780
That's fine.

63
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.310
We'll just do the interface facing towards R3 for now.

64
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:44.390
So I'll go to global configuration, make sure that IPv6 unicast routing is enabled and the subnet

65
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.230
on here is.. I'm speaking about in my diagram. I need to go to the interface first actually.

66
00:06:50.270 --> 00:07:00.020
So let's go interface fa1/0 and it's IPv6 address 2001:DB8:0:2,

67
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.280
is the subnet ongoing link between R2 and R3.

68
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:13.300
Normally, I would put in the manually defined full IPv6 address here, but I'll use the EUI-64 here.

69
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.850
So at this point I'll say ::/64.

70
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:25.790
That is the network portion of the address on this link and then a space, and then EUI-64 and the

71
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:35.030
address will be automatically generated for me. And then I'll do a no shutdown on here and now if I

72
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.100
do a show interface fa1/0,

73
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:56.030
you can see there is the MAC address and if I now do a show ipv6 interface brief, then there is the

74
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:04.520
automatically generated EUI-64 address, which is based on the MAC address that is on that interface.

75
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.910
OK, I don't actually need to show you. You know that I could do the same thing over on the other side on R3

76
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.510
as well.

77
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.120
And then I would be able ping, I would have connectivity between R2 and R3.

78
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:23.900
But if I went on R3 and I wanted to ping R2, I would have to ping it by this great big, long

79
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.890
address here.

80
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.350
So don't use the EUI-64 addresses on your routers.

81
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.820
It would be much better to use the manually defined address

82
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.770
2001:DB8:0:2::1 or ::2.

83
00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.080
It's much more memorable and it's easier for troubleshooting.

84
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.120
OK, so that was the EUI-64.

85
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.620
You will see more of it when we get to that SLAAC lesson coming up later in this section.
