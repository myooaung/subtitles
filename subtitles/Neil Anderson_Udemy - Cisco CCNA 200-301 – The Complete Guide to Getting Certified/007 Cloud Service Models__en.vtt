00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.210
In this lecture, you'll learn about the cloud service models, the NIST define free service models

2
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.970
of how cloud services can be offered.

3
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.290
In the same document that I was talking about earlier when we were talking about the cloud characteristics.

4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.520
So the three service models are IATSE, which is infrastructure as a service, Piast, which is platform

5
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.200
as a service, and Asheesh, which is software as a service.

6
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
And I'll cover what the three of them are and how they differ from each other.

7
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.550
In Mwencha, large cloud service providers will offer multiple models, not just one.

8
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.740
Small providers might specialize in just one just offer up.

9
00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.240
But large providers like Amazon Web Services and IBM, Accenture will offer all three.

10
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.040
The three models define where the customer and provider areas of responsibility are and at what level

11
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.490
the customer gains access and the three models build on top of one another, you'll see how that works.

12
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:25.670
We see the sites tool for figuring out where the customer and provider responsibility is.

13
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580
We need to understand what the different levels are first.

14
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.660
So let's look at the data center stock down at the bottom.

15
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.640
We've got the actual facility, which is the building, the power and the cooling and security staff,

16
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.240
et cetera.

17
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.440
On top of that, we've got the network infrastructure hardware.

18
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.700
Then we've got the storage, infrastructure, hardware, the computer hardware, which is the physical

19
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.360
servers.

20
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.530
Then we've got the hypervisor, which is the software that runs on top of most physical servers.

21
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.940
On top of the hypervisor, we've got the virtual machine operating systems, then we've got the applications

22
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.560
and then finally we've got the data.

23
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:18.170
So where is the bill, the line of where is the provider responsibility and where is the customer responsibility?

24
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.550
Well, if you've got your own on premises solution, obviously his new provider is just you see you

25
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.890
looking it from the point of view of your customer.

26
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.060
You're going to be managing everything obviously within on premises solution.

27
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.980
And that's not a cloud solution.

28
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.160
Cool new solution.

29
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:47.240
The provider is going to provide the facility and there's going to be a bit of a mix between whose responsibility

30
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.980
it is for the network where the provider is going to provide incoming network connections.

31
00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.300
You'll have your own network infrastructure equipment in there, you'll have your own firewalls, etc..

32
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.370
So some of that is the provider, some of it is you.

33
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.360
Everything on top of the facility and the network is going to be your responsibility.

34
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.100
So with on premises and cool solutions, you buy and maintain all of your infrastructure hardware.

35
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.240
You buy that as an upfront capex cost again on premises.

36
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.640
And Coolmore are not cloud solutions.

37
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.540
You look at the cloud solutions and infrastructure as a service offering.

38
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.090
With this, the provider is providing the facility.

39
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.880
They're providing all of the underlying hardware infrastructure as well.

40
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.090
So the network infrastructure, all the years, all of his switches is going to be provided, owned

41
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.800
and managed by the provider.

42
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.080
The same for the storage infrastructure and the computer hardware as well.

43
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:05.540
The hypervisor will also be owned and maintained by the service provider.

44
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.540
Now, there can be a bit of a gray area here.

45
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.790
It is possible with some providers that you can install and manage your own hypervisor.

46
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.630
As far as this Shishani exam is concerned, if you get a question about this, then the hypervisor is

47
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.080
the provider responsibility, everything on top of the hypervisor.

48
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.740
So the operating system, the applications and the data is going to be installed and managed by the

49
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.100
customer and the customer gets access to the operating system level.

50
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.110
So let's see how this works.

51
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.680
I'll go back onto Amazon Web Services.

52
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.670
You remember from the earlier lecture in this section where I showed you how to provision a new virtual

53
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.080
machine.

54
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.720
Now let's look at how I would actually access via virtual machine once it is up and running.

55
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.450
So I can see here's my instance here.

56
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.160
I can click on the connect button and from in there I can get the connection information, including

57
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.690
a remote desktop file.

58
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.010
So I've already downloaded to my downloads folder.

59
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:27.860
So I'll go there now and I'll open up this connection to my virtual machine and my password in there.

60
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.590
And it's going to open up this deep connection and you're going to see that I'm going to get in to the

61
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:43.840
desktop on this window server 2012 virtual machine that I provisioned earlier on.

62
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.930
What I can do now is I can go and install my own applications.

63
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.640
I can save my own data on here.

64
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.230
I can configure the server.

65
00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:01.240
However, I want it to be configured to deal with IAEA as the provider is providing the underlying infrastructure.

66
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.560
That's why it's called infrastructure.

67
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.280
As a service, I get in the desktop web with the operating system and I can configure and manage everything

68
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.480
upwards from there.

69
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.060
OK, let's go back onto the swines.

70
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:26.280
So the next one to cover is platform as a service, which goes up one level, too, if we go back inside,

71
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.300
slide with infrastructure as a service customer gets in the operating system, Wambo and its operating

72
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.960
system level and above, which is managed by the customer with platform as a service, the operating

73
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.800
system is managed by the provider and it's the applications and they are managed by the customer.

74
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.420
This doesn't really tell the whole story through.

75
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.490
So this site here, if you got anything on the exam, this is how your platform as a service works.

76
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.890
But it's easier if we look at it like this.

77
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:08.790
So with platform as a service, it's typically used for developing software and the provider will provide

78
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:15.960
a custom environment that it makes it easy for your developers to develop software in there.

79
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.910
So all of the underlying infrastructure is managed by the provider.

80
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.010
As a customer, you don't see that at all.

81
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.740
OK, so the operating system is managed by the provider.

82
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.790
You get in a custom environment and label, which is purpose built for building applications.

83
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.920
You can build your applications on there and then you can manage.

84
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.490
You're doing the as the customer.

85
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.470
So let's have a look at an example of that.

86
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.910
And I will go back to my Web browser and scan another tab at IBM here.

87
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.560
And you can see the IBM also offer infrastructure as a service offerings.

88
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.840
One way that they differentiate from us is we don't just offer virtual servers.

89
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.780
They offer Bermel dedicated servers as well.

90
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:09.540
If you look further down at the bulimics platform offerings vs our platform as a service to the cloud

91
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:17.520
foundry ops, you see that you can get into this purpose built environment for Python, for Ruby, etc.,

92
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.760
and you can develop your own applications in there, a benefit you can get from this.

93
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.830
If we look back at that ecommerce application we've been using throughout this section, let's say that

94
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.039
you need to develop that e-commerce application.

95
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.980
Well, if you use platform as a service, usually it's going to have plug ins there that you can pool

96
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:43.909
into your own application like plug ins for e like payment systems and things like that.

97
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:50.250
So rather than you having to write the entire code from scratch, you get this custom environment and

98
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:56.880
you can pull pieces of code in to build your own applications and it accelerates the process of doing

99
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.130
so.

100
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.900
So that is platform as a service of the three types.

101
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.180
Platform as a service is probably the least well known and the least used to it.

102
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.690
We've covered IATSE on PBS.

103
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:14.430
That leaves the last one, which is software as a service.

104
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:22.290
With software as a service, this is really the opposite of on premises where the provider is managing

105
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.260
everything provider manages all the way from the facility, all the way up to the data.

106
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:37.340
An example of software as a service would be something like Microsoft Office 365.

107
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.220
So, you know, you can install office programs like Word and Excel on your own laptop and run it from

108
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:44.520
there.

109
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.860
You can also run it in the cloud as well.

110
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:52.410
So rather than installing anything in your laptop, you can connect over your interconnect Internet

111
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:58.830
connection through a Web browser and you can mine you can access all of your office applications from

112
00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.090
there.

113
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:05.560
Other examples of software as a service would be Salesforce.com, things like that.

114
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:12.540
It's where you access software directly from a web portal rather than having to install and manage it

115
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.170
yourself.

116
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:23.790
OK, so those were the different cloud offerings and you get access at the application level with software

117
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.280
as a service, right.

118
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.920
For this lecture.

119
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.070
So see you in the next one for some more cloud.
