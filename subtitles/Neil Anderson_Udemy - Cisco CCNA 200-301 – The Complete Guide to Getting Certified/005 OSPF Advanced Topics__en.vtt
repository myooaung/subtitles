00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.280
In this lecture, you'll learn about the advanced OSPF topics of the router ID,

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.840
how to configure passive interfaces, and default injection.

3
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.510
So, we'll start off with the router ID.

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.150
This is very similar to how the router ID work for EIGRP as well. So our OSPF routers identify

5
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.550
themselves to other OSPF routers using an OSPF router ID, which is in the form of an IPv4 address.

6
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.470
It defaults to using the highest IP address of any loopback interfaces configured on the router, or if there's

7
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.190
no loopback interfaces,

8
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.220
it will use the highest other IP address. Loopback interfaces

9
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.630
never go down, so the router ID will not change if you use a loopback.

10
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.570
You can also manually specify the router ID.

11
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.100
Best practice is to use a loopback or manually set an ID, so it won't change, makes things more stable

12
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.050
by doing that.

13
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.100
So if you haven't used or you haven't configured a loopback address on your router, you can

14
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.790
see an example here on R1, I've done a 'show ip interface brief'.

15
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.010
There's no loopbacks configured there.

16
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.260
The highest IP address is 10.0.3.1, which is on interface FastEthernet3/0, so that will be

17
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.730
selected as the router ID. We can verify that by using the 'show ip protocols' command.

18
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.890
So we do that, and we can see that, yes, the router ID is 10.0.3.1.

19
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.640
Next example, we just 'show ip interface brief' and this time, we do have a loopback interface.

20
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.210
We've got Loopback0 with IP address 1.1.1.1.

21
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.860
So even though it's lower than the physical address is, because it's a loopback, this is going to be preferred

22
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.660
as the router ID.

23
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.630
Again, we can verify that with the 'show protocols' command.

24
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.789
Now, if you've got a router and you've just got physical IP addresses on there, and you've already got OSPF

25
00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.460
configured, and then, you configure a loopback afterwards,

26
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.120
it's not going to immediately update the router ID. To change to the loopback,

27
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.070
you would need to restart the OSPF process by rebooting the router or by shutting down and then restarting OSPF.

28
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.670
Obviously, in a production environment,

29
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.530
you would just wait until the next reboot because disabling and re-enabling OSPF would be disruptive.

30
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:46.030
The command if you want to manually configure it is under the 'router ospf' configuration, 'router-id', and

31
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.160
then the ID that you want to use, in the format of an IP version 4 (IPv4) address. The address that you use

32
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.490
doesn't have to actually be configured on the router. You could just make up a new address.

33
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.790
However, it's more logical and easier for troubleshooting if you do use an IP address that is actually

34
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.200
configured on the router.

35
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.920
Okay, so that was the router ID.

36
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.760
Next up is passive interfaces. If you configure a passive interface, it will be advertised in OSPF. So other

37
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.940
routers will learn how to get to that network,

38
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.710
but the interface itself will not try to form any adjacencies, and it won't give out any internal information.

39
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.440
You see in our example here, we've got router R1, which has got a loopback interface

40
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.130
and on interface FastEthernet2/0,

41
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.000
it's connected to R6, which in our example, belongs to another organization. So, it's best practice

42
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.090
to configure your loopbacks as passive interfaces.

43
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.650
They're not physical interfaces, so there can't be a physical router on the other end of the link to

44
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.180
form an adjacency with.

45
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.980
So, it's more efficient. Rather than sending out OSPF information, we'll make it a passive interface.

46
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.160
Now, we have to include it as a passive interface, so that your other routers will learn how to get to

47
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.950
that loopback address, and we're also going to make FastEthernet2/0 a passive interface.

48
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.740
Again, we want our other internal routers to know how to get to that network, but we don't want to be giving out

49
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.060
any of our own internal information

50
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.110
out on that link. That would be a security issue. So to configure this, we say 'router ospf 1' at global config, 

51
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.970
and then under the OSPF configuration, 'passive-interface loopback 0'

52
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.930
and 'passive-interface FastEthernet2/0'.

53
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:48.490
If more of your interfaces are passive rather than active interfaces, then you can set passive interface

54
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.790
as the default. So here, this configuration is going to do exactly the same as we did on the previous slide.

55
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.710
We say 'router ospf 1' on router R1, and then 'passive-interface default', which will make all

56
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.020
our interfaces passive.

57
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.190
Then, we say 'no passive-interface FastEthernet0/0', 'no passive-interface FastEthernet1/0',

58
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:18.000
and 'no passive-interface FastEthernet3/0', so that the router will form adjacencies on those links.

59
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.420
So, that was our passive interfaces.

60
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.090
Last thing to cover is

61
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.090
default route injection,

62
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.310
and this is configured in a similar way as what it was for RIP.

63
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.190
So the example here, we've got R4 is connected out to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), so we configure

64
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.840
a static default route on R4 with the command

65
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.910
'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0',

66
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.770
and the next hop address of '203.0.113.2'.

67
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.970
We don't want to have to configure static routes to get out to the Internet on all of our routers,

68
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.160
we want them to learn that dynamically,

69
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.130
so we're going to inject it into the OSPF process on router R4. The command to do that is 'router ospf 1',

70
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.630
and then, 'default-information originate'.

71
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:16.090
It look for a default route on the router, and it will inject that into OSPF. To verify it,

72
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:24.620
do a 'show ip route' on your other routers, and check that they do have a default route to the 0.0.0.0

73
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.720
network.

74
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.960
This will show up as an external route in OSPF.

75
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.510
What an external route is,

76
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.670
it doesn't mean it's come from somewhere outside your organization.

77
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:43.300
What it means is that the route was redistributed into OSPF. What redistribution is is when we take a

78
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.400
route from another source, like another routing protocol

79
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.020
or it could be a static route,

80
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.820
and we inject that into OSPF. Okay, so again, external does not mean it's outside.

81
00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:03.220
It literally means it was redistributed into OSPF. So this was a default static route that we've redistributed

82
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:09.650
into OSPF, so it shows up as an external route when you view the routing table.

83
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.950
Okay.

84
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.420
So that was our advanced topics.

85
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.500
Next lecture,

86
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.740
we'll configure it on the lab.
