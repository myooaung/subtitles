00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.560
In this lecture, you'll learn about user names and privilege levels.

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:19.590
Start off by recapping what we covered earlier and was sanctioned by line level passwords to with line

3
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.690
level secure to all administrators and login with the same password you see in our config.

4
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:33.460
Here I've got my console zero password flat box one and I see a login so that whenever anybody accesses

5
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.600
over a console, they have to enter password and in line with zero 15 for Battalino access password

6
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
flat box one and log in there as well.

7
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:51.040
So right now, whenever any administrator wants to configure the device, they all login with the same

8
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.160
password, which is blackbox one.

9
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.420
More granular security can be provided by configuring individual usernames and passwords for all of

10
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.030
your different administrators.

11
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.680
So rather than having them all in log in with the same password, we're going to get your own username

12
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.280
and password and then we can give them different levels of access when we do that to the config for

13
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.130
this is a username we've got admin one secret is flat one and username admin two, secret black box

14
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.870
to obviously and a real world environment.

15
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.430
You're not going to give them all a password, a flat box, one flat box two.

16
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.690
You're going to have something a bit more different and not then the line we've got line console, zero

17
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.370
log login local.

18
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.810
When we just say log in, it means use the password that is configured the line level.

19
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.180
When we see a log in local, it means using local usernames.

20
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.360
If we had a password configured on the console now because we've said log in, local password in the

21
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.880
console would be ignored, log in local means, use the local usernames and then we all should do it

22
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.920
for our telnet lines as well.

23
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.200
So we've got language 015.

24
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.060
We're also seeing log in.

25
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.270
We'll call there as well.

26
00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.070
So now whenever an administrator goes to log in, they need to enter their username and password.

27
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.740
Notice here as well, the username admin one secret blackbox one because we said secret.

28
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.870
The password is going to be encrypted.

29
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.420
When you do a short run, you can also use username, admin one, password, blackbox one.

30
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.930
But that's the old version of the command that is not encrypted.

31
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.350
So unless you don't a really old or use your command username.

32
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.110
I've been working on secret Roggeveen password.

33
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.670
OK, when you have configured this, if we go to telnet onto that device, we will get a prompt rather

34
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.830
than just asking for a password now and now it's going to first off ask us for the username and then

35
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.110
we have to enter the valid password as well.

36
00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.110
When we do enter a valid username and password, we're going to get to the user prompt by default.

37
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.920
OK, next thing to talk about is privilege levels and verse 16 privileged levels available on your ears

38
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:19.120
and switches going from level zero up to level 15, you can assign a username, a particular privilege

39
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.690
level.

40
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.900
The default level is one.

41
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.460
If you go back a slide with our usernames here because we haven't specified a privilege label Bouvard

42
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.470
one one in admin two are getting level one by default.

43
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.290
You can also configure different passwords for direct access to the different privilege levels.

44
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.580
You'll see what that means when we do the example we are on.

45
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.140
Each available command in Iaw can be assigned a privilege level and an administrator must be logged

46
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.920
in with that privilege level or higher to run the command.

47
00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.900
So you can specify C we take out particular command, we can give it privileged level five for any administrator

48
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.000
to be able to run, not command.

49
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.020
They need to be logged in with a privileged level of five or higher.

50
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.790
By default, only three of the 16 privilege levels are used, the levels that are used are zero user

51
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.880
and privileged, and all commands are at one of those three levels by default.

52
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.760
Zero level access allows only five commands logout, enable, disable, help and exit, so zero level,

53
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.190
basically you can get that or you can get out of it either, but you can't do it on any commands.

54
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.250
We are very limited.

55
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.800
Use our level.

56
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.180
Level one provides very limited read-only access to the rotor.

57
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.730
And when you enter user exact mode, you're at privileged level one by default chiuso before it.

58
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.630
And all the earlier lectures when we login are we get in the user by default and there is a limited

59
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.400
set of commands.

60
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.150
So that's because you're on level one.

61
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.830
When you do that privileged level, level 15 provides complete control over it, or you can run all

62
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.130
commands when you're logged in with privilege level 15 and when you enter privileged exact mode with

63
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.380
the enable command, you're at level 15 by default.

64
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.030
So again, you when the login we get and the user level and we've got level one commands, we can run

65
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.450
there.

66
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.710
Then when we enter the enable command, we get elevated up to a level 15 and we can run all commands.

67
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.920
So far, our configuration here, I've said username Aardman one secret black box one, and then username

68
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.720
admin to privilege 15, secret black box two, because we didn't specify a privileged level for admin

69
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.110
one.

70
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.600
When they log in, you're going to be at level one admin to we've specified privilege 15.

71
00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.290
So when they log in, we're going to be immediately at privilege level 15 and then line constant zero

72
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.000
and zero 15.

73
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.840
We've got the login local command again to the effect of this is going to be if the username admin one

74
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.960
logs in like you see here, the log in that server username and password and then you'll see the user

75
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.600
prompt are one and the great Irvan symbol.

76
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.260
If you just sure.

77
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.500
Privileged we can see their current privileged level is one.

78
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.630
But if admin two logs in the one that we'd configured privileged level 15 for as soon as we enter a

79
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:37.740
username and password known, the prompt shows are one hash they immediately get in the enable prompt

80
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.440
because they had privileged level 15 so they don't have to go.

81
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.670
The prompt, inane and or the enable command were already logged in with level 15 because we thought

82
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.500
the username level and if you do actual privilege, will see our current privilege level is 15.

83
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.550
OK, let's take this on a stage.

84
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.360
And the easiest way to explain this is by giving you an example that will work through Zuheir.

85
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.170
I've configured username admin one secret flat box one no privilege level specified service.

86
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:18.300
Get privilege over one username admin to privilege 15 secret Firefox two and username admin free privilege

87
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.870
five.

88
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.700
Secret flat box three.

89
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.000
Seweryn admin one logs in the privileged level one.

90
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.640
Admin two is at level fifteen.

91
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.610
An admin three is level five.

92
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:39.390
Now if I tell it to the device as admin one and enter my password school back admin one was privileged.

93
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:45.120
Level one they do a show IP interface brief that is a level one command.

94
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.600
So that command will be accepted and the command will run.

95
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:56.250
But then if that user tries to do a show run, which is a level fifteen command Bergonzi, it's invalid

96
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.810
input.

97
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.320
So the order master doesn't say you're not allowed to run, not command, you're not high enough privilege

98
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.710
level.

99
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.300
It just gives an error message.

100
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.830
Waqas is an invalid command.

101
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:13.790
If Aardman three logs and they come in at level five and right now there wasn't really any point of

102
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:20.230
doing this because all commands at at level 15, level one or level zero by default.

103
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.400
So admin three has got level five, but they really haven't got any more rights, an admin one right

104
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.760
now because we haven't set any commands to run at level five.

105
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:34.760
So admin three, they can do our IP interface brief on level one, command their level five.

106
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.110
So that will work just fine.

107
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.450
But they try to do a show run that's level 15, that when we're at level five, they're going to get

108
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.409
the error message.

109
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:49.820
If admin two logs in which that privilege level 15 for them, so soon as they log in, they get the

110
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.950
enable prompt for running at level 15 and they can run all commands, including.

111
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.880
Sure, run.

112
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:03.700
OK, so next thing will do is we will actually make some use of having that privilege Level five, so

113
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.830
we enter the command privilege exec level five.

114
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.370
Sure.

115
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.420
Running config.

116
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:16.100
This means that we're changing the shortening config command from a privileged level of 15 to a privileged

117
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.300
level of five.

118
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.590
So now anybody logged in with level five is going to be able to run this command.

119
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.190
We then log out and log back in as admin one.

120
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.170
They try to do a short run.

121
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.810
It's going to fail because we are running at level one.

122
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:38.690
But now when admin free and or second, they can do a short they're logged in at level five through

123
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.600
the command will work now.

124
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:49.010
But if they try to do a configure terminal, a config T that fails because config T is still on level

125
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.130
15 command.

126
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.940
So what we've done is we've given them some additional commands that they can run, which was show run,

127
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.550
but still not a fuel level administrator.

128
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.200
So they can't make any changes.

129
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:11.600
One thing to show you here is about how we can also set the password for a privilege level directly

130
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.350
to that level.

131
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:20.990
See here, when we do enable one, if you don't spend Shefi a privilege level, when you set mineable

132
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.600
secret, it defaults to your setting the password for privilege level 15.

133
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.460
Then we add an additional command and secret level five secret, too.

134
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:39.290
So now if somebody types AN�BAL and then they put in password secret one, they've got a level 15 access.

135
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.280
But if somebody enters a command enabled five to get in at level five and level five password, they've

136
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.690
got level five access.

137
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:55.930
So you can see here right now, I'm logged in as admin one, which is a level one administrator.

138
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:01.970
I do a show run, which is level five, and they can't run it because we're currently at level one.

139
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:10.880
But if a user knows the level five and password they can see enable five, meaning log in at level five,

140
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.160
they level five password.

141
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:20.000
I know they can do a short run, but if they enter config T, they wouldn't be able to make any changes.
