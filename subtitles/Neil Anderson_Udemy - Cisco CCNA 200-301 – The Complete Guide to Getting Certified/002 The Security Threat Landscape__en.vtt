00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.940
In this lecture, you'll learn about the general I.T. security threat landscape and the difference between

2
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.850
script kiddies and targeted attacks.

3
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.100
We'll start off with some terminology.

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.510
First up, a threat, a threat has the potential to cause harm to an I.T. asset.

5
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.250
So if you're under attack by a hacker and they're using a particular tool to attack you, then that

6
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.360
would be a threat.

7
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.620
A vulnerability is a weakness if it compromises with security or functionality of a system.

8
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.270
So if you're running and if the version of Windows, for example, which doesn't have up to the security

9
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.040
patches, then that would be a vulnerable system and exploit users a weakness to compromise with security

10
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.070
or functionality of a system.

11
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.630
So using the old version of Windows, again as the example, it's got a vulnerability because the software

12
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.530
is out of date.

13
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.070
It's the exploit which the attacker can use which exploits that particular vulnerability.

14
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.600
A risk is the likelihood of a successful attack.

15
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.820
So how likely is it that an attack is going to happen?

16
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.350
You also want to factor in what would be the impact if you became a victim of an attack as well.

17
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:43.350
And finally, mitigation is techniques to eliminate or reduce the potential of unseriousness of an attack

18
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.990
to.

19
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.380
So with the general security threat landscape, it's a constant battle between you and the hacker.

20
00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.500
The hacker is always going to be developing new tools, looking for new vulnerabilities and exploits.

21
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:10.530
And it's up to you to ensure that your mitigation techniques and solutions are up to date to protect

22
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.410
against those vulnerabilities and exploit.

23
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.480
Next thing is malware and malware is any malicious software.

24
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.990
This includes viruses.

25
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.210
A virus is software which inserts itself into other software and can spread from computer to computer.

26
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.150
Virus requires human action to spread.

27
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:44.530
So, for example, maybe you download a software program from the Internet from somewhere where you

28
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.200
shouldn't do and it's got a virus on there.

29
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.370
Well, you've now infected your PC.

30
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.190
If you then copy the executable program onto a USB stick and share it with somebody else and then they

31
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.500
run it, then they are now infected to to a virus.

32
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.150
It spreads from computer to computer, but it requires human interaction to do that.

33
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.020
For example, emailing it to somebody else or sharing it on a USB stick.

34
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:19.690
Worms are self-propagating viruses that can replicate by themselves so they don't require human action

35
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.370
to spread.

36
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:31.000
For example, maybe you are running a database on one of your species and when it gets infected, it's

37
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.070
able to connect.

38
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.800
I look for other systems that are running the database and infect them as well.

39
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.850
So once you're infected in the first place, if you're infected with a worm, if you've got other software,

40
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.090
the susceptible worm, it can spread itself out because of our systems as long as it's called network

41
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.530
connectivity to do so.

42
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.710
Next up is a Trojan horse, and this is named after the old story of the horse of Troy, which you probably

43
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.450
know about where the city of Troy was under siege, but the attackers weren't able to get in.

44
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.600
So what they did was they built a big wooden horse and then they hid some soldiers in there and they

45
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.490
left the outside as an offering.

46
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.209
And then the people inside the city pulled into wooden horse.

47
00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.890
And then that night, soldiers all jumped out and the city became overrun.

48
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.100
So a Trojan horse is something that looks nice on the outside, but it's actually got a nasty surprise

49
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.150
on the inside.

50
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.900
And when we're talking about Trojan horses with malware, this is malicious software which looks legitimate

51
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.210
to trick humans into triggering it.

52
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.700
And this often installs back doors.

53
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.060
So what can happen with a Trojan horse is maybe you're a gamer and you're browsing around on the Internet

54
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.870
and you land on a page which tells you click here and you will get free passwords to get into all the

55
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.600
best games.

56
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.540
So it looks nice on the outside.

57
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.090
You then double click or not, maybe it does have passwords there, or maybe it just gives you an error

58
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.600
message.

59
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.720
But because you've double clicked on, not executable file, unbeknown to you, the Trojan horse has

60
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.050
delivered its payload.

61
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.900
What about payload will often be is installing backdoor software on your PC, which allows the attacker

62
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.180
to take control of it or to see information on it later on.

63
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.650
Finally on here, the last type of malware I want to cover is ransomware, ransomware.

64
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.760
Encrypt your data with the attackers key and ask you, the victim, to pay a ransom to obtain the key

65
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.620
to what happens as a gang.

66
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.970
You are going to figure this ransomware on your PC as soon as you do that, encrypt all of the data

67
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.800
on your PC.

68
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.570
And what the attacker can do is later on walk you out from having access to your own data.

69
00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.880
The only way that you can get access back into that is by paying them a ransom, at which time they

70
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.930
will give you the key.

71
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.970
So you can get into that data.

72
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.740
Really a way that you can guard against ransomware is by making sure that you have got backups of your

73
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.400
PC.

74
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.360
And then if you do fall victim to this, you can just roll back to the last good backup.

75
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.800
Obviously, it's best not to be a victim of ransomware in the first place.

76
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.760
And I'll talk about the mitigation techniques against malware and everything else that I'm going to

77
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.750
cover and Mwencha intellectual later on in the section.

78
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:45.780
Hacking tools, many hacking tools that are available for the hacker they can use to attack your systems,

79
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:52.460
penetration testers who are the good guys use the same tools as hackers to test for vulnerabilities.

80
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:59.610
So the way that you can guard against cash if you've got vulnerabilities and see what the impact is,

81
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.490
is you have to do exactly the same thing as the hackers would do.

82
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.150
So you're going to be using the same tools.

83
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.710
Penetration Tester is actually our job tools.

84
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.570
If you're a penetration tester, it's your job to try to hack into companies.

85
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.140
And if you find a way to do so, you let the company know about that so they can then go and protect

86
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.680
against that vulnerability.

87
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:32.260
Hacking tools typically run on Linux, with Carly Lennix being a preferred flavor for doing this.

88
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.500
Tools include password cracking tools with a password cracking tool.

89
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:45.000
If the attacker is able to see a login page, you can use the tool to try to automate the gashing of

90
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.780
passwords.

91
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.660
Other tools include sniffers.

92
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:55.920
So if the attacker is able to see your data going across the network, they can use a sniffer to see

93
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.630
the contents of that data so they can see the information that is in there.

94
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.510
A ping sweeper is used for doing reconnaissance against a target.

95
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:13.380
What a ping sweeper does is it pings a range of IP addresses to see if there is a response.

96
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.660
At first, a response or not means that there's a system there and the attacker can then dig deeper

97
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.410
to see if that system has any vulnerabilities.

98
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.630
A tool that they can use to discover vulnerabilities is part and vulnerability scanners.

99
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.929
So typically the attacker will do a ping sweep first, find out what systems are alive, and will then

100
00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:39.450
dig deeper by using part and vulnerability scanners to see what parts are open on those systems.

101
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.940
And also if there's any known vulnerabilities, for example, if the systems have of the software.

102
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:55.820
But leads me on to Kiddie's after talking about the hacking tools to script kiddies is well-known and

103
00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:03.320
derogatory term for low skilled attackers who download and use off the shelf hocking software to launch

104
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.760
exploits to.

105
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.340
These are general hobbyists.

106
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.530
And they've just done some playing around on the Internet with we've found some hacking sites there,

107
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.260
which has got software that they can download.

108
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.180
Often this hacking software requires very little skill use.

109
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:27.200
The attacker can just point to a particular range of public IP addresses and see if you're able to do

110
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.190
any damage.

111
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:34.280
Script kiddie somebody that uses just off the shelf hacking software doesn't really have very high level

112
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:41.240
skills themselves that result these people out there, they will typically attempt to exploit any vulnerable

113
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.120
host that they can connect to.

114
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.710
So they're not generally doing targeted attacks against a particular organization.

115
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.710
Often they're just trying to attack anybody out there who's vulnerable to the particular attack.

116
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.630
More skilled attackers will also look for random victims as well.

117
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:05.320
So in order to meet their goals, such as installing ransomware or a botnet.

118
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.990
I'll talk about what a botnet is later in this lecture.

119
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.160
And organizations are constantly under these types of attacks.

120
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:20.420
So what this means is if you are working for an organization and your organization is connected to the

121
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:27.350
Internet, for sure, you are constantly being bombarded by attacks unremembered.

122
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:35.390
Years and years ago, the first time I broke it in my first I.T. job and one of my rules there was looking

123
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.850
after the companies firewall because basically I was I.T. guy looking after everything.

124
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:47.390
And the first time I looked in the logs in the firewall, I was thinking, wow, panicking, we're under

125
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:47.960
attack.

126
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.340
And I quickly found out that that is just the normal state of affairs.

127
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.810
That was just a small company that I was working for.

128
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.500
They're highly unlikely that anybody would target them for a particular attack.

129
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:06.710
But first of these, just general random attacks happening against everybody all the time.

130
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.560
So because of this, even if you think that you're not going to be the victim of a targeted attack,

131
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:19.160
you still need to make sure that you are protected against attacks because we're going to happen against

132
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.700
you anyway.

133
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.660
So with these targeted attacks, this is where it is directed against a particular individual or organization,

134
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:35.860
and this type of attack is rare, skilled attackers who are doing a targeted attack will typically start

135
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.710
off with very stealthy and low impact reconnaissance, which is very hard to detect by you.

136
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.310
And then they will systematically escalate the attack from there.

137
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:52.900
So they start off by being very unobtrusive, very stealthy, and they will go through steps with a

138
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.070
system that they have.

139
00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:00.940
Each one is intended to get more access to your systems, which allows them to have more damage.

140
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.070
And it's going to be more and more obtrusive as we go through that system.

141
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:14.720
So this is the evolution of a targeted attack, the attacker will typically start off by doing external

142
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:22.400
reconnaissance, Google searches and things like that, and then they will be becoming more obtrusive

143
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.490
as they go along, trying to get further and further in your systems until they make an initial compromise

144
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.310
so they get access to one of your systems.

145
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.060
At this point, they will then escalate their privileges.

146
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:41.000
So usually the attacker will start off by going for the low hanging fruit if they can see any system

147
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.060
that they can access easily, even if it's got very little access to the other corporate systems behind

148
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.970
there, then they will compromise that system first.

149
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:57.170
They will then try to get higher level privileges on that system, which will for them, hopefully allow

150
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:02.870
them to get access to Furber systems from there to external reconnaissance first, then the initial

151
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.470
compromise, then escalation of privileges or not just them.

152
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:11.600
And then from that system, they can then do internal reconnaissance because they're already inside

153
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:18.530
organization that will then do further compromise and further escalation of their privileges until they

154
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.180
reach their end goal.

155
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:28.460
OK, so that was an overview of the security threat landscape with the terminology and the difference

156
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:36.200
between script kiddies and a targeted attack in the next lecture will get into the detail of the different

157
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.690
type of attacks that hackers will launch against you starting off with reconnaissance.
