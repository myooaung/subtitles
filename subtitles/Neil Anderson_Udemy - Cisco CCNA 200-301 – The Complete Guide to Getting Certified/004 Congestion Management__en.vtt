00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:15.430
In this lecture, you'll learn about congestion management and how to configure cuing on your Cisco

2
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.260
devices.

3
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.570
When we talk about congestion management, we are talking about queuing service, some congestion on

4
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.820
the big switch.

5
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.880
There's more traffic coming in than it's able to send out.

6
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.220
So it has to buffer that traffic.

7
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.160
It has to put it into acute congestion.

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.680
Management is manipulating the queue so that you give better service to the traffic that requires it.

9
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:49.660
There's two types of queuing policies that are commonly used Virchow CBW, RFQ, which is Class-Based

10
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.380
weighted fare queuing and queue, which is low latency queuing with CBW, RFQ.

11
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.140
It gives bond with God and Ts to specify traffic types.

12
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.310
So when you've got congestion, you can see for this particular type of traffic, I'm going to give

13
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.540
it so much of the available bandwidth and we'll queue below it.

14
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.330
And she queuing is Class-Based wait for queuing with a priority queue.

15
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.500
So this is good.

16
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.410
The configurations at exactly the same is just the AOL queue has got an additional line on there where

17
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:32.890
you can give priority to a type of traffic traffic in the priority you sent before other traffic to

18
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.960
a with AOL queue.

19
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.850
You can have a broader issue there which you'll probably voice and Bedwin for your data applications.

20
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.860
You can give them bandwidth guarantees.

21
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.110
So let's look at how this is actually configured.

22
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.340
And it uses the Makushi, which is the modular Kulash command line interface.

23
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.020
The Nkechi is built with three main sections.

24
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.990
First up, we have the class map which defines with traffic to take an action on.

25
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.410
Then there is the policy map which specifies the action to take or not traffic.

26
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.040
And finally, you have a service policy where you apply the policy map to an interface.

27
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.540
When the MQ she first came out, it was just used for.

28
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.610
Q Ash bought Cisco users framework for loads of other different configurations as well.

29
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.000
For example, if you're configuring your security policies on a school firewall, it uses the same framework

30
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.870
as vet loads of other things as well, use the same framework.

31
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.880
So it's good that when you learn it the first time and then you go and you are in a different type of

32
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.350
technology, that still from Cisco, very often it uses the same framework.

33
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.940
So it makes it easy to are not new technology.

34
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.750
Okay, let's look at an actual example and a look at the configuration for base.

35
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.700
So we're for example, we've got the HQ on the left, we've got a branch on the right, and we've got

36
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.740
PCs and IP phones in both locations.

37
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.650
We send data and we send voice between the two locations.

38
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.990
We've looked at the calls that we're making between the locations, and we've seen that we need to support

39
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.510
10 concurrent calls between the HQ and the branch over that one link.

40
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.810
For our example, each call is taking twenty five point six kilobits per second.

41
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.230
And I use this to make the maths really easy.

42
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.530
If you are if you do work with voice, you see that different codex, which means how we convert the

43
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.600
actual spoken voice into the ones and always digital uses a Kodak.

44
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.640
I'm different codecs can use different bandwidth.

45
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.710
For example, here let's actually the each call is twenty five point six K.

46
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.650
We need to support ten concurrent calls between sites so twenty five point six equals two hundred and

47
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.600
fifty six K.

48
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.070
So we provision two hundred and fifty six kilobits per second bandwidth for our voice calls.

49
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.240
We also analyzed the data traffic between the two sites and in this example we have determined that

50
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.100
512 K is required for data on average.

51
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.890
So 512 plus 256 equals seven hundred and sixty eight K.

52
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.690
So that is the bandwidth on the link that we prevision from the service provider.

53
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.890
I know I'm using V we were numbers here, but big numbers make my head hurt so it's easier to understand

54
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.520
and explain using these all the numbers for the real world deployment.

55
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.020
Just make the numbers bigger.

56
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.030
It works exactly the same way.

57
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.140
OK, so we've provisioned our bandwidth at 768 K and we know that that is going to be enough bandwidth

58
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.850
for normal operations.

59
00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.800
But we also know that data is sometimes going to burst above 512 K during busy periods.

60
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.920
And during those periods we could also have those ten concurrent.

61
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.280
So when that happens, the link is going to get congested.

62
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.540
We don't want to use first in first out queuing because if we do that, the voice pockets are going

63
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.340
to get stuck behind the pockets and we're going to have bad quality phone calls.

64
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.160
We want to bump voice Boyzvoice packets straight to the front of the queue so they don't get delayed

65
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.650
and we get good quality calls.

66
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.940
So let's look at the configuration.

67
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.570
So the first part of the discussion is reclass map, where we specify the traffic that we're interested

68
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.980
in our config.

69
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.830
There is a map and then give it a descriptive name.

70
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.570
Anything you want.

71
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.950
I've called it voice payload March IPD, PEF, a name class map call signaling March IPD, SGP Shickshinny.

72
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.970
The IP phones are marking their own pockets, so whenever a phone generates a pocket which is spoken

73
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.550
voice, it will market is DPF.

74
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.680
Whenever it generates a signalling packet to set up the call or take it down, it's going to market

75
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.680
Oswestry.

76
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.770
So we're looking for those particular packets coming from the IP phone.

77
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.890
We recognize them with our classmates.

78
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.180
Next thing that we're going to do is we're going to specify what we're going to do to that topic in

79
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.160
our policy map.

80
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.640
So I've got a policy map.

81
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.810
I've called it one edge.

82
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.010
Again, call it anything you want.

83
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:30.960
Descriptive name, then class voice payload, which references the class map that we configured already.

84
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.340
And then I say priority percent.

85
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.930
Thirty three priority means this traffic's the front of the queue whenever there is a queue.

86
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.810
So if there's no congestion, this does not take effect.

87
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.170
But when there is congestion, the queuing policy will kick in and any voice pocket that comes in queue

88
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.670
will now be bumped to the front of the queue with provisions 256 K for our voice calls, which is one

89
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:04.750
third of the 768 Kilink, which is why I've said priority percent 33 Savoy's packets will go straight

90
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.440
to the front of the queue and are guaranteed thirty three percent of the bandwidth.

91
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.340
Next, I also I want to give a bandwidth guarantee to my colleague signaling traffic.

92
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.210
This traffic is not too important, so it doesn't need to go in to HQ.

93
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.780
If it gets delayed, then the call might just take a fraction of a second longer set up, but it will

94
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.160
still work just fine.

95
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.870
But I want to make sure that signalling package do get there, so that's why I'm giving them a bind.

96
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.620
We've got a..

97
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.170
This package doesn't require much bandwidth.

98
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.890
So real world, you would figure out exactly how much bandwidth you do require here.

99
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.360
We've figured out that it's Bonwit percent five the require.

100
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.010
So now whenever there's congestion interface, our voice, people with packets go straight to the front

101
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.610
of the queue.

102
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.820
They're guaranteed 33 percent of the bandwidth as well are called signalling packets.

103
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.240
Don't go straight to the front.

104
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.470
The cube, they're guaranteed five percent of the bandwidth.

105
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.570
And if you require more, the signaling packets can take more bandwidth than not as well.

106
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.990
If it's available, the priority queue is guaranteed.

107
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:13.840
Thirty five percent and it's unlimited to 33 percent as well, because if it was able to burst up to

108
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.300
100 percent, then it would take all of the bandwidth and nothing else would ever get out of it.

109
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.030
So it would break all of our traffic to the prosecutor.

110
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.720
It's guaranteed that much and it's also limited to that much as well for the bandwidth statements as

111
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.920
guaranteed that much.

112
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.080
And it can go higher if it's available.

113
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.929
OK, so that is us giving the required service to the voice payload and Nicole shingling.

114
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.690
Next is class class default.

115
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:47.020
Class default means all of our traffic that we haven't specified higher up with a class map.

116
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.480
So everything else and then we see fair queue.

117
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.730
This is a best practice to command to put in.

118
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.210
It's a more fair queuing policy.

119
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.130
Even first than first out is first in.

120
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.710
First out tends to penalize small pockets.

121
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.180
Unfairly, unfairly.

122
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.200
Fair queue is a better queuing mechanism, so it's best practice to always come on in.

123
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.180
And then finally, we need to apply the policy to the interface.

124
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:16.600
If you're ever working in QC, in the real world, this is the it's really easy to forget because you

125
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.680
do the class map where you see the traffic you're looking for when you do the policy map, where you

126
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.150
see what you're going to do to it in any anyway.

127
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.470
OK, I'm done.

128
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.730
And it's easy to forget to put on reserves policy.

129
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.810
If you do that, nothing happens.

130
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.050
You have to apply for a service policy for this to take effect.

131
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.060
This is done under the interface.

132
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.030
So not example, it's interface zero zero zero zero.

133
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.860
We say bandwidth seven six eight.

134
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.530
You have to do this if you're using a to eight percent.

135
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.330
So it knows what this percent is.

136
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.690
33 percent of 760 is two, five, six.

137
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.600
That's where it gets the value from the bottom which statement on there.

138
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:55.990
And then finally to apply it, we say service policy I one edge, which is the name of the policy map.

139
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.940
OK, so that is the whole thing.

140
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:05.500
If you missed this earlier for the Shishani exam, you do not need to know this configuration.

141
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:11.410
I'm showing it here because I think it makes it a lot easier to understand what's happening when you

142
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.110
see the configuration, but you don't need to memorize this for the exam, for the exam.

143
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.980
You need to understand all the things.

144
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.440
You need to understand what QSI is.

145
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.840
You need to understand the different cues.

146
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:30.490
Mechanisms like classification and marking are congestion management, which is cuing and also policing

147
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.800
and shaping, which is going to come up in the next lecture.

148
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.130
So you need to know the city, but you don't need to know the configuration.

149
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:42.040
You'll need to know that when you move on to specializing in some of the other trucks are going on to

150
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.270
the S.P. level.

151
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:50.140
OK, so that was congestion management and queuing and algae and not next lecture for policing and shaping.
