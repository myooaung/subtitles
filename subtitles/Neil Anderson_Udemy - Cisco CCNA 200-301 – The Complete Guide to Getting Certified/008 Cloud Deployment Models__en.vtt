00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.450
In the last lecture, you learned about the cloud service models of infrastructure as a service platform,

2
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.250
as a service and software as a service.

3
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.600
In this lecture, you'll learn about the cloud deployment models as defined by the NIST.

4
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.210
That's public cloud, private cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud.

5
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.270
So the first one, Ecover, is public cloud.

6
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.030
The definition is the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public.

7
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.770
It may be owned, managed and operated by a business, academic or government organization or some combination

8
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.250
of them.

9
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.720
And it exists on the premises of the cloud provider to public cloud are all the really well known cloud

10
00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.340
providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, IBM, Blue Mix and Salesforce.

11
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.500
The first three do support all of the different service models.

12
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.340
Salesforce specialize in software as a service, but are still all public cloud providers and public

13
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.430
cloud is by far the most common deployment model.

14
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.410
The next tape is private cloud, the definitiveness is the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive

15
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:33.440
use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers, for example, business units like departments

16
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.820
within that company.

17
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.420
It may be owned, managed and operated by the organization, a third party or some combination of them.

18
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.150
And it may exist on or off premises.

19
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.590
So private cloud could be where you've got a large company and they're providing cloud services to their

20
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.360
own internal departments, that those cloud services could be managed by the company themselves or it

21
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.570
could be managed externally by a third party provider.

22
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.449
The main point is that these cloud services are dedicated for one organization.

23
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.720
It's not a public cloud where anybody can go and use private cloud works the same way as public cloud.

24
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.440
But the services are provided to internal business units, usually instead of to external public enterprises.

25
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.810
Private cloud fulfills the cloud essential characteristics.

26
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.080
So this is how it's different than a traditional on premises solution, because you might think, well,

27
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.340
private cloud, that's a company and owning and managing their own infrastructure and providing support

28
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.250
for broad internal departments while they were doing that already anyway with on premises solutions.

29
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.920
So how is a private cloud solution any different?

30
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.000
The reason is that it fulfills the cloud essential characteristics we always wear on demand self-service,

31
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.780
rapid elasticity, broad network access, resource pooling and measure service.

32
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.180
So if you think back to the example, when I gave you the demo of Amazon Web Services, which was on

33
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.200
public cloud, well, an organization could develop something like that for their own internal use.

34
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.270
The traditional on premises model, a business unit, orders a new server by raising a ticket with the

35
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.380
IT department.

36
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.650
The server is van provisioned and configured by the server, network and storage teams, a separate

37
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.420
manual processes, and it will typically take over a week with private cloud.

38
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.300
A business unit orders a new server, typically through a web portal, just like you saw me doing it

39
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.040
for Amazon Web Services.

40
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.910
The server is then completely, automatically provisioned without requiring manual intervention again,

41
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.370
just like with AWG.

42
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.600
So it works the same way rather than being for public external customers.

43
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.540
This is for your own internal business units.

44
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.570
The company will use automation software such as Cisco UCS director, so again, remember when I was

45
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:16.640
talking about Ash and we said that there was not front end software, which is usually managed, is

46
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.440
usually configured through a Web based GUI and not what gives you the self-service that then talks to

47
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.190
other software which talks to the actual hardware infrastructure devices like your firewalls, your

48
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.240
viewers, your switches for the networking, your storage system for storage on VMware or hypervisor

49
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.040
or Citrix for the server provisioning the front, the front end software and the software.

50
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.430
Just behind that you can use something like UCS director, which comes from Cisco for the resources

51
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.530
companies like BMC and SIA Technologies that do that as well.

52
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.290
So they can do the automation software which talks with the front end and then talks with the back end

53
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.740
as well.

54
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.710
There's another component that is going to be used for the automation of the networking configuration,

55
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.640
and that is in the end controller software defined networking.

56
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.060
Cisco have a few different ISDN products available, including DNA Santur.

57
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.220
I'll be covering software defined networking on DNS and or later in the network.

58
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.680
Automation and programmability action.

59
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.930
Private cloud is most suitable for large companies with a long term ROIC and efficiency gains can outweigh

60
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.950
the initial effort and cost to set out the infrastructure and automated workflows to set up private

61
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.990
cloud is a lot of work because you need to design software that is going to automate all of this.

62
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.300
You need to test it.

63
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.070
You need to set up all of your different workflows.

64
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.550
So it's a really big amount of work up front.

65
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.060
But once that work is all being done, you've seen that you can very quickly all the provisioning of

66
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.040
a server, just like we did with NWC.

67
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.090
We could just click from dropdown and just put in basic information.

68
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.520
It took a few minutes to fill out information in and then the server would be up and running in around

69
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.370
15 minutes each way quicker than doing it the traditional way, which I normally take about a week or

70
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.800
longer to provision and new server so that you get the big benefit in the end.

71
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.040
But it's a lot of work to be able to set that up.

72
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.290
So typically it's only going to be large companies which are going to have resources to be able to do

73
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.530
this.

74
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.600
That might change in future as new software comes out and makes this easier.

75
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.540
But for now, it's mostly large companies that would have private cloud.

76
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:55.770
Companies with private calling don't usually advertise that fact because it's private, so there's not

77
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.280
many examples I can give you of private cloud, but one is U.S. Department of Defense on private cloud

78
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:09.330
provided by an example of private cloud owned, managed and operated by a third party.

79
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:16.920
The third party is Amazon, and they provide cloud services to the U.S. Department of Defense infrastructure.

80
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.260
Its own separate physical infrastructure is only used by the U.S. Department of Defense.

81
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.420
It's not shared with anybody else.

82
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:33.490
What we're talking about, private cloud, something to mention here, some public cloud infrastructure

83
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:41.330
as a service providers look sometimes market dedicated servers as private cloud dedicated servers means

84
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:48.620
that the actual server hardware is dedicated for a single customer or not one physical server and no

85
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.390
other customers running on there.

86
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:57.440
But it's not private cloud because even though that server hardware is dedicated for one customer,

87
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:04.910
all of us supporting infrastructure like the switches routers are starting just to make sure it is shared

88
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.140
so they might market.

89
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.190
It is private cloud.

90
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.290
That's not really private cloud.

91
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:18.620
OK, the next one is community cloud, the definition of this, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned

92
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:26.060
for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns.

93
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.850
So Private Cloud isn't a single organization.

94
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.530
Community Cloud is a shared community.

95
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.419
This is the by far the least common deployment model.

96
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.950
It is, however, sometimes used in government environments.

97
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:46.610
So again, this would really only make sense for government where they are huge organizations and separate

98
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.560
really large government departments that can come together and share a community cloud.

99
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:59.900
The last one is hybrid cloud definition of is the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more

100
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.610
distinct cloud infrastructures.

101
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.410
So it's a mix between private community or public that remain unique.

102
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:13.280
Entities are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables the and application

103
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.130
portability, for example, cloud thing for load balancing between clouds.

104
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.490
So really the three types versus private community on public.

105
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.800
But if you mix and match any of those, that would quite that would kind of hybrid cloud.

106
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.220
So an example of this is that cloud burst thing that was mentioned in the definition.

107
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:41.300
So if a company has got their own private cloud infrastructure, but there's only so much, they've

108
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:47.300
only got so much hardware if they're running out of space, the option could be they could buy more

109
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.930
hardware, but maybe it's not possible to do that in their data center anymore.

110
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:58.520
So a way that they can scale their own private cloud infrastructure is they can then spill over into

111
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.240
using public cloud to get that additional capacity.

112
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:07.940
So that's cloud birthing is you've got your own internal cloud and you burst out to use an external

113
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.650
public cloud as well.

114
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:16.700
An example of where this is sometimes used as a company could also have their own private cloud, their

115
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.870
main site, and use public cloud for disaster recovery solution.

116
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.420
So they've gone to the expanse of building their own private cloud environment and Marouane Data Center.

117
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.910
But they're worried that there might be some kind of regional disaster that takes that data center.

118
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.290
So they want to have a disaster recovery site that they can feel over to.

119
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.370
They don't need that huge expansive building of our data center again.

120
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.220
So they could use a public cloud provider for that.

121
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.640
OK, so what was all of the different types of Shia in the next lecture?

122
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.910
For the last lecture in this cloud computing section where I'll summarize all the advantages that you

123
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.050
get from using cloud.
