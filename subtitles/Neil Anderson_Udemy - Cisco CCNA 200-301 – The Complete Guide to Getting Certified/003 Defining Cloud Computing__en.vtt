00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:15.340
In the last lecture, you learned about the traditional deployment models of on premises and Kullu or

2
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.650
colocation facilities in this lecture.

3
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.750
I'll explain what cloud computing is and compared it with the traditional deployment models.

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.850
So there's a lot of confusion about exactly what cloud computing is.

5
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.050
Beginners tend to describe it as I.T. services, which are located somewhere else.

6
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.500
And this somewhere else is just some vague notion that it's not inside the company building.

7
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.910
But Cuillo facilities are off premises and they are not.

8
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.320
Cloud and private cloud deployments are often on premises.

9
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.730
So that definition view doesn't work.

10
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.180
We need a better one.

11
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.000
And there is a de facto definition of what cloud computing is.

12
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.230
It comes from the NIST, which is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

13
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.800
So we came up with this definition in 2011, cloud computing as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient

14
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.010
On-Demand Network access to our shared pool of configurable computing resources, for example, network

15
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.460
servers, storage applications and services that can be rapidly provisioned and unleashed with minimal

16
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.760
management effort or service provider interaction.

17
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.910
OK, I didn't say it was a very clear cut definition, but that is the standard definition of what cloud

18
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.600
computing is.

19
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.790
Luckily, in the same document, the Nasty released this definition.

20
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.950
They also specified the characteristics of cloud computing and they really nailed down what cloud computing

21
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.190
is.

22
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.280
But just like the definition is wrong, there is more than one characteristic that really defines cloud

23
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.880
computing.

24
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.890
The first one is on demand self-service.

25
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.030
Again, from the NIST, a consumer can unilaterally prevision computing capabilities such as server

26
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.770
time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service

27
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.250
provider.

28
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.110
So this is very different than what you see with an on premises or a cool solution with most traditional

29
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.070
solutions.

30
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.540
Whenever a department wants a new server, the raise of ticket request with the IT department, and

31
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.490
then we go through that long process I described in the last lecture by ordering the server, getting

32
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.960
it right or getting it cabled the network server and storage team then have to configure everything

33
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:07.780
before the server goes live with cloud computing on demand self-service, where it does not require

34
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.000
individuals in the I.T. teams to put this thing together.

35
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.490
Normally it will use a really convenient guey front end, a Web based tool that users, whether it's

36
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.100
another company or maybe an internal department, if you're doing private cloud, can provision their

37
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.620
own services, such as servers.

38
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.120
And in the next lecture, I'll give you an example of that working.

39
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.770
The next characteristic is rapid elasticity capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released,

40
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.690
in some cases automatically to scale rapidly outward and inward, commensurate with demand to the consumer.

41
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.180
The capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in

42
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.370
any quantity at any time.

43
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.010
So what they say is that you can think of it like an elastic band where you can pull apart and it will

44
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.510
stretch back again as well.

45
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.360
With elasticity, you can prevision the amount of resources that you require very quickly.

46
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.640
You can very quickly scale out when you need more and you can very quickly scale back in when you need

47
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.060
to flash and you only pay for what you're using at the time.

48
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.840
Next one is broadband network access to the first new characteristics, really their characteristics

49
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.660
of cloud, and it's very hard to do that with an on premises or Tarcoola solution, the broad network

50
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.670
access, really this applies to on premises and cool as well normally.

51
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.070
But for a service to be classified as a cloud service, it also has to meet this characteristic with

52
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.960
the characteristics.

53
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.700
It's not a case of a cloud service just has to meet one of those cloud service has to meet all of these

54
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.570
characteristics.

55
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.150
The broad network access, the capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard

56
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.180
mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous, thicker, thin client platforms like mobile phones,

57
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.090
tablets, laptops and workstations with a cloud service as you'd be able to be accessed from anywhere

58
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.120
from the company's offices or from anywhere on the Internet as well, and from a variety of different

59
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.720
clients.

60
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.720
Next one is resource pooling the providers computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers

61
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:34.100
using a multitenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned

62
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.740
according to consumer demand.

63
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.140
So with cloud services.

64
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.900
Every customer or every internal department does not have their own separate dedicated hardware, the

65
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.680
hardware is shared and this brings the costs down because our shared hardware, you don't have to buy

66
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.540
separate hardware for everybody that is using it.

67
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.930
Usually it will be virtualize and only election only are in the.

68
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.320
I'll show you how the virtualization works.

69
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:13.000
Next one is measured service systems automatically control and optimized resource use by leveraging

70
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.820
our metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service, for example,

71
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.060
storage, processing, bandwidth, an active user accounts with a cloud service.

72
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.710
It's always going to be an operational expenditure.

73
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.020
It's going to be a recutting monthly fee.

74
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.420
And the cloud provider needs some way of measuring how much of it you're using as a customer so that

75
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.030
they can build you accordingly.

76
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.070
OK, that was it.

77
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.690
That was all of the characteristics that made a cloud service.

78
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.860
In the next lecture, I will show you an example of actually provisioning some services in the cloud

79
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.220
and you'll see these characteristics and option share their.
