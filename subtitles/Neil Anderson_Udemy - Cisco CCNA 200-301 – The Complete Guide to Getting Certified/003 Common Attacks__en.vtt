00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.880
In this lecture, you'll learn about the comment attacks that hackers use and their attempts to compromise

2
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.680
your systems, you learned in the last lecture that if it is a targeted attack, then the hacker will

3
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.070
typically start off with doing reconnaissance of your organization, so will start their reconnaissance,

4
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.670
obtains information about the intended victim.

5
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.150
And in a targeted attack, as I said earlier, the attacker will typically start with completely unobtrusive

6
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.680
methods that even normal people would be doing.

7
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.430
It does not look like an attack at all, such as searching, who is information, phone directories

8
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.870
and job listings.

9
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:57.450
So if you use the WHO is database, that is just that database of information about people who are responsible

10
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.410
for Web sites.

11
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.000
So let's say that you're going to attack me.

12
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.060
Please don't.

13
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.930
Then you could look up the who is information for flat dot com and you would see that I am responsible

14
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.400
for not, you know, have some information about your intended victims, public web services, other

15
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.480
things you can do.

16
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.670
I look for corporate phone directories.

17
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.610
If the company has got a publicly listed corporate phone directly, then you can go in there, you can

18
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.400
find out the names of people that work for the organization, their phone numbers, maybe their job

19
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.780
rules and things like this.

20
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.180
This is going to be very useful information if you want to do social engineering, which we're going

21
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.010
to come to in a second.

22
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.020
Other things that you probably wouldn't have thought about, as well as things like job listings, for

23
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.920
example, if you advertise a job position and in there you see that you want a voice and video engineer

24
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.280
and they need to have skills in business school call manager.

25
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.520
Well, if an attacker sees that, they can be pretty sure that what you're using for your voice and

26
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.620
video system is a school call manager.

27
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.530
So if they're going to be attacking that, they already know what kind of system you're using so they

28
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.710
can look for vulnerabilities specific to that.

29
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.930
So with all this, you need to be very careful and be aware of the information that you're making publicly

30
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.500
available.

31
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.620
For example, by example, I just gave you a big job listings.

32
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.190
That's the kind of thing that most people would never think about at all.

33
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.410
But by doing that, you're actually giving out information which is valuable to attackers.

34
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.410
So after the attacker has done this very high level reconnaissance, which is not going to register

35
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.030
with any security tools at all, then proceed to do further.

36
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.120
Reconnaissance will dig deeper using tools such as ping sweeps the and Vulnerability Skyliners.

37
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.410
OK, so I mentioned social engineering a second ago.

38
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.960
Social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or

39
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.410
personal information, and it typically involves nothing more technical than the use of a telephone

40
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.670
or email.

41
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.810
And the attacker will often pretend to be somebody else to trick the victim.

42
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.390
So an example of social engineering.

43
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.680
Let's see that during the reconnaissance, the attacker did find that your organization has got a public

44
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.990
phone directory and then from that they find out the name of the I.T. manager.

45
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.890
And if you're in a large organization they know of, no, everybody is going to know the I.T. manager

46
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.550
personally.

47
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.850
So maybe the phone up somebody inside the organization, again, they know who this person is.

48
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.590
We've got your phone number and our job at all.

49
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.490
The phone them up and they pretend to be the I.T. manager and then they try to trick this person into

50
00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.580
changing their password to a particular password or something like that, or maybe giving out information

51
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.990
about the company, which, again, is going to be more valuable information for the attacker.

52
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.390
And they can escalate from their.

53
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.680
A very popular, fairly recently and common type of social engineering is phishing.

54
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:24.500
This is an attack where the attacker pretends to be from a reputable company to get individuals to reveal

55
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.120
personal information such as passwords and credit card numbers.

56
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.510
And victim is often directed to enter the details and the attackers Web site, which looks like reputable

57
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.190
companies, legitimate website.

58
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.970
The attacker has now got their username and password.

59
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.200
So if you've got an e-mail address, I'm sure you do, then I'm sure you're used to seeing these phishing

60
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.740
attacks.

61
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.540
You're used to seeing emails from Apple or somebody like that.

62
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.470
You get an email supposedly from Apple which says that there is an issue with your Apple account and

63
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.430
it's going to be locked out.

64
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.490
Or maybe it says it's from PayPal and it says your PayPal account is about to be locked out and never

65
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.270
will be a link.

66
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.940
You click on the link, it takes you to a Web site that looks just like Apple or PayPal website and

67
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.630
tries to trick you to your username and password in there.

68
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.810
So if, for example, your PayPal details are in there, the attacker has now got access to your PayPal

69
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.300
account and they can take any money out of their.

70
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:35.280
Next thing to talk about is data exfiltration, this is where data leaves an organization without or

71
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.310
authorization.

72
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.690
So this could be by a hacker who has compromised the system.

73
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.650
For example, if it was an attack by the hacker and they've got and this has happened several times

74
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.660
in recent years where an attacker has managed to compromise the systems of a financial institution which

75
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.920
have got a database of credit card details.

76
00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.140
So if the hacker is able to get this information, they can now steal the credit card details of all

77
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.240
of our organizations customers.

78
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.430
They can then use this to try to do fraud with those credit card details.

79
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.400
Or another thing that they could do is they could blackmail the organization, telling them, pay me

80
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.580
a ransom or I'm going to let everybody know that I was able to steal all of your customers credit card

81
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.120
details.

82
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.060
It could also be by accident or maliciously by an internal staff member.

83
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.220
For example, a staff member sends an email which includes secret information.

84
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.950
They could do that just by accident because we don't know any better, or they could do it maliciously.

85
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.090
Another thing that could happen is a staff member could accidentally leave a USB stick on a bus, which

86
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.990
has got company sensitive information on there, which is no encrypted.

87
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.940
Next thing is the US denial of service.

88
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.770
This is an attack which prevents legitimate users from accessing an I.T. resource and it's typically

89
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.920
a brute force style of attack, which floods the target system with more traffic than it can handle.

90
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.450
So the target system gets more traffic than it can handle, can't take anymore.

91
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:21.240
And not just crashes with Target's system, but at least stops it from accepting any more incoming connections.

92
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.290
DOS attacks from a single source can be easily stopped by blocking traffic from that single source.

93
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.490
So an example of a denial of service attack, well known one is the TGP Swinford.

94
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.270
Before I get to that in the next slide, let me explain the normal mechanism that it takes advantage

95
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.450
of.

96
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.900
So the way the TGP works normally when everything is well is a user.

97
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.730
So you can see a user here, they connect to a server.

98
00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.580
When they do that, their PC sends a sin message to the server.

99
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:07.150
The server will then send a Sinak box office, for instance, for synchronize the server, then sends

100
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.820
a synchronized acknowledgement back and then the originating system then sends that acknowledgement,

101
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.230
but then completes the teashop.

102
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:22.110
Three way handshake and a normal communication can occur after that with TCP traffic always starts with

103
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.720
that three way handshake to set out the TGP connection.

104
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:35.110
The TCP Swinford attack is a denial of service attack, which uses this mechanism to attack the target

105
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.559
server.

106
00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.080
See here you can see we've got the attacker.

107
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.549
They send in the sin to initiate the connection.

108
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.100
The server then sends a signal back.

109
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:52.090
What would normally happen at that point is the source system here would then send another acknowledgment

110
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.490
to complete the three way handshake.

111
00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:00.040
But with a TCP Synthroid attack, what the attacker does is they just don't complete the connection

112
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.960
by sending in the acknowledgement.

113
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.570
So it's a half open connection you've got to send from the attacker and in the Senate bot from a server

114
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.270
and then they don't send the act to complete it.

115
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.230
And the attacker will not just open up one half open connection.

116
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:21.730
They will open up so many half open connections, the exhausts, the resources on the target system,

117
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.730
and then it's not able to accept any new incoming connections to be doing this.

118
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.900
The attacker brings down that system.

119
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:34.030
They stop any other legitimate users from being able to open up a connection to that system.

120
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.360
OK, so as you saw earlier, if it's a single attacker, it's doing that from a single IP address,

121
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:47.550
it's very easy to stop the attack by just dropping all traffic coming in from that one source IP address.

122
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:56.640
But there is a more damaging form of the attack, which is Vidor's distributed denial of service with

123
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.470
a distributed denial of service attack.

124
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:04.800
It's the same type of attack, but it comes from multiple sources, not just a single source IP address.

125
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.870
To do this, the attacker builds and controls a botnet army of infected zombie hosts, which they can

126
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.980
control, and the botnet is built through malware such as worms and Trojan horses.

127
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:24.720
So, for example, about the Trojan horse I gave you before, let's say that you're a gaming fan.

128
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.040
You go into a website, it promises to give you the passwords for all of the latest games.

129
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:37.680
Sheardown movie you execute it then installs via TACKERS software onto your PC.

130
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.240
Your PC has now become a zombie RPG and it's possible for the attacker to control your PC and launch

131
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.070
denial of service attacks from there.

132
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:55.050
When the attacker gets a big enough botnet, a big enough army of zombie PCs that can launch very damaging

133
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.420
distributed denial of service attacks from their.

134
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:05.190
With the botnet, the infected horse can act out to the attackers command and control server, this

135
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.600
circumvents firewalls because the connection is initiated from the inside.

136
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:16.170
So I thought she is inside a firewall then even if the attacker gets the software on there, if the

137
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:22.470
attacker was going to initiate the connection to his own VPC, it wouldn't work because that would normally

138
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.410
be blocked by the firewall.

139
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:31.770
However, firewalls allow traffic from inside the network to go out of the network and enter return

140
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.150
traffic to come back in.

141
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:40.590
So what happens is you go and you download a Trojan horse, you inadvertently install the software on

142
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.370
your PC.

143
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:46.980
Your PC then connects out to the attackers command and control server.

144
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.710
Your firewall allows that traffic because it's going outbound and then the attacker connection traffic

145
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.810
back into you through the firewall.

146
00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:00.300
The firewall will allow it because it's return to traffic and they can now control your PC and they

147
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.700
can launch denial of service attacks from their.

148
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:09.660
Distributed denial of service attacks are obviously more difficult to mitigate against because the attack

149
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:16.560
comes from multiple sources which could normally be expected to send legitimate traffic to with a plane,

150
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.380
the U.S. attack is coming from a single source.

151
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.820
You can easily see that it's attacking you and you can block traffic from our source.

152
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:30.630
But if traffic is coming from a huge botnet of thousands of zombie zombies, it can be hard to protect

153
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.190
against that.

154
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.980
There are techniques you can use for which will cover later on in the section.

155
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:44.060
Next kind of attack that we have is spoofing and spoofing is where an attacker fakes their identity.

156
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:51.770
Spoofing types include IP address spoofing, where the attacker spoofed their source IP address, pretending

157
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:52.700
to be somebody else.

158
00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:00.050
Advanced spoofing, for example, are attacks which were covered earlier in the switch security section

159
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:08.930
and application spoofing, for example, a rogue DHP server so the attacker can put in a rule DHP server

160
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.690
in your organization.

161
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.710
It's not the legitimate DHP server, but the attacker is pretending like it is.

162
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:24.500
Next, reflection and amplification attacks, a deflection attack is a denial of service attack where

163
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:31.400
the attacker spoofs the victims source address the attacker sans traffic, supposedly from the victim,

164
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:39.770
which elicits a response from reflectors to, for example, if the intended victim has the IP address,

165
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:47.200
cannot handle it, handle attacking the attacker, sends traffic seeing that it is dot, dot, dot 10.

166
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.300
So it says that that is its source address.

167
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:57.140
It then sends out traffic in some destination hosts, which will send traffic back to the victim.

168
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.620
And if it does enough of this, then all out to turn traffic.

169
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:06.620
Going back to the victim can bring the victim via amplification, causes a large amount of response

170
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.480
traffic to the victim, which causes denial of service effect.

171
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:18.900
In mine, in the middle attacks, the attacker inserts themselves into the communication path between

172
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:27.050
legitimate hosts to when the attacker is able to do this man in the middle attack the traffic gottschall

173
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:34.110
pockets that are going between two legitimate who are passing through the attacker and it can then read

174
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.900
an option.

175
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:42.780
We modified the in those pockets are spoofing as a well known man in the middle attack we covered back

176
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.580
in this switch security section.

177
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.960
Password attacks.

178
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.850
If an attacker has connectivity to a login window so they can get to that login window, then they can

179
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.790
attempt to gain access to the system behind it.

180
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.380
Enumeration techniques attempt to discover usernames.

181
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.710
So most modern software will guard against this.

182
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.410
You've got all of the software on there.

183
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:15.490
Then it's possible that the attacker can use a tool which will be able to find out the usernames very

184
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:22.740
legitimate on that system and password cracking techniques, attempt to learn user passwords.

185
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:30.240
The different types of methods that are available to the attacker to crack passwords include just normal

186
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.990
guessing.

187
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.420
They can also use brute force on dictionary attacks.

188
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:42.750
So with gashing, a study was done fairly recently and it found out that a huge amount of people use

189
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:50.880
common passwords, for example, passwords using an art instead of an A or a password of let me in on

190
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.780
things like that.

191
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.930
People use them thinking, OK, this is your password.

192
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.870
But actually they're used all over the place.

193
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.890
Those are the first ones the attackers will get.

194
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:09.810
If the system does not have an easily guessed password on there, then the attacker can use tools which

195
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.190
can do brute force and dictionary attacks with a dictionary attack.

196
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:21.330
The tool goes through all the words in the dictionary to see if that is being used as a password and

197
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:27.840
with a brute force attack that is taking on a level which will take a bit longer for the attacker rather

198
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.840
than just using dictionary words, it will use combinations of words, will also do things like using

199
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.320
the symbol instead of an AI, etc., things like that, and an attempt to crack the password.

200
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:48.290
Buffer overflow attacks send malformed and or too much the to the target system.

201
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:56.120
So this is, again, where all of the software is more likely to be vulnerable.

202
00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:03.140
This if software does not guard against malformed, they are coming in, then the attacker can do that

203
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:09.290
and then they can do that either as a denial of service attack where it crashes the target system or

204
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.190
worse case.

205
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:16.190
Sometimes it can actually compromised the system and give the attacker admin rights on that system.

206
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:25.010
And finally, we have pocket sniffers, if an attacker has compromised the target system or ViiV inserted

207
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:32.150
himself into the network path and are able to she pockets going to or from the system, then pocket

208
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:37.370
sniffers such as Wireshark can be used to read the scent and received pockets.

209
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:44.060
And any unencrypted sensitive information that is in there can then be learned by the attacker.

210
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:50.590
They can use this to damage the organization, for example, by blackmailing them with the sensitive

211
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:56.450
information they have, or if it includes security information, they can use that to escalate their

212
00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.020
attack and get access to more sensitive systems.

213
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:07.760
OK, so that was the main types of attacks that hackers will use against you.

214
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:14.510
As we go through the rest of this section, we'll talk about the solutions that are available to you

215
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.890
to protect against them.
