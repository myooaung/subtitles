00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.830
In the next lecture, you'll learn about how the OSPF cost metric works and how it's based on interface

2
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.000
bandwidth by default.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.860
But before we get there, I want to explain how the 'bandwidth' command works, and what it does, and how it

4
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.110
relates to the 'speed' and the 'clock rate' command

5
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.010
because this is a common source of confusion.

6
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.340
Okay.

7
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.640
So, starting with the 'speed' command first. The rate that Ethernet interfaces physically transmit at is set

8
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.560
by the 'speed' command. GigabitEthernet interfaces transmit at 1000 megabits per second (Mbps) by default. A thousand

9
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.860
megabits per second is 1 gigabit per second, and FastEthernet interfaces transmit at 100 megabits per

10
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.820
second by default.

11
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.110
For example, if you use the 'speed 10' command on a FastEthernet interface and it supports it, it will

12
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.490
physically transmit at 10 megabits per second instead.

13
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.860
So if you do that, you need to make sure you manually set the speed on both sides of the link, or you're

14
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.940
going to have problems.

15
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.900
But when you do that, it changes the actual physical speed of the interface from 100 megabits per second

16
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.800
to 10 megabits per second.

17
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.720
So on Ethernet interfaces, it's the 'speed' command that you can use to change the default physical speed

18
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.180
of the interface.

19
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.970
Next command we have is the 'clock rate' command, and this works on Serial interfaces. Serial interfaces

20
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.110
used to be used very commonly on WAN links.

21
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.200
Not so much nowadays, but you do still find them.

22
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.460
The rate that Serial interfaces physically transmit at is set by the 'clock rate' command. Serial interfaces transmit

23
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.370
at 1.544 megabits per second by default. That is the speed of a T1 interface that used

24
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.160
to be commonly used in the United States. Cisco are a US company,

25
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.190
so that's why that is the default. If you use the

26
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.780
'clock rate 64000' command on a Serial interface, it will physically transmit at 64 kilobits per second (Kbps). So a Serial

27
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.850
interface transmits at 1.544 megabits per second by default, you can change that by using the

28
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.770
'clock rate' command to set a transmit rate in kilobits per second (Kbps).

29
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.330
And again, this will change the physical speed of the interface,

30
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.950
and again, it has to match on both sides of the link. Okay, so that was the 'speed' and the 'clock rate' commands,

31
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.910
which do change the physical transmission rate of interfaces,

32
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.630
next up,

33
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.030
we have got the 'bandwidth' command which does not. So interfaces also have a default bandwidth,

34
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.620
for example, 100 megabits per second on FastEthernet interfaces, 1.544 megabits per second

35
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.750
on a Serial interface, and you see that defaults to what the 'speed' and the

36
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.050
'clock rate'

37
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.750
defaulted too as well,

38
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.990
and the 'bandwidth' does usually match

39
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.800
physical transmission rate of the interface. It will do by default

40
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.600
and normally, as the administrator, we want to leave it at that as well. We want it to have it set to that.

41
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.080
The bandwidth setting on an interface does not affect the physical transmission rate, that is set by the 'speed'

42
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.660
or the 'clock rate'.

43
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.270
If you set a bandwidth of 50 megabits per second on a FastEthernet interface, it will still transmit

44
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.900
at 100 megabits per second.

45
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.200
Okay,

46
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.760
so if the bandwidth setting does not affect the actual physical speed of an interface, what does it do

47
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.450
then?

48
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.410
Well, it affects software policy on the router, such as which path will be selected by our routing protocols,

49
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.400
EIGRP or OSPF, or how much bandwidth will be guaranteed through a traffic type by QoS.

50
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:58.080
For example, if you've configured a QoS policy, which is going to guarantee your video traffic, a third

51
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.170
of the bandwidth on an interface. The way that you tell the router how much bandwidth is actually there is with

52
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.020
the 'bandwidth' command. So you can influence software policy by setting the bandwidth on an interface.

53
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.490
Like I said, you normally want the bandwidth to actually match the physical interface. On an Ethernet interface,

54
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.440
it's going to do that by default anyway. On a Serial interface,

55
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.790
it's going to default to 1.544 megabits per second always.

56
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.590
So if it's actually a 64 Kbps or a 128 Kbps interface, then you're definitely going to want to set the

57
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.410
'bandwidth' command on that interface to make sure that the bandwidth, which affects the software policy

58
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.930
is also matching the actual physical bandwidth on the interface.

59
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.620
Now, you don't have to have the matching. Sometimes, you want to override what would happen by default.

60
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.930
So you don't do this very commonly, but it is possible to set the bandwidth to be different than the

61
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.310
actual bandwidth on the physical interface if you want to influence software policy.

62
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.640
Okay,

63
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.960
so that is how the 'speed', the 'clock rate', and the 'bandwidth' commands work.

64
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.730
See you in the next lecture where we'll get into the OSPF cost metric.
