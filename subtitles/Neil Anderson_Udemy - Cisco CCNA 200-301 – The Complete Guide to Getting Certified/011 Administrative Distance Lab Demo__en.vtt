00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.420
In this lecture, we'll have a look at Administrative Distance in the lab.

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.070
So I've got the usual topology

3
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.550
here, R1 through to R5. The IP addresses are already configured, and right now, I'm running RIP along

4
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.350
the top path between routers R1 and R4, R5 does not have any routing protocols configured

5
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.700
on there. So,

6
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.070
let's have a look at this.

7
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.710
So I'll go into the command line on R1,

8
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.220
I can do a 'show ip protocols' and you'll see that the only protocol I've got running right now is RIP.

9
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.600
And if I do a 'show ip route' you can see I've got my RIP routes, the routing protocol, in the table and

10
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.270
they've got an Administrative Distance of 120, which is the AD for RIP.

11
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:12.540
So next up I will configure IS-IS, which is the next most preferred Administrative Distance.

12
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.980
I've got my configuration ready here, and I will paste it onto the routers. Actually, you know you've seen

13
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.070
me doing this before,

14
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.520
so I'll just pause the video and I will paste in the IS-IS config on each of the routers.

15
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.590
Okay, so I'm back again,

16
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.000
I've pasted in the config. I'll do a 'show ip protocols' on R1 again, and you can see I'm running RIP and

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100
if I scroll through, you'll see I'm also running IS-IS as well.

18
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.540
If I do a 'show ip route', it's the IS-IS routes that made it into the routing table.

19
00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:02.100
I can also do a 'show ip rip database', and you can see I'm learning RIP routes as well. So if you look at the routing

20
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.820
table,

21
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.400
my IS-IS routes have got an AD of 115, which is more preferred to the AD of 120 on RIP.

22
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.010
So, that's why it's my IS-IS routes that are making it into the routing table.

23
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.520
The next most preferred IGP is OSPF, so let's configure that on our routers.

24
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.870
This one doesn't take long to enable, so you can just bear with me as I paste these in. So I'll put that

25
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:46.240
on R1, on R2, R3, and R4, and we're not configuring a routing protocol on R5.

26
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.080
Okay, back onto R1 again, and I can do my 'show ip protocols' command.

27
00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.680
Now, you see I'm running RIP, and I'm running IS-IS, and I'm running OSPF as well now.

28
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.660
And if I do a 'show ip route', my OSPF routes

29
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.380
hasn't converged yet.

30
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.690
We'll give it a second for the adjacencies to come up.

31
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.120
This shouldn't take too long.

32
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.790
Okay, I'll pause a video again.

33
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.310
Oh there we go, alright.

34
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.810
So they just actually came up

35
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.670
now, and might need to give it a second on the other routers as well.

36
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.560
Let's have a look for a 'show ip route' and I can see that it hasn't fully converged, so

37
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.760
I've still got some IS-IS routes in there but there is an OSPF route that's made into the routing table.

38
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.480
Again, it's preferred over the IS-IS route because it's got a better Administered Distance of 110.

39
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.330
Okay, and the last one to do is EIGRP. So let's

40
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.370
copy and paste this from notepad again.

41
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.190
Again, I can put the same config in all of the routers, so

42
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:09.950
this will just take a second. So there's R1, R2, R3, and R4.

43
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.500
And if I go back to R1, EIGRP does converge very quickly so hopefully it will show up by the time

44
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.660
I get to looking at the routing table. Let's do a 'show ip protocols' again, and I can see I'm running RIP, ISIS,

45
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.460
OSPF, and EIGRP now.

46
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.600
And if I have a look at the routing table with a 'show ip route', a 'D' is for EIGRP.

47
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:42.600
It's my EIGRP routes that are making it into the routing table because they've got an Administrative Distance of 90,

48
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.580
which is most preferred.

49
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.850
I've still got an IS-IS route in here for 203.0.113.0 network because I didn't include that in any

50
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.560
of the other routing protocols.

51
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.010
Okay,

52
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.210
so you saw Administrative Distance in action.

53
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.950
Let's go back to the topology diagram, and what I'm going to do now is configure a Floating Static route.

54
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.090
My routing protocols are only running along the top path routers, from R1 to R4. I've not configured

55
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:22.110
a routing protocol on R5. And what I'm going to do on R1 is configure a backup route to the

56
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:29.660
10.1.2.0 network behind R4 to go through R5 instead. So, I need to create an IP route to

57
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.460
10.1.2.0/24 with a next hop of 10.0.3.2.

58
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.640
I would also need a static route from R4, sorry, from R5 to R4, and also static routes

59
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.780
coming back in the other direction, but I only need to do it on R1 just to show you the Floating Static

60
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.950
route working. So, let's do that now.

61
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.220
Back on the command line on R1, I'll go 'config t',

62
00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:03.750
and then I'm going to create an IP route for 10.1.2.0 255.255.255.0, and the next hop

63
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:12.210
is on R5, which was 10.0.3.2. Now, I won't do it as a Floating Static route first.

64
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.050
I'll just do this as a normal static route, and when I enter this, you see that before my route to the

65
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:28.500
10.1.2.0 network was learned through EIGRP, and the next hop was 10.0.0.2, which is on R2.

66
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:38.040
If I do a 'do show ip route' now, you'll see that my route to 10.1.2.0 has been replaced with the

67
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.300
static route because it's got an Administrative Distance of 1, which is better. But for our example,

68
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:52.350
I only want this to be a backup. I don't want it to be the preferred route. So, what I need to do is remove

69
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.660
that route. So I'll hit the up arrow twice, and then Ctrl-A to go back to the start of the line, and then enter

70
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:06.750
'no' to remove it. And then, I'll put the same command and again, but this time, I will give it an Administrative

71
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.320
Distance of 95, which is higher, and therefore, worse than the Administrative Distance of 90

72
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:23.810
in EIGRP. So when I enter that, the EIGRP route should be put back into the routing table again.

73
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.670
So I'll do a 'show ip route' to see if it's in there yet.

74
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:35.760
There we go, the EIGRP route is back in the routing table again. I don't see the static route because it is

75
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:41.670
not the best route. It doesn't make it into the routing table. But it is there, sitting as a backup though.

76
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:50.370
So let's look at the topology diagram again, and the interface to get out to R2 is fastEthernet0/0.

77
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.690
So if I shut that down, it should failover to using my backup route.

78
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.000
So, let's try that.

79
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:09.420
So I'll go 'config t' and 'interface fastEthernet0/0' and do a 'shutdown' here, and EIGRP should detect that.

80
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:17.490
So you see EIGRP detected that the neighbor went down, and if I do a 'show ip route' now, I'll see that my static

81
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.060
route has made it into the routing table, so my backup worked. Okay,

82
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.340
that was Administrative Distance. See you in the next lecture.
