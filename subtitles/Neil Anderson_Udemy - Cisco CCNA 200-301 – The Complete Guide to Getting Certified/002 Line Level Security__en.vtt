00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.080
In this lecture, you'll learn about configuring basic Chiku to aim on your school writers and switches

2
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:23.050
by configuring passwords the line level, when you first switch from the factory, you take the box,

3
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.350
you can connect it with a control cable and you can immediately start configuring it.

4
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.660
There's no password required when you deploy that or switch into your production environment.

5
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.690
You want to make sure that it's only authorized administrators that can get on there.

6
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.370
You don't want anybody else to make any changes.

7
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.060
So we're going to configure security to ensure that.

8
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.700
First up, a quick reminder, the IOW command hierarchy by default, when you first connect to a switch,

9
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.070
you'll be a user exact mode.

10
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.220
And this is a very limited way of vulvas.

11
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.170
Very few commands that you run here.

12
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.140
You can tell you to use that exact mode because the command prompt will show the hostname of a switch

13
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.090
and made a great Irvan symbol.

14
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.850
So to really be able to do much unretired a switch, you need to escalate your privilege level.

15
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.250
You do that with the enable command and that will get you into privileged exact mode.

16
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.630
That's where you can run all the visual commands and all of the debug commands.

17
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.810
When you do and are the enable command, you'll see the command prompt changes to show the hostname

18
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.790
and then a hash so you can view information about that.

19
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.750
Are there to make any changes you need to get into global configuration mode.

20
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.500
The command for VOP is configure terminal or config T and you'll see the prompt changes to include config

21
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.370
in brackets.

22
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.510
And then when you configure a particular thing on a switch, like a routing protocol or an interface,

23
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.160
you go at that level and then the prompt will change again.

24
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.370
For example, the hostname and end config dosch IAFF are configured interface if you're at the interface

25
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.570
configuration level.

26
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.940
OK, so basic line level security, minimal password security, it can be configured through the use

27
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.720
of static, locally defined passwords at three different levels and we'll get to the more advanced ways

28
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.540
that we can do security later on in this section.

29
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.510
So for the basic minimum level of security, you can use local meaning.

30
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.960
It's configured on regular switches, safe and static passwords.

31
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.940
We don't generally change the three levels, but you can do this on.

32
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.030
The first one is the console line.

33
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.370
So this affects you if you're accessing use it exact mode when connecting via a console cable.

34
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.170
Next one is virtual terminal.

35
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.750
The key Y line.

36
00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:03.120
This affects you if you're accessing the device when you're connecting remotely via telnet or SSL secure

37
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.510
shell.

38
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.910
And finally, we can set a password, the privileged exact mode.

39
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.940
We do this by saying a password on going to enter the enable command.

40
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.230
Those three levels can be used independently or in combination with each other, and they can use the

41
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.530
same or different passwords.

42
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.310
So, for example, I could just put a password on Vivica Y line if I wanted to, or I could pass passwords

43
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.200
on there and on the console line and on privilege exact mode as well.

44
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.660
If you just put a password on your virtual terminal vq y lines, you would be required to enter a password

45
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.960
if you were using Telnet or S.H. to access the device.

46
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.340
But if you were connected up with a console cable, you wouldn't require a password.

47
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.260
And also if you just did it, there been when you went to the enable mode, you wouldn't be required

48
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.850
to add an additional password for enable mode if we did and or passwords, all three levels I could

49
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.570
use password one on the console password to too on UI and password three for the enable prompt.

50
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.940
Or I could use password one on all three of them so you can use the same or you can use different passwords.

51
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.490
So first one was configuring a password on the console.

52
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.100
If you do this, then whenever you connect with a console cable, you're going to need to enter a password

53
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.510
to actually get access to the command line with a console connection.

54
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.650
So when you're connected up over a console part, only one person can be connected over the console

55
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.730
at a time.

56
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.580
So when you configure base, the line number is always going to be zero because there was only one line

57
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.730
number available.

58
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.310
So for our config, our config would be a global configuration line console zero and then password,

59
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.830
see whatever password you want to be required.

60
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.170
And then you put in the logging command.

61
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.340
You have to log in command as well as deity.

62
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.500
When you say log in, that means that whenever somebody connects up over the console and they want to

63
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.190
get access to the command line, they have to enter the password that is configured under the console

64
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.640
line.

65
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:24.500
So we enter that config, then we do hook up to the device with a console cable, and then when we look

66
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.050
at that on our administrator workstation, when we do the connection, we'll see a prompt.

67
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.440
So we see that and the which are one put on here.

68
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.540
Console Zero is now available.

69
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.120
Press return to get started.

70
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.930
We hit return and it will then prompt us for a password.

71
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.670
So says User Access Verification Password.

72
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.510
And we enter the password in there, but we configured under the line.

73
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.410
If we enter the wrong password, it will prompt us for the password again.

74
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.210
If we enter the correct password, then we will get into the device, the user exact mode.

75
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.440
And you can see that down at the bottom there with our one glaring symbol.

76
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.850
Would it use our exact mode?

77
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.750
So that was configuring a password on the consulate, if you just configured a password on the console

78
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.750
line, but you don't configure a password anywhere else, when other methods, people won't be prompted

79
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.690
for a password.

80
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:24.040
So we want to enable a password for sure when people are connecting remotely over Telnet or S.H..

81
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.080
We'll talk about Telnet that first in Mwencha.

82
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.890
I'll show you how to enable a message and I'll later lecture.

83
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.730
An administrator can use Telnet to connect to the command line of a router switch remotely over an IP

84
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.470
connection.

85
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:45.310
But you're a switch does not accept incoming sessions by default for telnet.

86
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.790
You need to set this up.

87
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.970
So what you need to do is you need to configure an IP address and you need to enable telnet access under

88
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.230
the UI line.

89
00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.080
Vicky Wiliness virtual terminal and is used for incoming CallNet and Associates connections.

90
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.890
So first thing that we needed to do there was to configure an IP address, you already know how to configure

91
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.830
an IP address on your router.

92
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.000
We covered on the switch before it as well.

93
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.010
But I'll just give you a quick reminder here.

94
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.960
So I'll layer to switch.

95
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.090
Is no IP routing aware?

96
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.440
It's unclear to device.

97
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.930
It does, however, support a single IP address for management so that you'll be able to telnet RSS

98
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.620
into it.

99
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:35.360
A default gateway will also need to be configured if you want to have connectivity to other IP subnets.

100
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:43.530
So our configuration for this is we do it under the survivors switched virtual interface interface VLAN

101
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:43.860
one.

102
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.600
Or you could use a different view on no.

103
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.080
If you want, give it an IP address and see no shut down and exit.

104
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.770
And then to configure the default gateway, it's going to use IP Default Gateway and the IP address.

105
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:05.370
The router gets an IP address on your switch that you're going to be able to telnet to it if it's only

106
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.360
are to switch.

107
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.770
If you try to add a second IP address, it's going to overwrite the first one.

108
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.380
You're only ever allowed to have one IP address on there.

109
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:22.090
OK, so basic town that she Kutta with our constant line, as you saw earlier, only one person can

110
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.860
connect over time.

111
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:31.390
But for Telnet and associates, you can have multiple administrators working on the device the same

112
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.720
time.

113
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.610
But there's a limited number of lines that are available depending on the device.

114
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.770
Usually at 16, those lines are allocated on a first come, first serve basis.

115
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:50.170
So if all 16 lines are already in use and then another administrator ties to Telnet onto the box, Virgini

116
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.130
be rejected.

117
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.800
So our configuration here is why invite UI zero and then 15?

118
00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.900
That's configuring all of our terminal lines.

119
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.590
Then we say password.

120
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.230
We're using flat box to here and log in.

121
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.460
Log in again means user password that is configured under the line.

122
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.580
You will sometimes see a configuration here seeing line V, QIC zero and then four.

123
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.280
If you do that, you've only got five lines available, so it's better to enable all of the different

124
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:21.700
lines.

125
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:30.940
Once we have configured if I'm on my administer or workstation and I go telnet to the Earth, so the

126
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:37.840
way I would do that would be telnet TANDO to one the IP address, it will then prompt me for a password

127
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.120
and I have to enter the password there.

128
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.680
When I do that, I'll get into the user exact mode as you see here.

129
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.720
OK, so that was control and telnet passwords.

130
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.290
Another thing to talk about here is the exact time out.

131
00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:02.350
By default you will be logged out if you don't enter any commands on it or switch for ten minutes.

132
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.740
Vorys And this is maybe you were working on the device at your desk and then you go away to make a cup

133
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.140
of coffee and then you get talking to somebody.

134
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.750
And when that happens, you don't want to leave yourself logged in at your desk in case somebody is

135
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.860
walking past and then they can jump on and see the configuration or not.

136
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:27.820
So it's a security feature that you'll be automatically Longdale after ten minutes of inactivity by

137
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.110
default, but you can change it to a different value if you want.

138
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.270
She could set it to log you quicker or you could set it to Wanggai after a longer period.

139
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:45.550
If you see no exact time or exact time I zero that disables the exact time out, which means you can

140
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.790
stay logged in indefinitely.

141
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.900
The commands to configure.

142
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.700
But again, it's configured the line level.

143
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.970
She can do it separately for console on, for telnet, for the console.

144
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:04.000
We've got like console zero exact time 015 which means will be long day after 15 minutes of activity.

145
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.440
And then we see why invited 015 for our telnet lines.

146
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.440
Exact time I five space three.

147
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.280
If you put in two numbers here, the first one is a value in minutes.

148
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.260
The second one is a value in seconds.

149
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.030
So there we would be long day after five minutes and 30 seconds of activity.

150
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:30.160
Another good reason it's good to have the exact time I would go back to slide a couple of slides was

151
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.600
when we were talking about if all the lines that are in use, then nobody else is going to be able to

152
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.110
get in.

153
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:41.650
So let's say that you had configured your 15 lines, but the administrators have not been cleaning the

154
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.940
sessions properly.

155
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:49.930
Then if all 50 node in use and you've disabled the exact time out, then nobody's going to be able to

156
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:50.960
telnet into that.

157
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.220
Right.

158
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.540
Or you would have to go and connect with a console connection to clear voice sessions.

159
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:02.260
So it's a really good idea to have an exact time configured on there to see it both for security reasons

160
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:08.860
and to make sure that users and administrators will be timed out if they did not clear of sessions cleanly.

161
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:19.410
OK, moving on, the next thing we can secure our virtual terminal lines with access list to get an

162
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:26.310
additional level of security so that can be used to limit telnet and associates access so that only

163
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.330
your administrator workstations are going to be able to log in.

164
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.260
To do this.

165
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.330
We configure a standard e-mail.

166
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.660
So I've got access to just one permit host to handle Ouda.

167
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.430
Ten, ten to ten is my administrator workstation.

168
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.130
In this example, it doesn't have to be an individual host.

169
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:51.260
We could specify an entire subnet here if you've got multiple administrators, all with source IP address

170
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.470
in the same subnet and to apply it to the terminal lines we see line.

171
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.360
Vickey Y 015.

172
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:03.150
We've got our login password and we've got our login command and our password command as usual.

173
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.490
And then we see ox's class one in to apply that access list.

174
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:15.870
Now, what happens is for a minister to be able to log in, you need to enter password that we configured

175
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.490
on the line and we need to be coming in from an approved IP address as well.

176
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:28.500
So if I try telnet into this device now and I'm not using IP address Tandoor OTA 10, I'm coming from

177
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.650
a different location.

178
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.620
The error message ofshe is connection diffused by remote host.

179
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:40.170
Well, we were talking about that, I said earlier, but for telnet access you need to configure an

180
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.960
IP address and you need to configure town to access under the line as well.

181
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:51.630
If you do not specify a login under your UI lines, then nobody is going to be able to telnet to that

182
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.110
device.
