00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.970
In this lecture, you�ll learn about VPNs, Virtual Private Networks. A private network uses links

2
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.990
which are dedicated for an individual organization.

3
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250
Local Area Networks are private networks.

4
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.790
You don't have another organization in your building using the links between your switches and routers.

5
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.320
Wide Area Networks can also use physical links, which are dedicated for an individual organization.

6
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.280
Looking at the example here, we've got a company with an office in New York and an office in Boston,

7
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.680
and they put in a physical link between New York and Boston, which is dedicated just for traffic between

8
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.120
those two offices.

9
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.760
Now, with this example, they're also going to want to have Internet connectivity as well, which they

10
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.890
don't have right now.

11
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.670
So, we could put in an Internet link from New York that will allow our New York users to get out to the

12
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.420
Internet, and for our users in Boston,

13
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.040
they could send their Internet traffic over to a private link to New York and then break out to the

14
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.210
Internet from there.

15
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.600
There are also lots of other network topologies that we could use for our WAN. We'll cover those throughout this

16
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.200
section.

17
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.210
A Virtual Private Network provides a virtual tunnel between private networks, like two offices

18
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.980
across a shared public network which will usually be the Internet, and traffic traveling over the tunnel

19
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.230
is encrypted and only readable by the authorized users on both sides.

20
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.370
You don't want to send confidential company information unencrypted over the Internet where anybody

21
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.120
sniffing that traffic is going to be able to read it.

22
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.880
So when you encrypt traffic, it doesn't stop people from sniffing and seeing the traffic, but because

23
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.680
it's encrypted, it's garbled and they're not going to be able to read what it actually says.

24
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.230
Users can share data over the tunnel as if they were connected with a dedicated private link.

25
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.750
So the example we've got here now, it's the same company.

26
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.010
They've got their office in New York, they've got their office in Boston,

27
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.030
and we put in an Internet link in both sites.

28
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.460
So, that gives them their Internet connectivity.

29
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.990
But they also want to be able to send that confidential corporate information between the two offices as

30
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.240
well,

31
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.270
so we need that to be secure. So. for that, we create a VPN tunnel between the two offices.

32
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.340
Now, all of our corporate traffic between the two offices goes through the tunnel.

33
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.430
It's encrypted, so nobody else can read it.

34
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.100
So a VPN, it's virtual because it's not an actual physical point-to-point link between the two offices,

35
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.440
and it's private because we encrypt the traffic to make sure that nobody else can read it.

36
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.200
VPNs allow an organization to use the same physical links for connectivity to the Internet and between

37
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.340
their offices. Because we use shared infrastructure, VPN connections are typically less expensive

38
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.480
than dedicated physical links.

39
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.800
So, a big selling point of VPN is its lower cost than using dedicated physical links between your

40
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.460
offices.

41
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:39.530
There's a couple of different types of VPN. We�ve got Site to Site VPN and Remote Access VPN. Site to Site VPN connections

42
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.550
are terminated on a router or firewall in each office.

43
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.220
Software does not need to be installed on user desktops.

44
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.960
So, in the example here, this can be our offices in New York and Boston again.

45
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.570
The configuration is all done on the firewall in this example, or it could be a router as well.

46
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.550
And then, our PCs in New York and our PCs in Boston, also between servers as well, that traffic goes

47
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.100
over the VPN tunnel.

48
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:17.390
We didn�t need to put on any extra software or make any changes to our PCs, and for Site to Site VPN tunnels,

49
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.260
we're going to be using typically IPsec for the encryption.

50
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:30.920
A Remote Access VPN connection is between a router or a firewall in the office and VPN software, which is installed

51
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.320
on an individual user's device.

52
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.670
For example, Cisco

53
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.150
AnyConnect is a VPN client software.

54
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.280
The user can access the VPN from anywhere with Internet connectivity.

55
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.350
So the user could be working at home, they could be in a hotel, they could be in an Internet cafe,

56
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.690
and this allows them to access their private files that are in the office over that VPN connection.

57
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.590
For Remote Access VPN, that usually uses SSL, which is Secure Sockets Layer.

58
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.310
Also, we can use IPsec again for the encryption here.

59
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.350
Now, our different configuration options, first up, and this is for Site to Site VPN.

60
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.710
First up, we've got an IPsec tunnel.

61
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.850
This is an open standard IPsec tunnel supportrf on all different vendors' devices.

62
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.690
This does not support multicast,

63
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.650
and a reason that you might want to allow multicast is, well, routing protocols use multicast.

64
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.100
So looking back at the diagram again, if we've got our offices in New York and Boston, and we've got

65
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.180
lots of different individual subnets inside New York and Boston as well, it would be nice if we could

66
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.230
advertise those to New York and Boston between each other over that VPN connection.

67
00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.980
If you're using an open standard IPsec connection between your offices, that does not support multicast.

68
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.460
So, you can't use a routing protocol to carry the information. You can still have connectivity between

69
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.760
them

70
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.740
but using static routes. Another way that we can do that connection which does support multicast

71
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.230
and routing protocols is we can use GRE over IPsec tunnel.

72
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.740
GRE stands for Generic Routing Encapsulation.

73
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.550
GRE is also a tunneling protocol as well.

74
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.930
You can use just GRE you on its own, but if you do that, it doesn't support encryption.

75
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.770
You can use IPsec on its own, but if you're using standard IPsec, it doesn't support multicast.

76
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.750
So by using GRE over IPsec, you combine the two together.

77
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.900
That way, you get the encryption from IPsec, and you also get the multicast support from GRE.

78
00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.480
Next way we can do the configuration is by using IPsec VTI.

79
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.580
VTI stands for a Virtual Tunnel Interface.

80
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.810
This is a Cisco proprietary simplified configuration which does support multicast.

81
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:16.800
So it's also IPsec, but it has to be between two different Cisco devices, slightly different configuration,

82
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.780
and then, it does support multicast.

83
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.820
IPsec VTI came out after the support for GRE over IPsec.

84
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:34.650
So, IPsec VTI is very often used for Site to Site VPN between Cisco devices. Some other newer configuration

85
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.180
options,

86
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.600
we've got DMVPN, which is Dynamic Multipoint VPN.

87
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.630
This is also Cisco proprietary.

88
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:49.680
This is a scalable, simple hub and spoke style configuration which enables direct full mesh connectivity

89
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.920
between all offices. So for the configuration,

90
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:59.670
let's say we've got our main offices in New York and we've got 20 smaller branch offices.

91
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.480
If we were going to use those earlier IPsec configuration options and we wanted to have a full mesh

92
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.980
of connectivity, we would have loads of VPN tunnels going everywhere.

93
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:18.900
If we use DMVPN from the branch offices, we just configure a VPN tunnel going to the hub site.

94
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.090
We don't need to configure tunnels directly between all our branches.

95
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:30.720
So, the configuration is hub and spoke. But for the actual traffic, what happens is the branches learn

96
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.679
how to get to each other from the hub site.

97
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.150
So when you send traffic from branch to branch, it goes directly from branch to branch without having

98
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.230
to go through the hub.

99
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.970
So, the configuration is simplified because you don't have to configure so many tunnels.

100
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.840
But the actual traffic, you do get that full mesh connectivity.

101
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.720
So traffic always goes over the best, most direct path. So, that's DMVPN.

102
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:02.340
Flex VPN is basically a newer version of DMVPN. It's very similar to it, that's newer technology.

103
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.680
The last one we have is GETVPN, which stands for Group Encrypted Transport VPN.

104
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.220
Again, this is Cisco proprietary.

105
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.550
This offers scalable centralized policy for VPN over in non-public infrastructure

106
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.110
so, not going over the Internet. This is often used over MPLS.

107
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.170
So, those are all the different configuration options,

108
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.320
but I'm not going to show you how to do them here.

109
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.980
The reason is you don't need to know that for CCNA,

110
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.880
and that's everything I need to cover here.

111
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.540
See you in the next lecture.
