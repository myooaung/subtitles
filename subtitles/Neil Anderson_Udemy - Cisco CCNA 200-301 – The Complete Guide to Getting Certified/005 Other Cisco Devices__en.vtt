00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:16.120
In this lecture, you'll learn about the other main product offerings that Cisco have other than their

2
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.380
routers and switches. The Cisco firewall is the ASA.

3
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.500
That's the Adaptive Security Appliance, and you can see a picture of one of those here.

4
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.850
The IPS, the Intrusion Prevention System, from Cisco is the SourceFire

5
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.410
FirePower IPS. That can be bought either as an appliance or, more commonly now, it will be either a 

6
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.290
software or a hardware module that lives inside the ASA Firewall.

7
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.960
Cisco also make wireless products as well.

8
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.870
They have Wireless LAN Controllers that you can see on the left here and Wireless Access Points that

9
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.420
you can see on the right.

10
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.830
The reason that they have Wireless LAN Controllers is that you get better scalability when you deploy

11
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.610
those, rather than having just lots of standalone and Wireless Access Points. For collaboration, 

12
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:33.110
Cisco have Unified Communications Manager. That is a software product, which is an IP-based PBX.

13
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.640
So, it replaces traditional PBXs, Private Branch Exchanges, which controlled the phones that you would

14
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.060
see in buildings a long time ago. 

15
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.420
A lot of modern companies still are using traditional PBXs, but IP PBXs are getting more and more

16
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.350
popular.

17
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.580
Cisco's Unified Communications Manager is one of the most popular IP PBXs that are available. If

18
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.720
you are going to be using the Cisco UCM to control your phones, 

19
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.669
you're also going to need to have IP phones on your desks. So, Cisco produce those as well.

20
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:19.070
You can see a picture of a typical Cisco IP phone on the left here. Cisco also do high-end, high-definition

21
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.110
video conferencing systems.

22
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.750
That's Cisco TelePresence, and you can see a picture of one of the available TelePresence models

23
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.580
on the right of the picture.

24
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.640
Another really popular product that Cisco have is Cisco WebEx, which is used for meetings.

25
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.700
Finally, there's also Data Center.

26
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.210
You can see a picture of the UCS blade server on the right here.

27
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.370
UCS stands for Unified Computing System, as well as the blade server that you see here. Cisco also

28
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.930
have standard rackmount servers as well.

29
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.690
With the UCS, Cisco moved into offering compute as well, where you can actually run your servers

30
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.660
directly on Cisco hardware.

31
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.590
The other main product that Cisco have for the Data Center market is the Nexus Switches.

32
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:23.610
These are very similar to the standard Cisco Switches, which run the IOS software.

33
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.850
They do exactly the same job, but these are often a bit higher-end switches, and they run the NX-OS 

34
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.090
software instead.

35
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.090
The commands in NX-OS and IOS are very similar, though. So after you've learned the information on

36
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.510
switching in this course,

37
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.890
you can pretty easily take those skills across to the Data Center as well.
