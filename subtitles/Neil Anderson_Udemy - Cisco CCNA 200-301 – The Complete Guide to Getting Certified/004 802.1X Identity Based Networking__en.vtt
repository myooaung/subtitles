00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:15.160
In this lecture, you'll learn about 802.1x Identity Based Networking. When 802.1x

2
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.930
is enabled, only authentication traffic is allowed on switch ports until the host and user

3
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.280
are authenticated.

4
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.580
Authentication traffic is sending a username and password. When the user has entered a valid username and

5
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.330
password,

6
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.490
the switch port transitions to a normal access port in the relevant VLAN. So it's easier to explain this

7
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.700
with a picture.

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.770
So you see the diagram here.

9
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.960
This gives us the terminology

10
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.260
as well. Over on the left, we've got the user sitting on a PC.

11
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.440
The PC is the supplicant in the 802.1x terminology.

12
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.380
So the operating system on there needs to support 802.1x. All modern operating systems like

13
00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.960
Windows,

14
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.010
Linux, etc., do support being an 802.1x supplicant. You're going to need to enable this

15
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.330
in the operating system.

16
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.290
The next setup, we have the access switch where the user is connected to. That is the authenticator.

17
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.530
We need to configure 802.1x suport on that access layer switch as well.

18
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.840
The final part in the jigsaw that we have is the authentication server.

19
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.880
If you use a server from Cisco, that could be the ACS, which is the older server, or the newer version

20
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.640
is the ICE, the Identity Services Engine.

21
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:45.100
So what happens if 802.1x is, the client plugs in to the access layer switch and at that point

22
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.020
they haven't authenticated yet.

23
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.080
So at that point they only get connectivity to the authentication server.

24
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.470
They don't get access to anywhere else in the network.

25
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.040
So it basically keeps them off the network until they authenticate.

26
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.760
They then enter their username and password.

27
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.120
The authenticator switch passes that information onto the authentication server and the authentication

28
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120
server will check

29
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.450
that is a valid username and password.

30
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.750
The authentication server is typically also integrated itself with an Active Directory domain controller,

31
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.570
which is where your user database is. Once the username and password has been authenticated, it's a

32
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.090
valid username and password that can be mapped to a VLAN as well.

33
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.790
The authentication server can then send that information down to the authenticator switch and it will

34
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.540
update the port that the client is plugged into with the correct VLAN. At that point, it acts just like a normal

35
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.150
switch port in the correct VLAN, and the user get their normal access to the network.

36
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.500
So 802.1x,

37
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.100
it's used to authenticate your users on the network.

38
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.050
They don't get access to the network at all until they do put in a valid username and password and at

39
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.700
that point they get given the relevant access for that particular user.

40
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.220
OK, that was our first three access layer switch security mechanisms.

41
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.060
I'll see you in the next lecture for port security.
