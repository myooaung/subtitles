00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.970
In this lecture, you'll learn about a basic initial configuration to put on your routers and switches.

2
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.160
One of the first things it will do is configure IP addresses. Your routers provide connectivity

3
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.820
between your different IP subnets.

4
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.280
That's their main job.

5
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.080
So the routers need to have interfaces in the different subnets, and they need to have IP addresses on

6
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.380
those interfaces.

7
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.910
Those IP addresses will act as the default gateway address for any hosts that are in that subnet.

8
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.730
The command to put an IP address on an interface,

9
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.760
first off, go to the interface. So you see an example here, we've got a router down at the bottom, interface

10
00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.410
FastEthernet0/0 on the right has got IP address 192.168.0.1/24, and the interface

11
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.010
on the left, FastEthernet0/1, has got IP address 192.168.1.1

12
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.810
/24.

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.950
Obviously, the IP addresses need to be in different subnets that are on different interfaces. The command

14
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.520
to do this from global configuration mode,

15
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.090
we then go to interface configuration mode.

16
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.130
So the command is 'interface FastEthernet0/0', then to put the IP address on there, 'ip address',

17
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.990
space,

18
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.000
'192.168.0.1', and then another space, and then the 'subnet mask 255.255.255.0'. The IP

19
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.840
address and the subnet mask are both entered with one command, and you have to enter the subnet mask in

20
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.700
full dotted decimal notation.

21
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:56.870
You can't enter /24 in IOS. On our routers, interfaces are shutdown by default, so remember to

22
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.200
also put in the 'no shutdown' command to bring the interface up. So we do that for interface

23
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.330
FastEthernet0/0, and then, we also need to configure interface FastEthenet0/1

24
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.970
for our example. It gets IP address 192.168.1.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0,

25
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.200
'no shutdown'.

26
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.720
After we have configured this, the router is going to be able to route traffic between those two networks.

27
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.510
As well as being able to route traffic,

28
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.950
it also gives IP connectivity to the router itself.

29
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.590
So after we've done this, we would be able to open up a Telnet or SSH client, like Putty, and connect

30
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.760
to the router to manage it.

31
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.440
So obviously, this is more convenient than having a walk down there with a console cable and hook it

32
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.140
up physically every time.

33
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.090
Once you've got IP addresses on your router, you'll be able to connect to those IP addresses to manage

34
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:07.820
the router remotely from wherever you are. We're also going to need an IP address on our switch to manage that

35
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.940
as well. A Layer 2 switch is not IP routing aware.

36
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:22.550
It does, however, support a single IP address which is used for management. So, you can't put multiple IP

37
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.530
addresses on a Layer 2 switch.

38
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.510
It will only allow you to put one IP address on there, and that's so we can again Telnet or Secure

39
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.000
Shell (SSH) to the switch remotely to manage it.

40
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:44.450
Unlike on a router, where we configure the IP address on an interface, on a switch, a Layer 2 switch,

41
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.280
the management IP address goes on a VLAN interface which is a virtual interface.

42
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.540
So when we configure our VLAN interface, that's called an SVI, Switched Virtual Interface,

43
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.690
and this is going to be in VLAN 1.

44
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.200
Now, I know we haven't covered VLAN's yet.

45
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.770
They're going to be configured in another section, for all you need to know for now is that the default

46
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.700
VLAN is VLAN 1, and all of our Layer 2 switch ports on a switch will be in VLAN 1 by

47
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.510
default.

48
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.150
So to get management connectivity to the switch, we configure out our management IP address on the

49
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.250
virtual VLAN 1 interface. That will allow us to connect to the switch from the same IP subnet

50
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.130
that the IP address is in,

51
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.950
but our administrators are probably going to be located somewhere else.

52
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.420
They're going to be in a different IP subnet, so this switch also needs to be able to get out to that subnet.

53
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.660
So just like a normal host would need,

54
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.620
it's also going to need to have a default gateway. Our configuration on our switch for our management IP

55
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.530
address, 'interface vlan 1', then we configure the IP address the same way.

56
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.750
So I've got IP address 192.168.0.10, subnet mask 255.255.255.0.

57
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.810
Now, on a router, interfaces are shut down by default. On a switch,

58
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.560
interfaces are enabled by default.

59
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.450
So there wasn't actually any need to do a 'no shutdown' here.

60
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.310
However, I'm just in the practice that whenever I configure an interface,

61
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.380
I always do a 'no shutdown' on there.

62
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.250
It doesn't do any harm, and it saves me having to think,

63
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.150
"Do I need to do a 'no shutdown' or not?"

64
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.210
Just always do a 'no shutdown' whenever you configure out an interface.

65
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.450
It saves you forgetting it. Then we exit back to global configuration mode, and to configure the default

66
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.200
gateway,

67
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.830
the command is 'ip default-gateway', for our example,

68
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.060
'192.168.0.1'. So that will give us IP connectivity on this switch, and we'll be able

69
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.880
to ping this switch now and ping out from the switch as well.

70
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.700
Now, I said that this IP address is for management.

71
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:07.080
We actually need to do some additional commands as well to allow Telnet and/or SSH access into the

72
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.890
switch.

73
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:15.110
We'll cover those in the later section, which is Securing Cisco Devices.

74
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.590
So, let's have a look at how to do this in the lab. For the lab

75
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:27.350
example, we've got router R1, and we're going to configure IP address 192.168.0.1

76
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.580
on the physical interface FastEthernet0/0.

77
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.210
That's going to be the default gateway address for our switch, which is SW1. SW1 is going

78
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.540
to be connected to the router through physical interface FastEthernet0/1, and that will

79
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:52.770
be in VLAN 1 by default. For the management IP address, we will configure that on the VLAN 1

80
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.980
Switched Virtual Interface. We'll give that IP address 192.168.0.10.

81
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.820
Once we've done that, the switch should have connectivity to 192.168.0.1

82
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.950
because it's on the same subnet. We want it to have connectivity to other subnets out through

83
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.660
the router, though. So we'll also configure the switch with an IP default gateway address of

84
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.890
192.168.0.1

85
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.980
Okay, let's have a look at this in the lab. So, I better configure the router first because it just got

86
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:34.770
a new configuration as well. So I'll go to enable on here, 'configure terminal' and let me just jump back

87
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:42.540
to the slide to check the IP address on here. Okay, so interface FastEthernet0/0, I'm going

88
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.030
to give that IP address 192.168.0.1.

89
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.890
So 'interface

90
00:07:51.450 --> 00:08:05.160
FastEthernet0/0', 'ip address 192.168.0.1', a space, and then I configure the subnet

91
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:13.260
mask, which was '255.255.255.0'. Now, this is a router, so the interface is shutdown by default, so I

92
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:21.840
have to remember to do a 'no shutdown' on here. Okay, so that's the router configured. Then if I go on to

93
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:32.760
the switch, 'enable' and 'configure terminal', and let's have a look at the diagram again. This was on the

94
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:51.760
VLAN interface, 192.168.0.10. So 'interface vlan 1', and 'ip address 192.168.0.10

95
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.260
255.255.255.0'.

96
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.560
And this is not shutdown by default anyway, but it doesn't do any harm.

97
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.730
I'm just in the habit of always doing a 'no shutdown' whenever I configure my interface.

98
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.570
Okay, so now the switch should be able to communicate with the router.

99
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.640
Let's check that.

100
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:24.940
So I'll go back down to the enable prompt, and I'll 'ping 192.168.0.1', and good,

101
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.100
we've got connectivity.

102
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.070
That's all good.

103
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.240
So, I've got connectivity on my 192.168.0.0 subnet.

104
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.390
But I want to be able to get out to other subnets as well,

105
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:41.440
so I need to configure the default gateway. The command for that is 'ip default-gateway',

106
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.970
and the router was at 192.168.0.1.

107
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:56.350
Okay, so that is the initial IP connectivity configured on there. So go back to the slides again,

108
00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:02.390
and I've made a note down here that this is how you configure a management IP address.

109
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:09.470
We actually have to do some additional commands to allow access via Telnet or SSH.

110
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.530
I'm not going to show you that here because it's covered in a later section, which is the Securing Cisco

111
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.800
Devices section.

112
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.430
But right now, I've got IP connectivity to switch, where I can do things, like do pings out from there. Okay,

113
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.270
next thing we want to do for the basic configuration is to configure a hostname. A descriptive hostname

114
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.640
makes it easier to identify the device.

115
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:40.580
For example, I could maybe call it New York-F1-Switch1.

116
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:48.640
So typically, you will specify where the Switch is, and maybe some other descriptive description on there

117
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.810
as well. In the lab,

118
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.890
I'm just going to call it hostname SW1 for Switch 1.

119
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.670
So let's jump back on the lab again and on my switch, notice right now,

120
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.870
the default hostname on a switch is just Switch.

121
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.090
So, that's what is showing up on the command prompt.

122
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:10.610
Now, when I enter 'hostname SW1' and hit enter.

123
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:16.580
Notice that the command prompt immediately changes to show the hostname.

124
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:24.370
This is useful because a really common mistake is to configure the wrong device by accident.

125
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.150
You notice on here,

126
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.620
I've got two different tabs open.

127
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.400
I've got a tab for R1 and a tab for SW1.

128
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:38.470
It's really easy when you're working from templates to paste the wrong config into the wrong command line. By

129
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.490
having the hostname showing up here,

130
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.210
It makes it a little bit less likely that you're going to do that.

131
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.640
So it gives you a nice description, you can see what device you're on.

132
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:54.260
Also, if you're doing troubleshooting from neighboring devices, then it will show up as its

133
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.060
hostname as well,

134
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.940
so it just makes it easy to see what's going on.

135
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.780
Okay, back to the slides again.

136
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:08.320
Next thing we're going to want to do is configure descriptions on our interfaces. So, interface

137
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.110
FastEthernet 0/1 was connected to the router,

138
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.270
so let's put a description on there.

139
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:23.000
Back to the command line again, I go to interface FastEthernet 0/1, and I'll say 'description

140
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.400
Link to R1'.

141
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.380
Again, this is going to be useful for troubleshooting later. If I'm doing some troubleshooting and I'm

142
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:38.110
looking at the configuration on here, I can immediately see that FastEthernet 0/1 is the

143
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.750
interface that's connected to router R1.
