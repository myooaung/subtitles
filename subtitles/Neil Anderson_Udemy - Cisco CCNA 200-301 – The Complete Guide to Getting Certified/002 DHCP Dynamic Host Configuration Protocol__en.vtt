00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:14.990
In this lecture, you'll learn about DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It's a client/server protocol

2
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.680
that automatically provides a host with its IP address and other related configuration

3
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.570
information like its subnet mask and default gateway. The DHCP clients obtain their IP configuration

4
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.030
information from server, rather than being manually configured.

5
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.720
So, this can save you a lot of legwork.

6
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.600
If you look on my PC here, let's look at how to manually configure an IP address.

7
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.160
This is on a Windows host.

8
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.660
So in Control Panel,

9
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.460
I'll go to the network settings,

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.530
I'll find my network card, go to the properties, and then the Internet Protocol version 4, so the IPv4,

11
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.250
properties.

12
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.580
And in here, I can see that it's selected to obtain an IP address automatically.

13
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.690
That means that my laptop is currently a DHCP client.

14
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.930
If I wanted to manually set an IP address on here, I could choose the other radio button to use the following

15
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.640
IP address and manually type in an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and the DNS server,

16
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.720
but I don't want to do that.

17
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.860
I want it to automatically receive it from the DHCP server, so I will just cancel out of here.

18
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:40.470
How DHCP works is the client sends a DHCP Discover message, which is broadcast traffic.

19
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.830
The DHCP server will then reply back with a DHCP Offer, but it's not completed yet.

20
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.600
The client will then reply back with a DHCP Request,

21
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.200
and then finally, the DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledgement to the client.

22
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.270
At that point, the client will have its IP information, like the IP address, etc.

23
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.130
So the benefits that we get from using DHCP, well, I just showed you there a minute ago about how we

24
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.290
can manually configure an IP address.

25
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.440
Imagine if you worked in a large campus where you had 5000 hosts there.

26
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.990
It would obviously be super inconvenient to physically walk around all 5000 hosts and manually configure

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.810
them with an IP address.

28
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.300
Also, if you did that, it's very likely on some of them you would accidentally make a misconfiguration

29
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.430
like a typo or accidentally enter some duplicate IP addresses.

30
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:51.790
By using a DHCP server, that gives you centralized and automated IP configuration in that one central location,

31
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.940
and you know that you're not going to have any mistakes happening,

32
00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.240
much easier than manually assigning an IP address to all your individual hosts.

33
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.000
You can also add additional IP configuration values by using DHCP options.

34
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.990
For example, if you're using IP phones in your office, they need to learn where their server is.

35
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.260
That's their TFTP server.

36
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.770
Well, you can give them that information using DHCP.

37
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.670
It gives efficient handling of clients that must be updated frequently, such as laptops that move

38
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.260
to different locations on a wireless network. In your campus, different physical areas of the network

39
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.010
are going to have different IP subnets and different VLANs.

40
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.370
It would be really inconvenient if you had to manually change the IP address on your laptop every time

41
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.920
you move to a different location in the network.

42
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.270
By using DHP, the laptop will automatically be updated with a correct IP address.

43
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.430
And lastly, the forwarding of initial DHCP messages by using a DHCP relay agent eliminates the need

44
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.350
for a DHCP server on every subnet.

45
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.930
So in a large campus where you do have multiple subnets, you don't need to build a DHCP server on every

46
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.760
single one. You'll have one centralized DHCP server, maybe two for redundancy, and they will have different

47
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.070
scopes for the different subnets.

48
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.890
And whenever a client comes online, it will automatically be given an IP address for the correct subnet.

49
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.770
You'll see how that works later on in this section.

50
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.170
We mentioned earlier that you have all of those benefits of it being more convenient using a DHCP server,

51
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:52.730
it also stops you from accidentally putting in a typo or configuring duplicate IP addresses.

52
00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:02.780
The kinds of clients that will be DHCP clients, well, desktop PCs and laptops are good candidates to be

53
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.070
DHCP clients because typically, you're going to have a lot of those in the office.

54
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.070
You don't want to have to manually go and configure them all.

55
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.670
Using DHCP saves you having to do that. And your normal desktop PC,

56
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.550
it will make outgoing connections to the Internet and to other internal hosts, other internal servers

57
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.300
in your network,

58
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.950
but it's not going to be taking direct incoming connections.

59
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.160
You're not running any services on there, so you're never going to have somebody outside it directly

60
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.540
connecting to that host.

61
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.450
So, it doesn't need to have a fixed IP address.

62
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.220
It doesn't matter if the IP addresses changes over time,

63
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.280
and that can happen with DHCP. Your servers and network infrastructure devices,

64
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.280
on the other hand, like your routers, your switches, and your firewalls, are not good candidates to

65
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.630
be DHCP clients.

66
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.720
They're mission-critical devices that are required for the running of the network and for its services to

67
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.380
function.

68
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.470
Their IP addresses are going to be fixed.

69
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.240
They have to stay the same because they're going to be accepting incoming connections.

70
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.290
So you're going to manually configure them to make sure that they never change,

71
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.540
and also, you don't want them to be reliant on the DHCP server to be up and running.

72
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.500
Okay, so that was an introduction to DHCP.

73
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.740
In the next lecture, we'll start talking about what our different options are to actually implement

74
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.100
this.
