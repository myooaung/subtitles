00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:14.720
In this lecture, you'll learn about the syntax of our access control list commands and the meanings

2
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.130
of the different options. So, we go to global config to create an access list. Here,

3
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.230
we have said access-list 100

4
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.210
So as you learned in the last lecture, you know that this is going to be an extended ACL.

5
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.850
Then if we use the context-sensitive help, so I put in a question mark after that to see what my options are.

6
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.820
I can deny or I can permit.

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.270
I also get an option to put a remark in here as well.

8
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.540
It's a good idea to include remarks in your ACL.

9
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.410
This is because in production environments, the ACLs can get to be really long.

10
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.590
And if somebody else comes in and looks at the ACL after you, it's not going to be obvious why all

11
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.180
the different lines are there for. For example, let's say that currently you've got an extranet connection

12
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.640
to a business partner.

13
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.670
So you put a line in your ACL to permit that traffic. Well maybe two years down the line, they're not a

14
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.650
business partner anymore.

15
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.560
And if another administrator is looking at the ACL, they're not going to know what that line was there

16
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.010
for.

17
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.370
And they're not going to remove it because it would maybe do some damage.

18
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.670
If you'd put on the remark in there explaining what the access control entry line is for, they would

19
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.440
know it's not required anymore and that they can safely remove it. After that,

20
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.960
the next thing we have is the protocol. The different protocols that you can put in here,

21
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:54.080
it's not just TCP and UDP. Also routing protocols are included as well, like EIGRP and OSPF. They relate

22
00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.190
to IP but they are not actually a TCP or a UDP protocol themselves. They've their own protocol.

23
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.570
So if you want to control your EIGRP or OSPF traffic, if it is going to be allowed to come in and go out,

24
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.570
then you can specify that in your ACL.

25
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.000
Other options included in here are ICMP for your ping traffic.

26
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.250
Also some of our VPN protocols as well, like ESP.

27
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.600
You'll learn about VPN or virtual private networks in our later lecture.

28
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:38.380
When you're specifying the protocol, use TCP or UDP, if you want that access control entry to apply to traffic

29
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.150
for a particular application between a source and a destination.

30
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:52.420
So the example here, which is access-list 100 deny tcp 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.50.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80

31
00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:01.360
access-list 100 deny tcp 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.50.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80. So this would be HTTP traffic between those two

32
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.610
networks that we're going to deny.

33
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.300
So when it's a particular application, specify TCP or UDP and then you'll have the port number at the

34
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.700
end so you can say what the application is.

35
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.420
One of the options for our protocols was also IP.

36
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.390
So we've got TCP, we've got UDP, and there's also IP.

37
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.400
Use IP if you want the ACE to apply to all traffic between a source and destination address.

38
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.390
So not a particular TCP or UDP application, but all IP traffic between these two parts of your network.

39
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.580
As an example, there would be

40
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.220
access-list 100 deny ip 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.50.0 0.0.0.255

41
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.480
So if I go back a slide, you see the first example where we use TCP.

42
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.170
It was traffic between those through networks which was HTTP web traffic.

43
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.100
The second example is all traffic.

44
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.250
We don't care about the application, so we use IP there.

45
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.660
The next keyword in our access list

46
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.470
command is the source.

47
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.540
So you can specify a source address in the format of dot decimal notation, or you can say any to specify

48
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.730
any source host or host to say a single source host. So this,

49
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.000
those wildcards,

50
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.620
save you typing out the entire wildcard mask every time.

51
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.010
And there's a couple of examples down below that mean the same thing.

52
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.970
So first off, if we wanted to specify an individual host, we could say 

53
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.750
access-list 100 permit tcp 10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0. It's a wildcard mask

54
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.520
so that equals a subnet mask of 255.255.255.255, meaning we're matching on every single octet

55
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.820
here,

56
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.530
we're looking for a particular host.

57
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.470
But rather than having I type out 0.0.0.0,

58
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.060
we could just say

59
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.130
access-list 100 permit tcp host 10.10.10.10

60
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.350
So it's easier when you use the wildcard. There's also a wildcard for any.

61
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.180
So rather than saying

62
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.200
access-list 100 permit tcp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255,

63
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.580
So that wildcard mask says we don't care about any of the octets, we'll match anything.

64
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.940
An easier way is to say is access-list 100 permit tcp any, meaning any IP address.

65
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.660
Next up, we have the source port number.

66
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:45.530
So in here, you can say eq to say match an exact individual source port number, or you can say

67
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.980
less than a particular number, greater than a particular number.

68
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.000
You can also specify a range in here as well.

69
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.500
You can also say neq, meaning it's not this particular port number.

70
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.710
Specifying the source port number is optional and it defaults to any port. And very often when traffic

71
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.410
is coming from a host, it is going to use an ephemeral port, which is just a random high number port

72
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.830
number.

73
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.370
It's the destination port that we're more likely to be interested in.

74
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.160
For example, part 80 for HTTP.

75
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.890
Next up, after specifying the source details, we specify the destination details, beginning with the

76
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.730
IP address and this is in the same format as the source address.

77
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.220
Then finally, we have the final options.

78
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.550
So in here, we can also specify the port number so we can say eq. For example, eq 80

79
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.930
for HTTP traffic.

80
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.640
We can also say greater than a particular port number or match everything above that.

81
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.030
We can also say less than.

82
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:58.280
There's also additional options we can enter in here, such as TCP flags, such as the urgent flags,

83
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.880
and if we want to do logging or not.

84
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:11.900
When we specify the destination port, the command line has got well-known port numbers built in, where

85
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:19.460
you can use a name. For example, you could say eq 80 or you could say eq www, or you could

86
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:25.010
say eq 23, or you could say eq telnet because 23 is the port for telnet.

87
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.580
Both of those will work just fine.

88
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.890
So you can say eq 80 or eq www. They're both valid and they'll both work.

89
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:41.390
So here is an example of a complete access control entry. I said

90
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.120
access-list 100 deny tcp host 10.10.10.10 10.10.20.0 0.0.0.255 eq www log

91
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.900
access-list 100 deny tcp host 10.10.10.10 10.10.20.0 0.0.0.255 eq www log

92
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.840
So on those final options, you can specify more than one. Here,

93
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:06.530
we specified the destination port and we said log as well. To verify your ACLs, after you've put the whole

94
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.780
config in, the command is

95
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.490
show access-list

96
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.190
If you say show access-list, that will show all of your different ACLs and it is common on production

97
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.600
routers that there will be multiple ACLs there because there is going to be different rules for which traffic you

98
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.430
want to allow or deny on one interface than it is on a different interface.

99
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.230
So in that case, you would have a different ACL for the two different interfaces.

100
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:36.169
So quite often we want to specify the particular access-list that we want to look at so we don't get too

101
00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:36.919
much output.

102
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.360
So here we have said show access-list 100 and it tells me it's Extended

103
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.980
IP access list 100.

104
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.400
The lines in there are  Tand octane.

105
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.040
permit tcp host 10.10.30.10 host 10.10.20.1 eq telnet

106
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.160
permit tcp host 10.10.30.10 host 10.10.20.1 eq telnet

107
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.950
So it shows you all of the lines in your ACL.

108
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.540
And another really useful thing in the output here is it shows how many matches that you got.

109
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.720
This is really useful in troubleshooting.

110
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:10.970
So if you've got an ACL applied to an interface and traffic that should be going through that interface

111
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:17.960
is not being allowed and you're not sure if it's the ACL that's blocking it or there's maybe some other kind

112
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.300
of connectivity issue,

113
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.480
If you do this,

114
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:20.730
Come on.

115
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:26.090
It will tell you because it tells you if you're getting matches or not. So, if the traffic isn't

116
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.750
working,

117
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:32.330
you just show access-list and you keep trying to send the traffic through and you can see the counter here incrementing

118
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:32.930
then yes,

119
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.850
it is being blocked because of the ACL.

120
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.250
If a number is not going up then it must be something else

121
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.920
that's causing the issue.

122
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:48.260
Notice here that we did not specify the log keyword on there. So the log keyword is not required to log

123
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.630
those hit counts that you see in the end there.

124
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.480
The log keyword is used to log to the console or to an external monitoring server.

125
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:05.420
OK, so that was it about how to configure our ACLs and how to verify them.

126
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:11.000
But we've still got some more information about ACLs to learn, so I'll see you for that in the next

127
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.480
lecture.
