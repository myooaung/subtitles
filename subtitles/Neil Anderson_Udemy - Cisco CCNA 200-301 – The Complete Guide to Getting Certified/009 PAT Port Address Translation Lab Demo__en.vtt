00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.260
In this lecture, you'll see how to configure that PAT, Port Address Translation with a lab demo.

2
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:21.810
The scenario here is that we've cleared out all of the old NAT config from the previous lectures.

3
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.790
Going with a new scenario here.

4
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.480
So this is a small office.

5
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.680
We don't have any internal servers that they need to configure static NAT for.

6
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.060
They don't have a pool of public IP addresses.

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.270
They're just getting their public IP address on their outside fa0/0 interface from DHCP.

8
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.010
And that's not guaranteed to stay the same.

9
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.910
The service provider could change it at any time.

10
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.510
So because of that, we want our hosts from the inside to be able to get out to the outside.

11
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.860
So we're going to need to configure NAT for that.

12
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.180
And we're going to NAT them to whatever happens to be the IP address on the outside interface right

13
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.500
now.

14
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.180
We also need to configure overload as well because we've got multiple hosts on the inside.

15
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.010
We want them all to be able to share that same outside IP address.

16
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.550
So let's configure this.

17
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.870
So I will go on to my router, which is R1.

18
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.400
And let's have a look and see what the IP address is right now.

19
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.750
So do a show ip interface brief.

20
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.770
And you can see on my outside interface, it is using DHCP.

21
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.480
And currently it's using IP address 203.0.113.13.

22
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.870
But like I said, we don't want to use the IP address in our configuration because it might change.

23
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.400
We're going to use the interface instead, which is fa0/0.

24
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.800
So first things to do are to configure our NAT interfaces as usual.

25
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.590
So I'll go to global config and interface fa0/0

26
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.670
is IP NAT outside and interface fa2/0

27
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.820
is where my inside hosts are.

28
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.620
So that's IP NAT inside.

29
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.410
Next thing I need to do is to configure my NAT rule and my access list. So specify the host on the

30
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:39.390
inside. I'll say access-list 1 permit, they're on subnet 10.0.2.0 with a wildcard of

31
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.720
0.0.0.255.

32
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.190
And then my NAT rule, I say ip nat inside source list 1 meaning I'm referencing access-list 1 that

33
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.260
I just configured.

34
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.290
And rather than mapping this through a pool, I can't do that.

35
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.600
I haven't configured a pool.

36
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:06.300
I'm going to map it to the interface, interface fa0/0. And I could hit enter here but then that

37
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:14.520
would be just my standard Dynamic NAT without overload. So that's only one host on the inside would be able

38
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.080
to get out.

39
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.240
So I need to also remember to put in the overload

40
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:27.260
keyword to enable PAT. The router is now going to map the NAT translation's by IP address and port

41
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.200
number as well.

42
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.360
And it's going to track those so that when traffic comes back, it knows which host to send it back

43
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.560
to.

44
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.150
So that's the whole configuration.

45
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.320
We just need to check it now.

46
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:47.070
So let's do a debug so we can watch what's happening. So I'll do a debug ip nat and then I'll go

47
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.470
on to a host on the inside. Check

48
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.860
that traffic can get out.

49
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.370
I'll telnet 203.0.113.20.

50
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.300
Let's have a look back at the network diagram again.

51
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.720
So that's the host on the outside. 203.0.113.20,

52
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.400
that's a web server on the outside.

53
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.840
I've already set that up and it's going to accept incoming connections on port 80.

54
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.519
I need to check that may NAT rule is actually working, so I'll go on to PC1 and I'll telnet to it

55
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.290
on port 80 and

56
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.040
that's open.

57
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.030
So that looks good.

58
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.500
And if I look know on R1 because I enabled my debug,

59
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:40.230
I can see that the traffic came from 10.0.2.10. That is PC1 and it was NAT'd to the IP address

60
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.140
of 203.0.113.13.

61
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.660
That's my public IP address on the outside that was learned through DHCP.

62
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.790
And I can see the source port that was used originally from the host

63
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.920
was 53386.

64
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.200
And that was NAT'd to a source port number of 4096.

65
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:08.180
And it's going out to 203.0.113.20 on destination port 80.

66
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.260
So that all looks good.

67
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.170
Let's also send traffic out from PC2. So I'll also telnet out from here to

68
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.340
203.0.113.20 on port 80.

69
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:32.700
And if I look back on my router again, I can see that it came from PC2 10.0.2.11 and it's going

70
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.170
out to 203.0.113.20.

71
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.840
The source IP address was NAT'd to 203.0.113.13.

72
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.880
So I'm reusing that same single public IP address that I've got.

73
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.670
And this one, the original source port from the host was 11561, and that was translated

74
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.550
to 4097.

75
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.910
So it's going to be able to track return traffic based on IP address on port number.

76
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.280
It's all going to be going back to the same IP address, but it's going to be going back to different

77
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.090
port numbers.

78
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:22.800
If I do a show ip nat translations, I can see that the return traffic is all going to be coming back

79
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.320
to 203.0.113.13.

80
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:35.160
But when it's going to port 4096, the router knows to send that to 10.0.2.10. When it's going to port 4097,

81
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.820
the router knows to send that to 10.0.2.11.

82
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.030
OK, so that was it.

83
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.180
That was the entire NAT configuration. You've seen how to

84
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.490
verify it as well for Static NAT, Dynamic NAT and PAT as well.

85
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.020
So that was done with NAT.

86
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.910
See you in the next section.
