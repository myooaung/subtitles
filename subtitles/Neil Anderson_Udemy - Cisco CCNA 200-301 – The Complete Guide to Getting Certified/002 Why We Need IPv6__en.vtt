00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.530
In this lecture, you'll learn about why we need to have IPv6. You already know the main reason

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.560
from earlier lectures, which is that we're running out of global IPv4 addresses.

3
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.000
But you saw in the last lecture that we can use NAT, Network Address Translation, as a workaround.

4
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.270
So why can't we just use NAT permanently?

5
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:39.410
Well, the problem is that there are some issues with NAT. The main one being that it breaks the standard

6
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
end-to-end IP model, the way the IP normally works.

7
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.950
And that can cause issues with security and it can also break some applications.

8
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.510
To give you an example, looking at the diagram here, we've got Company A and we've got Company B. And

9
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.630
they've both got IP phones internally and they do a lot of business with each other.

10
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.000
So they would like to be able to make phone calls to each other over their IP network rather than doing

11
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.320
it through the normal phone company because that will save them money.

12
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.910
So Company A has got their CUCM. That's a Cisco

13
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.810
Unified Communications Manager that controls the phones.

14
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.660
I'll just call it the Call Manager for short and Company B has got their Call Manager as well.

15
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.140
And what company A and Company B can do is they can program their Call Managers to point to each other.

16
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.030
So that calls between the two companies can go over the IP network.

17
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.910
But when they're using NAT, there is going to be a problem with this.

18
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.090
And this is very common with multimedia applications like voice and video.

19
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
And NAT is typically going to stop the traffic.

20
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.950
It's going to break it.

21
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.450
So let's walk through what's going to happen so you can see the issue here.

22
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.950
So I've got an IP phone at Company A. It's extension 10-1001.

23
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.840
It's using a private IP address of 10.0.0.10.

24
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.830
And if that IP phone send traffic out to the Internet, let's say that it would use Dynamic NAT and for this example,

25
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.370
it's going to get NAT'd to 203.0.113.10. So the IP phones,

26
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.550
they're not intelligent enough to make their own decisions.

27
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.240
They need to ask the Call Manager for help with that. So the user at extension 10-1001

28
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.260
at Company A, he wants to call the user at extension 11-2001 at Company B. So he picks up his handset

29
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.050
and he dials 11-2001. That sends signalling message to the Call Manager saying, "Hey,

30
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.630
I'd like to call 11-2001 please."

31
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.720
It comes from the private IP address 10.0.0.10 and it goes to the Call Manager's private

32
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.900
IP address of 10.0.0.100.

33
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.460
So that all works just fine.

34
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.860
Everything's internal in Company A right now.

35
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.370
The Call Manager at Company A then look at its dial plan which was configured by the administrator,

36
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.190
and it sees that whenever there's a call for anything starting with 11 and then four additional

37
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.810
digits, to send that call to the Company B Call Manager, which is available with the public IP address

38
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.630
of 203.0.113.20.

39
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.320
So the Call Manager sends signaling to Company B's Call Manager saying, "Hey, there's a

40
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.770
call for 11-2001 and it's coming from the phone at 10.0.0.10.

41
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.280
That traffic comes from the Call Manager's IP address of 10.0.0.100.

42
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.270
And it goes to Company B's Call Manager at 203.0.113.20.

43
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.550
The traffic will reach Router A and Router A will NAT the source address of Company A's Call Manager to

44
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.820
10.0.0.100 to the public IP address 203.0.113.3.

45
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.680
Because on Router A we've configured a Static NAT rule for that. The traffic will then get to Router B over at

46
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.980
Company B and it will NAT the destination address of 203.0.113.20 to

47
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:40.690
the internal private IP address of 10.0.10.100 because Company B Router B also has a Static

48
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.450
NAT rule for Company B's Call Manager.

49
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:53.610
So the signal comes in to the Call Manager at Company B and it knows the extension 11-2001 is available

50
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.380
at IP address 10.0.10.10.

51
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.470
And so it sends a signalling message down to the IP phone saying, "Hey, there's a call coming in

52
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.430
for you. Please ring." Then the user at extension 11-2001,

53
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.000
here's their phone ringing. So they pick up the handset.

54
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.990
The phone will then send a signal back to the Company

55
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.730
B Call Manager saying, "Hey, the user has picked up and we're ready for the call now."

56
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.800
The company B Call Manager then need to send a signal back to the Company A Call Manager saying, "Hey,

57
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:36.910
extension 11-2001 is ready for the call and its IP address 10.0.10.10." That

58
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.190
goes from 10.0.10.100 at Call Manager B to 203.0.113.3,

59
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.200
the public IP address of Call Manager A.

60
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:53.790
Router B sends the traffic out and it will NAT the source address of 10.0.10.100,

61
00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.630
the Company B Call Manager, to 203.0.113.20. It will then get to Router A and it will

62
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.560
NAT the destination address 203.0.113.3 to 10.0.0.100.

63
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:12.660
So all the traffic is working just fine now and NAT is allowing us to have private IP addresses on

64
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.830
the inside and those fixed static public addresses on the outside

65
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:25.110
for our Call Managers. Call Manager A then sends that signalling message to phone A saying, "OK, the phone is

66
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:34.390
ready to stream your voice directly to 10.0.10.10, which is the IP address of the phone at Company B.

67
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:43.320
And Call Manager B tells phone B to stream your voice to 10.0.0.10, which is the IP address of the

68
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.090
phone at Company A.

69
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:53.240
But the problem is that the phones only have connectivity to each other on their NAT'd public IP addresses,

70
00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:02.450
not via the internal private addresses. Phone A at 10.0.0.10 does not have connectivity to 10.0.10.10

71
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.150
over at company B.

72
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.720
Those are two different private IP addresses that only work internally at Company A and internally at

73
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.310
Company B. They don't work between the two different companies.

74
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.790
So for the two phones to be able to communicate with each other, they have to be using a public IP address,

75
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:29.000
which would be NAT'd on both sides. But because the information was included in the higher level

76
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.780
traffic within our voice protocols, the phones don't know to use a public IP address.

77
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.080
They're told to use that private IP address.

78
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.290
There's no connectivity, so the call fails. It doesn't work.

79
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:51.800
Now, there can be workarounds for this. Devices such as application layer firewalls, which can look up that

80
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.640
higher layer traffic, see what's going on in there and make adjustments.

81
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:04.130
Also, traversal servers and proxy servers can help with these issues. But NAT does break the way that

82
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.480
IP works normally.

83
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:13.670
And it does break applications that use embedded IP addresses or port numbers in the higher OSI layers.

84
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:20.750
So it would be a cleaner solution if IP supported an addressing scheme which was big enough to give

85
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.280
all devices in the world a publicly reachable address.

86
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.590
That way the phones inside the two companies would have a publicly reachable address to get to each

87
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.000
other and the call would work.

88
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.070
So how can we do that?

89
00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.320
Well, we've got IPv6.

90
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:45.500
It uses a 128-bit address compared to IPv4's 32-bit address. And it provides way, way, way

91
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.570
more addresses than IPv4 does.

92
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.450
The address is 4x longer, but it's much more than 4x as many addresses,

93
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.110
7.9x10 to the power of 28. A very big number.

94
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.130
There are other IPv6 enhancements as well.

95
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.170
So in addition to the larger address space, IPv6 was designed to support building security and also

96
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:14.870
host mobility, where a host can keep the same IP address but move to different physical locations.

97
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:24.450
OK, last to tell you here is that wherever you're going to use IPv6, IPv6 and IPv4, it's

98
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.950
not an either/or decision.

99
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:35.370
You don't have to use IPv4 or IPv6, you can use IPv4 and IPv6. In a dual stack implementation,

100
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:43.200
a network interface on a host or on a router can have both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address at the same

101
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.560
time.

102
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.520
It can then communicate using either protocol.

103
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:56.100
So if the application sends traffic to an IPv4 destination address, it will use IPv4. If the application

104
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:03.720
sends traffic to an IPv6 destination address, it will use IPv6. Dual stack can be enabled long term.

105
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:11.580
If you do need to support both IPv4 and IPv6 applications or it can be used shorter term if you're

106
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.020
using it as an IPv4 to IPv6 transition strategy.

107
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:24.690
OK, those are the limitations of NAT and how IPv6 doesn't suffer from them. In the next lecture will

108
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.290
start getting into more details about how IPv6 works.
