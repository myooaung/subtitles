00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.110
In this lecture, you'll learn about how to configure to slog through a lab.

2
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.960
Damul The lab topology is really simple.

3
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.680
I've just got my router one with IP address Tandoor Odah 0.01, and I've got my log server at 10 or

4
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.010
100.

5
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.770
That's marked as the animation system in the diagram.

6
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.150
It's the network monitoring system.

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.490
OK, so right now I'm going to tell you about that terminal Morna IRCAM on the last thing that we covered

8
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:46.110
in the last lecture to if you have a look at my PC, I'm actually on Tando Order at one hundred now

9
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.550
and I've got a continuous paying that is pinging the R-1 router.

10
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.730
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up a party telnet session to that I or I'm opening up

11
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:14.190
party and I'm going to tell that to tandoor order order one and I'm going to log in here with my passwords

12
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.050
and enable a password in there as well.

13
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.740
And while I'm here, I want to have a control session open in the background.

14
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:32.580
So this big window here, I'm connected over a console session and this smaller window is the town that

15
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.760
session that I just opened.

16
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.840
So I want to see you to see how the logging is going to be different here.

17
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.110
So in my telnet session, I'm going to debug IP ICMP and this is going to do it's going to debug those

18
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.490
pings that are coming in.

19
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.330
I should see every time that a ping is received and every time I reply as well, and because it's a

20
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.310
debug, it's going to be up there and continuously in real time.

21
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.800
But the thing is that I haven't entered the terminal M�rner command yet, so it's not going to show

22
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.630
up in my telnet session.

23
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.290
So when I hit Enter here, you'll see that logging is enabled on the console by default and the big

24
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.970
window in the background to console.

25
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.410
I can see the debugging output showing up in there, but in my telnet window, because I'm logging is

26
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.280
not enabled by default and telnet, I don't see anything.

27
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.740
And this can be really confusing when you first start working with debugged because you enter a debug

28
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.900
command and you'll get new output and you'll think, oh, I'm not receiving any pings and it's going

29
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.800
to be something like that.

30
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.570
But actually it's just that you haven't turned on the logging output.

31
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.650
So the way that you do that is in your telnet window or your window.

32
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.090
The command, the enable prompt is terminal monitor.

33
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.800
So I'll do that.

34
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.240
And now I should see.

35
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.910
There you go.

36
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.910
The debugged start coming in.

37
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.590
OK, so whenever you're debugging in a town that our associate Cheche and remember in the terminal.

38
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.340
M�rner, come on.

39
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.190
So you can actually see the output.

40
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.040
OK, the way to stop the debugging, if you want to turn off all debugging, then you can type in undie

41
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.040
bugel or Reshat, which is just you all, and that will turn off all debugging.

42
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.280
You might see a little bit if I come in after that, just as it's finishing up as the debugging turned

43
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.520
off.

44
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.360
OK, so that was the terminal monitor command.

45
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.820
The other thing I told you about the end was in logging Synchronoss.

46
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.310
So let's go into our console window here and I'll go config TI.

47
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:59.160
And what I'll do is currently interface Fast's three swash zero is shut down, so I will do a no shot.

48
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.210
And then as soon as I enter command, I'm going to start entering a new command.

49
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.580
So I'll do do your IP interface.

50
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.410
OK, you see what happened there.

51
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:21.390
So in the middle of me typing a command, I'm seeing some logging out there and it makes it really hard

52
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.930
to see exactly where I am in that command.

53
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.100
It's confusing.

54
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.630
So I'm like, oh, where was I?

55
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.590
And not command.

56
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.070
And usually what you'll end up doing is you'll just end up hating the backspace to clear it and enter

57
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.780
and then start the command again.

58
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.420
And it's a little bit annoying to what you can do to prevent not behavior is go to your control line.

59
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.910
So I'll goal line console zero and enter logging Synchronoss there.

60
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.190
And I also want to do it for when I'm connected in over S.H. or Telnet.

61
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.620
So I'll go line Vickey with 015 and hit the portal to enter and logging Synchronoss there as well.

62
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.550
So now what happens.

63
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.060
I'll do.

64
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.170
The same thing, so I will do a shot this time and then start.

65
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.040
I need to have interface to interface fast three swash zero.

66
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.620
I'll do a shut down and then start typing.

67
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.820
Do your IP interface to see what happened.

68
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.850
No, it doesn't put the logging right in the middle of my line, making it hard to see what I am.

69
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.930
It still shows the logging output, but once it's done that, it prints where I was.

70
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.800
I began in a new line so I can see exactly where I was.

71
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.740
So a couple of things you always want to do there.

72
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.040
So that was always enable logging Synchronoss on your console and your UI lines.

73
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.020
And also when you're debugging over a telnet session, remember who in the command terminal monitor.

74
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.930
OK, so that was voice first your commands.

75
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.840
I think this video has been going on a little while already.

76
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.320
So let's wrap this one up here and I'll cover doing this just log configuration in the next lecture.
