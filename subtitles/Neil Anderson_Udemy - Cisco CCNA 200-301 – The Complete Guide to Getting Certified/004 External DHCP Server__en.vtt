00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:16.010
In this lecture, you'll learn about how to configure a Cisco router to support an external DHCP server.

2
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.580
So you learned in the last lecture, for small branch offices, we'll often configure our Cisco router as

3
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:31.280
a DHCP server to save buying an external router. But in larger offices where we've got several subnets,

4
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.560
then typically, we'll have an external DHCP server there.

5
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.270
Maybe two of them for redundancy as well.

6
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.410
So, that's what we've got in the example here.

7
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.260
We've got an external DHCP server.

8
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.280
We've got the same topology as the last lecture.

9
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:53.630
So I've got R1, and our PCs are in the 10.10.10.0 subnet, but we're not going to configure

10
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.140
a DHCP scope on R1 here.

11
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.410
The DHCP requests are going to be served by our DHCP and DNS server, which is at 10.10.20.10.

12
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.520
But we've got a problem here,

13
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.180
so let's see what the problem is.

14
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.890
So, PC2 gets powered on. It doesn't have an IP address yet, so it's configured as a DHCP client.

15
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:27.290
So it sends out a DHCP request, that is broadcast traffic. It hits the switch and the switch will forward it out

16
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.270
all ports apart from the one it was received on because it's broadcast traffic.

17
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.400
So it will hit PC1,

18
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.280
it's not a DHCP server

19
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.990
so it will silently discard the packet, and it will hit R1

20
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.600
and it's not a DHCP server either.

21
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.090
The problem is the R1 is a router and routers by default do not forward broadcast traffic.

22
00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:04.610
So R1 will not send that DHCP request out on to the 10.10.20.0 subnet, so it will never reach the DHCP server and

23
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.340
PC2 will not get an IP address.

24
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.380
So that's the problem,

25
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.550
snd the fix for this is we need to configure R1 to forward DHCP requests. The way we do this is we configure

26
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.200
it on the interface which will be receiving the DHCP request.

27
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.950
So in our example here, the interface in R1 which is facing the clients is fastEthernet0/1.

28
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.100
So we go to the configuration for the interface fastEthernet0/1 and we say

29
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.680
'ip helper-address 10.10.20.10'.

30
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:50.060
Now, whenever the router receives a DHCP request on interface, it will forward it to the DHCP server at 10.10.20.10,

31
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.950
and now our clients will be able to get IP addresses.

32
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.560
So, that's how we configure a Cisco router to support an external DHCP server.

33
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.830
Let's have a look at actually configuring this in the lab.

34
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.040
So I'm running this in Packet Tracer

35
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.630
because Packet Tracer supports

36
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:17.030
a DHCP server. If we have a look at the config on our DHCP server, if I go to the Services tab on here

37
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.160
and choose DHCP, you can see I've configured a DHCP scope for the 10.10.10.0 network. I've specified

38
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.890
the default gateway is at 10.10.10.1, and the DNS server is at 10.10.20.10, and I'm going to

39
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.870
give out addresses in that subnet starting with 10.10.10.100 with a /24 subnet mask.

40
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.500
So, my DHCP server is all set up and configured.

41
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.550
If I have to look at the config on the PC, so I'm going to PC1 here and if I look at the configuration

42
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.230
for its interface, I see that it's configured as a DHCP client.

43
00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:04.460
But if I open up a command prompt on here and do 'ipconfig', you can see that is not getting a valid

44
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.360
IP address.

45
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.040
That is because the DHCP request is not reaching the server.

46
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:21.560
So to fix this, I need to go onto the router. I'll go into the command line here and I want to go

47
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.130
to global configuration and then its interface

48
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.660
fastEthernet0/1, the interface facing the clients, and I say 'ip helper-address',

49
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.060
let me just expand this out,

50
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:48.820
so 'ip helper-address' and my DHCP server is at 10.10.20.10. That's it, all that I need to do. If I now go back

51
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.110
onto the PC

52
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.950
and I do an 'ipconfig /renew', then hopefully, it's going to be able to pick up the IP address now,

53
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.430
and you can see, yes, it has. It's been given the first address in the scope, valid address 10.10.10.100.

54
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.080
It's also received its default gateway and its DNS server.

55
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.520
So, that's how you configure a Cisco router to support an external DHCP server.
