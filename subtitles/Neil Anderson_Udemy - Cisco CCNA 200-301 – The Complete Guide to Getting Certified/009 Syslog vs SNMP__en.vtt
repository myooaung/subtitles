00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:15.730
In the earlier lectures in this section, you've learned about smog and S&P, which are both used for

2
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.020
logging, and you've also heard about steam systems and Annemasse systems as well, and you're probably

3
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.390
thinking, well, aren't these things all doing the same thing?

4
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.510
Do I have to choose one or the other or what do I do?

5
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.740
So I'm going to clear it up for you in this lecture.

6
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.080
First up, can comparing just log and S&P and bulls just log in S&P provide logging functionality?

7
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.410
Such log can often provide more granular detail than S&P can, but it has support only for the device

8
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.230
pushing information out to a small server.

9
00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.590
It doesn't support a server pooling or sending information onto the device like you can do with S&P.

10
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.830
So it's just log a bit more granularity on the amount of reporting it can do.

11
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.030
But S&P has got a bit more functionality there.

12
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.940
So do you have to choose one or the other?

13
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.080
Well, no.

14
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.160
Annemasse servers will typically support both search log and as an amp, you see the diagram of gawped

15
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.810
on the slide here.

16
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.590
But from the Kiwi website, which was the software I was using for the demo earlier, and you see that

17
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.950
the Kiwi server, its market, it is a system of server based support AMP as well.

18
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.010
It also supports other types of events coming in, for example, from the windows of log and Mrs. Typical

19
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.210
and NMM system will usually support getting information from multiple sources, both just LOG and S&P

20
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.280
and other sources as well, including net flow from Cisco routers.

21
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.200
So you don't have to choose one or the other.

22
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.920
You can run Bov and you can use them where they fit based.

23
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.250
Next thing is Annemasse on scene, because we talked about both of those earlier as well, the Annemasse

24
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.610
is your network management system.

25
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.150
The scheme is your security information and event manager.

26
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.110
And just like there's overlap with just LOG and S&P, which are the protocols that are used, there's

27
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.700
also overlap between Annemasse and steam systems, which are the servers that are used to monitor all

28
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.700
this information.

29
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.180
So with animation seem can gobber logging information from network infrastructure devices such as urse

30
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.710
switches on firewalls, also from other devices as well like servers, and that uses protocols like

31
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.610
search log, S&P and net flow is commonly used to say, networking information from subscribers.

32
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.860
So what's the difference between Annemasse and Seamer Booth gathering that information?

33
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.240
Well, a product which is marketed as an Annemasse, which is a network management system, will have

34
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.990
a focus on cleaning network information and it will provide nice reports in a nice Jewish.

35
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.210
You can see what's going on with your network.

36
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.420
It will provide early warning of any problems and easier troubleshooting of those problems as well.

37
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.130
A product which is marketed as a scheme as a security manager will have a focus on cleaning security

38
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.570
information, and it will provide reports which focus on that and early warning of any security incidents

39
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.060
and easier troubleshooting of them so they can both gather the same kind of information.

40
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.750
But they've got a different focus on how they're going to report it and the tools that you can use to

41
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.350
manage it.

42
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.370
So let's have a look at an example without looking at Annemasse system here.

43
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.110
This is from Zulma.

44
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.170
Winds here at a very popular speed and smash.

45
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.050
And you can see here, it's got nice guey.

46
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.210
You can get nice graphical reports.

47
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.910
And over on the right, you can see the kind of information is being highlighted, interfaces with high

48
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.420
percent utilization.

49
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.040
So if you've got interfaces that are getting congested, it's going to tell you about that.

50
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.180
So you can fix it by putting more bandwidth in there or maybe by configuring kulash quality of service

51
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.589
that we're going to cover later on.

52
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.890
Down at the bottom, it's reporting on interfaces with high EDR and discard rates.

53
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.700
So it's giving you a nice dashboard where you can see everything that's going on in your network.

54
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.090
And it's also highlighting any potential network problems.

55
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.560
If we look at Aoshima, on the other hand, this is from inforce, right?

56
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.780
It can get the same kind of information.

57
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.840
But you see the is focusing on different types of reports.

58
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.870
It's telling us with top 10 event categories.

59
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.780
So we can see that the most common fault we have is authentication, meaning people are putting in the

60
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.530
wrong password.

61
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.060
What's normal for that to be high?

62
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.390
Because people do sometimes put in wrong password.

63
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.340
But if you see that that is unusually high and there's been a jump in it, that could indicate that

64
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.770
an attacker is trying to break into your systems by getting your passwords for everything we can see.

65
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.890
The next most common thing is malware attacks against us.

66
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.440
Another we can see other exploits in there as well.

67
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.360
Other kind of information we can see which are the most common attacks that are being launched against

68
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.310
this also, which hosts have been receiving multiple events.

69
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.950
So if we prosecute engineer, we're going to come in in the morning.

70
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.510
We're going to look at this dashboard.

71
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.430
And maybe one of the first things we'll do is we'll go and investigate these hosts to see if there's

72
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.320
anything bad happening with them.

73
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.460
OK, so that's a difference between anonymous and a scheme.
