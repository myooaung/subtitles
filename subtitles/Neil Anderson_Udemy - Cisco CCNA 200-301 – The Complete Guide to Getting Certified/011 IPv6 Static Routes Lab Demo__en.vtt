00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:16.360
In this lecture, you'll learn how to configure your connected and local routes, and static routes for

2
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.350
IPv6.

3
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.400
This is going to be a bit of a longer lecture than usual.

4
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.210
And the reason is I'm recording this intro after I recorded the video. While I was doing the configuration,

5
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.580
I made a mistake that I had to troubleshoot.

6
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.610
So

7
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.310
by watching it and watching me go through the troubleshooting process, you'll see how my mind thinks

8
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.370
and the process I went through to discover the problem and to fix it.

9
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.500
Well, you see me doing the configuration.

10
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.730
See if you can figure out the mistake I make before I actually get there.

11
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.780
So watch what I do, see what I do wrong.

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.910
If you can't see what it is, you'll see what it is when I do the troubleshooting later anyway.

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.460
So let's go hope you enjoy the video.

14
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:13.180
So I have the lab topology up here. I've got my R1, R2, and R3 and a couple of pieces,

15
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.680
PC1 and PC2.

16
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.170
I'm actually using routers to emulate the PCs here as well.

17
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:30.080
And the scenario is that we've got a dual stack network, so I'm running IPv4 and IPv6 here. IPv4

18
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.810
has already been completely configured.

19
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.410
We've got the IP addresses on everything and I'm using EIGRP for the routing.

20
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.210
IPv6 is being configured as far as the addresses have been set, but we haven't configured any IPv6

21
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.160
routing yet. So let's just verify that first.

22
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.890
So I'll jump on to the lab. On R1,

23
00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.750
I can do a show ip interface brief, and I can see that my IP addresses are being configured on my interfaces.

24
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.220
A show ipv6 interface brief and I see that on those same interfaces,

25
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.620
I have got my global unicast and my link local addresses configured as well. The same as being done on R2

26
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.560
and R3 as well.

27
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.150
And if I do a show ip protocols, I can see that EIGRP has been configured for IPv4.

28
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.050
But show ipv6 protocols and I haven't configured any protocols for IPv6.

29
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.030
So if I do a show ip route, I'll see my connected, my local and my EIGRP routes there. A

30
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.660
show ipv6 route,

31
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.430
and I've got connected and local because I've configured the IPv6 addresses on the interfaces so they

32
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.410
get generated automatically, but I don't have any other routes in the routing table.

33
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.620
I haven't configured any static route yet.

34
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.790
So because I've got routing for IPv4, I should be able to ping between my two PCs.

35
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.470
So let's go on to PC2 and let's do a show ip interface brief here.

36
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.300
Like I said, it's a router emulating a PC. Just to check what the IP address is,

37
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.880
it's 10.10.3.10.

38
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.680
And if I ping that from PC1 which is over on the other side of the network, that ping works.

39
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:38.120
So looking back at the topology diagram, I've got IPv4 connectivity end-to-end across the network.

40
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.060
But if I try pinging by IPv6 address, so let's do that.

41
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:53.630
So I'll just show ipv6 interface brief on PC2 . Get its global unicast IPv6 address.

42
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.710
Copy that and try pinging it from PC1.

43
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.400
This is going to fail because I haven't configured routing for IPv6.

44
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.890
The error message I get is that there's no valid route for destination, so it's OK.

45
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.750
PC1,

46
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.640
I'll do a show ipv6 route on here and I can see it's just got the connected and the local route for

47
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.340
its local interface. A

48
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.080
show ipv6 interface brief,

49
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.620
I've got an IPv6 address on the fa0/0 interface there, but no routing configured on

50
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.010
here.

51
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.650
So let's fix this one first.

52
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:42.140
Looking back at the topology diagram PC1 is a PC and R1 is its default gateway.

53
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.290
So I can see from the diagram that the interface on R1 facing PC1 has got an IPv6 address of

54
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.760
2001:DB8:0:0::1/64.

55
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.830
So let's configure that as the default gateway on PC1.

56
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.060
So I'll go back onto PC1. Let's just move this across so you can see the topology diagram as well when

57
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.800
I configure this.

58
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:24.200
And on PC1, I'm going to do a config t to get to global configuration. Don't worry about it.

59
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.690
It is just an artifact showing up below there.

60
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.300
And the command I want to do is

61
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.160
ipv6 route

62
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.810
And it's a default static

63
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.380
route.

64
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.790
So the destination is ::/0.

65
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:50.870
And the next hop address is 2001:DB8:0:0:0

66
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.830
and so on.

67
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.950
So I can just say that as ::1.

68
00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.750
I don't have to put in all of the fields of consecutive zeros.

69
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.050
So that's my IPv6 route

70
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.800
configured now.

71
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.000
Let's also check that it's got connectivity to the default gateway, so I will ping that address as

72
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.470
well.

73
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.540
And this is because I'm at the wrong command level. I'm at global configuration. So if I hit the up arrow,

74
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.780
ctrl + A to get to the start of the line and type do in front of it, this command will work.

75
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.620
And I can see that the success rate is 100 percent.

76
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.810
So that all looks good.

77
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.960
OK, next one of these.

78
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.250
I'll just I'll configure it left to right from PC1 all the way across to PC2. So

79
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.710
we'll do R1 next. R1

80
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:51.580
is directly connected to the 2001:DB8::/64 network and the

81
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.130
2001:DB8:0:1::/64 networks.

82
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.120
So they are already in the routing table as connected

83
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.520
routes.

84
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.150
Let's just verify that.

85
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.650
So I'll just

86
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.430
show ipv6 route

87
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:15.010
And I can see that 2001:DB8::/64 is connected and

88
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.130
2001:DB8:0:1::/64 is also connected as well.

89
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:27.900
But it's not connected to 2001:DB8:0:2 or 2001:DB8:0:3,

90
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.320
so I need to add static routes for those networks.

91
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:40.120
So at global config, config t and it's ipv6 route.

92
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.380
And that was for

93
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:51.820
2001:DB8:0:2::/64.

94
00:07:52.240 --> 00:08:01.000
And the next hop address is the interface on R2 which is

95
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.450
2001:DB8:0:1::2.

96
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.260
So that's  the route in place for the first network.

97
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:16.420
And I can just hit the up arrow and edit this because the other network is DB8:0:3, so I'll just

98
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.170
edit it. The next hop is the same address again and hit enter.

99
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:27.660
So those are my static routes configured on R1. Let's do R2 next.

100
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.470
So I'll jump on there.

101
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:38.159
And if I do ipv6 route, again, I've just got the connected and the local routes in there. So

102
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.370
global config and it's going to be

103
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.270
ipv6 route

104
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:51.400
is the network PC1 is connected to. 2001:DB8 and it's a 0:0,

105
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:59.020
but again I can just say ::/64 and the next hop address is on R1 which is

106
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:10.420
2001:DB8:0:1::1 and the other network is the one that's connected

107
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.680
to PC2.

108
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:18.780
Let's just move this across and see where that is. So 2001:DB8:0:3 and the next

109
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.580
hop is on R3.

110
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:33.300
So when we edit this, it's going to be 2001:DB8:0:3::/64

111
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:42.070
and the next hop address was 2001:DB8:0:2..

112
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.750
Let's just move that across.

113
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.740
0:2::1 which is the interface here on R3.

114
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.460
OK, so that's my 2 routes done

115
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.330
on R2.

116
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:08.470
Next up, we'll do R3 for its route. And show ipv6 route again, just to confirm. Yeah. Just the local

117
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.150
and the connected routes in there.

118
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:16.930
So config t, ipv6 route to the network connected to PC1.

119
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.490
That is

120
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:29.650
2001:DB8::/64 with a next hop address of R2

121
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:39.470
which is at 2001:DB8:0:2::2.

122
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:48.820
And I also need a route going to 2001:DB8:0:1 on the link between R1 and R2.

123
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.530
So 2001:DB8:0:1::/64

124
00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:02.220
and the same next hop address on R2 again. OK,

125
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.510
that's my configuration done on PC1, R1, R2, R3.

126
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:13.780
Last thing I need to do is PC2. So do a show ipv6 route on here.

127
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.190
And I see again it hasn't been configured with its default gateway address yet.

128
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.550
So I'll go config t

129
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.370
ipv6 route

130
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.220
::/0 for a default static

131
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.000
route.

132
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:33.430
And check the address on R3. That is 

133
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.780
::1

134
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:49.720
next hop 2001:DB8:0:3::1 is R3. And hopefully I think

135
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.720
I've configured all the routes that are required there.

136
00:11:53.170 --> 00:12:00.160
So let's go on to PC1 and see if it can ping PC2. I just checked the IPv6 address on PC2 again.

137
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:08.920
So show ipv6 interface brief and I will copy its global unicast address.

138
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.000
And then on PC1, I will ping that.

139
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.320
And fingers crossed,

140
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.040
we will get a response here. OK,

141
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:27.910
it's looking like it's maybe going to timeout. So let's do some real time troubleshooting and see

142
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.920
what's going on here. To troubleshoot

143
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:38.740
a connectivity issue, it's easiest to work your way from the source to the destination. So while  we're

144
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.250
on

145
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.090
PC1, actually,

146
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:47.800
what I'll do is a traceroute, I'll just hit that up arrow to get that address back and I'll change the ping to

147
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.280
a traceroute and see how far this is getting.

148
00:12:51.810 --> 00:13:00.940
So the first hop should be 2001:DB8::1 which is at R1.

149
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.550
OK, and it looks like it's not getting anywhere.

150
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.120
So maybe I made a typo somewhere. To break out of a

151
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.410
traceroute,

152
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:15.850
I can hold down Ctrl + Shift + 6 at the same time and then X, and that breaks out.

153
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.760
You might want to take a of that because it's really frustrating when you have to wait ages for a

154
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:20.980
traceroute

155
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.850
to time out.

156
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.870
So Ctrl + Shift + 6 all at the same time, then let your fingers off and hit the X, that will 

157
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:28.640
breakout.

158
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.730
Let me check the IP,

159
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.390
show ipv6 route.

160
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.100
I should have a right for ::/0.

161
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.300
Yeah, that is right.

162
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:46.150
And the next hop address is 2001:DB8::1.

163
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.070
So that all looks OK.

164
00:13:51.300 --> 00:14:02.280
Sp, let's just check. I can ping that. So I will ping R1, which is 2001:DB8::1

165
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.580
and that works.

166
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.050
Let's check and see if I can ping R2.

167
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:18.440
So I'll ping 2001:DB8:0:1::2 is the neatest interface on R2.

168
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:29.850
And this looks like it's going to feel.. Oh actually, this is great that I forgot to do this because it illustrates

169
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.770
that I could put all of those commands in.

170
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:38.970
I've got all my IPv6 addresses configured. I've got all my static route configured and the router

171
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.070
did not complain at any point.

172
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.470
It didn't give me any error messages.

173
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:51.270
But when I'm trying to ping from PC1 to PC2, it's not working and all my satic routes have been

174
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.530
configured correctly.

175
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:58.560
So this can be really confusing and hopefully some of you have noticed the mistake that I made.

176
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.180
So let me show you what it is.

177
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.670
I didn't preplan this, which is good.

178
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.930
So that highlights that even when you're experienced, you can make these kinds of mistakes.

179
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:17.820
So if I do a show run on R1 and pipe that, and include IPv6, hopefully you're going to notice that

180
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.820
I have got a command missing. So I'll give you a second.

181
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:28.380
Well, I'll go to global config where I'm going to correct it to see if you can see the command that I

182
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:28.850
forgot.

183
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.420
Hopefully you've got it.

184
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:35.220
I forgot to say IPv6 unicast routing.

185
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:42.000
So like I said, it will let you do the full configuration, even adding routes without having unicast

186
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.870
routing configured.

187
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.710
But if you do that, it's not actually going to forward traffic.

188
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.840
So the routing isn't going to work.

189
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:57.000
So I need to add this command to R1 and R2, and R3, which are my routers, to allow them

190
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.910
to route IPv6 traffic over the network.

191
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:06.120
So I'll just paste that command in on R1, R2 and R3. And now,

192
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:16.710
I go back to PC1 and try the ping again all the way over to PC2, this is going to work now.

193
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.200
OK, so there you go.

194
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.640
So now you can see I've got my connected routes,

195
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:27.900
my local routes and static routes all configured. And I've got end-to-end connectivity across the network.

196
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:34.290
I also just want to show you about how IPv4 and IPv6 are separate processes.

197
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.770
So if I do a show ip protocols, that is going to show me my

198
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.480
IPv4 routing protocols configured.

199
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.800
I'm on the PC here so that's why I'm not getting any outputs. I should be on R1 so I can do a show ip protocols,

200
00:16:53.640 --> 00:17:00.150
and I can see I've got EIGRP configured for IPv4. But if I do a show ipv6 protocols, I'm not

201
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.760
going to see anything because I'm using static routing.

202
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:09.210
So EIGRP is just configured for IPv4, not for IPv6. And I can do a

203
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:09.730
show ip route.

204
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.660
That shows me the IPv4 routing table.

205
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:18.660
So whenever the router receives an IPv4 packet with an IPv4 a destination address, it's going to

206
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.420
forward it based on its IPv4 routing table.

207
00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.609
If i do a

208
00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:23.990
show ipv6 route,

209
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.790
I can see the IPv6 routing table. So packets received with IPv4 routed according to the IPv4 routing

210
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.260
table. IPv6 uses the IPv6 routing table.

211
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.750
So they both work the same way, but they're separate.

212
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.990
OK, that's everything that I needed to show you here.

213
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.460
See you in the next lecture.
