00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.960
In this lecture, you'll learn about traffic shaping and policing when people talk about queues in general,

2
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.600
they're probably talking about queuing.

3
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.920
But there are other queue mechanisms available like shipping and policing, which are also commonly

4
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.250
used.

5
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.470
Traffic shaping and policing can be used to control traffic rate.

6
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.460
They both measure the rate of traffic going through an interface and take an action if the rate is above

7
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.950
it configured limit.

8
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.850
If you look at a router, it knows the amount of traffic that's going through its interfaces.

9
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.520
You can see that if you do a interface command.

10
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.830
So because it knows how much traffic is going through the interfaces, you can configure it to take

11
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.730
an action if it goes above a certain rate.

12
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.860
Traffic shaping and policing both work and a very similar fashion, but the action that they take is

13
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.400
different.

14
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.850
So it's used for different scenarios that will cover as we go through this picture, traffic shaping

15
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.280
buffers, any access traffic.

16
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.750
So the overall traffic reach these within your desired rate limit.

17
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.710
So you can think of traffic shaping as putting the brakes on.

18
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.690
Traffic is going too fast.

19
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.910
It keeps it within the required limit and it moves the traffic flow.

20
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
Traffic policing, on the other hand, drops are remarks.

21
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.300
Assess traffic to enforce the specified rate limit to traffic.

22
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.010
Policing is much more aggressive if the limit goes up, if traffic goes above the limit that you set

23
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.940
said usually you're going to just drop by excess traffic.

24
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.290
Roggeveen buffeting it.

25
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.010
So it just gets wound down.

26
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:59.120
So you'll see that traffic shaping is usually used on the customer side of a link and policing is used

27
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.580
on the other side on the service provider.

28
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.300
You can use them for different scenarios as well.

29
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.550
But what's most common, and I'll cover that in more detail as we go through this picture classification

30
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.920
can be used in your shaping or policing policy to configure different rates for different traffic types.

31
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.450
For example, you could download a different rate for traffic that is marked as DPF then you only know

32
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.210
for traffic that is marked as F 31.

33
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.470
So that is optional.

34
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.050
You can apply the rate to the aggregate of all traffic or you can have different rates for different

35
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.830
traffic times.

36
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.290
So let's look at the scenarios where this would be used as the easiest way to understand it.

37
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.780
First one is we are looking at it from the point of view of the service provider in the example the

38
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.160
customer has provisioned and ampules VPN between their headquarters and their branch offices.

39
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.440
The physical links from Michy to the drivers on both sides are 100 megabits per second fastest rate,

40
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.790
but the customer has only paid for 10 megabits per second in the contract with the service provider.

41
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.590
That's what's agreed and or service level agreement.

42
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.920
Traffic is going to go at the rate that the physical interface is set, which is 100 megabits per second

43
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.330
in this example.

44
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.410
But a way that you can influence the rate is by using policing or shaping.

45
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.670
So any example here, the customer have got 100 megabits per second on broadband, but they've only

46
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.650
actually paid for 10 megabits per second.

47
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.770
So the service provider is not going to be sending traffic all the way across their core 100 megabits

48
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.180
per second for this customer.

49
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.880
They're going to limit it to 10 megabits per second when it comes inbound on the PPI.

50
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.030
So that's what the service provider is going to do.

51
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.010
They will configure a policing kiosk policy on both PS on the interface facing the sheet and the inbound

52
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.660
direction.

53
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.180
So whenever any traffic comes in, if it comes in at a rate higher than 10 megabits per second, the

54
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.240
access traffic is just going to get dropped to the service provider is going to limit the customer to

55
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.990
about 10 megabits per second worth of bandwidth that they've paid for.

56
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.120
You will see this being used very commonly.

57
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.580
Another place where you can see policing being used not at service providers, but within normal enterprises

58
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.730
and common use case here is worm on junk traffic mitigation.

59
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.820
What a worm is, is that's a type of virus.

60
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.790
Obviously, you don't want that type of traffic on your network at all.

61
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.450
Definitely not.

62
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.590
Taking up your bandwidth to an enterprise can configure classification and marketing to recognize worms

63
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.680
and also junk traffic that they don't want on your network, like peer-to-peer file sharing applications

64
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.220
that bad traffic is known as scavenger traffic and recommended DCPI value to market with is DGP eight,

65
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.960
which is she asks one.

66
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.650
So once you've got the traffic classified and marked, you can then configure a policing policy which

67
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:24.120
is going to limit down to a tiny amount so it can't take up any bandwidth on your network.

68
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.920
So this will mean that if users are trying to share files like movies and stuff like that over your

69
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.690
one week, that's not a business case.

70
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.830
You don't want them doing it.

71
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.220
You can police the traffic right down so it doesn't take up any of your bandwidth for worms.

72
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.620
Obviously, you want to have antivirus on your users PCs so you don't get a worm in the first place.

73
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.290
But if you are infected with a worm, one of the really bad things that happens is it will start sending

74
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.900
traffic out, trying to infect other PCs.

75
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.720
And when it manages to do that, they'll do the same thing.

76
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.940
And it can quickly end up eating all of the bandwidth on your network by using policing for worm mitigation.

77
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.920
It doesn't stop you getting infected, but it stops the worm from taking up all your bandwidth and grinding

78
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.100
the network to a halt when you do get hit with one.

79
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.660
So it means it gives you time.

80
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.400
You can go and clean all those pieces that are not to get infected in the first place.

81
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.300
But this is good.

82
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.110
If you do get infected, it stops it from crashing your network.

83
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:34.830
OK, back onto that first scenario again, where we've got the customer with her HQ and our branch office

84
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.160
and they've got an employee VPN between the two sites and the physical links from each of the P are

85
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:50.640
100 meg and the provider is policing at 10 meg inbound on the drivers and the customer knows this.

86
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:57.600
So the customer knows if they send traffic at a rate higher than 10 megabits per second, the access

87
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.760
traffic is going to get dropped.

88
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.860
So if they do send at the higher rate, some traffic will get to the other side.

89
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.630
Some traffic will not.

90
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.960
In our scenario, we're using both voice on video.

91
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.980
And, you know, already that voice has strict quality requirements.

92
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.390
If a lot of the packets are getting dropped, it's going to be a terrible quality phone call.

93
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:25.980
So the customers, they have to make sure that they don't have any of those voice pockets being dropped.

94
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.420
And the way that they do that is by making sure that we don't send a rate higher than 10 megabits per

95
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.980
second.

96
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.050
Now, you know already that they can't use the bandwidth statement on the interface to do that.

97
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.930
The bandwidth statement effects of our software policy like your routing protocols.

98
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.940
But it doesn't actually affect the rate that topic is setting up.

99
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:58.860
The way that we can affect the traffic is sent is by configuring a shaping policy outbound on BOYCIE

100
00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.490
routers.

101
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.190
So let's have a look and see how we're going to configure that.

102
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.750
We configure a policy map here.

103
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:13.800
I've called it one edge and actually cross-class class default and shape average to ten megabits per

104
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.250
second.

105
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:20.880
I didn't need to configure any of our class maps here because the policy map, the shaper is being applied

106
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.810
to all traffic to class class default makes it take effect on all traffic and I'm shaping it to ten

107
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.040
megabits per second.

108
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:34.049
Then I need to remember to apply it to the interface with my service policy.

109
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.809
So interface fast Ethernet zero zero.

110
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.220
I do that on Bouffe.

111
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:45.570
She writers on the outside interface facing towards the provider and I say service policy I one edge.

112
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.770
No, all traffic is going to be shaped to ten megabits per second.

113
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.620
It's not going to go above that.

114
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.560
So the provider is not going to drop any traffic.

115
00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:02.960
But we've got another problem as well now, so let's have a look at that and let's see what our scenario

116
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.280
was.

117
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.060
So we've got a ten megabits per second assembly on the one outside interface.

118
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.350
The physical speed of human outside interface was 100 megabits per second.

119
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.990
So we've put the Shapard on there to ship all traffic to 10 megabits per second to guarantee that the

120
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.380
service provider won't drop any of our traffic.

121
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:27.290
We've got a 100 megabits per second fastest bernet interface on the inside, facing towards Milan as

122
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.910
well on both sides.

123
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.830
And we have figured out how much bandwidth we need for our different traffic types.

124
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.820
We need one megabits per second for voice, three megabits per second for video on six megabits per

125
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.120
second for data.

126
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.800
So that's why we paid for a tanmay going from the provider.

127
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:53.570
But data will sometimes burst above six megabits per second, creating congestion because we've got

128
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.780
about 100 megabits per second interface on the inside.

129
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.230
We're shaping to 10 megabits per second on the outside.

130
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.770
So if we have traffic coming in at a rate more than 10 megabits per second, we're going to get congestion

131
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.070
there.

132
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.870
And let's see that there has burst above six megabits per second.

133
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:18.020
We've now got 12 megabits per second worth of traffic coming in, but we're trying to squeeze 12 meg

134
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.580
into a 10 meg pipe.

135
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.400
It's not going to go.

136
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.150
So we've got congestion there.

137
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.940
It's going to affect the quality for all of our traffic.

138
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.880
And again, we're going to have bad quality voice and video calls if that happens.

139
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.510
So we don't just have a shape or a shape traffic to 10 megabits per second.

140
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.050
We also need to have an AOL queue policy here as well.

141
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:44.690
So let's have a look at the config for that same policy that you saw before for AOL.

142
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.340
Cubitt is going to be a twist here.

143
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:54.240
So we've got the class maps to specify the traffic we're interested in voice match, IP, DPF Map,

144
00:10:54.260 --> 00:11:00.710
Video Match IP, DPF or A1 and flashmob signalling match IPD free.

145
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.480
Then we've got the policy map to see, but we're going and do with it policy amount of code it nested.

146
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:13.550
You'll see why in a second for class voice which was video PEF, the voice traffic priority one or two

147
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:18.650
for Sueur, guaranteeing it one megabits per second worth of bandwidth required.

148
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:25.010
And we're putting it in the priority queue class video prior to E3 07 to its getting its three megabits

149
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:30.770
per second cost, signaling bandwidth one to eight and in class cost default for everything else.

150
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.310
Fair.

151
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:37.910
Q No, you can only apply one policy map, one service policy to the interface.

152
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:44.720
So what we do is this AOL Q policy that we've just created to provide the voice in the video topic.

153
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.380
We nashed that inside the ship policy.

154
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.720
So underneath policy, not one edge.

155
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:57.820
We say service policy nested in there and it's the policy map, one edge as applied interface level.

156
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:04.130
So the interface wabble, we're shaping all traffic to ten megabits per second if we need to try to

157
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.380
send more than ten megabits per second through there, through our voice on our video traffic is going

158
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.540
to go straight to the front and B, Q so this guarantees that neurotrophic is going to get dropped because

159
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.090
we don't send more than what we've paid for the service provider.

160
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.160
And when we are trying to send more voice in, but you go straight to the front of the queue, so voice

161
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.620
in video still gets the service it requires.

162
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.150
OK, that was it.

163
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.780
That was everything for Kulash.

164
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.650
Again, don't worry about memorizing these configurations.

165
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.110
You don't need to know the configuration for the exam.

166
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.510
I'm just showing you here.

167
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.370
So you get a full understanding of how KUOW works.

168
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.810
OK, QSA done.

169
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.370
See you in the next section.
