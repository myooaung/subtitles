00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.730
In this lecture, you'll learn about the different WAN connectivity options, and there's multiple

2
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.060
Wide Area Network options available. Not all options are going to be available in all locations.

3
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.260
It really depends on what region, what country you're in.

4
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.570
What is commonly used in one region maybe considered a legacy

5
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.000
in another. You might be in one part of the world where Frame Relay connections are still being used,

6
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.010
but in other countries, that would be considered legacy.

7
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.890
Also, different providers will use different terminology.

8
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.530
Here, I'm going to use the terminology that Cisco used for the CCNA exam.

9
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.970
So, looking first at our primary WAN connectivity options, and when I say a primary option, I mean

10
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:04.220
this is going to be used by a corporation for their main connectivity to the Internet or to their other

11
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.000
offices.

12
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.160
So the options here are Leased Lines, MPLS Multi Protocol Label Switching, and Satellite. I'm going

13
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.910
to have separate lectures for these later to give you more detail on them.

14
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.540
Now, if it's a really large company, they might actually own the entire WAN infrastructure. But far

15
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.400
more often, your WAN connections are going to be offered by a service provider.

16
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.320
So what options are available?

17
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.030
It really depends on what country you're in and what the service providers there can do. With these primary

18
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.900
connections,

19
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.380
the service provider will typically provide an SLA, that's a Service Level Agreement, and it's going to

20
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.070
have guarantees for the uptime of the line, and also for the traffic quality, meaning the delay and

21
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.430
the loss on the link.

22
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.800
Leased lines and Satellite can be used for connectivity to the Internet, for direct connectivity

23
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:16.430
between offices, and/or connectivity between offices over VPN. MPLS uses a shared core infrastructure

24
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.160
at the service provider. So, it can be used for connectivity to the Internet and/or connectivity

25
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.450
between offices over VPN.

26
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.320
If it was a really large company and they owned their own MPLS infrastructure, that could also give

27
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.450
direct connectivity between offices.

28
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.270
Okay, so those were our primary options.

29
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.240
Again, we're going to cover those in more detail later on

30
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.190
in this section. Optical fiber is more suitable for long distances than copper wire. It's commonly

31
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.390
used for service provider backhaul connections, meaning, the connections between a service provider's main

32
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.150
locations,

33
00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.620
so those are internal Internet service provider, require a lot of bandwidth. But, optical fiber services

34
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.130
can also be offered to the service providers' customers.

35
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.660
In North America, you'll often see this being described as FTTx services. That's Fiber to the Home,

36
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.380
to the Premises, the Building, and the Neighborhood.

37
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.320
SONET in North America and SDH in the rest of the world are standards used in service provider optical

38
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.790
fiber networks. So, you can see the terminology you get,

39
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:38.150
SONET STS and SONET OC can be used basically interchangeably. STS-1 or OC-1 gives 51.84

40
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.160
megabits per second. Up to STS-192, for example, giving 9953.28 megabits per

41
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.640
second,

42
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.500
so really high bandwidth.

43
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.010
In rest of the world, it is using

44
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.450
SDH STM.

45
00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.290
So, those are typically used for service provider backhaul connections, definitely the larger bandwidth

46
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.650
WANs.

47
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.420
But if you are a large enough organization, you can also be using optical fiber, high bandwidth for

48
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.640
your connections between your offices.

49
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:21.279
DWDM is Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing, and it combines or ï¿½multiplexes' multiple optical signals

50
00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.110
into one optical signal transmitted over a single fiber strand.

51
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.730
The way it works with multiplexing is that each signal is assigned a different wavelength because

52
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.340
you've got now that multiple signals that would normally require different fiber strands.

53
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.060
That allows more capacity, more bandwidth to be added to existing infrastructure without requiring expensive

54
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.660
upgrades.

55
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.410
DWDM is used in all modern long haul optical connections in the service providers.

56
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.600
Many service providers laid optical fiber cabling in the past and then found that they didn't actually

57
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.140
need it,

58
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.510
and DWDM was a major reason for this because it did provide much more bandwidth with much less actual

59
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.200
cabling.

60
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.830
So there is a lot of unused cabling out there, and that is referred to as Dark Fibers. Dark fiber

61
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.570
because it hasn't been let out,

62
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.320
and it is possible, depending on where you are in the world, that maybe you can buy dark fiber from

63
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.060
a service provider as an organisation to use for your own WAN range.

64
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:40.120
We'll also have a look at our WAN backup and small office solutions. So less expensive options, which

65
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:48.400
are often aimed at home user Internet access, can also be used as Internet VPN WAN backup options

66
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.290
in corporate environments.

67
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:57.550
There will typically be no corporate level SLA with these services because they're going over the Internet,

68
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.350
and the service provider can't control what happens there.

69
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.850
These can be used as the primary WAN connection method to the corporate network from smaller offices

70
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.400
and for home users. So Leased Lines, MPLS, and Satellite connections,

71
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.970
they're more expensive.

72
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.160
So in a large office, we would use one of those, and we'd probably use a backup solution there as well.

73
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.830
If we've got a small office with just a handful of users there, maybe we can't justify using one of

74
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.450
those more expensive options.

75
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.940
So, we would use one of these instead.

76
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:39.900
Our options here are DSL Digital Subscriber Line, Cable, and Wireless, for example, 4G.

77
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.050
So, those are the kind of options that you knew about already because you can get them at home.

78
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:53.720
There are also legacy options as well, like PSTN going over the Public Switch Telephone Network.

79
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.640
If you're as old as me, you remember most old 56K dial-up modem.

80
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.680
So, that would be using the PSTN for your WAN.

81
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.390
Obviously, nobody would use voice anymore.

82
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.640
There was also ISDN, which is Integrated Services Digital Network.

83
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:17.930
This is similar to use in most 56K modems, but it was aimed at the corporate market, and it's got higher

84
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.350
bandwidth than a single analog phone line.

85
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:27.680
Other options, Frame Relay. Frame Relay is still used in some parts of the world, but in Western countries,

86
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.740
it's usually seen as a legacy option.

87
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:38.690
Also ATM, Asynchronous Transfer Mode, similar characteristics to Frame Relay and even older

88
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.710
X.25.

89
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.020
So, these are legacy as far as Cisco is concerned.

90
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.790
But like I said right on the first slide, it really depends where you are in the world about what

91
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.730
options will be available. Maybe where you are,

92
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.410
the service providers don't offer MPLS, but they still do offer Frame Relay.

93
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.330
Okay, the last thing to cover here is our WAN interface cards.

94
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.470
Routers will typically come with onboard Ethernet ports, and additional Ethernet interface cards can

95
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.780
be added if you need more parts.

96
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.750
Ethernet is commonly used for WAN connections today. Other WAN

97
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:23.540
interface types are modular and fit into a spare slot on the router.

98
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.880
There are many, many different types of WAN interface cards.

99
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.310
We'll see some examples coming up on the next slide.

100
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:39.950
Part numbers for different cards can be very similar, and different cards are compatible with different router

101
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.030
platforms.

102
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.320
So, be very careful when selecting your card.

103
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.350
It's really easy to order the wrong one.

104
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:54.470
To give you an example of that, up on the top here, we've got a couple of serial cards.

105
00:08:54.470 --> 00:09:02.300
We've got the WIC-2T, which is compatible with the 1700 and 2600 platforms.

106
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:08.900
And then next to that, we've got HWIC-2T, which is compatible with the 1800, 1900, 2800

107
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.790
2900, 3800, and 3900 ISRs.

108
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.600
So you're looking at these two,

109
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.430
they look exactly the same. They're both the same type of connection which is serial.

110
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:26.870
So we would often use these for slower speed Leased Lines or for Frame Relay, but one fits into one type

111
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.170
of platform, the other fits into other platforms,

112
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:38.300
and if you order a WIC-2T instead of the HWIC-2T, then it won't work. So be really careful

113
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.600
when ordering, because often it's just like a single letter or number difference, but it's not going to

114
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.710
have compatibility. Down in the bottom left,

115
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:54.500
this is for the newer model routers before thousand Series ISR, and this is a NIM module.

116
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.340
So, it's actually a larger module than the WIC modules here.

117
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.490
We've got the NIM-2MFT-T1/E1.

118
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.270
So, it's got two T1 or E1 ports.

119
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:11.510
You can configure them as either. This can be used for the like over Leased Lines.

120
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.630
We could also use this for TDM voice

121
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.620
calls going to the Public Switch Telephone Network.

122
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.650
I'll speak about that a bit more when we do the Leased Lines

123
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:28.160
lecture. Down in the bottom right, we've got a NIM-VAB-A which is also 4000 

124
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.300
series ISR, and that is a DSL card.

125
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.030
So you can see particularly from the two at the top, part numbers can be very similar,

126
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.060
be careful when you order. To give you a story about that,

127
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:49.010
I worked for the company before, and we were opening up a new office in Africa, and it was easier to source

128
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.050
the equipment in the UK.

129
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.250
So we bought the equipment in the UK, and the office in Africa,

130
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.510
it was going to have PCs there and also IP phones as well.

131
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.130
So, we needed switches that provided power for the IP phones.

132
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.370
And what happened was the person that ordered, ordered non-POE switches.

133
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:17.150
So, we had thirty pieces of routers and switches in the warehouse in Aberdeen, and it was just about to

134
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.680
get shipped out to Africa.

135
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.860
And luckily, somebody noticed the mistake, and we were able to get it replaced. But it had been shipped

136
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.520
to Africa,

137
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.740
that would have been a really, really expensive, career-limiting mistake.

138
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.840
So, do be careful when you're ordering interface cards or routers, or switches.

139
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.280
Okay, see you in the next lecture.
