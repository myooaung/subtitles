00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.280
In this lecture, you'll learn about wireless network security.

2
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.810
It's going to be a pretty quick lecture because the Shishani Wambo, we don't need to go too deep into

3
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.560
the topic so Wi-Fi coverage can leak outside the desired area.

4
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.050
If you have got a building and you want to have wireless coverage throughout the entire building, you

5
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.130
will place your access points to give you the desired coverage.

6
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.640
But it's going to be next to impossible to have the wireless access available right up to the edges

7
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.650
of the building on the inside and not leak out to the outside of the building.

8
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.120
And also and stations joining the wireless network do not need physical access to join the network.

9
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.640
So this can obviously make it more vulnerable to attack than a wired network.

10
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.370
There could be an attacker sitting in their car outside in your car park and they could potentially

11
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.070
join the wireless network from there and get access the same as if they were inside the building.

12
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.010
So because of strong authentication and encryption techniques should definitely be used.

13
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.670
So let's talk about the wireless security standards, the first one was WAP, the wireless equivalent

14
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.640
privacy that came out in 1999 and got used RC for encryption.

15
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.940
WEAP was pretty quickly cracked.

16
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.460
You should never be using WAP nowadays because it is trivially easy to crack it and get access through

17
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.330
into the wireless network.

18
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.930
So after that, what came out next was WPA.

19
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.260
You'll find that with old security methods and standards, it's always a constant battle between the

20
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.200
people who are creating those standards and the hackers who are trying to circumvent them.

21
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.590
So what always happens is there will be a new security standard.

22
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.320
Hacker will then find a way to circumvent it and then a new security standard will come out which plugs

23
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.020
those holes.

24
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.830
An attacker will then figure out a way to crack that new standard and then a new standard of anot will

25
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.780
come out and then it just keeps going cyclically like that.

26
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.090
So that's why you can see here we've gone through Web, WPA, WPA to on WPA three.

27
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.980
So after WEAP WPA came out after that and did plug the security concerns which were present in weap

28
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.840
WPA stands for Wi-Fi protected access, the first version came out in two thousand on three, but still

29
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.750
uses Arcy for encryption, as was used in Web and introduced to the temporal key integrity protocol.

30
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.630
So after some time, WPA was also cracked.

31
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.050
So after the WPA took him out, WPA two came out in 2000 for it uses a yes encryption so that stronger

32
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.910
encryption than our for.

33
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.070
And it also supported Shishi and Pete Champy stands for the counter safer mode with block changing message

34
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.900
authentication code protocol.

35
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.090
It's a bit of a mouthful, OK.

36
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:30.990
And then after the WPA to WPA Free came out after that because there is an attack called the KROK attack,

37
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.170
which WPA too is susceptible to, to have a fix for that is WPA three.

38
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.960
It came out in twenty eighteen.

39
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.230
It also uses E.S. Encryption HWP to this.

40
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.180
It's got Shishi amp and it does have protection against the crack attack.

41
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.560
No, the current state of affairs, as I'm recording this video, is that WPA three is still comparatively

42
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.780
new, even though it has been out for a while.

43
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.640
You'll find that a lot of wireless devices out there still only support WPA to sort of devices are still

44
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.180
using WPA to any environment you're in.

45
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.860
Should be on at least WPA to preferably WPA.

46
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.269
As time goes on, more and more devices will support WPA three.

47
00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.750
So that is what you really should be targeting to be running on.

48
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:30.240
Last thing to tell you about is a comparison between WPA personnel and WPA enterprise and personal and

49
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.630
enterprise.

50
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.940
It's not just the original version of WPA.

51
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.270
It was also WPA two and three.

52
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.480
This applies there as well.

53
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.800
So with WPA personnel, that uses pre shared keys.

54
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.740
So when you go to join the wireless network, you enter a picture Keeves, basically a password which

55
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.880
matches the password on the access point with WPA Enterprise that uses a triple A.

56
00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.630
However, we spoke about it earlier on in the course Rothstein's for authentication, authorization

57
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.040
and accounting protocol that will be used for the authentication is radius and we're going to be using

58
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.620
one X and with WPA Enterprise, that gives you much more granularity.

59
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.680
You can have users and logging in with their username and password, so it gives you that user level

60
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.340
security.

61
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.000
So if a user does leave the company, it's very easy.

62
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.520
You just delete user and nobody can log in without username and password anymore.

63
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.070
You don't have to do anything different if you're using WIPA personal where you've got Boshier password.

64
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.830
If a user leaves the company, then you need to change it so it quickly becomes unmanageable in a corporate

65
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.370
environment.

66
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.960
So now if you're thinking, well, I'll definitely be using the enterprise.

67
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.910
When would I ever use WPA personnel, both home networks for your network at home?

68
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.440
You don't want to have the expense and complexity of having to use a server there and you don't need

69
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.340
the scalability it would give you.

70
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.150
So WPA personnel is used in personal networks.

71
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.840
In a corporate environment, you should be using WPA enterprise.

72
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.080
And once it's a really small environment, OK, that's everything I needed to tell you here, but covers

73
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.510
all of the theory of wireless networks now.

74
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.320
So starting.

75
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.680
In the next lecture, I'll start showing you how to configure them with eLab Daniel.
