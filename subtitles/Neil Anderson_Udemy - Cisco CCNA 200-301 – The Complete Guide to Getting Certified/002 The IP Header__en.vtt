00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:14.560
In this lecture, we're going to cover Layer 3 of the OSI model, which is the Network Layer. The Network

2
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.500
Layer is responsible for routing packets to their destination on the network,

3
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.420
so this is why routers operate at the Network Layer, and it's also responsible for Quality of Service as well.

4
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.450
What Quality of Service is, you might have

5
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:38.420
one particular type of traffic that requires a better level of service than another level of traffic.

6
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.780
For example, if you're running voice or video over IP, it's sensitive to delay.

7
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.600
So, we're going to give it better Quality of Service than something like email. IP, Internet Protocol, is

8
00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:02.860
the best known Layer 3 protocol. IPv4 is the focus of this section. There's also IPv6 as well,

9
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.810
which is the upgrade for IPv4. Later on, throughout the course,

10
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:17.690
we'll be talking about why we have IPv6, and also its actual usage today, and how to configure it.

11
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.390
IP is a connectionless protocol,

12
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.190
so there's no acknowledgements at Layer 3. You can still have reliable traffic by using TCP and

13
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.150
its acknowledgements at Layer 4 or by having it built into the upper layers. Other Layer 3 protocols

14
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.190
apart from IP include ICMP, which is the Internet Control Message Protocol, which is used for ping, for

15
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.730
troubleshooting, which we'll also be talking about later in the course, and also IPSec for secure

16
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.140
encrypted communications.

17
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.180
There are other protocols as well, but IP is the best known one, by far the most commonly used.

18
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.250
That's what we're going to be talking about in this entire section. IP addressing is a logical addressing

19
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:14.730
scheme which is implemented at Layer 3. The network designer uses IP addressing to partition the overall

20
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.160
network into smaller subnetworks, or commonly called subnets. By having different subnets,

21
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.970
it improves performance and security and makes troubleshooting easier. It improves performance because

22
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.780
rather than having one big flat network, we divide it into smaller subnets, and we can keep the traffic on

23
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.040
the particular subnet that it needs to be on rather than going everywhere.

24
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.250
So, we get better performance that way.

25
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.030
We also get better security by having this logical addressing as well.

26
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.270
For example, let's say that we've got accounting servers. We can put them on one particular subnet,

27
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.750
and that makes it really easy to control who's got access to those servers.

28
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.740
Also, it makes troubleshooting easier as well because by partitioning the network in o smaller parts,

29
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.320
if we have a problem, it's easy to see what part of the network the problem is on and concentrate there.

30
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.880
So that's our Layer 3 addressing, it uses IP addresses. At Layer 2, which will get to soon in the next

31
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.630
section,

32
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.630
we have MAC addresses

33
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:30.040
if we're using Ethernet. IP addresses Layer 3. MAC addresses Layer 2. IP addresses a logical addressing

34
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.700
scheme.

35
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.590
MAC addresses is just one big flat global addressing scheme.

36
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.020
So you see, this section is going to be a lot longer, more involved than when we get to MAC addresses

37
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.600
because there's a lot more work to do here.

38
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.100
There's no logical separation at Layer 2, the OSI model, it's done here at Layer 3 with our IP addressing.

39
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.320
Okay,

40
00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:01.060
this is the first lecture in our Layer 3 section. So, as usual, we'll have a review of the OSI stack again.

41
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.270
You're going to see this several times because it's important, and I really want to drill into you about

42
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.020
how networking works based on the OSI model.

43
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.610
So again, we've got the 7 layers. Layer 7 is the Application Layer, where when a sender is going to

44
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:26.420
send traffic, it composes the packet. It creates the Layer 7 information first. That then gets encapsulated

45
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.880
in the Layer 6 Presentation Layer header, then encapsulated in the Session Layer header. Top 3 Layers

46
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.430
are upper layers, mostly the concern of application developers. As networkers, we start getting really

47
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.910
interested at Layer 4, so the packet we've got Layer 7, 6, 5 then gets encapsulated with the

48
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:55.180
Layer 4 header, and that will either be a TCP or a UDP header, and the port information will be on there.

49
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.320
That then gets further encapsulated in the Layer 3 header, which is the subject of this section. Main

50
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.160
information in the Layer 3 header is the IP address information, that you'll see coming up shortly

51
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.650
with the rest of the information that's also in the header. Our network infrastructure device that works at Layer 3

52
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:22.180
is our routers. Then, we carry on making the packet we put on to the Layer 2 header which is

53
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.060
the Data-Link header on a Local Area Network that will be using Ethernet, and we'll have the source and

54
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.980
destination MAC address there. Our network devices that work at Layer 2 are our switches.

55
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.480
Finally, the packet will actually get put onto the physical wire, that's at the Physical Layer, and our hubs

56
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.780
work at the Physical Layer. Not that we still have hubs, we'll talk about that a bit more later too.

57
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.500
Okay,

58
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.650
last slide in this lecture, we're going to take a look at the IP header. So the top row that

59
00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.700
you see there, first part is a 4-bit version. It's either going to be IPv4 or IPv6

60
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.660
that's referenced in that field. We then have the 4-bit header length, the length of the IP header. It can be

61
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.450
a different length because the header options that you see further down can be variable length. We then

62
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.340
have the type of service byte. This is used for Quality of Service information.

63
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.870
So we can put a marking on the packet to specify what kind of traffic this is, and on our routers later,

64
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.480
we can take an action based on that marking to give it better service if we need to, for example, for

65
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:38.680
our Voice over IP (VOIP) traffic. We then have the 16-bit total length of the packet. The next row underneath

66
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.620
is used for fragment information. With our different media types,

67
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:52.120
for example, Ethernet, there is a maximum transmission unit size, the maximum size of the packet. Maximum

68
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.920
size by default in Ethernet is a 1500 byte MTU.

69
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:05.320
If we try a packet onto the wire that is larger than that size, it has to get split up into smaller parts

70
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.520
which are called our fragments.

71
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.720
The second row of information on the IP header is used to help keep track of those fragments.

72
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.880
The next row down,

73
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.870
we have an 8-bit time to live (TTL) field.

74
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:25.310
Every time a packet goes through a router, the router will decrement the TTL field by one.

75
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.200
If it gets down to zero, then that router will drop the packet.

76
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.130
What this is for is to prevent routing loops.

77
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:39.010
We might have an error in our network somewhere that is causing packets to endlessly loop around the

78
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.270
network without ever getting to their destination.

79
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.010
We don't want packets to loop around forever, so TTL will prevent that and drop them.

80
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.290
Now, it doesn't fix the underlying problem. We still need to cure the loop. So that traffic, once

81
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.960
they get there, that stops us from having a huge amount of traffic getting build up on our network, slowing

82
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:06.970
it down, which is just looping. The next field, the 8-bit protocol, that will specify the Layer 4 information

83
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.720
type, typically, TCP or UDP.

84
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:17.460
We then have a checksum which is used to check that packet has not been corrupted in transit.

85
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:24.150
Next, we have the source IP address specifying where the packet came from and then the destination IP

86
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:30.390
address specifying where the packet is going to. The next field is the header options, where we can put

87
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.920
in additional information.

88
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.150
It's not commonly used.

89
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.980
And finally, we have the data,

90
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:43.830
the rest of the packet. Okay, so that is the basics of Layer 3 and the IP header, but I've got a lot

91
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.700
more information to tell you here. So, I'll see you in the next lecture.
