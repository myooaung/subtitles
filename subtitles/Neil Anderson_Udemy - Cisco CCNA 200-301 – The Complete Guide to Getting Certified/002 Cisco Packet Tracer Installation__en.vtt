00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.390
In this lecture, you'll learn how to install Cisco Packet Tracer, which is the software used for the

2
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.290
labs. To get the software,

3
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.050
the first thing that you have to do is sign up for the free Introduction to Packet Tracer course,

4
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.960
which you can find on the Cisco Network Academy website.

5
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.150
So, I'm on the page already.

6
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.510
You can see the URL up here at the top, and then I'm going to hover my mouse over 'Sign up today!'

7
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.120
and click on English.

8
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.100
Then when the next page loads, I'll enter in my name here and my email address.

9
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.470
I created a temporary email here to do this demo, and then solve the math question, and then I can

10
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.130
click on Submit.

11
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.840
Then, it tells me that they've sent an activation email to my inbox, so I will go there, and I can

12
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.470
see the message coming in now into my inbox, so I will click on that. I can see there's a link here

13
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.080
to activate the account, so I will click on that. The next page asks me to create my account at

14
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.500
Cisco.com, which will give me access to this Cisco Network Academy. It's already filled my detail and my

15
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.970
name in here for me.

16
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.710
It asks me some additional details here, including setting a password.

17
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.970
I've already filled that in, so now I can click on Register.

18
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.000
Then on the next page, it asks me to sign in, so I'll enter my email address, and then click on Next, and then

19
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:56.280
enter my password, and I can click on Sign in. It's then going to ask me for yet more details, so I will

20
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.630
fill all those in.

21
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.730
I have already,

22
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.420
and then I can click on Create Account. Then I can click on Launch Course, and that will finally take me

23
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.560
into the Introduction to Packet Tracer course.

24
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.820
So if you're haven't used Packet Tracer before, this course is useful. It will teach you how to build your

25
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.560
own projects in there. I'll actually show you how to do that quickly here,

26
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.700
but if you want to have a longer course about that, then you can watch this Introduction to Packet Tracer course.

27
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.250
The other thing that we can do from in here is to actually download Packet Tracer.

28
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.870
To do that, I need to click on the My NetAcad button over here on the left.

29
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.850
I can also just go to www.netacad.com and log in there.

30
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:56.670
That will bring me to this page, and under the Resources menu, I can click on Download Packet Tracer, and then on

31
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.690
the page here, I select the version for the Operating System I'm running on.

32
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.940
You can get it for Windows, Linux, or Mac. I'm on 64-bit Windows here,

33
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.080
so I'm going to click that option, and then that is going to download the installation file to my Downloads

34
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.850
folder.

35
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.710
It's 146 Megabytes, so it might take a little bit of time.

36
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.800
I'll just give this a couple more seconds, and then it will be done.

37
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.790
And then when that is ready, I can go to my Downloads folder, and I can see it there.

38
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.640
So, I double click on the executable. In windows, click on

39
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.180
Yes

40
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.000
to accept this, accept the agreement.

41
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.000
It's a very simple install, I'm basically going to just be clicking Next, Next, Next here.

42
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.760
So I do that, and then it's going to install Packet Tracer.

43
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.150
This is going to take a little bit of time as well, so I'll pause the video again here and come back when

44
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.980
it's done.

45
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:03.360
When the installation has completed, I can click on finish, and that is going to launch Packet Tracer

46
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.610
And when it finishes starting up here, it's going to ask me to log in with that same username and password

47
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.100
again.

48
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.900
You're going to have to do this every time you use Packet Tracer,

49
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:24.540
it is a mild annoyance. So I'll put in my username, which was ptdemo@flackbox.com, and then

50
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:32.160
on the next page, I'm going to put in my password in there, and then I can click on Sign In. This is

51
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.400
now going to open up Packet Tracer for me. When I open it like this is going to be just a blank project

52
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.220
with nothing in there.

53
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.920
If you do want to create your own projects, you'll see that you've got the devices down here at the bottom.

54
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:54.300
So, there are all of my different routers. I can just click on here, and I can drag and drop a couple

55
00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.660
of routers into my topology. But, say that I want a switch as well. You can see down in the bottom left,

56
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.600
it's Routers that are selected there. We'll like to add a switch. Just over the right of there is Switches.

57
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.410
I would click on that, and then I can select the switch that I want, and drag and drop that in as well.

58
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.080
Then, I also need to connect my devices, so I'll click on the button here to add connections. You need

59
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.450
to use the right type,

60
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.340
so I'll add just straight-through ethernet connections here. I'm going to click that button, and then I

61
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.030
can click on my router and select the interface that I want to connect the cable to, and then click

62
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.450
on my switch and select a port

63
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.350
I'm going to connect it to on my switch. And then, I need to click on the link button again.

64
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.750
So each time you add a new link, you need to click on the link button again. I'm going to select the port

65
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.820
on my router I want to plug the cable into, and then click on the switch, and select the port on the

66
00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.800
switch I'm going to plug that into. Then to actually configure your devices, you just click on them,

67
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:08.220
so I'll click on my first router here, and then click on the CLI tab, and then that gets me into the Command

68
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:16.110
Line Interface for that router. Okay, so that's how you can quickly build your own typologies to practice

69
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:23.550
with in Packet Tracer. For this course, you don't need to build your own topologies because I'm going to

70
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:30.690
be supplying pre-built projects for every single technology that you're going to be learning

71
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.130
on the Cisco devices, and I'll show you how to use the projects that are provided with the course in

72
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.940
the next lecture.
