00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:16.520
In this section, we're going to focus on Spanning Tree, which is a Layer 2 technology which prevents

2
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.010
loops across your Layer 2 switched network.

3
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:29.660
But before we get into that, I want to do a review of how network redundancy, and our path selection,

4
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:39.980
and loop prevention works at Layer 3. At Layer 3, routing and HSRP control the path selection and provide

5
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.910
automatic failover for our Layer 3 connections.

6
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.300
You see the network topology diagram here,

7
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.850
I'm going to be using this throughout this section, and the routers up at the top, so R1, R2, 

8
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.870
SP1, and SP2 at the service providers,

9
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.770
they've all got Layer 3 connections between them.

10
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:13.340
There's also a Layer 3 connection going from R1 and R2, down to the end hosts, PC1 and PC2 at

11
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.070
the bottom. But our switches, so CD1, the Core Distribution Switch 1, CD2, and our Access

12
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.840
Layer switches, Acc3 and Acc4, they are Layer 2 only switches. So this first lecture,

13
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.990
we're going to be talking about those Layer 3 connections.

14
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:43.610
So looking at the path selection, which is controlled by our rotuing, for this example, I'm just going

15
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.260
to use static routes.

16
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.880
But if we were using a dynamic routing protocol, it would work pretty much the same as this. So my first

17
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.710
route on R1,

18
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.870
I'm going to have a default static route for all traffic going out to the Internet, which points at SP1,

19
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:17.030
my Service Provider (SP) router that is directly attached to R1. The command that use is 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.1',

20
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.670
the next hop address on SP1.

21
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.560
And because this is a static route, it has a default Administrative Distance of 1.

22
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.610
Now, I want to have a redundant route here as well.

23
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.890
I've put in redundant network devices, so I don't have any single points of failure.

24
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.290
So if that link between R1 up to SP1 goes down, I need to be able to route around the failure.

25
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.500
So, I've got a backup route for that on R1.

26
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.940
My command is 'ip route

27
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.430
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0'

28
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.430
and the next hop address is 10.10.20.2.

29
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:07.610
Whenever you configure a backup route, it needs to be pointing to the same subnet as the main route was.

30
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.950
So that's why they're both going to 0.0.0.0

31
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.330
with a /0 mask. This route points to R2, rather than SP1

32
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.340
and to make a backup for the primary route, I give it an Administrative Distance of 5. With Administrative

33
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.730
Distance, that controls which will be the preferred route, with the lower number being the better.

34
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.980
So my first route has got an AD of 1, the route is going to SP1 will be preferred. If that route goes

35
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.220
down, for example, because the SP1 router or the linked to SP1 goes down, then this route will

36
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.470
take over in the routing table.

37
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.120
So, that gives me redundancy for my northbound traffic.

38
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.350
The reason the traffic works via R2 is the R2 is going to have a similar configuration to R1.

39
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.830
So R2 has got its primary default

40
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.160
route

41
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.990
pointing at SP2, the service provider router that it's directly connected to. R2 will have a mirror backup route

42
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.030
pointing back towards R1.

43
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:21.680
I also need to have reachability and failover for my southbound traffic going down towards my PCs.

44
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.790
Well if you look at R1, its gigabitEthernet 0/1

45
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.070
interface has got an IP address 10.10.10.2. It's in the same subnet as the PCs,

46
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.600
so it is directly connected to the 10.10.10.0 subnet,

47
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.650
and whenever an interface is directly connected, it goes into the routing table as a Connected route

48
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.080
with an Administrative Distance of 0,

49
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.870
so it will always be the preferred route to get to that network.

50
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.980
I want to have redundancy to get down to my PCs in case the link going downstream to my CD1

51
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.980
switch goes down.

52
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.330
So for that, I'm going to have a backup route pointing towards R2

53
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.450
again. My configuration there is

54
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:18.710
'ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0' and the next hop address on R2 of 10.10.20.2.

55
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.730
This is a static route, so it has the default Administrative Distance of 1, which is not as good

56
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.550
as the connected interfaces, AD of 0,

57
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.890
so this will function as a backup route.

58
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:41.120
Okay, so that was how I did my configuration on R1, R2 is going to have similar configuration

59
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.430
as this as well.

60
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.790
So, I've got redundancy going northbound and southbound through my R1 and R2 routers.

61
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.080
Now, looking at things from the point of view of the PCs, they've got two gateways available on the

62
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:07.090
10.10.10.0/24 network. There's R1 at 10.10.10.2, and there's R2 at 10.10.10.3

63
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.060
I want to have just one IP address to use as the default gateway on my PCs,

64
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.920
so I'm going to configure HSRP on my R1 and R2 routers.

65
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.430
This is configured at the interface level, and its interface gigEthernet0/1 which is facing down

66
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.010
towards the PCs on both routers.

67
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:36.470
So on R1, on interface gigEthernet0/1, I give it its physical IP address of 10.10.10.2, 'no shutdown',

68
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.800
and then I say 'standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1'.

69
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.860
That is the HSRP configuration that uses a virtual IP (VIP) address of 10.10.10.1. On R2,

70
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.730
I give it physical address 10.10.10.3, and it also has that shared virtual IP address

71
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.250
of 10.10.10.1.

72
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:05.660
I haven't configured priority and pre-emption for this example, so the highest IP address will default to

73
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.040
being the active HSRP gateway, that is on R2 because it's 10.10.10.3.

74
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.640
So all of the PCs will use R2 as their active default gateway,

75
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.420
R1 is going to be the spare.

76
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:31.700
If R2 or the link to R2 from CD2 goes down, then R1 will detect that and R1 will transition

77
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:38.990
to being the active gateway, and now all our traffic going northbound from our PCs will go via R1.

78
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:51.360
Okay, so that is how we configure our routing and our redundancy and failover when we've got redundant

79
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.700
devices in a Layer 3 network.

80
00:07:54.010 --> 00:08:02.240
Now, it is possible that we could make a misconfiguration here and create a routing loop.

81
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.840
So, let's have a look at how that can happen.

82
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:19.260
So here we've added a static route on R1 for 10.10.50.0/24 with the next hop address of 203.0.113.1 on SP1,

83
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.360
and then on SP1,

84
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:30.500
we add an IP route also for the 10.10.50.0 network with the next hop address of 203.0.113.10 on SP2.

85
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:38.960
SP2 routes it to R2 with IP address next hop 203.0.113.6,

86
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:46.410
and on R2, we're routing traffic for 10.10.50.0 to R1 with the next hop address

87
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.840
of 10.10.20.1.

88
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:57.630
So you've see we've created a Layer 3 routing loop here, and what would happen would be if traffic gets

89
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:04.810
sent into R1 or any of these routers with the next hop address of the 10.10.50.0

90
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:12.600
network, it's going to start looping around those routers. But it's not going to loop forever

91
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:18.240
because in the IP header, we've got the Time To Live field, the TTL.

92
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:27.090
The way that the TTL works is every time that a packet passes through a router, it will decrement the TTL

93
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:33.620
value by 1. And if the TTL gets down to 0, the router will drop the traffic.

94
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.140
So let's see how this fixes our loop,

95
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:46.020
so a packet has come into R1 with a destination address, let's say  10.1.50.10, and it currently

96
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.620
has a TTL of 5.

97
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:56.870
So R1 will route it to SP1, it gets to SP1. SP1 will forward it to SP2 and it will decrement

98
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.460
the TTL to 4. SP2 forwards it to R2, the TTL is decremented

99
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:10.950
to 3. R2 sends it to R1, TTL goes to 2, and R1 will then send it back to SP1

100
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:16.230
and decrement the TTl to 1. When it comes into SP1,

101
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.700
if it was going to forward on again, it would decrement the TTL to 0.

102
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:27.660
So it won't do that, it will drop the packet here and it will send an ICMP time exceeded message back

103
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.550
to R1 to let it know the packet was dropped.

104
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.120
Okay, so you've seen it at

105
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:40.920
Layer 3, our standard Layer 3 routing and HSRP will control the path selection and provide automatic

106
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.660
failover for our Layer 3 connections when we've got redundant devices.

107
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.670
Dynamic routing protocols have built in loop prevention mechanisms.

108
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:57.390
So that example I showed you there, where I deliberately created a routing loop with static routes,

109
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.970
when you're using dynamic routing protocols, that shouldn't really be possible to happen because they've

110
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.550
got built in loop prevention mechanisms,

111
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:13.800
but the TTL is there in the IP header to act as a final failsafe in case a loop does somehow get created.

112
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.540
Okay, so that's how things work at

113
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.950
Layer 3.

114
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:25.320
In the next lecture, we'll start taking a look at how path selection, failover, and loop prevention is going

115
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.180
to work for our Layer 2 only switches in our network example.
