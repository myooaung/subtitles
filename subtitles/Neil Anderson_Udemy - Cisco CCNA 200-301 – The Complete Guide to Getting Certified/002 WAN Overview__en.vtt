00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:15.950
In this lecture, you�ll learn what Wide Area Networks are and how they compare to LANs, Local Area Networks,

2
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.590
and MANs, which are Metropolitan Area Networks.

3
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.090
So, starting off with the definitions first,

4
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.340
and when you see this, it's so simple that it's kind of comically easy.

5
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.500
But if you didn�t know the definitions and somebody asked you what is a WAN, then maybe you�re going

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.090
to start trying to talk about different connection types and things like that.

7
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.960
But the actual definition of a LAN, a MAN, and a WAN is super easy.

8
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.530
So, a Local Area Network is a network that connects computers and other devices in a relatively small

9
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.280
area, which will typically be a single building or a group of buildings.

10
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.380
So if you�ve got a company, they own a building, and they�ve got all their internal connections in there for that building,

11
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.520
that is their Local Area Network. Or maybe, it's a university campus which is spread out over several

12
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.070
buildings, but all in the same small area,

13
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.570
that would also be a Local Area Network as well.

14
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.860
A Wide Area Network is a geographically distributed network that connects multiple Local Area Networks

15
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.290
together. So say, we�ve got a company, and they�ve got an office in New York,

16
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.910
so they�ve got a LAN in New York. They�ve also got a building in Boston,

17
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.860
so that�s their LAN in Boston,

18
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.390
and we want New York and Boston to have connectivity to each other.

19
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.450
What we would need to have is a Wide Area Network to connect them together. That is our WAN.

20
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.290
The other type of network that you�ll hear about is a MAN, which is a Metropolitan Area Network.

21
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.370
This is a network that connects computers and other devices in a geographic area larger than a LAN

22
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.980
but smaller than a WAN.

23
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.229
You see what I mean about it being kind of comically simple about the definitions.

24
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.030
So if you�re at a university campus and it�s all in one campus, that would be a LAN. 

25
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.350
But if there�s a university and they�ve got their main campus, which is in, say, New York, and maybe got a smaller

26
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:29.630
campus, which is five miles away also in New York, so within the same city, and they connected those

27
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.560
two campuses together, each campus would be its own LAN.

28
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.680
The connection that connected the two campuses together would make up a MAN, a Metropolitan Area

29
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.210
Network.

30
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.750
Now, you won�t hear MANs being used so much, the definition, as you do with the LANs and WANs.

31
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.170
So, that scenario there where

32
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.710
we have two campuses within the same city, and we connected them together,

33
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.290
you could describe that either as a WAN, or you could describe it as a MAN as well.

34
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.850
So, the term MAN is not so commonly used.

35
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.280
So looking at again, a bit more detail with the differences, this is something that we covered in

36
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:17.790
an earlier section when we spoke about our LANs. So our LAN network here, it's for a small building.

37
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.140
We�ve got a collapsed Distribution and Core layer,

38
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.070
so we've got redundancy here.

39
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.130
So we�ve got a couple of redundant routers, which connect to the Wide Area Network, which connect to our

40
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.130
other offices.

41
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.210
Also, so we're going to want to connect to the Internet as well,

42
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.270
and that goes down to a pair of redundant Distribution and Core layer switches, and then that goes

43
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.640
down to our Access layer, where our end users get plugged into the network.

44
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.280
So, this would be a Local Area Network.

45
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.840
We can also have the Core, the Distribution, and the Access layer split out into three separate areas.

46
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.720
What you see here, this would be for a larger Local Area Network.

47
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.880
We�re still going to have our routers on the outside here connecting us to the WAN. That was then a pair

48
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.640
of Core layer switches that goes down to a pair of Distribution switches which are

49
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.970
each different building in the campus,

50
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.079
and then again, we have our end hosts connected in at the access layer.

51
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.010
So that�s a couple of different ways you can design your local area network, depending on how big it

52
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.310
is.

53
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.960
For our Wide Area Networks, that�s just where we connect our different Local Area Networks together.

54
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.710
So, we've got a LAN in New York, we've got a LAN in Boston.

55
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.860
We connect them together so that our users have got connectivity across our different sites, and that

56
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.640
is our Wide Area Network. There are loads of different ways we can design and build our WAN,

57
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.120
and that's what is going to be covered throughout the rest of this section.
