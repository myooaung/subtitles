00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.580
I want to show you how the command history works in a second, so I'm just going to enter a couple

2
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.880
of random commands in here. It's just adding a couple of host entries.

3
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.660
Don't worry too much about what this command does.

4
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.890
It's not important.

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.250
I'm just using this to illustrate the command history coming up in a second.

6
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.910
So, I'm adding IP host Server1 and IP host Server2.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.760
Next, I'm going to change the name of my router. I'm going to give it a hostname, but I'm going to deliberately

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.810
make a mistake here.

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.250
So I type in 'Router1' and hit Enter, and you'll see it tells me, "Invalid input detected at the marker."

10
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.380
It's because I forgot to say 'hostname' at the start here, so let's correct that.

11
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.650
But rather than typing the whole thing in again, when you make a typo on a command, the quickest way

12
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.450
to correct it is to hit the up arrow, and then that will bring the previous command back again.

13
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.320
Now, what I could do is I can use the left arrow to move the cursor to the left.

14
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.240
But if it's a big, long command, a way that you can do this quicker is by hitting Ctrl+A,

15
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.080
and that will bring you to the start of the line.

16
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.820
So I hit the up arrow to get the previous command back, then Ctrl+A to move to the start of the line,

17
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.950
and I can now type in 'hostname' and a space, and that's the correct command

18
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.350
now.

19
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:36.470
So I hit Enter and notice that the prompt changes to reflect the hostname that I just entered there.

20
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.980
Next, I'm going to show you command history.

21
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.980
So I'm going to hit the up arrow a few times, and you'll see each time I hit the up arrow, it cycles back through

22
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.450
my previous commands.

23
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.680
That's why I entered those commands earlier. Notice that it only cycles back through commands at the same

24
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.160
level.

25
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.640
I'm in global configuration here, so it's cycling back through the commands I entered in global configuration

26
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.880
mode.

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.500
It doesn't show the commands that I entered at the enable prompt or in the user mode. Now, I'm just going to delete

28
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.010
this command to show you the next thing. While I'm in global configuration,

29
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:26.000
if I try to do a 'show' command, so let's do a 'show ip interface brief', and I hit Enter, and I get the "Invalid

30
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.200
input detected."

31
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.050
You know, I said earlier that where you'll most often see this is if you've put in a typo. The other

32
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.070
place where you'll often see it is if you're at the wrong command level. When you're a beginner,

33
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.360
this is the most frustrating thing about the IOS command line.

34
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.570
You'll make this mistake a lot, where you're going to be at the wrong level when you enter a command.

35
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.600
Our 'show' and our 'debug' commands are entered in privileged exec mode at the enable prompt.

36
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.990
If I try to put it in global configuration, it's going to give me an error message, but this could be

37
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.890
really annoying.

38
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.140
So, thankfully, there's a workaround for this when you want to enter a 'show' command because it's very

39
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.820
common to put 'show' commands in.

40
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.520
And what I can do is I'm going to enter the same command, but I'm going to put 'do' at the front.

41
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.910
So again, I'm going to use the command history here. Rather than typing the whole thing in,

42
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.270
I hit the up arrow to get the command back, then Ctrl+A to go back to the start of the line.

43
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.980
Then I type in 'do' and a space and hit Enter, and you'll see that the 'show' command is going to work now.

44
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.670
And when you enter 'do', that will work from any level unless you're actually in privileged exec mode.

45
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.930
At privileged exec mode,

46
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.710
you have to do the 'show' command without 'do'. At all the other levels, you put 'do' in front of the 'show', and then

47
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.430
it's going to work.

48
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.870
So far, we've seen the user exec mode, the privileged exec mode, also known as the enable prompt,

49
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.670
and global configuration.

50
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.950
There's other levels when you're configuring something specific on the router. Meaning, at global configuration,

51
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.590
this is where I would do my global configuration for things that affect the router as a whole.

52
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.790
If I wanted to configure a specific interface, I need to go to that level in the command hierarchy.

53
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:25.610
So looking at my output here, I can see the interfaces I've got available on this router. If I wanted to

54
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.920
configure interface FastEthernet0/0, for example, putting an IP address on there,

55
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.760
I have to go to interface configuration mode. So to get there,

56
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.690
the command is 'interface', and I'll use tab completion here.

57
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:49.610
So 'interface fastEthernet 0/0', and notice here that in the output above, FastEthernet, that was capitalized

58
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.290
at the start.

59
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.300
Here, I don't need to use capital letters.

60
00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:00.110
IOS is not case sensitive. It doesn't matter if you use upper case or lower case, with one exception that

61
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.840
we'll talk about a little bit later in this lecture.

62
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.610
So I go to interface

63
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.090
FastEthernet 0/0,  hit Enter. You'll see that the command prompt changes again to show

64
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.950
config-if,

65
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.860
and I can see very clearly that I'm at the interface configuration level. If I want to drop back down to level,

66
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.350
I enter the 'exit' command, and that takes me back to global configuration.

67
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.490
If I wanted to go to the enable prompt again, I would enter 'exit' again, and that will drop me back to the

68
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.430
enable prompt to privileged exec mode.

69
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.710
Notice from here, I can't enter interface FastEthernet 0/0.

70
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.490
This is going to give me an error message because you have to go up through the levels one by one.

71
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.050
You can't skip straight from the enable prompt to the interface prompt.

72
00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.990
So I'll go back through the levels, I enter 'config t' to get to global configuration, and then 'interface

73
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.390
fast0/0' to get to the interface mode.

74
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.730
So when you go up through the levels, you have to go one by one.

75
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.650
When you drop back down the levels, you can actually do that all in one go.

76
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.040
So, it was 'exit' to drop down one level. To drop all the way back to the enable prompt with one command,

77
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.910
I can enter 'end'.

78
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.040
Another way I could have done that would be by hitting Ctrl+C on the keyboard.

79
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:34.290
Okay, a couple of the most common commands you'll use when you're working on a Cisco router or switch is the

80
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:41.670
'show ip interface brief' that you saw earlier. That will show all the interfaces on the router, and the

81
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.160
state of the interface, whether it's up or not, and also the IP address configured on the interface as well,

82
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.840
if there's an IP address on there. The other 'show' command that is used really, really often is 'show running-config'.

83
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.380
That shows the entire configuration on the router,

84
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.400
and I'll hit the Spacebar here to scroll through the configuration.

85
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.910
You can see even on a new router, it's a really long configuration file, and it's going to take

86
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.060
quite a while to scroll all through there. On a production

87
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.270
router,

88
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.050
it's going to be even longer because there's going to be actual configuration in there.

89
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.460
There are switches we can use for the 'show run' command, which are going to help us target the actual part

90
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.530
of the configuration that we want to look at.

91
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.320
For example, if I want to look at the configuration for the particular interface, I can do 'show run

92
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.380
interface', and then the interface I'm interested in,

93
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.190
and it shows me just that part of the configuration.

94
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.720
So to see the interface configuration, it's 'show run interface', and the interface number. The other switches that

95
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.110
we can use on the 'show run' command use a pipe '|'.

96
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.710
To give you an example of that, I can do a 'show run',

97
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:59.610
and then the pipe '|' symbol, which looks like that, and then the available options after there,

98
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.900
the ones that are most commonly used,

99
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.600
begin is probably the most commonly used.

100
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.650
I can also include and exclude as well.

101
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:15.750
So, for example, I could do 'show run | begin hostname', and this will show me the running configuration, but starting

102
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.470
from where hostname shows up in the running configuration.

103
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:27.780
Now, you know, I said that there's an exception to when the IOS command line is case sensitive or not.

104
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:33.330
When you use a pipe '|', this is actually using a regular expression which is case sensitive.

105
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:42.690
So if I did a 'show run | begin', and try not to put a typo in, and then 'Hostname', with a capital H,

106
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.310
and hit Enter, you'll see it's going to just go straight back to the command line again.

107
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:54.360
This is not an error. The reason is that 'Hostname', with a capital H, is not in the running configuration at all,

108
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.070
so there's no output to show.

109
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:04.470
To give you examples for the other pipe options, I could do a 'show run', and then pipe '|' it to 'include

110
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.490
interface', and it will show me all the lines that include 'interface'. Meaning, the word 'interface' in the

111
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.450
actual output.

112
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.410
I can also do a 'show run | exclude interface'.

113
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.800
This will show me all lines from the configuration but do not include the word 'interface'.

114
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:32.160
And I can also do a 'show run | section interface'. That will show me the configuration for

115
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.770
all my different interfaces.

116
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.580
Now, when you've got a production router, you're not going to just have interfaces configured on there.

117
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.760
You'll have other things like routing protocols, for example.

118
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:48.990
So I could also do a 'show run | section', and put in the particular part of the configuration

119
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.070
I want to see here.

120
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.990
Now, if you put in a question mark '?', it's not very useful here because it just tells you 'LINE', telling

121
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.550
you to use a regular expression.

122
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:04.560
For example, I could put in 'section bgp' to see information about the BGP routing protocol. I haven't

123
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.580
configured that on this router yet,

124
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:13.370
so I'm not going to get any output. But if I was using BGP on this router, and I had a big, long configuration

125
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:18.800
on there, this would be a useful command because it would just take me straight to the BGP configuration, and

126
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.330
I could see that very clearly.

127
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.400
Okay, so that's how to navigate the IOS command line.

128
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.800
In the next lecture, we'll take a look at how to manage our configuration files.
