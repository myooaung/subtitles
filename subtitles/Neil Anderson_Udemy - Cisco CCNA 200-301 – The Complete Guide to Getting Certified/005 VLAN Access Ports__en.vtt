00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:14.860
In this lecture, you'll learn about VLAN access ports and how to configure them. So our access ports are

2
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:23.800
configured on switch interfaces where end hosts are plugged in, and access ports are configured with one

3
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.540
specific VLAN.

4
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.350
For example, we've got an Engineering PC,

5
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.780
it gets plugged into the switch on that port,

6
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.520
we configure it as an access port in the Engineering VLAN. The configuration is all on the switch.

7
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.880
The end host is not VLAN aware,

8
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.490
it doesn't even know that the VLAN exists.

9
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.360
The end hosts doesn't need to know anything about VLANs. Switches only allow traffic within the same

10
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.020
VLAN.

11
00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.650
That's a benefit we get from configuring VLANs, they segment our campus LAN into smaller broadcast

12
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.150
domains.

13
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.190
So, we are going to have an Engineering VLAN and a Sales VLAN

14
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.830
in the example here. All my Engineering PCs and the router interface and the Engineering IP subnet

15
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.240
go into the Engineering VLAN, and all of my Sales PCs and the router interface for the Sales subnet

16
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.220
go into the Sales VLAN.

17
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.180
Whenever I send unicast traffic within the same IP subnet, for example, from Sales PC2 to Sales

18
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.350
PC1, the traffic comes into the switch, and the switch

19
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.610
already knows the MAC address of Sales PC1 in this example. It just sends it out that one port.

20
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.820
Now, if we misconfigured our VLANs, for example, Sales PC1,

21
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.890
if we put that in the Engineering VLAN by accident, instead of the Sales VLAN, then our Sales PCs

22
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.560
are not going to be able to talk to it anymore.

23
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.690
Well, nobody's going to be able to talk to it anymore.

24
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.580
So that the Sales PC2 send some traffic with a destination IP address of 10.10.20.11,

25
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.090
well, the switch does not forward traffic between different VLANs. That would have to go via a router,

26
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.900
so the traffic is not going to make it to Sales PC1.

27
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.660
So, you need to be careful when you're configuring VLANs.

28
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.920
Traffic or hosts which are in the same IP subnet should be in the same VLAN.

29
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.930
Hosts which are in a different IP subnet should also be in the same VLAN, but that's a different VLAN.

30
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.090
So Engineering goes into the Engineering VLAN,

31
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.550
Sales PCs go into the Sales VLAN.

32
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.000
The default VLAN is VLAN 1.

33
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.590
So by default, all ports on a switch are in VLAN 1, and until you manually configure VLANs,

34
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.760
your campus LAN is going to be one big broadcast

35
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.310
domain. We don't want that.

36
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.770
It's bad for performance and for security,

37
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:16.630
so we are going to configure specific VLANs. The command to do that, using our same example again,

38
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.740
so if we look at the topology, then our Engineering PCs are on interfaces FastEthernet0/3,

39
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.510
fastEthernet0/4, and fastEthernet0/5, and fastEthernet0/6.

40
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.970
We also need to put the port on the router into that VLAN as well for the VLAN subnet, so fastEthernet 0/1

41
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:48.220
is also going to go into the Engineering VLAN. Interfaces fastEthernet0/2, fastEthernet0/6,

42
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.420
and fastEthernet0/7 are going to go into the Sales VLAN.

43
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.880
So looking at the configuration, we'll do the Engineering VLAN first.

44
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.800
First off, we have to create the VLAN. To do that,

45
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.500
the command is simply 'vlan' and then the number you want to use for this VLAN, at global config.

46
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.210
So we say, 'vlan 10', that gets us into the VLAN sub configuration.

47
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.070
Optionally, you can give it a name.

48
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.390
It's a good idea to give it a logical name. Here, we've called it Eng.

49
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.390
Next, we need to configure our switch ports as access ports in the correct VLAN.

50
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.930
So we say 'interface FastEthernet0/1', 'switchport mode access' to make it an access port, and

51
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.450
'switch port access vlan 10'.

52
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.390
If you're wondering about the other type of ports we can have, we can have trunk ports as well.

53
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.280
We'll cover that in the next lecture.

54
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.310
We also need to put interfaces FastEthernet0/3 to FastEthernet0/5 into the VLAN as well.

55
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.730
Rather than having to do these commands over and over again

56
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.110
for each individual port, we can configure a range of ports.

57
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.440
So we say 'interface range FastEthernet0/3 - 5',

58
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.780
and you have to do it in this exact format here.

59
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.390
If you try to say 'interface range fastEthernet0/3 - 0/5',

60
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.130
it will give you an error message.

61
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.470
This is the correct syntax to use to specify a range of interfaces. We then say 'switchport mode access'

62
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.620
again and 'switchport access vlan 10'.

63
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.460
So that's our Engineering VLAN completed.

64
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.580
We also need to do the the Sales VLAN as well.

65
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.140
So we say, 'vlan 20' is the number we're going to use for this example. For Sales, 'name Sales' and then

66
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.890
'interface FastEthernet 0/2', 'switchport mode access', 'switchport access vlan 20', 

67
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.460
and 'interface range FastEthernet 0/6 - 7'. Again,

68
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.810
'switchport mode access', and 'switchport access vlan 20'.

69
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:56.290
So, that's how you configure them. To verify, best command is 'show vlan brief'. That shows all of the VLANs

70
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:05.110
that are available on the switch and it also shows you which ports are in which VLAN. So you can see we just

71
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:13.270
did the configuration, so interfaces fastEthernet0/1, 0/3, 0/4, 0/5 are in the Eng VLAN 10,
 

72
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:21.580
and fastEthernet0/2, 0/6, and 0/7 are in the Sales VLAN 20. All with the other physical ports are in the default

73
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.110
VLAN 1.

74
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.760
So that shows you global information about all your VLANs and all of your ports.

75
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:36.660
If you want to see information specific to an individual port, you can say 'show interface fastEthernet0/1' for example,

76
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.100
and then put 'switchport' at the end.

77
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:47.350
In the example here, you can see that it's an access port in VLAN 10, which is the Engineering VLAN.

78
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.330
Okay, so that's how we do the configuration for our access ports.

79
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.050
In the next lecture, I'll show you with a lab demo.
