00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.450
In this lecture, you'll learn about virtualization, which is one of the main enablers of cloud computing.

2
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.540
It allows for resource pooling where multiple customers are internal departments share the same underlying

3
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:29.100
hardware and virtualization has been around a lot longer than cloud computing has.

4
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.250
This lecture focuses on server virtualization because that was the first type available.

5
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.090
But the same principle I'll cover here can be applied to virtualize network infrastructure devices as

6
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.480
well.

7
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.690
I don't give you some examples of those in the next lecture.

8
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.870
So looking at our diagram here, this is the Three-tier e commerce application that we worked through

9
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.440
as a case study in the previous lecture, you can see that we've got the firewalls front connecting

10
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.770
to the Internet behind you.

11
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.690
We've got load balancers balance for incoming connections through our front end Web servers behind there.

12
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.950
And we've got the application middleware servers.

13
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.870
And at the back end, we've got the database servers and everything is tied together with our network

14
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.700
infrastructure devices of our writers and our switches.

15
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.300
So when we build the solution on cloud, this is how it's going to look and behave logically.

16
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.080
But it's not actually running on dedicated physical hardware devices.

17
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.200
The underlying devices are going to be shared with other customers or departments as well.

18
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.120
So the cloud provider does not provision separate dedicated physical hardware for every customer it's

19
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.910
shared.

20
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.760
A customer can sometimes deploy some selected dedicated hardware devices, additional cost depending

21
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.770
on the cloud provider you're going with.

22
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.210
Some will give you that option.

23
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.990
Some will not.

24
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.480
So let's look at what we had before virtualization.

25
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.060
Let's see, we're looking at a small company here and we go down to their server room.

26
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.250
We'll find the rock and indie rock.

27
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.460
They've got, for example, a Web server, a database server and an e-mail server for consistent power

28
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.610
will use Upshaw's uninterruptible power supplies for the network connectivity, but will be switches

29
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:38.730
on or and a firewall in the rock and noticed that here everything is running on separate dedicated hardware.

30
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.480
So if we look at the architecture of this and the blue box here represents a physical server, so in

31
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.330
server down at the bottom here, we've got the physical components in there, like the processor, the

32
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.220
raw mammone, the network card, the hard drive, et cetera.

33
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.950
And then the operating system runs on top of there.

34
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.330
And then on top of the operating system, we install the application.

35
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.260
For example, the first server is our email server.

36
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.770
So that's how the email server is going to look from an architectural point of view.

37
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.490
We're going to have the same for the database server, the same for the Web server, and all three of

38
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.060
them are running on their own separate physical boxes.

39
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.520
And a problem with this is if you look at the server utilization, it's going to be down around 15,

40
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.970
20 percent, normally something like that.

41
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.300
And when actually the utilization I mean, how busy the CPU is, how much memory we're using, how much

42
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.920
of the potential of the hard drive, the network card, etc. So we're really not getting good utilization

43
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.370
at all.

44
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:57.110
A lot of the potential power to the server is being wasted and you have to pay for each separate server.

45
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.460
You have to buy that server.

46
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.740
And you're also all using power, space and cooling, which is costing money as well.

47
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.050
So it's really not cost efficient.

48
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.420
So how could we get better efficiency from our server?

49
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.590
Well, the first week you might think of doing it, looking at the box here again.

50
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.089
This is a single server.

51
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.910
We've got the CPU, the RAM, and on the bottom we install the operating system on server.

52
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.180
And what we could do is we could run our email server application, our database server application

53
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.090
and our Web server application all on top of the same operating system on the same box.

54
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.050
But doing multiple applications on the same server is terrible practice.

55
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.460
It would give us better utilization if it was running at 15 percent each before.

56
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.640
Maybe we're going to be up at 45 percent utilization now.

57
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.850
But it's bad practice because if we have a problem with any one of those applications, it's liable

58
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.960
to crash all of them.

59
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.820
So you never do this.

60
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.610
So is there a better way to do it?

61
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.710
And the answer is yes, we can use server virtualization.

62
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.920
So this is going to look a little similar to the previous example.

63
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.790
But you'll see that there's a key difference to the blue box.

64
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.260
Here is our single physical server box.

65
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:25.490
Again, we've got the physical components down at the bottom, CPU, The Ram Vinik, etc., and installing

66
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:33.920
a normal operating system on there, like Windows or Linux, we install a hypervisor on top of the physical

67
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.610
hardware.

68
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.730
I'll talk a bit more about what the hypervisor does in a second.

69
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.750
For now, you can think of it as running as an operating system.

70
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:49.340
Then on top of the hypervisor, we install a virtual machine and it's not virtual machine.

71
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.240
It's got its own operating system, which is windows in this example and also the application, which

72
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.680
was our email server.

73
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.700
We then install a second virtual machine, which has got its own separate operating system, which is

74
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.440
windows again in this example.

75
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.590
But it's a separate instance of windows.

76
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.750
And on top of our operating system, we install our second application, which was the database server.

77
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.620
Then we install our third virtual machine on there.

78
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.160
We install its operating system, which is Linux, for example.

79
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.190
And on top of there, we install the Web server.

80
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.400
So you can see the difference from the previous example.

81
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.560
In the previous example, we just had one operating system and we were running all of our applications.

82
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.250
On top of that here we've got three separate instances of the operating system and each of these separate

83
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.500
instances should be separate virtual machines.

84
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.150
Oxenham behaves as if it was a separate physical server.

85
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.010
So if there's a problem in one of the applications, it's only going to affect that virtual machine.

86
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.800
It's not going to affect the other virtual machines.

87
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.750
So we don't have that bad practice issue that we had in the previous example.

88
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.080
But we got all the benefits now of running multiple virtual machines on top of one piece of physical

89
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.670
hardware.

90
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.100
So if you look at the utilization, you're going to get much better utilization, which gives you much

91
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.460
better cost efficiency.

92
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:23.840
OK, for example, there was a type one bare metal hypervisor and type one hypervisor was run directly

93
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.900
on this system hardware.

94
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.140
So this is go back again.

95
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.290
You can see the hypervisor is running on top of the hardware.

96
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.500
It's acting is the operating system.

97
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.540
The other thing it does is it gives out the access to the underlying hardware.

98
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.910
Who, the virtual machines that are running on top of it, it's in charge of making sure that they all

99
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.340
get their fair share of the underlying hardware.

100
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:55.840
Popular software, which is type one hypervisor, is VMware ESX High that runs on the physical box,

101
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:02.040
the physical server itself, which is known as the host and VM VMware is such operating system.

102
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:10.150
The host that's part of the Vesuvio Suite in VMware of a popular type one hypervisor are Microsoft hypervisor,

103
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.310
redhot KVAMME Optical VMS server on Citrix Xang Server.

104
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:23.690
There are old school type two hypervisor as well, which are not used in the data center, but I'm going

105
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.780
to cover them here to save any confusion.

106
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.640
Type two hypervisor is run on top of a host operating system.

107
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:40.070
And examples of these are VMware Workstation, VMware player and VMware Fusion for Mac, VMware workstations

108
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.300
for Windows, Virtual Box, Camu and Pottow else.

109
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.680
So let's look at the different architecture with a Type two hypervisor.

110
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.190
Here we've got the physical box, which is probably going to be your workstation or your laptop.

111
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.410
We've got the underlying physical resources there.

112
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.930
Then on top of that, we don't install the hypervisor directly onto the hardware.

113
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:08.260
We've got our normal desktop operating system like Windows or Linux or Mac here.

114
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:17.030
Then on our normal desktop operating system, we've got our normal applications like Microsoft Office,

115
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:24.590
our Web browser, etc. and then also on top of the desktop operating system, we install the hypervisor

116
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.400
on there.

117
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:31.610
Then within that hypervisor we can run our different virtual machines, which will have their own separate

118
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.780
operating systems and applications.

119
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.990
So my laptop that I'm recording this on is actually got a type two hypervisor installed on it.

120
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:49.130
I've got VMware workstation player on here and I've already started up a virtual machine, so I'll just

121
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.270
open that for you.

122
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:56.270
You can see I'm running on windows, but my virtual machine is actually a Linux box.

123
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.270
So what this would be useful for is, well, I'm an instructor.

124
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:06.560
Let's see that I go to a customer site to do some training, but I'm going to be doing training on Linux

125
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.130
this week.

126
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.180
I don't want to carry a Windows laptop with my presentation on it and a separate Linux laptop that I

127
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.140
can do the demonstrations on by running a Type two hypervisor.

128
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.060
I just take my one laptop.

129
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.680
I can use the Windows operating system to show my PowerPoint presentations.

130
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:31.050
And within VMware I can open up my Linux virtual machine so I can show that as well.

131
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:40.610
So what a Type two hypervisor is really useful for is for doing lab tests or lab demos, that kind of

132
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.910
thing.

133
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.380
So let's compare the two.

134
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:49.310
You see the type one hypervisor they are the hypervisor is running directly on top of the hardware.

135
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.440
And then we have our virtual machines running on top of there with the type two hypervisor.

136
00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.440
We've got a normal desktop operating system on top of the hardware and then our other normal applications.

137
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.200
And we also install a hypervisor in the operating system as well.

138
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.290
So where would you use one or the other?

139
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:13.760
You would use a type one hypervisor and a data center because there's less and layers there between

140
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.030
the virtual machines and the hardware.

141
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:24.410
This is this is really built for datacenter environments where you're dedicating that physical server

142
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.890
horse to be used for data center servers.

143
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.740
And because we don't have extra layer there, you're going to get better performance with the type two

144
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.640
hypervisor.

145
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.710
There's an extra layer between the virtual machines and the underlying hardware there.

146
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.190
We've got the hypervisor and a normal desktop operating system.

147
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.990
So this would be used when you've got a normal laptop that that's what you're going to be normally using

148
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.410
it for.

149
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.340
And you also want to do some lab testing or some lab demos as well.

150
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.850
And it gives you the convenience of being able to run it on your laptop.

151
00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.680
OK, that was our server virtualization.

152
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:09.410
But let me just skip back a whole bunch right here to our case study that we covered earlier as well.

153
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.420
I must be just about there.

154
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.140
OK, here we go.

155
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:22.320
So go ahead eventually with our case study, you see the servers we had our front end Web servers,

156
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.620
an application, middleware servers and our backend database servers.

157
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.000
Those are not dedicated to Osh and also Lewen.

158
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:37.590
When we are the customer of the cloud provider, our servers are going to be running as virtual machines

159
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:43.180
and is going to be our customers virtual machines running on the same underlying hardware as well.
