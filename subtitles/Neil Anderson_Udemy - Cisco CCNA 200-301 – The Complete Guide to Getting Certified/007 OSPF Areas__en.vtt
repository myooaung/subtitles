00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.390
In this lecture, you'll learn about OSPF areas. As you learned already with our Link State routing

2
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.160
protocols, every router learns the full picture

3
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.120
of it's part of the network, including every router,

4
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:30.580
its interfaces, and what they connect to, and this can cause issues in large networks. Because every router knows

5
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.890
about every link, there is going to be a lot of routes in its routing table and that can take up too much

6
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.000
memory.

7
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.020
Also, if there's a change in the network, like a new link being added or a link going down, that causes

8
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.400
all routers to reconverge which takes time and CPU resources. And the larger the network is,

9
00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.360
the bigger impact that this is going to have. So to mitigate against this, OSPF supports a hierarchical design,

10
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.269
which segments large networks into smaller areas.

11
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:13.450
Each router maintains full information about its own area, but only summary information about other areas.

12
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.810
So the routers are going to have less routes in their routing table and if a new link comes up or goes

13
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.630
down in another area, it's not going to affect that router.

14
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.360
You'll see how that works later,

15
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.170
when I show you an

16
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.860
example later in this lecture.

17
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.880
So with our areas, we have a two level hierarchy. At the top level,

18
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.170
We've got the transit area, also known as the backbone or Area 0.

19
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.860
It does not generally contain end users when we've got a multiarea network. And then we've got our regular areas,

20
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.870
also known as our nonbackbone areas, which hang below Area 0.

21
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.460
They're used to connect end users to the transit area. By default,

22
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.170
all transit traffic goes through the transit area.

23
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.729
So you see the example diagram here, we've got Area 0, and Area 1 and Area 2 are hanging off of there.

24
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.530
Any traffic between other areas, not Area 0, always has to go through Area 0. We can't

25
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.840
have traffic going directly between Area 1 and Area 2.

26
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.740
Now, multiple areas are really only required if you've got a larger network.

27
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.520
If you've got a small network, there's less destination networks in there, there's less routes.

28
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.990
So, it's not a problem

29
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.300
if our routers know about all of those different routes. In that case, we don't need the hierarchical

30
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.060
design, and all routers can be in Area 0.

31
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.860
When you do have a single area design, it's always going to be Area 0. Later on if your network grows

32
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.350
and you want to go to a multiarea design,

33
00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.400
this makes it really easy to migrate. So our configuration for configuring our different areas,

34
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.860
the area is configured at the interface level with the network command.

35
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.050
You see the example here, we've got network 10.0.0.0, a wildcard mask 0.0.255.255

36
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.440
area 0.

37
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.360
So, any interfaces on this router which have got an IP address that falls within that range will be enabled

38
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.820
for OSPF and put in Area 0. For a router to form an adjacency,

39
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.060
its neighbor on the other side of the link must be configured to be in the same area.

40
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.670
If you've got an area mismatch, the adjacency isn't going to come up and the routers are not going to

41
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.900
share routes with each other.

42
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.850
Moving on to our different router types.

43
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:56.050
First off, we've got our backbone routers. A backbone router is a router where all its interfaces are in

44
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.740
Area 0,

45
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:06.720
so this forms part of the transit area. With OSPF, routers maintain a full Link State Database (LSDB) of other routers

46
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.980
and links in their own area.

47
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.180
So, your backbone routers will have the full Link State Database (LSDB) for all of the other links that are also in

48
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:25.520
Area 0. Whenever an OSPF route is received from a neighbor and that neighbor is in the same area,

49
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.110
it will show up in the routing table as an intra area

50
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.070
route.

51
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.520
You see in the example 'show ip route' output here,

52
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.500
all the different types that are shown in bold are different types of OSPF routes.

53
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.040
We can have intra area routes, which means the destination network is in the same area, an inter area route,

54
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.340
where it's in a different area, or an external route,

55
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.280
meaning it was redistributed into OSPF. So the example here, I can see we've got 3 routes,

56
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.080
the prefix for all of them is 'O',

57
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.620
so these are all intra area routes, received from the same area.

58
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:12.750
The next type of router we've got is the ABR, our Area Border Router. Routers which have interfaces and multiple

59
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.120
areas are ABRs. So you see the example here, I've highlighted the routers in red.

60
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.660
I've got a router on the left here, which has got one interface in Area 0 and another interface in Area 1.

61
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:33.540
And our other ABR has got an interface in Area 0 and another interface in Area 2. The characteristics

62
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.680
of the ABRs, they separate the flooding zones.

63
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:47.600
This is what really segregates our network into the different areas and compartmentalizes our network.

64
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:55.740
So if we have a link goes up or goes down in that area, it's going to keep the information just in

65
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.020
that one area. It doesn't impact our other areas. You'll see how that works in a second, when I show you

66
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:09.250
the example. The ABR is also where we always do our summarization in OSPF.

67
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.980
Say that again, in OSPF, summarization is always done on your ABRs. It functions regularly as the

68
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:25.470
source for default routes for other normal areas, normal routers in our normal areas, and it maintains the

69
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.120
Link State Database (LSDB) for each area with which it is connected.

70
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.450
So if I go back to the slide, you see the ABR on the left here, it's going to have the

71
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.250
full Link State Database (LSDB) for Area 0, so it knows about all the individual networks in Area 0, and it also has the full Link

72
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:49.420
State Database (LSDB) for Area 1. Our ABR on the right here, it will have the full LSDB for Area 0

73
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:59.260
and for Area 2, but it only has summary information for Area 1. Ideal design is to have each ABR connected

74
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:08.990
to two areas only, the backbone and another normal area. An important point is that your ABRs do

75
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:18.170
not automatically summarize. You need to do this manually, and if you don't manually configure summarization,

76
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:25.330
all routes will be flooded everywhere, so the network will basically behave like it was all in one big area.

77
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:32.280
So again, the point of doing our multiple areas is for larger networks, takes up less resources,

78
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:38.660
puts less load on the routers. But you don't need to just configure the different areas, you also need

79
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.130
to configure summarization on ABRs to really get any benefit from it.

80
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.350
So looking at how we're going to configure it here, R2 is our ABR. It's got an interface in

81
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:58.860
Area 0, which is FastEthernet1/0 two and FastEthernet0/0 is in Area 1. At global config,

82
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:08.540
we say 'router ospf 1', and then 'network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0', so that will put

83
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:16.020
interface FastEthernet1/0 into Area 0, and then 'network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255'

84
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:24.410
goes into Area 1, that is FastEthernet0/0. Then to get the benefit of our different areas, we need to

85
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:31.980
do so summarization on the ABR. So, you notice that we've got all of our networks over here on the left in

86
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.270
Area 0. I've got 10.1.1.0/24, 10.1.0.0/24,

87
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:46.340
so all the networks in the left begin with 10.1. They're all 10.1.X.X/24 networks,

88
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:55.070
so I can summarize those into 10.1.0.0/16. The command to do that, the routes are

89
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.990
in Area 0,

90
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:04.820
so I say, 'area 0 range 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0'. And over in the right hand side

91
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:12.210
of the network in Area 1, my routes there are 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24,

92
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.850
and 10.0.2.0/24.

93
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.080
So all of the networks over in the right, they all begin with 10.0 and they're /24s.

94
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:29.480
Rather than advertising all of those individual /24 networks over to Area 0 on the left, I'm going

95
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.310
to summarize it to a single /16 route.

96
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:43.180
So that command I enter is 'area 1' because it's over in Area 1, 'range 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0'.

97
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:49.960
The effect that you'll get from this now is R1 over in Area 0, rather than having routes

98
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:56.130
to 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, and 10.0.2.0/24,

99
00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:02.240
it just has a single summary route for 10.0.0.0/16.

100
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:09.650
So there's a less routes on R1, so that takes up less resources on the router. The other benefit

101
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:17.300
you get from this is let's say that the 10.0.0.0/24 link goes down. Well, all of

102
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:25.250
my other routers that are in Area 1 will have to reconverge to see if they can find a better path to get there.

103
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:33.280
So R3 and R4 will have to recalculate, they'll have to do work to update their routing table

104
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.290
about the 10.0.0.0/24 network going down. But if you look at it from

105
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:45.560
the point of view of R1, well its summary route still stays the same. If any of these individual

106
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:53.260
routes here go down, our 10.0.0.0/16 route is still good. So if we have an outage

107
00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:00.200
in a different area, it doesn't affect the routers that are in this area. So less routes in your routers,

108
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:07.400
so it takes up less memory, and also outages, the impact is confined to just that one area, so it takes

109
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:14.570
up less CPU resources on your routers as well. So that's why we want to have multi areas when

110
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:21.660
we've got larger networks. When we look in the routing table, our inter area route,

111
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:28.280
so a route that was a learned from an ABR which is in another area, will show up as type 'O IA'

112
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.410
for inter area routes.

113
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.250
So you see the example output here,

114
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.480
I've got a couple of intra area routes.

115
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.640
The bottom two destinations are within the same area as this router, and I've got an inter area route

116
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.910
which is in another area, and inter area routes are always learned from an ABR. They're the border

117
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:55.530
between our areas and they're where we do our summarization. The next type of router is a normal area router.

118
00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.900
This is a router where all of its interfaces are just in one normal area.

119
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.990
So you can see highlighted in red on the left,

120
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.390
I got 3 routers which are Area 1 routers. All of their interfaces in the Area 1 and I've got an

121
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:14.330
Area 2 router over here on the right.

122
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:20.910
Again, these routers will maintain the full Link State Database (LSDB) for the areas which they're a member of.

123
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:28.880
So all the Area 1 routers will have the full LSDB for Area 1. They will have summary routes for Area 0

124
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.550
and Area 2 that they learned from the ABR. Our Area 2 router will have the full LSDB for Area 2,

125
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:47.940
summary routes for Area 1 and Area 0. Our last type of router is an ASBR, an Autonomous System Boundary Router.

126
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:56.810
So ABR is an Area Border Router, ASBR is Autonomous System Boundary Router. What and ASBR is

127
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:05.480
it means that on that router, it's running OSPF and we're redistributing from another source into OSPF.

128
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:13.340
So maybe, we're also running EIGRP or RIP on that router. We're taking our EIGRP or RIP routes and we're

129
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.910
redistributing them into OSPF, so they'll also be advertised through our OSPF neighbors, or maybe it's

130
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:27.200
a static route that we're redistributing into OSPF. So again, an ASBR, it just means we're redistributing

131
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:35.030
into OSPF on that router. Our redistributed routes show up as external route. So an external route

132
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:42.850
does not mean it's outside this enterprise, outside this organization. It literally means it was redistributed

133
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:51.510
into OSPF and if you look at the routing table, this will show up as a type 'O*E' either E1 or E2 for an external route.

134
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.620
So where it says 'O', that means it was an intra area route, the destination is in the same area,

135
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:07.250
'O IA' is an inter area route, it's from another area learned by an ABR, and 'O*E2 means it was redistributed

136
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.560
into OSPF.

137
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.070
Okay.

138
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.760
So that is our OSPF areas.

139
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.970
I'll see you in the next lecture for lab demo.
