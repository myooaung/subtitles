00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.090
In this lecture, you'll learn about the Spine and Leaf datacenter network design. So you can see

2
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.550
the traditional campus design here,

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.600
I covered this in the last lecture with the core, distribution, and access layers. And in the example here,

4
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.890
we've got the Main Building and Building 1, and we could have the Main Building now that is actually

5
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:39.660
being a Data Center with our servers in there. And with the old style traditional data center environments,

6
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.980
this traditional core, distribution, and access layer would work just fine where we had mostly North-South

7
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.990
traffic flows.

8
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.330
What I mean by North and South bound traffic flows is where the traffic is mainly flowing up and down.

9
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.530
So traffic would be going up and down the data center, and then down to the clients in the other buildings.

10
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.400
So you can see here,

11
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.340
it's going up from the building through the access and distribution layer to the core layer and then back

12
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.330
down from the core layer to the distribution and access layer. So you can see with our North-South bound traffic

13
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.370
flows, that's going from the clients over here to the servers in the data center,

14
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.440
and the traditional campus design works really well where most of your traffic flows are going in that

15
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.080
North and South bound direction.

16
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:42.980
But in modern data centers, there's a trend nowadays where we see a lot more traffic going in East

17
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.420
and West bound direction,

18
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.500
and what I mean by that is between the actual servers themselves in the data center. The reason for

19
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.970
that is that data centers are getting bigger.

20
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760
There's a lot of virtualization now,

21
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.050
so many virtual servers and those servers might be clustered where an app is spread across multiple

22
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.890
different servers and all of those servers need to talk to each other.

23
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.080
We also might have an application, for example, which has got a web-based front end on a server, and that's

24
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.230
talking to a backend database on another server as well.

25
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.960
So again, that traffic, rather than going North and South bound through the different layers,

26
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.010
would be going East-West bound between the different servers themselves.

27
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.310
And while the traditional campus design works well where most of your traffic is North and South bound,

28
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.530
it's not so good where a lot of your traffic is East and West bound.

29
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.430
And as I said, in modern data centers, you do have a lot of East and West flowing traffic.

30
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.050
So because of that, there is another network design that's very popular in data centers now, and that

31
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.920
is Spine-Leaf data center design.

32
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.830
Now, you're probably looking at this now and thinking, wait a minute, Neil, that looks pretty much

33
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.410
exactly the same as a Collapsed Core and Distribution layer with the traditional model,

34
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.100
and yes, right now it does.

35
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.780
So going back to the traditional model again, you can see here that we pair up our distribution layer

36
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.350
switches and we also pair up our core layer switches. That gives us some load balancing and also gives

37
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.360
us redundancy there as well, because we wouldn't want to have a single point of failure.

38
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.460
And this example from the Spine-Leaf design right now, it looks the same right now.

39
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.180
But the thing is, it's actually designed where we can get additional scalability and better performance

40
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.980
for our East-West traffic flows,

41
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.220
and what we can do is with the scalability, we can just add on additional switches in the East and

42
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.450
West directions.

43
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.000
So you can see here, if I've got a larger data center, I can just add additional Spine switches and

44
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.480
additional Leaf switches. With the Spine-Leaf design, we've got the Spine switches here, which

45
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.480
are at a higher level in the hierarchy.

46
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.570
We don't have our servers connected there.

47
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.850
Our servers are connected into our Leaf layer switches and we have got a mesh between.

48
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.230
So all of our Leaf switches are connected to all of our Spine switches,

49
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.650
and as I said, it's really easy to scale this out just by adding additional switches in the East and

50
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.460
West direction. So that gives us the good scalability.

51
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.920
It also gives us good performance as well, because if any of the servers in the data center need to

52
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.700
talk to each other, it's only going to be a maximum of two hops away.

53
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.450
Meaning if, for example, this server here is talking to the server on the right,

54
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.000
it's one hop at the Spine switch and then it goes down to another hop at the Leaf switch.

55
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.170
So that gives us the good performance and also the good scalability, where we've got a lot of East and West bound traffic.

56
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.660
It still works well.

57
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.140
We are still going to have North and South bound traffic here as well.

58
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.090
But it does give us those gains where we've got that additional East and West traffic.

59
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.410
Okay, that's everything I needed to

60
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.210
tell you about the Spine-Leaf data center network design.

61
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.940
I'll see you in the next lecture, where we're going to be back onto our main campus networks, which

62
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.040
are the main focus of the CCNA exam.

63
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.430
We'll start getting into detail on our VLANs.
