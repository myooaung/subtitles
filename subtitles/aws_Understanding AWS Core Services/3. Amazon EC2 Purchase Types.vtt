00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.230
So now we're going to talk through the different purchase types

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.640
that you get when you're working with EC2.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.400
So first of all, we have On‑Demand.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.340
And if you just launch an instance by default, this is what you're going to get.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.740
We then have the option for Reserved Instances.

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.640
Then we have Savings Plans, which was a newer option.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.690
Then we have Spot Instances and Dedicated Host Instances.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.640
So let's understand each of these options and when you would want to use them.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.200
So, first of all, we have Reserved Instances,

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.150
and what this does is this provides discounts over that On‑Demand model,

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.450
which, again,

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.630
is going to be your default model when you can

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.160
commit to a specific period of time, which is going to be one or three years.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.040
In addition,

15
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.760
it also provides a capacity reservation for the

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.210
specific instance type that you specify.

17
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.010
So you can make sure that when you go to launch that that that's going to be

18
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.560
there for the entire period of time that you sign up for.

19
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.740
Now within Reserved Instances, there are multiple types,

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.160
and let's quickly review these.

21
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.390
Now, as a note here,

22
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.940
you're not going to need to dive super deep into each of these for the exam,

23
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.810
but I do think it's important to understand the

24
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.040
different approaches that you can take.

25
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.610
So first we have Standard, and this gives you the highest discount,

26
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.770
and it works well for steady workloads.

27
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.190
But, if you have a Standard Reserved Instance,

28
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.180
what that means is is that if you want to get a bigger instance type,

29
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.440
you can't make that change,

30
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.560
you're locked in for that period of either one or three years.

31
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.040
And that's why we have a Convertible Reserved Instance.

32
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.810
And with this,

33
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.200
this does allow us to convert some of the attributes if it's going

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.510
to be of equal value to what we already have.

35
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.880
This is also great for steady workloads.

36
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.920
Now, in some situations you're going to have predictable,

37
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.670
but not steady workloads, and if that's the case,

38
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.840
you can create a Scheduled Reserved Instance.

39
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.060
So this is able to have a time window attached to it,

40
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520
and so if you know, for example,

41
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.300
that during weekdays for a specific period of time you're going to have a lot

42
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.050
of usage and you want to get a Reserved Instance for that,

43
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.740
the Scheduled type would work well.

44
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.550
Now let's look at just the Standard Reserved Instance cost model.

45
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.970
So, with this you have some choices.

46
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.620
You can specify that you want to pay this all up front.

47
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.150
So you can say if it's one or three years,

48
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.660
you want to pay all of it,

49
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.590
and this is going to give you the highest level of savings,

50
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.740
but it's also going to require the biggest upfront investment for that instance.

51
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.260
You can then do a partial up front,

52
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.940
and this is going to enable you to pay part of that

53
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.180
one or three‑year period up front, and then you'll have a reduced monthly cost.

54
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.740
But even if you don't choose either of those,

55
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.310
if you take a no upfront approach,

56
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.510
you're not going to have to pay anything up front,

57
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.640
but you'll still get a reduced monthly cost over the On‑Demand option.

58
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.730
So here's the way to look at it.

59
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.460
Here on the far left we have the maximum savings,

60
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.970
and on the far right we have the minimum up front cost.

61
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.220
So you need to be able to evaluate a situation and determine

62
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.940
which of these would make the most sense.

63
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.020
Now next we have the option that is the Savings Plans option.

64
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.050
Now this is very similar in concept to Reserved Instances,

65
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.270
but one of the key differences is that it's not just limited to EC2,

66
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.140
it supports compute with EC2, Fargate, and AWS Lambda.

67
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.960
But unlike Reserved Instances, it does not reserve capacity.

68
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.760
Now, that being said, there's still a way you can reserve capacity with savings,

69
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.770
but it's going to be in addition to what you do with Savings Plans,

70
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.570
and it can provide savings of up to 72%.

71
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.340
And just as with Reserved Instances, it comes in one or three‑year terms.

72
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.370
However, if you want to get the biggest price reduction,

73
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.670
you can look at Spot Instances,

74
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.970
and this really enables you to leverage the excess EC2 compute

75
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.940
capacity that might exist within an availability zone.

76
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.040
So let's quickly look at some notes here on Spot Instances.

77
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.740
First of all, it can provide up to 90% in discounts over On‑Demand pricing.

78
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.150
Now with this, there is a market price for instance types per availability zone,

79
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.140
and this is called the Spot price.

80
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.640
So think of this almost like a stock market for excess compute capacity.

81
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.990
Now, when you request instances, if your bid is higher than the Spot price,

82
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.840
then you'll be able to launch your instances.

83
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.770
Now if the Spot price grows to exceed your bid,

84
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.940
then your instance is going to be terminated.

85
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.270
Now, it's not instant, you do get 2 minutes prior to termination.

86
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.640
However,

87
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.120
what this means is this will only work for workloads that can start

88
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.870
and stop without affecting what you're trying to do.

89
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.740
So if that's your use case, you can get great savings by using Spot Instances.

90
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.440
Next, we have the Dedicated Host option,

91
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.670
and this gives you a dedicated physical server in the data center.

92
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.260
Now this is going to be your most expensive option,

93
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.200
but there's two use cases that you need to know

94
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.210
that would require this approach.

95
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.650
The first is going to be if you have a per‑server licensing model and you

96
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.440
want to be sure you're abiding by the terms of that license.

97
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.980
In that case, you'll need to use this option.

98
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.290
Also for some compliance requirements,

99
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.310
it requires that you utilize a dedicated host,

100
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.860
and if that's the case you'll also need to use this pricing model.

101
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.530
So let's quickly review the different options.

102
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.680
First of all, if you have an instance that is consistent and always needed,

103
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.840
you should purchase a Standard or Convertible Reserved Instance.

104
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.280
Next,

105
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.070
if you have batch processing where you can start and

106
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.440
stop without affecting the overall job,

107
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.700
this is where you should look to leverage Spot Instances because

108
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.640
this is going to give you the maximum savings.

109
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.200
So next,

110
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.640
if you have an inconsistent need for instances and you can't

111
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.910
stop it without affecting the overall job,

112
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.840
this is where you want to look at just the Standard On‑Demand Instances.

113
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.230
Now a few other notes here.

114
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.190
If you have specific per‑server licensing or if you have a

115
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.480
compliance requirement for a dedicated server,

116
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.740
you should use Dedicated Host.

117
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.440
And also here if you're leveraging Lambda and/or Fargate alongside EC2 and

118
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.030
want to achieve discounts for a one or three‑year period,

119
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.840
this is where you can choose a Savings Plan.

120
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.570
But if you have predictable, but not steady workloads in EC2,

121
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.140
you should purchase a Scheduled Reserved Instance.

122
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.340
Now let's look at some examples specific to Reserved Instances.

123
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.880
So first, let's say that we have a t3.medium.

124
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.500
So we can see here it's a little over $.04 per hour.

125
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.840
Now if we look to purchase an EC2 Reserved Instance,

126
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.830
if we do all upfront for one year, we pay $213.

127
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.340
If we look at the effective hourly rate, that's going to be about $.02.4.

128
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.840
That's going to save us about $150.

129
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.690
And if we look at the same thing for three years,

130
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.340
we're going to have the ability to save over $680.

131
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.750
So here,

132
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.590
our savings are only going to increase as we move to bigger instance types.

133
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.470
So here, if we look at a compute optimized instance like a c5d.24xlarge,

134
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.180
the On‑Demand rate is going to be $4.60,

135
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540
almost $.61 cents per hour.

136
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.110
Now if we look here at just a partial upfront for only a year,

137
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.970
what we're going to do is we're going to pay $12,000

138
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.410
plus a little bit more up front, and then we're going to pay about $1000 monthly.

139
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.560
What this does is this lowers the effective hourly rate

140
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.100
to $2.76 a little bit more per hour.

141
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.840
That gives us about 40% savings.

142
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.360
We can look also here at an i3.16xlarge. We can see here that the On‑Demand

143
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.620
rate is almost $5 and we're able to achieve 52% savings.

144
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.240
So even though the cost is high here,

145
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.550
if you need this specific instance type, this approach is

146
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.370
going to give you a lot of savings if you can commit to

147
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.240
the one or three‑year period.

148
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.160
Now if we look here at spot instances,

149
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.680
this is where we're going to see even more savings.

150
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.000
So let's take a look at our t3.medium that we mentioned earlier. So On‑Demand

151
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.960
is going to be about $.04 per hour, and with Spot pricing we can see this get

152
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.530
down to maybe a little bit over $.01 per hour.

153
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.140
Now, as a reminder, this is a market price, so this is going to change.

154
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.210
This is when I was actually looking at the pricing when I was creating

155
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.840
this course, here's what you could get this for.

156
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.060
You can see here, this is going to give us about 70% savings.

157
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.400
Now we can also look at our c5d.24xlarge. Here we're going to see 80% savings.

158
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.580
And we also can see 70% if we're looking at our i3.16xlarge.

159
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:40.000
So you can see here that there are huge benefits to exploring the different pricing models that you can leverage with Amazon EC2.
