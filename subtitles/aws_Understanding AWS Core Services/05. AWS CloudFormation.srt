1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,500
Next, we're going to talk about AWS CloudFormation.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:04,670
Now,

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,970
let's say for a minute that we have a custom application, and

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,770
this custom application requires two S3 buckets,

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:17,390
five EC2 servers, two SQS queues, and three Lambda functions.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,800
Well, we could go in and set up all of that in the console,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,420
but that creates a problem.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,020
There are a lot of manual steps that need to happen to make that work.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,970
And what happens if we miss one of them or we

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,070
incorrectly apply settings to a resource?

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,000
Well,CloudFormation exists to solve this problem,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,940
and let's talk about how it works.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,940
First of all,

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,800
it is a managed service for provisioning infrastructure based on templates.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,630
So, instead of going in and manually clicking in the console,

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,000
or instead of writing a custom CLI script,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,900
or instead of going in and using the SDK to write your own custom

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,360
logic for creating your infrastructure, here you're going to use a

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,840
service that manages that for you.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,880
Now there is no additional charge for CloudFormation.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,060
So with CloudFormation,

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,080
you only pay for the resources that you launch, but the

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,440
service itself does not have a charge.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,820
Now you can write these templates in two formats, one is YAML and another

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,640
is JSON, and those are both common formats, and many different tools can

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,740
support the writing of YAML or JSON templates.

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,800
Now this enables an approach that we call infrastructure as code.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,150
This means that we're able to write a template that every resource

29
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,900
on our team can use to launch infrastructure.

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,940
And this means that we're taking the manual processes out of the picture.

31
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,290
It also handles the management of dependencies between resources. So if we

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,020
require one resource to be in place before we launch another one,

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,740
it will go through and manage those dependencies.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,010
Now one of the powerful features that you get with CloudFormation,

35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,470
and this is going to be similar to what we've seen in services like

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,360
AWS Config, but this is specific here to CloudFormation, is that it

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,620
provides drift detection.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,630
So if we launch our application that has all of those resources I

39
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,760
mentioned earlier, but somebody goes in and changes the S3 permissions

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,720
to be globally available, then in that case,

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,540
we can notice that change and we could choose to take action.

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,930
Now here's a very quick and limited example of what we can do.

43
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,050
So this is a YAML‑based template, and with this

44
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,730
information included in the template, if we ran it through CloudFormation,

45
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,740
it would create an S3 bucket for us, and it would have the name sample‑S3‑bucket.

46
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,010
Now, this is a very simple example, but you can expand to have very,

47
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,440
very large templates.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,250
You can even have kind of templates within templates that

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,160
enable you to launch infrastructure.

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,050
So if you have a set of infrastructure, like I mentioned

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,220
earlier for our custom application,

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,370
you could launch that within one account and then turn

53
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,400
around and launch it within another account.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,210
You could have one environment for production and another environment for

55
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,840
testing and make sure that the two of those were completely identical

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,000
because they're both based off the same template. And that's what you get with CloudFormation.
