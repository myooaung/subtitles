00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.190
So next, we're going to look at another category of

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.490
services called app integration services.

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.400
And when we're talking about app integration services, we're really

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.340
talking about three distinct services on AWS.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.010
First of all, we're talking about Amazon SNS, or Simple Notification Service,

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.610
which is a managed pub/sub messaging service.

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.200
And don't worry,

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.540
we'll dive into what that means later within this

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.590
module. And then, we have Amazon SQS, which is a managed message queue service.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.260
Now both of these services together would also be known

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.340
as the messaging services on AWS.

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.910
But in addition to those two, we are also going to look at AWS Step Functions,

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.980
and that is a serverless workflow management service on AWS.

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.210
So here's what we're going to be covering as we go

15
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.550
throughout this module. First of all,

16
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.730
we'll be introducing Amazon SNS, Simple Notification Service,

17
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.440
and introducing Simple Queue Service, or SQS.

18
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.010
And then, we're going to be exploring architectures that leverage SNS and SQS.

19
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:15.000
Then after that, we're going to be examining AWS Step Functions, and we'll even have a chance to review sample AWS Step Function usage.
