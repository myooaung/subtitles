00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.720
So we've gone through a lot here in this course.

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.640
There's a lot of AWS services that have been introduced here.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.870
So what do you do next?

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.160
Well first, I want to encourage you, don't sign up for the exam just yet.

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.820
Wait until you make it through all four video courses, and later within

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.200
this path we'll walk you through the process of how you sign up for the

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.040
exam and ultimately how you take the exam.

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.360
Now, with this being said, you'll need to move on to the next course,

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.810
which is an Introduction to Security and Architecture in AWS.

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.270
But, what you need to study from this course is all of the material

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.530
that's contained within, first, the guided notes that you took over

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.420
this, and be sure that you thoroughly study the services list that

13
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.740
we've provided for this course because that information is definitely

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.040
going to be on the exam.

15
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.280
And as you'll learn later,

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.710
I even recommend that you take the service list from this course and

17
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.170
from the next course, and that's the last thing you look at before you

18
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.970
walk in and take your certification exam.

19
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.240
So I'm excited for you to move forward and take your next step

20
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.000
and complete this learning path so you can take your AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.
