1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,160
So next, we're going to be talking about Amazon VPC and Direct Connect.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,230
Now when we're talking about a virtual private cloud, or VPC, really what

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,220
we're talking about is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud, and

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,260
this is where you can launch your EC2 servers in that area and know that

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,840
it is just your slice of the cloud.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,940
And this is a virtual network that you define and you can configure.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,670
Now when we're talking about VPC, there's a couple of things to note here.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,630
First of all, it does enable you to have a virtual network in AWS.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,480
Now, let me ease your mind for a minute.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,390
You don't have to be a networking guru to be able to pass

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,360
your Certified Cloud Practitioner exam,

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,840
but you do need to understand what a virtual private cloud is. But

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,690
for those of you that want to dive a bit deeper,

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,340
let me tell you that within a virtual private cloud,

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,570
you can support both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, and those are just

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,370
different standards that we have for the addresses that our

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,310
computers have on the networks that they're on. And you can

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,320
configure an IP address range, subnets,

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,700
route tables, and network gateways. Again, you don't have to

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,400
know all of those details for the exam, but if this is an area of interest,

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,470
you should know that you can configure all of these

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,560
things within your VPCs. Now, in addition,

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,380
it does support both private and public subnets, so if you want to

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,430
have areas that can't communicate or can't be reached from the

25
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,180
internet, you can do that. If you want to have areas that are

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,290
accessible to the internet, for example if you have a web server

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,350
that you want to be available,

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,850
you can do that here as well. Now if you do have private subnets,

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,230
you can use network address translation, or NAT, for those private

30
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,750
subnets, and there are multiple ways that you can actually

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,930
establish a connection to your datacenter,

32
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,000
and we'll talk about one of those in just a minute. And, you can connect VPCs

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,670
to each other. So you can have what we call peering connections or use

34
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,240
transit gateway to be able to connect multiple VPCs.

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,470
You also can have private connections to many AWS services.

36
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,660
Now let me explain why that's important.

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,360
If you want to be able to make sure that your sensitive application

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,700
doesn't have to send traffic through the internet, that can just stay

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,380
within your VPC, there's a way to do that,

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,470
even when you're using specific AWS services. Now next,

41
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,640
we have AWS Direct Connect.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,290
Now this is a service that makes it easy for you to establish a

43
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,170
dedicated network connection from your datacenter to AWS.

44
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,290
So let's say, for example,

45
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,930
you have a business application that uses application data

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,430
that's stored within your datacenter, but the application

47
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,000
itself is running on AWS.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,340
Well,

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,490
it would be ideal to have a highâ€‘speed connection

50
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,270
between your datacenter and AWS directly,

51
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:42,000
as opposed to having to send it through the internet. And that's what AWS Direct Connect provides for you.
