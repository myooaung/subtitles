00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.640
So next,

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.850
we have two other managed services that you can leverage on AWS, and

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.190
those are Amazon ElastiCache and Amazon Redshift.

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.640
So ElastiCache is a fully managed, in‑memory datastore,

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.390
and it actually has two different engines that are supported, both

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
Memcached and Redis, which are really the two most popular options you

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.040
could choose within in‑memory datastores.

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.370
It provides extremely low latency in terms of response times,

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.230
and you can include things like scaling and read

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.640
replicas to meet your application demand.

11
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.080
And again,

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.700
you can do this without having to be able to manage

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.840
that underlying infrastructure.

14
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.240
It handles most common use cases, including things like database layer caching.

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.210
So if you're working with another database,

16
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.670
even something like DynamoDB, and you want to add a cache layer

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.250
in between your application and the database,

18
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.700
ElastiCache could help fill that need, and even session storage.

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.960
So if you're working with a web application that is doing sessions storage,

20
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.200
you can utilize ElastiCache with something like Redis to be

21
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.280
able to get quick responses on session data.

22
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.580
Next, you need to be familiar with Amazon Redshift.

23
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.180
It is Amazon's born‑in‑the‑cloud scalable data warehouse service.

24
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.490
So if you're looking to do data warehousing for your user

25
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.930
behavior data or for your analytics data,

26
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.120
Amazon Redshift becomes a great choice.

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.440
It supports petabyte scale,

28
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.800
and in addition it also leverages high‑performance disks and column storage.

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.020
So this gives you the ability to beat out many traditional

30
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.760
data warehousing solutions because, again,

31
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.480
this was designed with the cloud in mind.

32
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.890
It does give you the ability to fully encrypt the

33
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.030
contents of your data warehouse,

34
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.940
and it does give you a level of isolation within your own virtual private cloud.

35
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.040
Now there are some great features that have been added to Amazon Redshift,

36
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.850
including Redshift Spectrum,

37
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.000
and this gives you the ability to query exabytes of data directly within Amazon S3.
