00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.040
So next, we're going to be talking about using the AWS CLI.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.640
Now, I need to make a note here.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.250
You don't need to know how to install and configure the CLI

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.340
for the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.850
You do need to know what it is and why you would use it.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.350
However,

7
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.130
I do think it's a valuable tool if you'll be working within

8
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.940
AWS, so we're going to do a quick review here.

9
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.610
So here, over the course of this demo,

10
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.740
we will first be accessing AWS access keys.

11
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.740
We'll then be reviewing installation instructions for the CLI.

12
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.320
We'll then be configuring the CLI for a specific user. And finally,

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.640
we will be interacting with AWS utilizing the CLI.

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.600
So, I'm here at your security credentials, and this is where we

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.840
left off when we were demoing the console.

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.130
Just as a reminder, you can get here by going under your username

17
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.940
and then going into My Security Credentials. Now,

18
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.100
I mentioned that access keys were critical.

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.940
This is basically the way that we control authentication and

20
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.900
authorization when we are using the CLI and the SDK. I'm going to

21
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.140
select Access keys, and AWS is going to present me with a warning, and

22
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.890
rightly so. They let us know that root users have unrestricted access

23
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.170
to the entire AWS account. So, they recommend using an IAM user with

24
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.620
limited permissions if we're going to be creating access keys, and that

25
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.540
is great advice.

26
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.470
Now, as a note, we will be creating access keys here. However,

27
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.320
I am going to be deleting these immediately following this demo.

28
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.500
You should not create root user access keys and use them on a day‑to‑day basis.

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.980
That is not a good practice.

30
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.260
However, for simply demoing the CLI, in this case, that should be fine.

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
So I'm going to select Create New Access Key, and it lets us

32
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.040
know here that it has created our access key.

33
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.360
And it lets us know here that this is our one chance to see this

34
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.770
information, and we need to download our key file now.

35
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.340
It will not show it to us again. Now, if I click here on Show Access Key,

36
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.150
we can see here, both our access and secret access key, and

37
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.850
this is the information that we will need to be able to access

38
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.340
our AWS resources from the CLI.

39
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.980
Now, before we use these keys,

40
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.540
I'm now going to navigate over to the installation instructions.

41
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.890
So here within the AWS documentation,

42
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.670
there are instructions for installing the CLI.

43
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.710
There are currently two versions of the CLI, version 1 and

44
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.200
version 2. Version 2 is a newer version that is just

45
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.020
currently in preview, so for now,

46
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.190
we'll look at version 1. Now depending on your platform,

47
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.290
you can install the CLI in different ways.

48
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.310
For example,

49
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.230
Windows has an installer that actually comes with Python

50
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.240
integrated in. Now, Python is what the CLI is actually

51
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.200
built on and what is required.

52
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.440
So in Windows, there's a single installer that will handle it for you.

53
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.160
For many users that are on Linux or Mac, Python is

54
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.620
already included on your machine,

55
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.860
and you can simply use tools like pip to install the CLI. I'll include links

56
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.300
to this particular documentation within the guided outline.

57
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.910
Now next,

58
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.790
I'm going to navigate over to the terminal so we can actually

59
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.540
use the access keys that we've created.

60
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.360
So from here,

61
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.920
I can first check to see if the AWS CLI has been

62
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.790
properly installed on my machine.

63
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.050
I can simply type aws ‑‑version, and I can now see that I'm

64
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.590
using the AWS CLI version 1.16.180, so I do have it

65
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.840
properly installed on my machine.

66
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.270
Now, the next step is going to be to configure it with

67
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.740
the access keys that I just created.

68
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.740
Now, the first step will be to enter in the access key.

69
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.190
Next, I'm going to be entering in the secret access key.

70
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.590
Once we have that in place,

71
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.130
we can now enter in the default region name, and in this

72
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.440
case I'm going to choose us‑east‑one.

73
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.400
Finally, we can choose the default output format.

74
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.020
In this case,

75
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.110
I'm just going to choose JSON because that's a format that I'll work with.

76
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.840
Once I have all of that in place, I'm going to hit Enter.

77
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.660
And now we have configured the AWS CLI to work with those

78
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.990
credentials in a profile called PS test.

79
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.730
So now, I should be able to utilize the AWS CLI to get information

80
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.640
about the AWS resources that I'm leveraging. In this case, I'm going

81
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.530
to run a command that's going to list the S3 buckets that I have

82
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.940
created within this account.

83
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.320
And here you can see it has returned to me a list of all of the different S3

84
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.850
buckets that I have created within this account. So, to quickly review what

85
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.490
we've done. We have gone in and created access keys for our user with a caveat

86
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.050
there that we don't generally want to create access keys for the root user,

87
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.640
but for simple testing purposes, as long as you delete them after the fact,

88
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.940
that should be fine.

89
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.200
Then, we went through the process of looking at how you

90
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.020
would go about installing the AWS CLI.

91
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.670
And we noted that there are different instructions for Windows,

92
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.540
Mac, and Linux users.

93
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.880
We then configured the AWS CLI to use the credentials that we had created.

94
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:59.000
And finally, we verified that we could access the AWS resources that we're leveraging, utilizing those credentials from the CLI.
