1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,820
So next, we're going to talk about two additional AWS services, and

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,670
those are going to be Amazon CloudFront and API Gateway.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,750
Now we've mentioned CloudFront before.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,470
This is a service that leverages the edge locations

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,040
within the AWS global infrastructure.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,630
And it is a content delivery network,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,770
which means that there are servers around the world

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,440
that you can send your content to.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,760
And why would you do that?

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:23,970
Well,

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,850
because it enables your users to get content from

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,980
the server that's closest to them, which will increase performance.

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,040
It also supports both static and dynamic content.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,270
Many people think about content delivery networks only

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,250
serving static content, like images and videos or even

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,160
specific text, but in this case,

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,540
you can also configure it to support dynamic content.

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,500
And it also utilizes the AWS edge locations that we've mentioned,

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,300
which we also noted were the most prevalent form of

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,460
the AWS global infrastructure.

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,360
It also includes several advanced security features,

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,620
and those include things like AWS Shield,

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,330
which handles distributed denial of service attacks

24
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,740
and their web application firewall.

25
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,650
Now within a later course in this path, we'll be diving more into security and

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,250
understanding how that factors in to your use of CloudFront.

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,260
But just as a reminder, there are edge locations that exist globally,

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,970
so this gives you the power to take your content and distribute

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,240
it globally within just a matter of minutes.

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,740
So next, let's talk about another service, Amazon API Gateway.

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,260
Now what API Gateway is is that it is a fully managed API management service.

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,540
This means that you can create APIs, which are just web services that then

33
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,280
other applications can call, and you can make those available. And you can

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,340
actually distribute those through CloudFront.

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,540
It directly integrates with multiple AWS services,

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,910
including several of the services that we have learned

37
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,980
about so far within this course.

38
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,880
It also gives you concepts like monitoring and metrics on your API

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,820
calls so that you can understand how your APIs are being used and also

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,140
debug them if they're not working properly.

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,140
Now you can also integrate this in with both VPC and

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,000
onâ€‘premise private applications, so it doesn't just have to be for public API calls.
