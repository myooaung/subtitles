1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,770
Now next,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,710
we're going to walk through some scenarios to see how well you've

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,740
absorbed what we have covered within this module.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,790
So our first scenario has to do with Ruth, and she started a nonprofit

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,440
that assigns volunteers to open opportunities to serve.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,150
And recently, their database server went down, so when users went to sign up,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,530
it wouldn't let them do anything, so they actually lost some people

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,340
that could have volunteered for some opportunities.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,820
Now, while they have improved their database server,

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,040
they're still not able to guarantee that there won't be downtime in the future.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,800
So she really wants to explore an AWS service that

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,140
could prevent these lost user signups.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,480
So in this case, what service would you recommend to Ruth?

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay, next, we're going to talk about Jessi,

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,640
and she created a list of onboarding steps for new customers for their app.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:53,780
Now,

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,390
these steps have a lot of integrations with things like their

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,310
CRM, they want to send out an email to users, they want to

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,800
integrate this in with analytics.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,680
Now, Jessi's a bit worried that it's going to take her development team a

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,540
long time if they have to build all of this from scratch.

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,570
So is there an AWS service that can help with this approach?

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,240
Okay, let's look at our third scenario, and this one has to do with Roger.

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,440
And his company is an ecommerce company that's building a custom ecommerce

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,290
platform, so they're not using one of the ones off the shelf. Now they're still

26
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,320
adding some new functionality into their platform, and he wants aspects of the

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,740
platform to listen for some key events, like orders and refunds.

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,110
But, they don't yet know all the elements that need to respond to

29
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,540
the events because they're still building it out.

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,990
So, is there a service that would allow current and future parts of

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:53,000
the platform to listen for events like these? So here in the next clip, we're going to walk through the answers.
