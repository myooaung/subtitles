00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.880
Turn their resume into a visual masterpiece.

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.770
Margins.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.380
Setting proper margins for the document ensures the information fits within the readable space on the

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.770
page.

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:19.060
If you have a very short resume with a lot of dark space, one inch margin will likely be the best option

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.160
to create a wealth based document.

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.160
If you require more space to describe your relevant skills and experience, then you might reduce your

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.530
margins to 0.75 inches.

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.600
If you decide to adjust your margins, you should keep them at or above.

10
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.280
0.5 inches.

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.020
Also left.

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.950
Align all the text on your resume.

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.030
Since is the easiest form for review is to read.

14
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.410
Font choice.

15
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.110
When deciding what font to use, keep in mind that it should be clear and easy to read.

16
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.080
Making sure employers don't have to work to understand the words and the recipe is the most important

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.880
factor when choosing a font.

18
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.720
You should also avoid light or fine fonts, which can sometimes be difficult for people to read on a

19
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.680
screen or paper.

20
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.850
Generally, you should stay between ten and 12 points if you have a short recipe in there trying to

21
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.820
fill space selected 12 point font.

22
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.600
Anything larger than that might appear as unprofessional.

23
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.700
There are two main categories of fonts serif and sensory.

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.350
Serif fonts have tails while sorcery fonts do not.

25
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.930
Sorcery fonts or fonts without tails are generally good fonts for resumes because they have clean lines

26
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.070
that are easy to read.

27
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.250
Headers.

28
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.110
Balding, underlining or increasing the font size by one or two points for section headers can help

29
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.260
employers quickly find the information they are looking for.

30
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.070
Be careful that when formatting section headers they should be differentiated from this section, but

31
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.980
in a clean and a professional way, you can work your headers in a few different ways.

32
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.720
For instance, you can use a bald font on your section headers to increase the size of your section

33
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.070
headers fonts to 12 or 14 points and underline your section headers where needed.

34
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.980
Gallerist Kim added color to your resume makes it stand out from the resumes of other job seekers and

35
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.320
makes your application look more appealing.

36
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.600
Using colour when the resume radically increases a candidate's chance to land an interview.

37
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.660
But be careful recall colorful resume can sometimes come across as unprofessional, especially if it's

38
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.680
difficult to read.

39
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.290
So how do you choose colours?

40
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.440
First, avoid using bright colours.

41
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.160
Stick to using darker colours on your resume.

42
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.570
And you can also make one colour dominant, one secondary, and use the third to place emphasis.

43
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.300
Let's see, two examples.

44
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.240
The first resume is for a project manager position.

45
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.760
We picked two complementary colours Dark Blue, which will be used for headings and a yellow orange

46
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.620
color to highlight certain sections.

47
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.340
The second example is a resume for a graphic designer position.

48
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.760
We picked his primary and secondary color, two different types of blue, and we use black and bold

49
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.680
to emphasize certain details.

50
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.800
If you are not sure about the choice of your colors, the easiest way is to refer to an online color

51
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.940
palettes generator.

52
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.990
Personally, I find it easy to use the color wheel from Canva.

53
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.840
You will find the link under the resources section.

54
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.450
Using templates to create a resume.

55
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.450
A template is a great way to save time and create a professional looking application.

56
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.920
It also ensures that you don't forget to include any necessary to resume a section, but choose it wisely.

57
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.780
Make sure all the content on your resume is unique and that you use it.

58
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.190
Template design that is appropriate for your target job attention.

59
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.790
Though most of fancy resume templates cannot be read by the applicant tracking system that most of the

60
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.440
companies are using today.

61
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.470
It is estimated that up to 75% of resumes are rejected for online jobs just because its context tracks

62
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.760
information it needs.

63
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.530
Due to the happy design.

64
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.450
So make sure you use a design which is atheist friendly.

65
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.300
Feel free to download ideas friendly resident templates to get inspired for your own designs.

66
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.360
And let's conclude we've been looking at the margins.

67
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.360
So state between a one and 0.5 inches font type sans serif.

68
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.280
So the font without.

69
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.200
Font size stay between ten and 12 points.

70
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.660
Header sections stay between 12 and 14 points and use a bold font colors.

71
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.530
You can use a primary and a secondary color or two complementary colors.

72
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:41.870
You can refer to the color wheel from combat and get inspired, but use your own template.
