00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,840
Let's start with why your resume is so important.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,540
First, your resume is a marketing document that represents you when you are not there.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,820
Most of resumes fall into the everything I've done camp.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,930
There's a lot of I've done these.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,280
I've been responsible for that.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,200
This is certainly very important.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,670
But don't stop it here.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,600
Explain.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,900
How did you help the company achieve this or that when listing a list of duties and responsibilities?

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,450
You are missing the opportunity to sell yourself.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,670
You've got to approach this project with a top of mind that you are making a marketing document and

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,770
your intent is to capture insurgents.

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,760
Audience Attention.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,720
Recruiters want to know what benefits your current skills will bring to their company.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,430
The better your resume explained the situation, the better it will serve the purpose.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,390
The first impression you make on the recruiter is the last.

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,950
A strong resume also creates this first impression on behalf of you.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,910
Your resume also convinces the recruiter that you are the right candidate.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,150
A good resume is going to allow you to move forward to the next step in the process, which is interviewing.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,880
You'll likely need to conduct at least one interview to be offered a position.

21
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,530
So having a resume is essential.
