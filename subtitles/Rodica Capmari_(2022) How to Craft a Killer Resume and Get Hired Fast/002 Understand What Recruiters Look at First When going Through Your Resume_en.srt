1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,680
What recruiters look at first on your resume.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,630
An easy way to find out what a recruiter looks for on your resume is to put yourself in the recruiters

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,140
shoes.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,700
The first thing to know is that recruiters are very busy professionals.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,900
They have to deal with hundreds of resumes before choosing the perfect ones.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,690
Think about what those questions might be and proactively address them in their document.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,300
Don't leave anything to interpretation.

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,310
Most recent work experience recruiters are looking for experience in qualifications related to the job

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,570
they're considering you for.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,630
Their primary hope is to see relevant experience in your 2 to 3 most recent jobs.

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,220
However, that doesn't mean they ignore the rest of your work experience.

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,320
They simply look at their first.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,860
Storytelling.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,940
Recruiters are looking for someone whose career progression tells a connected story, as opposed to

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:11,360
someone who worked everywhere without developing a specific skillset relevant to the job they are applying

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,780
for.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,980
The biggest challenge today in developing a one page resume is creating a document that will be as effective

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,960
when someone scans it very quickly.

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,270
Next, facts and numbers.

20
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,080
The best way to do it is to quantify your achievements, results, accomplishments, experiences.

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,850
What does it actually mean?

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,530
Well, you have to provide straight facts in your prior experiences.

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:50,350
For example, instead of saying I helped my company make the profit, you should write, I created two

24
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,820
new tools that helped my company say 50% cost notice.

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,690
The second example helps illustrate your real contribution.

26
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:06,310
Now, when making your resume, make sure you review every line and identify if there is any way you

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,510
can mention numbers.

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,430
Next deployment gaps.

29
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,260
That sounds like a problem.

30
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,440
Do not fear recruiters and hiring managers are trained to look for gaps in candidates resumes.

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,830
It's totally fine to have gaps in your employment, but you need to make sure you can explain them.

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,770
You might fall into the following situations.

33
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:40,270
Maybe you took some time to work on a personal project, or would take a trip or obtain a diploma a

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,950
certificate to participate in charity projects or do some volunteering work.

35
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,910
Make sure you create a link between what you did during this break and the position you are after now.

36
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,610
Overall structure, although recruiters mostly care about your experience, knowledge and skills.

37
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,460
They still notice your resume as overall structure.

38
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,200
Is it easy to read?

39
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,550
Is it well-structured?

40
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,170
Is it visually appealing?

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,970
They'll take this all into account when deciding if they want to pursue or not.

42
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,330
Also, don't make your resume too long.

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,720
Condense it so that it's no more than two pages.

44
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,270
Let's conclude with what recruiters look at first on your resume.

45
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,500
First, most recent work experience.

46
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,820
Second storytelling.

47
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,070
You are telling the story of your career, so be as concise as possible.

48
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,620
First, facts and numbers.

49
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,710
So be specific and use metrics where possible.

50
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,080
Full employment gaps.

51
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,560
That's fine to have them, but you need to explain.

52
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:58,580
And the final one, your overall structure, the content, the visual appearance, colors, chronological

53
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,200
order of your work experience.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,140
We will review these points in our next section.
