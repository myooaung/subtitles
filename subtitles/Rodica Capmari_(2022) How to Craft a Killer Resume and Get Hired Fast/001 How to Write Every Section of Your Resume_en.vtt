00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.340
So are you ready for a walk through?

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.510
What sections should I include in my resume?

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.650
A stellar resume should includes five basic resume sections contact information, summary or objective

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.270
statement, work experience, education and skills.

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.240
While every person's resume is different, there are some sections that you should always include and

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.590
some that are optional.

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.040
We're going to go step by step for the most important resume sections, as well as optional sections

8
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.680
that I can use to get even more interviews.

9
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.420
So let's get started.

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.910
Full name and contact information.

11
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
This is the first essential section of your resume and should appear at the very top of page one.

12
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.770
It's intended to clearly show your name and relevant contact info.

13
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.260
Keep it simple and include your name, address, phone number and email.

14
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.480
So here we go.

15
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.640
A couple of tips for the contact section.

16
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.120
So always add the country code to the contact number.

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.960
Choose a professional email address for a resume.

18
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.830
So, for example, you can use your first and last name and avoid silly email addresses and don't add

19
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.140
random number to your email because there make it more difficult for the hiring manager to remember.

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.730
Another point to consider, including a LinkedIn profile.

21
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.580
So it's a good way to attract recruiters attention.

22
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.700
Make sure your LinkedIn profile is update and remember to customize your public.

23
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.200
You are out.

24
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.790
And finally, you might also consider including the driving license category.

25
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.520
Summary and objective statements.

26
00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.390
People often confuse resume objective statements with summary statements because they share common goals.

27
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.320
Introducing a job applicant, but they are not the same.

28
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.070
This summary highlights your qualifications for a job.

29
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.790
It is meant to give the hiring manager an immediate, quick synopsis of your background and experience

30
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.230
that is relevant to the position.

31
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.170
It highlights your specific strengths and skills and can help the hiring manager understand how you

32
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.810
will add value to the company.

33
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.590
On the other hand, the objective usually is short one or two sentences long.

34
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.300
The most effective objective is specific about the position and type of employment.

35
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.570
It identifies the kind of career you are seeking and focuses on yourself.

36
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.000
What job or career you are looking for.

37
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.200
Personally, I would suggest to use a summary statement because it focuses on what employer wants to

38
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.560
know.

39
00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.070
It articulates your values and emphasize your key trends rather than focusing on what you want.

40
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.030
So how do you write a career summary or an objective?

41
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.420
First, read the employer's job description.

42
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.500
Your career summary shouldn't be a long list of everything you've done.

43
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.350
It would be a refined list of skills and experiences that demonstrate you're a fit for the job.

44
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.870
Mention your current job title.

45
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.970
One common way to begin your resume summary is to state your current job title.

46
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.080
As you can see in the example, include any relevant metrics and data like dollar amounts.

47
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.670
Year of experience.

48
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.250
Size of team sled.

49
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.140
So this can help your resume stand out.

50
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.530
Focus on making the employer want to read more.

51
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.850
The goal of your salary isn't to show everything you can do, but to grab their attention and show enough

52
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.230
that they continue reading.

53
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.540
Work experience.

54
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.250
Let's go over some general rules when writing the work experience section.

55
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.220
List in chronological order with the most recent employment first to start the beginning of the most

56
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.950
recent position held and the work backwards in time.

57
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.910
Do not include irrelevant experiences.

58
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.690
Every statement on your resume should lead the employer to the conclusion that you have the right qualifications

59
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.380
for the job.

60
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.780
Avoid vague descriptions.

61
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.310
Don't be general.

62
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.980
Employers want to learn about the skills and assets utilized to achieve real results.

63
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.580
Take the time to quantify your achievements and show the reader what you have accomplished at each position

64
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.450
you have helped.

65
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.080
Voluntary work accounts.

66
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.560
Other experiences outside of paid employment could show your capabilities.

67
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.540
This might include unpaid work placements, community activities, such as working with a charity work,

68
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.770
being a student representative for your course.

69
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.570
Stick to the following work experience.

70
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.210
Wardrobe dates employed.

71
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.710
Job title.

72
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.910
Company name.

73
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.960
Location.

74
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.980
Achievements and responsibilities.

75
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.220
Well, that's not obvious, right?

76
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.810
So when writing your dates employed simply list how long you worked at your previous role for and relax.

77
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.540
If you don't remember the exact date you got hired, you can give an approximate timeframe.

78
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.180
The START format for dates employed is month and year.

79
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.250
Let's look at the example.

80
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.520
Let's say you got hired in May 2018.

81
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.170
Well, the first example is the correct one.

82
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.430
Next the job title.

83
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.500
The job title should be accurate to what you did to make things simple.

84
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.700
You can use the exact name you saw in the original job ad.

85
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:13.280
For example, you'd rather use marketing manager title instead of online marketing manager.

86
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.990
Company name, description and location.

87
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.220
If the company isn't famous, you can also describe it in one or two sentences.

88
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.480
And you should always mention the location of the company to.

89
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.890
Achievements and responsibilities.

90
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.130
When you're basing your achievements in your resume, you should add any specific change that you made

91
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.610
happen.

92
00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:04.300
So when possible, you should list accomplishments over responsibilities while describing your accomplishments

93
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.920
or responsibilities.

94
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.400
Try to limit them within six bullet points at most.

95
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.980
And Bispecific recruiters love to see numbers on the rest of me.

96
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:25.730
For example, you can use optimized 15 landing pages during the course of the internship, resulting

97
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:33.320
in 17% lift in the organic search traffic rather than saying experience in optimizing landing pages.

98
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.930
The second example sounds less attractive and do not reflect exactly your accomplishment.

99
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.870
Education.

100
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.960
It's important to for mature educational experience to match the requirements of the job you're applying

101
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.410
for.

102
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.340
However, you should stick to the following education details the name of your school graduation year,

103
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.520
if applicable, the degree you obtained, your field of study, your GPA.

104
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:13.950
Of course, if above 3.4 and in your relevant honors or academic recognition or coursework, for example,

105
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:20.490
a recent graduate will want to include more detail and the place education section in a prominent position

106
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.530
on their resume.

107
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.480
Because this is the bulk of their experience.

108
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.020
Skills.

109
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.850
The next area that should be highlighted are your skills and abilities.

110
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.320
Employers who want a mix of hard skills and soft skills on your resume.

111
00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.450
So what is the difference between the two?

112
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.510
What skills can be demonstrated for educational certificates or practical demonstrations?

113
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.990
For example, software development requires knowledge of sound programming languages and can be used

114
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.520
for a variety of tasks.

115
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.390
For example, Microsoft's acknowledge it's an example of hard skill.

116
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:08.190
Soft skills, on the other hand, are personality traits, social competencies and skills used to perform

117
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.710
interpersonal activities and unique tasks.

118
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.020
They are also called human skills.

119
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:19.830
Usually they are linked to people's personality traits and social skills, but they also can be trained

120
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.710
and developed for practice and professional development.

121
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.930
Languages.

122
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.860
Language skills are great for adding content to your resume.

123
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.790
If you're putting together your first resume or a student, transmit language skills, show your ability

124
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.510
to learn quickly and to apply knowledge to real world situations.

125
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.150
Give your language skills its own section, usually under skill section.

126
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:55.640
Start at the top with the language you're most proficient in and list languages with your level of proficiency.

127
00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:02.900
You can refer to the CFR framework if you're applying for jobs in Europe or to LR scale.

128
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.990
If you're applying for jobs in the US, feel free to download those frameworks on the Air Resources

129
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.470
section.

130
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.800
Based on your personal experience in the job you're looking for, you can add some other possible headings.

131
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:32.190
For example, international experience, affiliations, memberships, publications, community service,

132
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.060
others.

133
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.220
And the words and passions.

134
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.630
What are them based on relevance to the job?

135
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.540
Ensuring that the most pertinent information is listed earlier in the resume.
