1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,640
In some final touches to polish your resume.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,790
Don't include references available upon request.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,380
Wait to be asked.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,780
Hiring managers will assume you have them.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,760
You don't need to tell them you do.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,200
You want to be sure to have your references ready to go when you're asked for them.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,230
Have someone else proofread your resume.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,430
Spelling, grammar and punctuation must be perfect.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,680
It's hard to prove with your own work.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,570
So ask friends or family to also look at.

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,910
Sami document is a PDF.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,310
Well, looks like a clean and well-structured document and your computer might look different on another

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,850
computer.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,490
A PDF helps you avoid this by saving the page is an image rather than a text file.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,760
Name your file appropriately.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,980
Don't just have it as resume or something.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,340
Equally, remember the person receiving it is going to be getting many resumes.

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,460
A better way to save it is your name.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,470
Plus, resume or last name?

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,180
Plus, first name plus resume.

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,750
Make it easy for the hiring manager to find your information.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,500
Update your resume.

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,320
Well, even if you're currently employed, at some point you may find that you need to update your resume.

24
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:28,020
Also, we often row beyond our original roles, further our qualifications, and we develop new sets

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,620
of skills.

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,350
Congratulations.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,440
That brings us to the end of the resuming writing course.

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,600
While working for your resume.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,520
Press pause and carefully.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,560
Craft each line of your resume.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,920
Go through all resources available and make sure you get some feedback before we send it out.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,540
Well, I wish you the best of luck and plenty of interviews.
