1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,340
Let's do a really, really quick exercise just to get our hands dirty and get us excited about the course.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,850
What we're going to do is build our first logo.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:17,210
Now we have a whole section where we're going to create logos from scratch ourselves and learn what

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,590
the best practices are.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:26,330
But just for now, I want us to have something created right away, and what we're going to do is create

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,450
our logo for the product that we want to build.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:37,010
So in our case, if we want to build a shopping experience that beats Amazon, well then let's create

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,340
that.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,560
If you have a logo that you want to do on your own for a different product, let's do that as well.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,550
And what we're going to use is some online logo makers.

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,470
Again, this is just the first step.

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,500
Don't worry, we're going to get into the nitty gritty later.

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,270
But for now, I'm going to link to some resources after this video.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:03,130
But as you can see here on zero two Mastery Audio, we have a resources page and at the very top we

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,650
have some free logo makers that we can use.

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,150
So there's four options here.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,610
It doesn't really matter which one you pick.

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,440
I want you to click on one of these and create your own custom logo.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,040
Now after this lecture, we're also going to include a bunch of design resources that we're going to

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,570
use throughout the course.

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,420
Just so you always have a reference and you can always get inspired as we're creating our product.
