00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.320
So I want to talk about components now.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.680
Components are very important to every design system, and one of the most important component that

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.690
we create are buttons.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.630
Now, as you can tell over here.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.850
I have two different types of buttons.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.750
I typically have my button that is a zero based button and a button that is a fixed based button.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.780
Now.

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.690
What does that mean?

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.240
Now a button that grows is a button that grows with the content within.

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.220
I'll show you what that looks like.

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.330
I'm going to create just an instance of that component.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.430
And if I start typing in here.

14
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.500
Hello, this button grows.

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.790
You'll see that the button grows with the content.

16
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.110
If I remove these icons.

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.390
Now the button shrinks.

18
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.050
So that is a growing button.

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.100
A fixed button is exactly the opposite.

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.670
So let's take that component and bring it up over here.

21
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.340
Now, if I were to say this button is fixed, you'll see that.

22
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.310
It is indeed fixed, but I can stretch out this component and I can make it full width.

23
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.750
There are a couple of times where we will do this within our application, where we will have buttons

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.020
that span 100% width from left to right.

25
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.020
This is where you would use something like that.

26
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.970
Now you may be asking me, Daniel, what is base?

27
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.780
What is that?

28
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.790
Now I've created this thing called base.

29
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.480
Because when you create your initial component, it's not going to be like.

30
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.930
Like this.

31
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.380
It won't be, like, beautiful.

32
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.380
Like it won't have any styles.

33
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.910
There won't be variants of it.

34
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.230
You'll have to create a version where this is just your base version.

35
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.300
Everything else is based off of this.

36
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.080
If I modify this in any way.

37
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.790
Like say if I.

38
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.420
Expand it every other variant.

39
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.660
That is a grow variant on the left hand side here.

40
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.830
You'll see.

41
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.710
Will actually expand.

42
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.100
Or if I change the border radius like I just did.

43
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.250
So it's very important to create a base that you can base everything off of.

44
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.660
That's exactly what it is.

45
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.880
If I put a period in front of it, it will hide it from my component list.

46
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.840
But you do need a paid account.

47
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.210
So another thing is you do need a paid account for your design system if you want to use it across other

48
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.080
files.

49
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.420
Trust me, it is very much worth it.

50
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.340
If you are using a paid account like with your company, that works fine as well.

51
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.280
Like that's perfect to have like those libraries.

52
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.920
But if you're using it just for yourself and then you want to use a design system and use it for a project

53
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.260
or a bunch of different other files, you're going to need to have a paid account for that, and I'll

54
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.410
show you what that looks like in a second.

55
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.060
But this is what I have done.

56
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.860
I've created these different regular fixed and a regular grow button.

57
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.960
Now, the reason why I've named them regular is just because I think this is regular size.

58
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.390
If I want to create a variant which is smaller, I can create another base button or I can create another

59
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.220
component based off of this instance.

60
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.520
Totally up to you.

61
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.690
I don't use the smaller buttons enough for me to do that.

62
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.740
I may use them.

63
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.480
I may create another version.

64
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.390
So let's go into how I've gone ahead and actually taken these buttons and turn them into different variants.

65
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.270
So I have a primary, I have a secondary and tertiary.

66
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.470
So let's get right into it.

67
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.340
If I have a button here, you'll see this is my primary button.

68
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.010
But if I look within this structure, there's my regular grow and everything else.

69
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.150
Now, all I've done here is I'll show you exactly what I've done.

70
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.530
So I've taken this.

71
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.050
Button.

72
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.000
I'm going to just duplicate it right here.

73
00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.860
And let's say I name this default.

74
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.230
The only problem with like real buttons is if you see this, this little container here, you're just

75
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.900
going to have to this frame, you're going to have to just bring it to the edge to properly size it.

76
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.060
So if I was going to create a default button like that where I can reuse within my application, I'm

77
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.810
going to do that.

78
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.460
I'm going to change colors.

79
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.730
So I'm going to use like my primary yellow.

80
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.920
Remember what I said about colors?

81
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.020
So if my UI is white, I want to change it to like a UI which is like a gray 80.

82
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.260
My text will be text gray as well.

83
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.010
And there you go.

84
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.240
I kind of have my button.

85
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.460
I can even go into other styles.

86
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.290
So I have some styles in here around different like shadows.

87
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.480
So I have a default shadow.

88
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.090
And there you go.

89
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.450
I have my primary button.

90
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.160
Looks exactly like that.

91
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.120
And all I would need to do is I'm not going to change this, this instance.

92
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.280
I'm actually going to create another frame around it.

93
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.920
So Option Command G and I have another frame and I'm going to rename this super cool.

94
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:43.570
But in and I'm going to just create that as a component option command K Or you can go into your toolbar.

95
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.550
So if I reverse that command Z so I have my ability to just go like that.

96
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.530
And that's a component.

97
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.470
Now if I go into my assets and I go into my buttons.

98
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.720
I will see my super cool button up there.

99
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.080
I mean, it's not in a nice folder.

100
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.490
You'll notice just how we have our bass buttons here.

101
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.900
We have our primary buttons, and that's based off of the frames they're in.

102
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.040
That's how I've separated them.

103
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.230
So that way I can easily access components, not necessarily based off of their naming convention,

104
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.540
but based off of the frames that they're located in.

105
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.490
And that's just the best practice I find for creating components separate them by frames so they're

106
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.880
easily accessible when you need to grab them.

107
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.150
So I have all my gro versions for primary buttons, all my like fixed versions for secondary and so

108
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.510
on.

109
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.210
And so this is my super cool component button that I can just reuse and reuse.

110
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.500
And in this instance, if I were to create.

111
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.150
Let's delete one of them.

112
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.560
If I were to create an active aversion, let's see what I've done here for active.

113
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.680
So all I've done basically is I've made the pass through 80%.

114
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.010
So that way it looks like it's when you're clicking it just like a nice hover state in a way, but it's

115
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.530
very much different from that first state.

116
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.610
So I'll just go ahead and I will set that to 80%.

117
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.870
There is a variance there.

118
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:20.330
And I can even go ahead and go right in there and set that to the active shadow, which is maybe just

119
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.140
a little bit later.

120
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.610
So it looks like it's a press down.

121
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.480
I press down button and let's go into our layers section and you'll see this is very much an instance.

122
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.970
You'll see that super cool button over here.

123
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.370
You'll see my other super cool button.

124
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.230
But over here, what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to detach this instance.

125
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.300
I'm not going to detach the base, just the initial instance.

126
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:49.040
So Option Command B and I'm going to rename it super cool button active.

127
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.500
Now this is very good and this is why I said about like your design system is not just for you.

128
00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:00.230
Oftentimes designers aren't really designing to show like active states or disabled states or maybe

129
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.950
disabled states.

130
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.630
It really depends how in-depth you're going with your different user flows you're trying to show others.

131
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:11.030
But when we hand off something like this to developers, we're showing them all the different types

132
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.130
of variations of buttons they need to code.

133
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.290
So this is my active button.

134
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.760
And this will trigger when this is clicked.

135
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.610
So if I were to create a prototype.

136
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.280
This is what I would do.

137
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.530
So when I click on this.

138
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.870
We can do on most down.

139
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.950
We're in a swap.

140
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.289
Super cool but in active.

141
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.490
And that is not instant.

142
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.080
We're just going to smart animate it.

143
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.930
And what I'm going to do here is we can actually sorry dissolve that.

144
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.670
I don't think it's going to work because they're not the same name.

145
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.500
And what I'm going to do is over here on mouse up.

146
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.030
I'm actually going to go back.

147
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.050
And that's just going to dissolve.

148
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.650
Let's see what this prototype looks like.

149
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.130
So you'll see when I'm clicking at.

150
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.890
There is very much a change.

151
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:32.620
Now, I can even set this to like 50% if you want to see more change than anything.

152
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.480
I'm not clipping the content.

153
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.040
Okay.

154
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.020
Let's go back to our prototype.

155
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.830
And you'll see.

156
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.080
There is a change in that interaction and we're giving them a lot of feedback.

157
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.470
So don't just create the default button.

158
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.490
Let me delete that.

159
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.570
Don't just create the default button you need to create like the variations that go alongside them when

160
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.590
you're working on desktop.

161
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.080
That may be like hover states as well.

162
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.510
So I've gone ahead and done that.

163
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.130
I've created disabled buttons.

164
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:07.040
I've also created like a secondary button where it's just like a white background with a shadow.

165
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.150
And I've created those variations with active and disabled as well.

166
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.100
Same with the tertiary.

167
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.060
I don't have a disabled button because I'll never use a disabled button in this instance.

168
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.290
But I've done the exact same thing for fixed as well.

169
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.340
So when you're creating buttons, when you're creating components like that, you remember to think

170
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.860
about all the different types of use cases for that button.

171
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.530
I may even be missing something here, and I totally understand that.

172
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.900
And I understand that these things may change.

173
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.000
I may use different colors in the future.

174
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.860
I may use different typefaces, different icons, but I've made it so.

175
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.120
It's very much modular.

176
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.100
I have this icon now.

177
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.700
This is my instance and I want this to be like an add button.

178
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.530
Now I'm using it for the sole case of an ad button.

179
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.630
I'm going to not delete it.

180
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.520
It'll just hide it, which is perfect.

181
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.800
And for this button, I'm going to swap it out for another icon.

182
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.410
Do we have an ad icon in here?

183
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.010
Oh, there it is.

184
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.490
Plus.

185
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.790
And just like that, we've created our own component.

186
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.680
And I'm just going to shrink that down so that we have proper sizing.

187
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.180
And there you go.

188
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:23.120
You have your own component that you can use at any which way you like, and that is how I've built

189
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.120
out buttons for our design system.
