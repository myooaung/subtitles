00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.150
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.530
So what we're going to do today for this little kind of video, we are going to actually prototype some

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.800
micro interactions for our navigation.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.840
So if you remember, we were working on some visual style exploration and this is where we kind of left

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.540
off in terms of our home screen.

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.420
Now, I'm actually going to just delete everything here and I'm going to just keep our nav.

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.080
I think that's a good place to start for our NAV anyways.

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.450
We're going to just bring that up.

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.040
And what I want to do here is.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780
Let's actually take our nav.

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.030
Oh, I'm going to just duplicate it.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.620
I'm going to just work on the knife right here for now.

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.530
So let's just hide that.

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.830
Let's bring this color.

15
00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:01.830
I'm going to just detach that, grab that and OC so we have our little nav.

16
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:09.750
And, you know, for the sake of this this little test, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to bump

17
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.910
this all the way up to, I think.

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.660
100 is going to be fine.

19
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.390
I'm going to bring them up and this is going to be enough to work with.

20
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.920
So what I want to do is I want to create a couple of different interactions here.

21
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.270
I mean, I know we're on mobile, but I want to show some hover interactions as well, some clicking

22
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.750
interactions, just different examples of things we can do and what's in the realm of possibility.

23
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.590
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just select my text tool.

24
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.030
I'm going to just write something and write home.

25
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.590
Let me just detach that.

26
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.810
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do that's a little too big.

27
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.310
So we got home.

28
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.570
Perfect.

29
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.360
Let's just change 100%.

30
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.650
So I have home over here and I'm going to actually make that a frame and just call it home.

31
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.480
Let's do the our other frame there.

32
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.010
So we're going to call that home and that I want to have pop in over there.

33
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.610
So I'm just going to leave that there for now.

34
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.940
So this is just going to be just an auto layout.

35
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.620
We got a home in there.

36
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.730
Perfect.

37
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.320
Let's keep that centered.

38
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.110
I'm going to create another one.

39
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.040
And another one.

40
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.000
And another one.

41
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.770
Perfect.

42
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.930
So this one is going to be a wish list.

43
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.410
This one is going to be orders.

44
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.890
And this one's going to be Cart OC.

45
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.660
Let's rename each frame.

46
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.100
This is important so we keep things in order.

47
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.990
So we got all our different.

48
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.210
Just copy in general.

49
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.850
What else can we do here?

50
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.850
We can make copies of these.

51
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.740
Actually.

52
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.890
Let's keep it like that for now.

53
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.860
Let's just prototype quickly what we got here.

54
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.480
So what we're going to do is on a hover, we're going to go like that.

55
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.880
Weird.

56
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.360
Okay.

57
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.870
Let's do on hover.

58
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.030
I'm going to open up overlay, and that overlay is going to be home.

59
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.590
And we can select how we want to feature that.

60
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.800
I mean, that can show up right there.

61
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.880
That's a little.

62
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.450
Perfect.

63
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.800
So we got home.

64
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.450
That's what's going to happen on hover and that is going to be a dissolve.

65
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.820
That's OC.

66
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.560
Let's see what that looks like, actually.

67
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.210
So what I want to do is I want to just do you see, that is a micro interaction.

68
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.240
We're going to hover.

69
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.350
Boom!

70
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.010
Hover.

71
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.820
Gone.

72
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.910
So really nice feedback we're getting there.

73
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.060
Just changing the background color and we're going to do that for everything else as well.

74
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.020
So on hover we are going to.

75
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.060
Let's just shoot while hovering.

76
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.480
We are going to do that dissolve.

77
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.280
We're going to navigate open overlay.

78
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.710
We are going to keep that two manual and eight pixels just below.

79
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.050
And centered.

80
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.480
So we're going to do that and we'll do that for this one as well.

81
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.630
So what we're creating here is just very, very simple micro interaction on hovering.

82
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.070
Let's do that.

83
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.880
So.

84
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.300
Yeah.

85
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.680
Eight pixels.

86
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.890
And let's finally do it for carts as well.

87
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.600
So we got a click while hovering.

88
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.540
Open overlay, custom or manual, so you can center an overlay any which way you want.

89
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.310
I'm doing manual because I want it to be perfectly centered.

90
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.580
Okay.

91
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.100
I don't think I'm going to get it perfectly centered, but.

92
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.460
Okay.

93
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.440
Let's take a look at our micro interaction.

94
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.330
That's looking sharp.

95
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.310
I really love it.

96
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.020
So that is a micro interaction.

97
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.940
Let's see if we can bump that up.

98
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.980
That's really why.

99
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.790
But it's all right.

100
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.950
So we got our wish list, our home, our orders, and our cards.

101
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:07.330
Now, what we can try and do is we can actually make the actual icons come in and darken.

102
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.350
So I want to do is I'm going to also.

103
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.330
So there's a couple of ways we can actually do this.

104
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.520
So I'm going to just take all these and delete them.

105
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.700
Until the.

106
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.060
Okay.

107
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.990
So let's go back to design.

108
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.500
So we're just going to set this up really nicely and quickly.

109
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.170
We are going to make these a vertical and I'm going to drop that in there.

110
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.990
I'm going to drop that in there.

111
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.330
And I'm going to drop that one in there.

112
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.550
Oop!

113
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.000
Oh, no.

114
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.310
Let's drop the.

115
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.960
So as you can tell, what I'm doing is I'm just.

116
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.270
Beautiful.

117
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:15.250
And let's select all of these and make the spacing between items eight pixels.

118
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.790
So what happens is perfect.

119
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.850
They're all going to turn black.

120
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.330
And let's see what the animation will look like.

121
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.970
So when I do that, what's going to happen is I'm going to have to just overlay that.

122
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.750
Over my.

123
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.100
That's.

124
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.390
That's fine for now.

125
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.490
Same thing over here.

126
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.080
I want to bring that up.

127
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.930
For some reason it is not aligning, but that's okay.

128
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.720
And I'm going to bring this one up, too.

129
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.980
Nice.

130
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.910
That's good.

131
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.990
And this one I'm going to bring here.

132
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.720
So let's click on that.

133
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:05.430
Okay.

134
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.050
So that one's perfect.

135
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.860
Okay.

136
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.570
So let's take a look at our micro interactions.

137
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:16.080
So as you can tell, when we hover over, we're getting that nice little black overlay.

138
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.990
It's a little shaky on these, but that's fine.

139
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.090
And now we can see just the actual the label as well.

140
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.980
So that's really nice.

141
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:32.280
In our next video, we're actually going to jump in and animate this search experience over here.

142
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.210
We're going to work on the micro interaction for what happens when we actually click on this or even

143
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:39.870
hover on it.

144
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.850
So that is it for hovering on each navigation item.
