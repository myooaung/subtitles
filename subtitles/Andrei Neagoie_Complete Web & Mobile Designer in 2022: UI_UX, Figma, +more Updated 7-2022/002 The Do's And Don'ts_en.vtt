00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.250
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.510
We're going to jump right into the do's and don'ts of user flows.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.890
So user flows show the purpose of what you're trying to create.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.610
And really, we shouldn't be vague at all.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.880
So this title tells me absolutely nothing.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.510
Vague user flows and names really hide the potential complexity and doesn't communicate enough information

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.590
back to the viewer.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.490
Remember, we have to be a little bit more detailed when we think about these.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.250
I do not know what is happening here.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.650
All I know is that there is some sort of vague flow and it's going in different directions.

11
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.910
Maybe this could be broken out.

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.190
I don't know what profile means.

13
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.710
Maybe the user is trying to get to their profile.

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.110
Maybe the user is on their profile or maybe the user is signing up.

15
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.130
I'm not sure.

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
What you should do is use descriptive names.

17
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.580
Maybe it's add user payment details, organize them maybe into separate flows.

18
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.280
Is the user trying to get to their profile to edit their profile picture?

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.550
That's a separate flow.

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.620
And by naming your flows, you're really able to design from the user's perspective, and you can split

21
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.830
goals based off of what they're trying to do.

22
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.140
So remember, you can create separate flows.

23
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.150
Don't be afraid to make as many as you want.

24
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.190
It really helps us break down all the different requirements we need and all the different scenarios

25
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.540
that may pop up.

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.390
Your flow should always go in one direction.

27
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.840
I mean, there's really no excuse to do something like this.

28
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.570
I mentioned it before about sprawling like flowcharts or site maps, but these are confusing and they

29
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.010
don't really do a good job of actually indicating some sort of user flow.

30
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.160
They may tell me all the different possibilities that the user may encounter while their inner product

31
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.170
or website or whatever we're building.

32
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.670
But to take a look at that, that's incredibly overwhelming.

33
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.530
So these work as a good site map or to show the way the navigation works in your product.

34
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.150
But don't use it for our user flow.

35
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
What we should do is the following.

36
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.850
Split them up into distinct flows and categorize them.

37
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.650
So if we zoom out just a bit, we had like three different flows broken into here, broken it into one

38
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.000
or put together as one.

39
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.610
And over here what we've done is even though there's like a decision tree in one of our flows, we've

40
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.500
actually just broken them out separately.

41
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.690
We'll name them, we'll write descriptions for each task and they'll have an end goal.

42
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.470
So remember, keep it simple, break it out.

43
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.610
It's okay to be a little redundant, but it's going to help you in the end.

44
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.050
And the last don't.

45
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.770
Your flow should represent a complete task.

46
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.240
Don't do this.

47
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.700
You're missing a bunch of details here.

48
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.940
There's a bunch of useless information like click button at bottom.

49
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.660
I'm not sure what button means.

50
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.370
Fill out fields.

51
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.420
Like what fields?

52
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.600
And I mean, there's just nothing left at the end.

53
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.500
We should have some sort of description of what that end goal is.

54
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.230
We need to know the details the user needs to take to complete a task and the actions.

55
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.780
This is what you should probably be doing.

56
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.290
Add the right amount of detail outlining each step and goal.

57
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.110
This way anyone can read and understand your flow.

58
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.330
So I know that this flow is purchasing a product instantly and that can mean a lot of things, but we

59
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.760
can break that up into several flows.

60
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.520
So I can review a product detail.

61
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.060
I can review a product's details and use the Buy Now button, and that pushes me into the next step.

62
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.070
I am reviewing shipping and payment information and we can even add to this review shipping and payment

63
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.210
information.

64
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.130
Confirm.

65
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.230
Details and make purchase.

66
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.480
Let's just open this frame up just a little bit more.

67
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.960
Great.

68
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.730
And the last step is the purchase has been confirmed.

69
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.810
You get an order confirmation and you receive some sort of success message.

70
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.209
So remember, add the right amount of detail and outline each step and goal.

71
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.470
That way anyone could read it and understand it.

72
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.030
We don't want people looking at those confusing site maps with not enough information outlining each

73
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.920
step or each scenario.

74
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.520
And we don't want people to be confused.

75
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.230
So follow these do's and don'ts and you'll be ready to create your very own user flows.
