00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.570
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:11.240
So in our last little lesson, we talked a bit about finding the right font and or a typeface and finding

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.200
the different font styles are going to work for you and testing out with elements.

4
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.600
And the next part is we're actually going to start creating a typography system.

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.700
When I approach a typography system, there's a couple of things that I do.

6
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.910
I have my font.

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.460
I have, like, ladle bowls over here.

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.420
I like to, like, use a headline find.

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.630
The stuff that you love.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.250
I like to get a bunch of different things going here.

11
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.570
Let's actually get one for body copy.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.950
So, like, we may just get, like, lorem ipsum, maybe like a three sentence paragraph.

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.230
Okay, maybe that's a larger paragraph and then maybe we have a little bit of a smaller paragraph.

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.850
So let's let's get that ready.

15
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.550
So I urge you, you know, design along with me.

16
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.800
Do your own thing.

17
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.090
Do what works for you.

18
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.040
It's all about having fun.

19
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.110
And just exploring all the different ways we can kind of built out a type system.

20
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.550
This is what I'm going to do.

21
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.390
So I have a bunch of things.

22
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.710
They all kind of look alike.

23
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.940
Now I need to think about the different types of content that I'm going to have in our mobile application.

24
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.760
We're going to have headings we're probably gonna have like subheadings Republicans have like body copies,

25
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.930
smaller body copy.

26
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.970
We're going to have labels for like inputs, we're going to have links, probably, we're going to have

27
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.310
hint, text.

28
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.690
And I start essentially thinking about all these different typographic elements, and I'm going to just

29
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.220
start kind of like mocking them up.

30
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.890
So 32 pixels is probably a good size, maybe like 36 for a bigger headline.

31
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.030
And for, like, some larger body copy I can do, like.

32
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.210
16 or maybe 20.

33
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.230
And I'll set that to like 115%.

34
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.080
I like to use like actual pixels for the line height.

35
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.890
I mean, you can do it based off of like a percentage.

36
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.880
It's totally up to you what you think is best.

37
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.720
So like, I'll probably do like 24 pixels, not 24%, 24 pixels.

38
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.230
And I think that's totally fine.

39
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.350
What I'll do is I'll also kind of like make it medium.

40
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.090
I'll bring this in.

41
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:30.240
This will probably be like my main body copy at 16 pixels and the line height probably around like 20.

42
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.310
Pixels.

43
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.130
And there we go, regular.

44
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.310
So we start to see how things may actually play out here.

45
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.780
I think right now we have some really interesting things.

46
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.480
I like to kind of try to establish some sort of visual hierarchy.

47
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.970
So the visual differences need to be obvious enough to instantly understand the importance of each element,

48
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.260
and that is key.

49
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.750
So, I mean, like if we're talking about like buttons, headlines, we're talking about remember the

50
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.280
elements that we made last time which were like prices and product names.

51
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.010
So we need to really think about how those different elements are going to look and how they're going

52
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.240
to play well together.

53
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.720
So I like to kind of start creating stuff like this to really establish like some sort of hierarchy.

54
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.970
And the next thing I'll do is I'll start to kind of assign some preemptive roles.

55
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.930
So I know this is like a heading, so I know like maybe there's a 36 pixel heading.

56
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.440
I'll probably have like a 40 pixel heading.

57
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.640
I like to use like a really tight line height because, you know, a mobile.

58
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.130
I don't plan to have these headings wrap.

59
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.640
You know, maybe this is like my h one.

60
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.510
This is like my H two.

61
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.030
If I'm thinking about like semantic handling of our our headlines.

62
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.250
What else is there?

63
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.970
Maybe there's a 32 pixels.

64
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.610
So I'm starting to think about all the different headlines I may have in the variety that really helps

65
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.120
me kind of start building out this type system a bit.

66
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.450
So for a 32 pixel headline.

67
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.420
What do we have here?

68
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.990
This is 32.

69
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.589
This is 36 and this is 40.

70
00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.200
So maybe 36 is on enough variation there.

71
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.230
So like, I'll scrap that and I will go with like 32 by a 36 line height.

72
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.300
And while I'm kind of like assigning these rules, I like nothing is set in stone.

73
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.880
But what I can do is if I'm starting to really like the kind of the type scale I'm building, so I'll

74
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.930
just keep on going.

75
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.470
So if I go from like 32 to 28.

76
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.640
And let's create a couple more.

77
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.290
So I got 20 pixels, maybe 20 I like.

78
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.860
I'm just trying to create enough variation.

79
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.560
So that.

80
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.610
When you go down to like a lower size, it's enough.

81
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.060
Like contrast between the previous one.

82
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.800
We have 20 pixels and 16 will probably be the next one.

83
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.650
So that's good.

84
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.810
And what else is there?

85
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.580
Maybe like 12?

86
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.600
I think 12 is the lowest we'll go and we may not even use that, but I think it's good to just have.

87
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.620
Okay.

88
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.580
So you have all these we may use like extra bold.

89
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.410
Okay.

90
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.020
So what I will do now is now that I know, like I have an H one, two, three, four, five and six,

91
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.610
I'll start actually assigning roles.

92
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.280
So I know this is going to be my H one and I'm happy with it.

93
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.620
I'm going to actually create like a style for it.

94
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:54.000
And what I'll do here is I'll actually go into my text little bar over here, go into styles, and this

95
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.110
is how you add a style.

96
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.990
So I'm going to create a category called headings.

97
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.580
This is just the formatting of it, all headings, and I'll just slash, then I'll name it.

98
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.890
So I'll call this like h one.

99
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.180
What size is this one.

100
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.840
I think this is 40 pixels or 40 pixels every 20, 40 pixels.

101
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.770
So there it is.

102
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:20.550
I'll create that style and you'll see that if I go into here or if I just click off and I just click

103
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.760
onto my canvas or my frame, I'll see all my local styles.

104
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.780
So there's one.

105
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.500
And the great thing about this is I'll just click this and I will go over here and I can just select

106
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.830
that style and now I can use that across my whole actual library.

107
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:45.120
So I can use that across like all my different types of like pages that may be linked to this, which

108
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.140
is amazing.

109
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.810
And I will do that for the rest of them.

110
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.280
So I will once again go headings.

111
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.240
I will slash and I'll call this like h two.

112
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.840
And this one is 32 pixels, I believe.

113
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.190
And there you go.

114
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.510
And it shows up right there.

115
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.270
So for body, I would do something very similar.

116
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:19.240
What I'll do is I'll look, I'll go into my styles and I'll type in body and I will say large.

117
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.650
I think this is 20 pixel.

118
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.660
I know that if I have a larger paragraph, I want to display a larger copy.

119
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.030
Maybe it's a quote.

120
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.010
Maybe it's like copy after a headline.

121
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.990
Not necessarily body copy that we read all the time and I will use something like that.

122
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.950
Same with this.

123
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.630
I will do the exact same thing.

124
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.400
So I will go Bodhi.

125
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.240
I'll call Bodhi and I'll call it Reg regular.

126
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.630
And this is 16 pixels crate style.

127
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.370
These are my textiles.

128
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.590
They're all separated based off of what I've created.

129
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.790
So let's go in here.

130
00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:01.310
And when I go to select a textile, I'll see that now they're separated by body and headline.

131
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:08.330
So the goal here is to really try and create a bunch of different like roles that you're going to be

132
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.610
using for your type system.

133
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:17.690
So I like to use like a couple of variances of the body copy, so I'll just disconnect this class.

134
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.530
So detaching the style, I'll probably have like a 12 pixel.

135
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:29.630
12 pixels, smaller body copy, and this would be like 16 pixels in height and line height.

136
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.730
So really easy to read and I'll just create a style right there.

137
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.190
And I'll call it body.

138
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.850
How do you SM for small and I'll just say 12 pixels and there you go.

139
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.610
Now we're starting to create a bunch of different things.

140
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.040
I also think of like labels.

141
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.350
So if I just write.

142
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.540
Label.

143
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.310
I'll detach that again.

144
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.290
And if I think about the type of label we'll have, maybe it'll be like 12 pixels.

145
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.590
The thing about the label they'll have will be probably around 12 pixels.

146
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:11.200
So maybe it's like a bold and I think like it's not going to drop to a second line so I can leave it

147
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.170
at 100 and I'll just create a style for that.

148
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.510
And under that I may just call it like.

149
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.460
Text or miscellaneous or forms.

150
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.020
It really doesn't matter.

151
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.800
I mean, it's going to be what you're going to be using and what you're comfortable with.

152
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.570
So I'll call it label.

153
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.810
And I'll just say like 12 pixels.

154
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:32.990
So there we go.

155
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.920
Like we have a bunch of different like styles that we already created and it's like the beginning of

156
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.640
your type system.

157
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.980
I mean, nothing is set in stone, go through it, see what works best, and you can update these styles

158
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.790
all the time.

159
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.240
So if I notice that this isn't working that well, I'll jump into here.

160
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:56.980
And I will go to this little button that says edit style with my style selected and I can edit it up

161
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.540
here and I can change anything from like the line height.

162
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.970
I can change all the little details, like if it's an all caps.

163
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.940
And that is essentially the easy way to create a type system from scratch.

164
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.060
I mean, you'll have to go through different types of body copies that you think work.

165
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.290
Maybe there's alternate versions, maybe there's different headlines, sub headlines.

166
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.490
Think about the product that we're building and the different types of pieces of content that we need

167
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.660
and just keep on going.

168
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.250
I mean, have fun with it.

169
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.720
It's totally such a fun exercise because you can do what we did in the last lesson and start building

170
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.840
different types of like components, and you can really start to see the different types of things that

171
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.600
we're going to need in terms of typographic elements.

172
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.690
Go out there, have some fun, build your own type system.

173
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.220
At this point, it doesn't necessarily need to be so complex because we'll get into that even later,

174
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.950
but start having fun so that when we actually get into visual design and designing actual interfaces

175
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:04.520
with color and all our elements we are going to like, it'll speed up our workflow to use things like

176
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.870
our local styles.

177
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:13.130
So go ahead, create your own type system and we'll definitely use that in our next couple of lessons.
