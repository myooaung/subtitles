00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.300
Hey, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.200
Well, now we're in Figma and we're going to talk about responsive grids.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.440
Now, you may be designing for multiple screens.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.780
I mean, we do that a lot and grids can really help with that.

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.860
We just spoke about layout grids and typographic grids and the history of grids.

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.770
But, you know, grids are used to scale up and down to display information on multiple set of screens.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.550
So let's jump in.

8
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.810
We have some cool demos here.

9
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.480
First is the fixed grid.

10
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.340
Now the fixed grid has a fixed container with position.

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.410
I can demonstrate how this works.

12
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.770
So as you adjust the frame.

13
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.700
This container that's housing, the actual layout grid is going to stay fixed and all the elements within

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.470
it will stay fixed as well.

15
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.400
So this actually maintains the exact measurements while the margin sizes increase or decrease.

16
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.810
Like this, even when I decrease it like that, they will stay fixed.

17
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.130
Now, this is great if you want all your elements to stay proportional, but when you get to larger

18
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.430
streams, you may end up with way too much white space.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.440
Like this would be an extra large desktop screen and you're like, Wow, that's a lot of whitespace

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.940
right there.

21
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.300
There are ways to handle that.

22
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.000
But fixed grids aren't really used as much anymore, so let's just put that back there.

23
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.510
Next is the fluid grid.

24
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.640
Now, this is really cool.

25
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.830
Now, fluid grids are measured in percentages, so the columns of the grid or your entire grid will

26
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.020
shrink or grow depending on the size of your screen.

27
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.340
Let me show you what I mean.

28
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.660
So here is our grid.

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.430
And you'll notice when I stretch it, the columns will stretch to.

30
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.870
And when I shrink it, the columns and the content shrink as well.

31
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.080
All of these sizes will increase and decrease based off of percentages.

32
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.400
That's kind of cool, right?

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.350
You know what's even cooler.

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.660
Take a look at those margins and gutters.

35
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.600
Let's zoom in now.

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.470
We've got margins on the right, gutters in the middle.

37
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.520
Look at that.

38
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.229
They aren't even.

39
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.230
Shrinking.

40
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.400
We're growing.

41
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.650
The only thing that shrinks and grows is the size of your column, your gutters and your margins will

42
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.180
always stay the same.

43
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.360
They don't change and they adhere to your base unit.

44
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.530
So in this case, let's take a look.

45
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.880
This is our layover here.

46
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.320
We've got 24 pixel gutter and 24 pixel margin, and they are staying the same.

47
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.390
Now, one con is that when you're on larger screens and you want to utilize some extra space, sometimes

48
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.050
your content may look kind of stretched out, but there's ways to handle that.

49
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.750
You could actually define a set with for your container, but still have it be responsive.

50
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.150
Now responsive grids.

51
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.930
Here we have a set of four.

52
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.580
Over here.

53
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.400
This is always kind of a topic that designers like to kind of not really talk about as much.

54
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.800
You know, we need to always keep breakpoints in mind when we're designing for responsive layouts.

55
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.710
As you notice, based off of our little demonstration there with fixed and fluid content, content will

56
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.630
stretch and shrink depending on your screen size.

57
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.820
And that's fine.

58
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.180
We expect that we can't run away from this, but we have a way to work around this.

59
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.700
So breakpoints allow us to scale up.

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.730
And down our design based off of desktop and mobile.

61
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.820
So we have extra large screens, large, medium, small.

62
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.530
So this is probably like a tablet.

63
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.200
This is your mobile screen, probably like your regular laptop or small desktop and even larger screens.

64
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.540
The first step is to always establish the set of breakpoints Don't worry too much.

65
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.350
There's a bunch of literature out there about certain breakpoints and what works best, but here's a

66
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.890
set of breakpoints that I always use, and it helps me get started on projects.

67
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.400
So from small, let's zoom in here.

68
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.470
This one's at 375, but I usually define it by a little bit larger.

69
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.630
I think 600 is fine for smaller phones.

70
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.390
Something like that.

71
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.589
This is just like your typical size of like an iPhone X screen or an excess medium.

72
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.000
You got 600 to 899.

73
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.160
This one's at 904.

74
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.620
So you get.

75
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.940
There you go.

76
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.950
I could just bring that up.

77
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.700
And then larger.

78
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.170
We have 902 1199.

79
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.240
So this one we can fix to that.

80
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.550
Let's move over our content.

81
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.200
You see, sometimes there's a really large screens that we need to think about.

82
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.690
This would be our large medium.

83
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.500
Something like that.

84
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.070
Something like that.

85
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.410
For small and for an extra large, it's 1200 pixels, width and above.

86
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.800
These breakpoints will help you define small, medium, large and extra large breakpoints.

87
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.810
And you can definitely modify your layout grid to change dramatically based off of that breakpoint or

88
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.400
if you can change slightly.

89
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.360
So let's take a look what we got here after we modify it just a bit.

90
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.000
Let's just align them together.

91
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.690
There you go.

92
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.580
We just distributed horizontally.

93
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.880
So we can see on our extra large column grid, we have a 12 column grid.

94
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.890
And when we move a little bit down to large, nothing really changes with the layout, but we still

95
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.630
have the same type of column grid.

96
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.050
And when we move down to a medium grid, we start seeing some changes.

97
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.910
We can use a six column grid.

98
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.500
This would be typically a smaller laptop screen or even a tablet.

99
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.860
So we start thinking about things like How are these users actually experiencing our product?

100
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.450
Do we need to scale down elements?

101
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.140
Do we need to scale up elements just to keep them tappable.

102
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.150
And on small.

103
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.830
Like I said before, you could use like a two column grid, but I think that really limits you.

104
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.420
So over here I have a six column grid.

105
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.290
So we have.

106
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.360
Two items together on there, and we can even do three items on this one.

107
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.620
It gives you a little bit more variety.

108
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.560
Before I said I like a column grids and I'll show you what that looks like.

109
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.620
So I'm going to just do is zoom out here.

110
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.220
I'm going to copy this over here so we can work on it.

111
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.150
And we're going to change the columns from 6 to 8.

112
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.350
Now that kind of looks skinny, doesn't give us much breathing room and the margin in the gutter, you

113
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.240
can tell we'll play around with red.

114
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.830
So it's easily visible.

115
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.940
You have four columns on to half the column grid, but you can even like if you want to have things

116
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.030
kind of scale off the page a little bit.

117
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.830
And have that as a swiping behavior.

118
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.890
You can do that.

119
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.560
Another really nice thing you can do on a column grid is have something really large.

120
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.720
I like that.

121
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.460
And you can sleep like that, which is really great.

122
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.110
Know, let's just kind of set that back.

123
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.430
Actually, we can just delete this.

124
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.810
Okay.

125
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.820
So these are fluid layouts.

126
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.220
Once we stretches out like it will give us an indication on if we need to actually scale up your design,

127
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.550
if we need to scale down certain components, like I mentioned before.

128
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.250
But this is where you should probably start if you have to actually build a product or a website based

129
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.580
off of or that allows for multiple screens.
