00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.020
Congratulations.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.720
You're actually learning quite a lot.

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:12.160
Although things might still seem a little intimidating, you now have a newfound power where you can

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.860
create websites, you can put them online.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.480
Now, there's still lots to learn, but one of the neat things about knowing how much we know now is

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.290
that you can leverage other people's templates.

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.620
Now.

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.460
What does that mean?

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.220
It means that unlike the startup landing page that we just created, you don't have to create everything

10
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.210
from scratch.

11
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.580
As a matter of fact, if you Google free HTML five templates or free HTML CSS templates, there's a

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.480
ton of free resources online that you can use.

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.420
Now, after this lesson, I'm going to link to some of my favorite free resources, but one of them

14
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.860
is mash up template.

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.080
Here, you can actually use a bunch of free templates for yourself.

16
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.070
And if I let's say go to complex here or no let's do factory.

17
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.750
I can actually download the files here as HTML.

18
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.400
And check this out.

19
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.200
If I now open this.

20
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.380
I now have these files and there's a lot of files that we still don't know.

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.640
There's some JavaScript here that we haven't talked about yet, and we'll cover these in later lessons.

22
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.510
But the thing here is that you know about HTML and CSS.

23
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.910
So now if you actually double click on this HTML, you have a website that you can use and customize

24
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.750
to your liking.

25
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.350
And this website is free for you to use.

26
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.620
You can now change the background image.

27
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.590
You can change what the button does.

28
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.510
You can do different things and you can customize it just like we have with the startup landing page.

29
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.230
But to your own liking, by just changing the HTML and CSS files, which we have right here.

30
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.110
This is the power of the Web.

31
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.720
The Web allows programmers to share pieces of code so that we don't have to constantly reinvent things

32
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.630
from scratch.

33
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.750
Just like Bootstrap allowed us to do things easily in terms of layout.

34
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.600
Templates allow us to create websites instead of from scratch.

35
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.870
We get to start with a basic template.

36
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.800
Now I want you to try building your own startup landing page.

37
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.950
Up until now, I've shown you step by step, but you have the power to create something custom to your

38
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.490
liking.

39
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.720
You can use something like mash up templates, or you can elaborate on the current startup page.

40
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.460
You have the power to do it.

41
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.780
And although it may seem a little bit hard right now, we're still starting off.

42
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.080
It's good for you to get that practice of doing things on your own, experimenting on your own.

43
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.590
And even if you fail, even if it takes you hours to just center a text or a button, it's going to

44
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.420
be good practice in the long run.

45
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.900
So give it a go.

46
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.980
Create your own custom startup landing page.

47
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.300
And if you're done, go share it in our Discord Server.

48
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.920
I'll see you in the next one.
