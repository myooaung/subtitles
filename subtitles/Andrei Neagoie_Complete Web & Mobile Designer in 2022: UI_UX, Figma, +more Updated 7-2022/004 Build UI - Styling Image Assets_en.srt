1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,550
All righty.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,689
So the goal of this video is going to be to style our image assets.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,250
Luckily, most of this work has already been done by the designer.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,850
If we jump back to Figma, we can start by clicking on our branding layer.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,000
So once we do that, we can see that we have some CSS in the corner here.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,490
So we're just going to copy that.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,680
It's as simple as that.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
And we'll jump back to our code, into our CSS.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,010
And the class name we're targeting is our brand IMG.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:46,930
So we'll do that actually above our title because it appears above our title there brand IMG and then

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,570
we'll just paste that in there and we'll need to shift that position of course, and we can save that.

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,560
And yeah, so our branding is looking a lot better.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,750
It's the right size and you can actually see that it's lining up with the text here as well, just like

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,090
it does in our page here.

15
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,840
Awesome.

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,350
Next, let's focus on our App Store links.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:16,580
So we'll start with our Apple App Store styling so we can copy this just like we did.

18
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,930
Jump back to our code and we want to style our app dash store dash button.

19
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:31,280
So App Store dash, BTN four button and we're going to paste that in same thing.

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,570
We'll need to align that again, save it and check it out.

21
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,200
Okay.

22
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,620
So we can see that our positioning is correct, but we have an issue that our image itself is still

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,000
bigger than it should be.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,470
It should be smaller than that.

25
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:53,360
How we need to fix that is we actually need to target the image that is a child of our class and we

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,380
need to explicitly set the width and height.

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:05,570
So right below this, we're just going to type app dash, store dash, BTN and then space and then IMG.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,240
So this is going to target the image that is a child of our App Store button.

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,330
Then we can simply copy the width and height and paste it in there.

30
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,090
So if we save that now and check it out.

31
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,400
We can see that that is now the right size.

32
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,480
Awesome.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,420
So now we'll do the same thing with our Google Play badge as well.

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,370
So we'll jump back to Figma.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,500
Click on our Google Play badge.

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,450
Copy this CSS here.

37
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,490
Jump back to the code.

38
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,830
And target our Google dash play dash BTN curly bracket.

39
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,720
Paste that in there and we'll fix the formatting.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:59,860
Then below that, we will type out the same class followed by IMG to target that image element and then

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,940
we will copy in the width and height as well.

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,650
So let's save that.

43
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,390
Okay, so that's working a lot better, but we can see that our main image is still way too big, so

44
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,440
we'll need to fix that.

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,790
Next, we'll need to jump back to Figma to grab the styling.

46
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,700
We're going to click on our main image layer.

47
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,540
To copy our CSIS.

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:36,770
So we'll need to attach this to our main dash image dash container and we'll paste that in there.

49
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,870
Fix the formatting.

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,270
Save it.

51
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,470
Check it out.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,890
Okay.

53
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,050
So a couple of things are happening here.

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:55,020
First, we can see that our other images have decided to move their way up, which is not ideal, and

55
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,290
our main image is also the wrong height.

56
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,420
So we'll need to fix that as well.

57
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:08,340
So if we jump back to Figma, expand our main layer and click on our iPhone, we can see that it has

58
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,450
a smaller height than our parent container does.

59
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,680
So we will copy that height and back in our code.

60
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:24,810
We'll do a similar thing as before and we'll target the main image container, specifically the image

61
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,090
element of that main image container.

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,630
Then paste in our new height of 411.15 pixels.

63
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,140
Let's save that.

64
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,060
Check it out.

65
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,760
Okay.

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,640
So our main image now is looking much better.

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,080
It's the right size.

68
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,060
You can see that it's a lot sharper now that it's smaller compared to these bigger ones.

69
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,100
So that proves my point there.

70
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,330
Now we're going to need to style the rest of our images.

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,940
So I'm going to just fast forward through copying and pasting over the styling from each of these and

72
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,040
then we'll check it out after that.

73
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,780
Okay.

74
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,110
So now we're ready to save and check it out.

75
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,330
So the first part of that looks a lot better than before.

76
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,820
And if we scroll down, we can definitely see that there are some issues.

77
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,370
So the first issue is that our bottom two assets are bigger than they should be.

78
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:30,350
So this is because we're only showing half of the image, but we have the same height that we do for

79
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,190
the others.

80
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,880
The solution to this will be to try to cut the height in half of these two assets.

81
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,410
But I've kind of forgotten which is which.

82
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:48,260
Let's go back to our figma and if we hover over it, so we're concerned with the product one as well

83
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,160
as the cart one back in the code.

84
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Then for our cart we'll change this to be 222 pixels.

85
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,630
So cut it in half and our product image will do the same.

86
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,090
Cut that in half to 2 to 2.

87
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,130
So let's save that.

88
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,220
Okay, so that's looking a whole lot better.

89
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,330
The next thing that I'm noticing now that I can see more clearly is that the box shadow is cut off here.

90
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,840
So you see there's a sharp line in the box.

91
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,770
Shadow doesn't fade nicely.

92
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,150
And the same thing is happening with this one as well.

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,190
So again, let's double check which ones those were.

94
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,750
So this is for our orders and our home assets.

95
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:43,230
So we can go back to the code now and we'll just increase the height to be 470 instead of 444.

96
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,450
So that was for our orders and for our home as well.

97
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,240
So change that to 470 as well and we can save that.

98
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,940
Okay, so that's looking a lot better.

99
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,210
You can see that we have our full box shadow at the bottom here.

100
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,610
That is looking way, way better.

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:09,390
Something else you may have noticed is that our gradient is not extending to the bottom of our page.

102
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,260
That is because our wrapper has a min height of only 100 viewport height, so it's only filling one

103
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,830
screen.

104
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,780
And then you can see it stops.

105
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,210
So we're going to need to adjust the height value for our wrapper.

106
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:32,010
If we jump back to Figma, we can see that if we click on our landing page layer on the right side,

107
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,990
we have a static height value of 1388 pixels.

108
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,810
We can go ahead and copy that, jump back to the code, scroll back up to the top in order to replace

109
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,860
our wrapper.

110
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,300
Min height will convert it just to height because it's a static value.

111
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,800
Then we'll paste in the value from figma save to check it out.

112
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,970
Okay.

113
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,170
So we can see that the gradient now is going all the way to the bottom.

114
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,340
So that's good.

115
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,390
But we can also see that we have a bit of a gap here on the bottom.

116
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,510
Let's see if we can make it a little bit smaller.

117
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:21,290
So I already know from my own experimentation that I can have a new value of 1379 in order to make it

118
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,610
smaller but still stretch to the very bottom of the page.

119
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,590
Okay, so that's looking better.

120
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,380
We have a nice thin gap at the bottom.

121
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,520
All right.

122
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,299
Awesome.

123
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,159
So our gradient is going all the way to the bottom.

124
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,100
Our assets are all the right side.

125
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,559
They're all in the right position.

126
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:47,420
If we jump back and compare what we had in Figma that our designer gave us and what we have now in our

127
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,860
page, and we can see that it looks very similar.

128
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,880
The only difference is we're actually scrolling to get to the bottom, but other than that, everything

129
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,690
is lined up exactly as it is in Figma.

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,770
All right.

131
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,410
So that's it for our developer from designer hand off.

132
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,320
In the next video, I'm going to show you how you can have toggles in the top right to allow users to

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,360
be able to change the background.

134
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,750
I'll see you in that one.

135
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,940
Bye for now.
