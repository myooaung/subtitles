00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,750
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,440
So we're going to be continuing this basics of typography portion here.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,410
And the next type of category we have here for typefaces is display typefaces.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,810
Now, you may have heard that before.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,770
You may be wondering, wow, this is a typeface like how do I even use something like this?

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,270
Let's get into that.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,170
Now, this includes typefaces like lobster or Abril.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,380
Now this category is the broadest and includes the most variation, as you can see over here.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,800
The most consistent characteristic, though, is that they're generally unsuitable for body copy, and

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,640
it's best that we kind of keep these for things like headlines, larger text, maybe even shorter copy

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,760
for a little brief.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,880
Definitely use us if you need to draw attention to something.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,090
So this is lobster.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,940
This is a really, really nice one.

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,090
I like it a lot.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,470
And you can definitely see this being used in like a website or a marketing website or something like

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,980
that.

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,760
Same with something like maybe this one over here, I can see something like this.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,740
This is I think this is a Braille right here.

20
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:11,030
And one great thing about this typeface is even though it is a serif, it definitely has that contrast.

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,930
That is just like very, very pronounced here, kind of like a throwback to a Disney or modern serif

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,860
typeface.

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:26,840
You may look at these display typefaces and think, Well, Sarah, for us and Serif and in reality you're

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,500
definitely right.

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,900
Like I mentioned before, they do have serifs, but technically it would still be categorized as a display

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,240
typeface because you wouldn't use it as body copy.

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,930
And in this example, you may be thinking, Well, how do I use it?

28
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,310
Now, this pulled from dribble and this is by Isaiah Arafat.

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,630
And they do a great job contrasting typefaces here on the Web.

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,130
Let's take a look over here.

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:56,150
Now, the display typeface here is very elegant and there is some extreme contrast between that thick

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,740
and thin line.

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,750
You'll notice you could try to use this as body copy, but it would be really, really hard to read.

34
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,940
I guarantee that display typefaces have their use and this is a great example of that.

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,870
So you'll see over here use as a headline like the main hero copy for this kind of landing page and

36
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,320
you'll see over here just as a title.

37
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,960
Now, I couldn't imagine using this pretty consistently to typeset like all this copy.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,170
It would just be really hard to read, like I mentioned before.

39
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,730
But this is still a great example of how you could utilize that even for the web.

40
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,380
And the last category I have is called mono space.

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,810
Now you may be thinking, what is mono space?

42
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,400
These kind of look like sans serif.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,450
And you know, they are variants of censor for serif types of fonts.

44
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:51,710
Now, Roboto mono space is one example of amount of space typeface, and these are fixed pitch or fixed

45
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,020
width or non proportional fonts.

46
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,930
It's letters and characters each occupy.

47
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,610
You'll notice that over here, each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,830
Narrower characters simply get a bit more spacing around them to make up for that difference.

49
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,330
So you'll see like a narrow character like the N but or like a T.

50
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,310
I don't have a T over here, but these are pretty similar and you'll see they still have the same width

51
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,630
right across horizontally.

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,710
You'll notice that they all take up the same amount of space regardless of their letter.

53
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,560
These are best used for areas where you want to evoke some sort of technical feeling.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,220
Now let's take this, for example.

55
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,950
Now this is just a simple feature within GitHub where people can collaborate over code reviews.

56
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,040
So there are some code here and people are just chatting about it.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,170
We got some reactions to that.

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,430
Pretty cool.

59
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:46,700
Now, mono space fonts have widely been used for coding because of the higher importance of reading

60
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,410
the individual characters.

61
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,290
Mono space typefaces are used for programming because they are widely believed to be better due to the

62
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,650
common treatment of skinny letters and punctuation and alignment.

63
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,700
You'll notice that right here in the code that they're reviewing, it's very, very easy to read.

64
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,760
Now, if we were to compare that with something like this, when I'm trying to look at each individual

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,420
letter where one letter left out could mean the difference between a code that works and code that doesn't.

66
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,600
It's very important that I have a very legible typeface or a mono space typeface, which would allow

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,780
me to actually read that in a much more clearer way.

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,470
It's a very, very functional typeface and like I said, mostly used by programmers.

69
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,400
And within that kind of realm, there are definitely other use cases for it.
