00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.910
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:08.990
So we learned how to make images much more dynamic and sometimes they don't necessarily fit like that.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.010
And you may want to like overlay text over imagery like we have over here.

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.220
Certain ways we can actually do that and provide better contrast and make this much more of a successful

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.150
composition.

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.550
So like I said, we'll run into scenario where we need to place text over imagery.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.820
A lot of times there's some issues with this particular scenario because of the lack of contrast.

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.080
So let's zoom in here.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.110
Now in this image, there's enough contrast here between the white text and the darker background.

10
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.870
But if we look at this portrait over here, this man, there is just not enough contrast.

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.290
And if we look and we zoom right in, we notice that we start losing things like the E, the edge of

12
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.000
the D over here in the end.

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.320
So there are ways we can kind of combat that and just make our composition much more better and much

14
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.130
more legible.

15
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.220
One of the ways we can actually do that is with gradients.

16
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.130
So let's copy this composition.

17
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.840
So just remember, you can use the file that we have for you, and you can come along for this ride.

18
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.850
So I'm going to select this image.

19
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.330
This is a perfect example.

20
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.730
And over here, like we did prior, I'm going to add an actual gradient to the image.

21
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.630
You can do it other ways.

22
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.970
You can actually add a rectangle with a gradient, but we can do this as well.

23
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.500
So here we go.

24
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.120
We're going to switch those around.

25
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.890
And now for the gradient, we'll just use like a darker color.

26
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.960
Like a black.

27
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.490
And we'll transition to a black, but there will be a zero opacity, so we'll be able to actually see

28
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.699
the men so we can do something like this, which is totally fine, and we can read the text properly,

29
00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.230
but we start to lose.

30
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.580
What makes this image so good?

31
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.430
Like the contrast of colors, we start to lose that with gradients.

32
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.130
So what we can do is there's a couple of things we can do here.

33
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.540
We can actually.

34
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.800
Decrease the opacity because you don't necessarily need that much.

35
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.170
So you can decrease it.

36
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.800
And that would be enough for you to actually read that.

37
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.630
We could do the same over here.

38
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.500
Actually, this one has a little bit more happening around this image.

39
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.070
You see a lot of the foliage, there's a lot more textures, which makes it a little bit more harder

40
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.960
to read when there's much more activity.

41
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.950
If you look at here, there's not much activity.

42
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.970
There's a lot of darkness behind the text.

43
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.230
Let's do that over here.

44
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.090
So the same concept this time, instead of flipping it around, we're just going to.

45
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.500
Do that.

46
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.180
And then perfect.

47
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.930
So we can start doing this.

48
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.060
So there's consistency.

49
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.720
So we have the same colour, we have the block that's going right through.

50
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.250
Now this is another issue.

51
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.650
So like I said before, when you are applying like color or like a gradient on your photography in order

52
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.600
to allow for enough contrast between text, you run into the issue where sometimes you lose like what

53
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.550
makes that photograph or that image really great, the colors, details.

54
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.700
So what we can do is we can remove this one.

55
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.570
We're going to delete that.

56
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.410
There we go.

57
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.540
And we can bring this down and we can kind of like keep it just.

58
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.970
To the bottom.

59
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.350
So it's kind of cropped and we still get that gradual darkness to lightness and we can easily read this

60
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.720
in comparison to what it was before.

61
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.250
So let's take a look at what we had before over here.

62
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.660
We can easily read that.

63
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.830
Let's just remove that.

64
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.860
And over here it's a little bit harder.

65
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.200
So gradients are one way that you can make text over imagery work.

66
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.120
If there's a brand color you want to work with, you can display that as well within your gradient.

67
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.510
So if it's something like a navy or like a teal.

68
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.850
Like you can do something like that.

69
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.940
So it isn't just like a pure black.

70
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.430
There's a little bit more color.

71
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.890
You still get great results.

72
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.020
So that's something else you can do.

73
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.100
Another thing you can do is let's just copy that and we're going to option shift and we're going to

74
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.130
just drag that to the other side of our frame.

75
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.640
Another thing you can do to create enough contrast in these situations is use a solid color.

76
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.840
This can be done in a variety of ways.

77
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.270
One way I like doing it is you can select the image like before.

78
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.430
Add a fill on top.

79
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.180
And instead of a linear gradient, we're just going to go with a solid fill.

80
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.860
We're not going to do that.

81
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.060
But like I said before, if we can just grab a color like that, which is like a dark green forest like

82
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.990
color, maybe not suitable for that image, but if we grab something like that and then we start decreasing

83
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.160
the opacity.

84
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.830
You can do something like this.

85
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.860
And, you know, it may not suit the style or the tone of the brand, and that's totally fine.

86
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.790
You've got to find out what works for you, what works for your client, and apply that visual style

87
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.450
so you could do something like this.

88
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.810
Well, it can be a little darker and decrease the opacity.

89
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.280
And there you go.

90
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.740
You get a little more visual contrast that way.

91
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.910
Now, what I like to do, and this really depends on your imagery and how the composition works.

92
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.580
So it may not work on this one, but I'm going to show you what it looks like.

93
00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:00.000
So what I like to do is I like to grab a rectangle, so I'll select my rectangle with our grab it there.

94
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.950
Just drag it across your image like that.

95
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.680
And to click the image shift.

96
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.630
Click the rectangle.

97
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.770
Hold shift.

98
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.980
Click the image.

99
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.450
Right.

100
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.460
Click and send that to the back.

101
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.190
You can also shift command.

102
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.390
Open bracket.

103
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.150
So now we have that.

104
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.210
Now that doesn't look too good, but we can do something really subtle.

105
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:37.800
So I like usually doing like a grey or a dark black and then decreasing the opacity just a bit.

106
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.040
So we're like 25% opacity.

107
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.940
It's very interesting in terms of like the actual composition now.

108
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.560
Like it's a little bit more dynamic.

109
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.840
It's much more readable, legible.

110
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.090
And the only thing I would recommend is in this scenario to be consistent.

111
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.100
So if you're going to apply this to one image.

112
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.160
You should apply it to every other image.

113
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.470
So let me bring out to the front shift.

114
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.740
Click with that background image and send that right to the back.

115
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.340
The sizes could vary depending on the size of your typography that you have here.

116
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.460
But this is another way to do it.

117
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.480
So I'm going to shift click, bring that over.

118
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.060
And like I said before.

119
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:31.950
You know, it may not work with an image like this where the focal point is right in the foreground,

120
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.170
right in the middle, and it may cover that.

121
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.230
And that's unfortunate.

122
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.820
So, like I said before, figuring out what works for you.

123
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.370
There isn't like a right and wrong.

124
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:51.120
But this doesn't necessarily look as good as having maybe like a gradient, a gradient, maybe like

125
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.790
a better application for these for these images because it's much more softer.

126
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.860
You can apply some color there, and it's not a harsh line that's going right through like a person's

127
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.580
face.

128
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.310
But similarly to what we saw with the gradients, we can actually pick a color out a brand color and

129
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.210
work with that.

130
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.910
And.

131
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.290
That just reinforces your brand identity, reinforces your color palette.

132
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.690
We can do the same with this.

133
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.240
So I'm just going to grab like a color like that.

134
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:24.980
And there you go.

135
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.010
They look a little less static with the black blacks.

136
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.600
Kind of harsh.

137
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.910
Even grays are kind of harsh.

138
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.390
So you can reinforce your your brand's identity, your brand's tone, just with adding some colors.

139
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:42.470
And it's a really subtle way of actually making sure that your typography is legible while a person

140
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.630
is reading it through these images.

141
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.580
So that's it for this.

142
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.010
And we're going to move on to illustrations next.
