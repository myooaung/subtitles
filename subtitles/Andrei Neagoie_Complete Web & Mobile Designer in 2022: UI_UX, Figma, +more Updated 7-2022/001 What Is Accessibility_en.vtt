Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.140
We're going to be talking about something that I'm pretty passionate about and that is accessibility.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.130
Now, we live in an incredibly diverse world, full of so many types of users, and we can assume that

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.450
all users are going to experience our products in the same way.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.350
And here comes accessibility.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.450
And simply that is why it's so important.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.620
If one person can actually use your designs or your product, you really have failed them.

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.940
An accessible product is one where all your users can actually enjoy it.

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.190
Unfortunately, when we design products, we always design for the majority of users in mind, which

10
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.130
are users who do not experience any difficulty when using any type of product.

11
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.010
In most cases, there is very little insight into designing individual components that will work for

12
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.030
every user.

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.720
Nobody ever thinks about the user who has function only in one hand or a user who has trouble with hearing.

14
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.630
Or a user who has visual impairments.

15
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.680
Accessible design aids in creating a better experience for everyone.

16
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.780
It could be for somebody who has a permanent disability or maybe a temporary disability and even a situational

17
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.130
impairment.

18
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.070
Contrary to popular belief that accessible design is sacrificing the visual quality of your product.

19
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.000
It does, in fact make it better for every single user.

20
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.700
Let's take a moment to think about our world.

21
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.160
Think about ramps or sloped kerbs.

22
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.050
Now, they've been designed for helping those in wheelchairs get around.

23
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.670
This isn't the only use, though.

24
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.750
Think about everywhere.

25
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.560
You have seen a ramp to curb parents with strollers, people making deliveries with trolleys, people

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.790
bike riding.

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.000
I mean, it just makes our life that much easier.

28
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.250
What about push to open buttons?

29
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.930
They're installed in most stores, in most places to aid people in wheelchairs.

30
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.810
And if you're to think if they weren't installed in a place or an establishment, you'd think that that

31
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.980
would be pretty odd.

32
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.979
They help all of us when you have too many bags to carry or a child that can't really muster the strength

33
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.080
to open the door by themselves.

34
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.440
Also, sometimes it's just easier to use one.

35
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.820
We shouldn't have the mindset that accessibility is a checklist or a set of requirements, but it should

36
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.550
be ingrained in how we design.

37
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.780
We should be designing for all people.

38
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.170
Next, I'm going to talk about some assistive technologies.
