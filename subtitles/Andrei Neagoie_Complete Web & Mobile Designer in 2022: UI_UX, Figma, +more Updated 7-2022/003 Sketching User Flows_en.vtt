00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.350
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.470
We're going to be sketching some photos.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.960
You can sell them on a tablet here because I just want to demonstrate how we can sketch those flows

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.130
without using paper.

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.700
A lot of people like to use tablets and I'm using an application called Concepts.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.170
It's a free application.

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.450
You can pay for some additional features, but I'm not paying right now and I can just like draw.

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.730
I can export this as a jpeg and send it to myself if I need it.

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.710
And that's all we really need for sketching.

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.420
So I totally recommend, if you want to go the digital route, you can even do it in Figma.

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.680
And yeah, so I mean, you can just grab your pen, you can even change the size of it.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.660
If you want to get a little bit more thick there, if you double tap with two fingers, you'll just

13
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.190
go back.

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.270
This is your eraser.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.390
So for the sake of this video, I'm going to keep it pretty.

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.920
I think that's good.

17
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.220
Also, you can select different types of pens.

18
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.520
So what we'll do is.

19
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.770
Right now we're using a regular pen.

20
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.990
There's the fixed with pen.

21
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.710
That's something that I rather use just for actually drawing the wireframes.

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.550
So let's bring that down.

23
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.550
I think that's a little too thick.

24
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.990
Okay.

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.720
Perfect.

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.000
Now we're ready to go here.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.440
We're going to be focusing on a user's experience through certain journeys, both big and small.

28
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.090
Before we even jump into those types of journeys, I just want to give you a little understanding of

29
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.840
what I'm asking myself every time I approach something like this.

30
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.410
Step one I want to understand what I need to draw.

31
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.280
So I've got to figure out exactly what I'm thinking of sketching.

32
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.450
Do I want to sketch a large journey, or am I thinking about a small interaction?

33
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.470
Step two is defining some sort of starting point.

34
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.400
You can start at the beginning of a journey or in the middle or at the end you choose what you think

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.150
is best.

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.100
Typically, I like to start thinking about the most difficult or riskiest parts of the product first.

37
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.870
Some people actually like to start at the end and work their way backwards to figure out how users get

38
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.860
to a certain point.

39
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.770
Like I said, it's whatever works for you.

40
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.130
Step three to decide your next steps after you define that first starting point within your flow.

41
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.210
You need to know where to go.

42
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.890
Well, that is up to you, and you need to ask yourself some important questions.

43
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.480
Which way this step lead our users?

44
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.550
Where do you want them to go?

45
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.610
What does the user need to do to get there?

46
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.150
In the end, when I'm thinking about alternate scenarios or alternate flows that I'm trying to sketch,

47
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.510
I think about all the different questions in terms of alternative ways that a person can go through

48
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.470
a certain route.

49
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.600
So what options do they have?

50
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.690
What happens if the user closes the app at this point?

51
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.080
Where will they resume?

52
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.220
So these are the types of questions I'm always asking myself.

53
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.550
Every time I approach a sketch.

54
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.360
So let's start with our very first sketch.

55
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.300
We're going to talk about mapping overall flow.

56
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.760
Think about a user's journey through the product.

57
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.460
That's like from point A all the way to point B, we want to understand when they come in and when they

58
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.950
leave and what that experience is like.

59
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.440
It's like creating some sort of customer journey.

60
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.810
And here we can really outline different types of pain points when they're feeling happy through this

61
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.800
journey, when they're feeling sad and pick out different types of opportunities where we can really

62
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.680
improve that experience for them and also understand where exactly we can branch out and focus on different

63
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.580
types of flows.

64
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.150
Let's start sketching a general journey.

65
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.050
It doesn't need to be neat.

66
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.070
It needs to be just a little like you need to be able to understand it.

67
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.620
We're going to start sketching a flow here.

68
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.390
The first one I'm thinking about is mapping the overall journey for our client habitual.

69
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.780
So if I think about step one, I'm just going to put one.

70
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.010
I'm going to draw a frame.

71
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.620
And we're not really focusing on UI elements here or anything like that.

72
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.250
I just want to think about what the user is possibly seeing, what screens they may be they possibly

73
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.580
are going to, and what they're expecting.

74
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.750
So when they come to our application, they may see a welcome screen.

75
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.149
And like some sort of button.

76
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.709
Maybe it's an onboarding process.

77
00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.370
We can figure that out later, but now we've kind of established that.

78
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.110
Step two.

79
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.620
Let's create another frame.

80
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.640
Maybe the user when they come here, they're thinking about searching right away.

81
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.200
They want to find a product.

82
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.030
That's why they would use something like habitual.

83
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.670
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just draw like maybe a home screen that looks like a cube.

84
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.830
This just still looks like cube.

85
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.550
That's fine.

86
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.030
We're going to just draw some boxes.

87
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.020
Okay.

88
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.880
So they come to this home screen and what they're going to do is they're going to search for a product.

89
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.730
And the next step is that they're going to actually find that product.

90
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.170
So they find their product and they go and research those details.

91
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.490
And from here, after they've done that, they're interested in actually purchasing it.

92
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.570
Right now, you'll notice that this is a very happy flow.

93
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.070
This is what we really want our users to do every single time they come into our product.

94
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.400
And that's not always the case.

95
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.880
So they'll probably see a cart with a little X, maybe there's a checkout button.

96
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.640
There are details of whatever they're purchasing or whatever product they want to buy.

97
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.710
And if we move that over.

98
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.170
Okay.

99
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.760
Little messy, but that's okay.

100
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.570
I mean, we're getting a general sense of what this journey is looking like and they get some sort of

101
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.790
confirmation that the package has shipped that you bought it and it's right out the door.

102
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.060
And then I don't think the journey really ends there.

103
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.490
We need to think about what happens after it's shipped.

104
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.330
In this scenario, it's delivered and the user is happy.

105
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.000
So this is what our whole flow starts to look like.

106
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.000
User comes in and is welcomed by us.

107
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.480
They search for a product.

108
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.480
They find that product and review it.

109
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.150
Add it to their cart and check it out.

110
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.160
The package ships and it is delivered to them and everyone is happy.

111
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.530
Now, that always doesn't happen.

112
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.900
And this is where I'm asking myself, well, we asked ourself the question of what the goal was.

113
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.800
The goal was to sketch the whole journey.

114
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.710
We thought about what steps come next, but we didn't really think of alternate scenarios.

115
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.950
So what happens if like they can't find their product?

116
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.630
There's a scenario there.

117
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.930
If they can't find their product, maybe they have to go through some category searches, so they start

118
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.850
searching based off of categories.

119
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.380
Or they start maybe reading reviews.

120
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.720
There's different things that we need to always take into account.

121
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.710
Not very rarely.

122
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.440
And this is an assumption and we always try to validate our assumption.

123
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.110
But my assumption is that very rarely that everyone goes to the same exact flow, maybe they want to

124
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.950
read reviews.

125
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:19.190
So we're starting to think about all the different types of scenarios that a user may experience in

126
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.940
their journey.

127
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.180
You know, maybe over here they're happy so we can give them a good onboarding.

128
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.020
Experience.

129
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.860
And over here, when they're searching, you know, maybe they're a little confused and maybe this is

130
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.480
a great way to implement a really easy search experience that makes them happy.

131
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.590
Oops.

132
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.900
So maybe we can really capitalize on that opportunity when you really need to think about who our users

133
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.890
are and what they really want to experience when they're moving through our app.

134
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.060
So that's how you map an overall flow using sketching.

135
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.610
And if you wanted to, like I said before, you can just export this, bring it into figma, clean it

136
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.220
up a bit and start thinking about it there if you want to.

137
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.280
But that's how you map an overall flow.
