00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.630
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:09.130
So before we talk about just motion in general and how important it is in the design process, but I

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.620
really want to talk about like how to make purposeful animations, how to make motion in general, purposeful

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.730
in your design.

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.610
And what I've done here is I've created this really cool little prototype in terms of it's like a photo

6
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.340
exploration application.

7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.690
It's going to help us figure out different types of ways we can make motion much more purposeful in

8
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.640
our designs.

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.720
What I'm going to do is I'm going to actually launch this in prototype.

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.130
I have it here, so I'm just going to press play.

11
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.140
It's going to bring me over here and this is what we're going to kind of play today just for now.

12
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.440
And I'm going to show you some more advanced stuff in a second.

13
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.600
But what I really want to talk about is when we use like motion in a subtle way, it helps build like

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.380
these mental models about how our system works and how users can interact with it instead of creating

15
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.730
like animations or things like that for the purpose of just delight.

16
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.050
Don't worry, that's okay too.

17
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.290
Like a confetti pop when something really good happens.

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.990
Instead we can use these animations or just motion in general for usability.

19
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.470
Think of clues for what is happening within your product, or maybe signifiers for how certain UI elements

20
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.400
will behave.

21
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.500
Now the first thing I really want to talk about is state transitions.

22
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.590
Now, this is huge within design, and especially like when we're moving across a mobile app or just

23
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.930
a web app in terms of different transitions between screens, state changes in your user interface can

24
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.880
involve really hard cuts.

25
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.590
I mean, that's a change from one screen to another without any transition whatsoever.

26
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.600
And that's kind of like a big no no.

27
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.220
Now this makes things really difficult to follow.

28
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.370
So think about it.

29
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.790
If you open a door, you start to push the door open.

30
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.020
And when you're in a new room, the same rules apply to digital products.

31
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.490
So, I mean, you open the door slowly and you can see you're going into a new room.

32
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.650
Can you imagine if you just like tap the door and you're like immediately in the room that you want

33
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.070
it to be in?

34
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.259
It'd be kind of weird and disorienting.

35
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.980
So let's take a look at this example.

36
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.810
When something has two or more states, it's easier for users to understand if things are animated rather

37
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.520
than like instantaneous.

38
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.970
If I were to click just like nature over here, you can see like the hot spots.

39
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.520
If I click that, I can see like it's a very gradual change even with the navigation moving right to

40
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.910
left.

41
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.290
And this is all built in figma.

42
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.550
I want to stress that because Figma is awesome and I can also see the images.

43
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.510
Let's do it again.

44
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.130
Architecture is clickable.

45
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.360
It makes that really, really smooth.

46
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.070
How about if we click an image?

47
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.420
So we have one over here.

48
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.500
Look, I know as a user, if I'm clicking an image, I'm going gradually into a new detail screen.

49
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.580
I can easily kind of come back out of that.

50
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.910
So let's click that again so I can see what's clickable here.

51
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.700
And there you go.

52
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.620
I'm back to my home page, and that's just me creating a simple animation in Figma and that motion really

53
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.990
helps smooth that state transition.

54
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.900
The next thing I like to think about is visual feedback.

55
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.870
So users really want to know their current context within a system at any given time, and you shouldn't

56
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.010
really keep them guessing.

57
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.790
So that could mean like the visual feedback of it being an active like element within your navigation

58
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.600
over here.

59
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.410
That's good feedback.

60
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.570
That's one way to do it.

61
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.490
Using just animation or just motion to tell the user what is happening with feedback really makes the

62
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.390
user feel like they're interacting with the visual elements on the screen.

63
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.400
Pressing buttons is like one way to do it.

64
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.460
Let's use the example of pressing like a like button over here.

65
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.270
So I have feedback over here that that's been pressed.

66
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.600
And it's just a gradual motion and there's some more feedback at the bottom.

67
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.810
So that's one way or a couple of ways that you can actually just showcase visual feedback or just easily

68
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.550
giving feedback to your users.

69
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.459
If something were to happen where like you click something and a feedback shows somewhere else, that's

70
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.899
just jarring.

71
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.280
Buttons, like I said, are a great way to show different types of visual feedback when there's some

72
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.960
sort of interaction happening.

73
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.150
And we'll get into that a little deeper later.

74
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.290
Now, the last thing I really like to talk about is visual cues.

75
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.510
So when your user starts using a product, it may be unclear for them on how to do something or where

76
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.110
to look.

77
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.190
That's totally normal.

78
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.230
I mean, if your products in you and the user has and used it before or users in general haven't used

79
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.940
it before, that's going to happen.

80
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.270
It's just about making that experience as delightful and just easy to use as possible.

81
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.310
So animation, I feel, can really help guide user's attention in certain areas.

82
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.520
It really directs their focus to the right spot at the right time.

83
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.180
So this is especially true in like onboarding features.

84
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.630
You can think about like when a user first comes to an app, let's just jump back here.

85
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.540
When you use a first comes to an app, everything could be great.

86
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:20.180
Oh, and this area can be like highlighted just to showcase that, hey, this is our navigation and

87
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.550
then it can switch gradually to something else.

88
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.140
And just showcasing features like that, not necessarily like a swiping onboarding, but this is more

89
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.470
like an onboarding for learning how to use an app.

90
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.770
Another thing is like when we actually interact with elements, think about like carts, think about

91
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.960
like little notifications.

92
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.800
Sometimes they aren't as prominent as we like them to be and users may not necessarily know where to

93
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.190
go.

94
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.020
So let's look through another example.

95
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.350
So I'm over here and we see this nice little click and then there's a feedback and there's should be

96
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.370
like a little animation right there that we've created once again within Figma.

97
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.880
So we have a little kind of notification bouncing over and over again in my little navigation at the

98
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.540
bottom.

99
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.680
So this little ball notification kind of ball or ping wherever you want to call it, it's not obtrusive.

100
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.390
It's just kind of in the corner.

101
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:21.710
It's very subtle, but there is some movement there that should redirect the user's attention to something

102
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.760
you want them to click.

103
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.000
Now, it may not be this, but I can see it really being used for like a car or for our application.

104
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.760
So we may go ahead and do something like that in the future.

105
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.420
So that's one way to like have a visual cue.

106
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:43.640
And those are different ways you can use animations and motion in your product to just make your product

107
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:50.150
a much better experience for users and make your motion and animations much more purposeful.

108
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.770
See, like everything that's been incorporated within this little app that we've built.

109
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.170
This little prototype.

110
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:05.100
Everything is very useful if we didn't have these different types of animations and I'll show you what

111
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.940
it will look like.

112
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.860
So if we just go to our prototype.

113
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.520
And over here I have a thing called smart animate.

114
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.540
Now, if it was just instant, let's take a look at what that could look like.

115
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.690
Like, that's just really jarring right off the bat.

116
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.500
And.

117
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.300
That's nice, that's jarring.

118
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.930
So just subtle things like that really improve a user's experience and this type of thing should really

119
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.930
be thought about way ahead of time.

120
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.530
Don't leave this to the end because by that time it may be too late.

121
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.850
So think about ways to incorporate motion.

122
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.240
Think about like state transitions.

123
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.720
Think about visual cues, think about visual feedback.

124
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.050
That's going to make your app so much more better, and I guarantee it'll have people talking.

125
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.010
So that's it for creating purposeful animations.
