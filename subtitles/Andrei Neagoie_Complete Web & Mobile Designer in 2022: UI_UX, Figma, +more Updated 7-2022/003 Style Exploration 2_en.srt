1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,510
Everyone.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,230
And welcome back.

3
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,000
So I know I kind of went on a little bit of a rant earlier about design fidelity, but I just really

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,310
wanted to stress that, you know, don't jump into visual design exploration too early.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,220
This is an iterative process.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,860
I mean, we are not going to create something perfect right off the bat and we're going to gradually

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,940
build our way up.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,970
You shouldn't necessarily just jump right into it.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:31,920
So what we've did in the last video, we talked about navigation and we were exploring that a bit and

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,490
you could see we started to create some hierarchy within here just with colors.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,160
I kind of already like the way we're starting to use color.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,140
You know, this yellow has more of an accent and, you know, keeping things a little monochromatic.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,360
Let's see how that may change.

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,970
I also need to start thinking about things like just typographic hierarchy.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,740
So let's jump right in and do that.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,750
So I have a grid on here.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,690
I've just kind of created my own.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,739
Let's go back and I'll just show you that so that I have a mobile style here of a grid, which is really

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,550
helpful.

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,570
That's just a standard, a column grid, and I'll show you what it looks like.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,970
So it's just really standard 16 pixel gutter and a margin of 24 pixels.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,860
Just something to think about.

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,740
This is what I'm using.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,150
You don't have to use that, but let's jump right in.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,710
So I'm going to start typing some stuff that we can actually use.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,010
So, you know, maybe we don't use this hello like line in terms of like the person's name, maybe it's

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,080
something else.

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,450
Like I said, it's all about visual exploration at this point.

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,180
We are building that fidelity.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,090
So I have some headings here that that are styles that are really, really helpful.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,330
I want to stress the idea of reusability.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:00,310
Just because, you know, reinventing the wheel over and over again is so pedantic.

33
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,900
We want to reduce the amount of time we have to do that.

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,910
So, you know, create styles.

35
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,260
Even if they are finalized, these typographic styles aren't finalized by any means.

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,270
I think I still need to tweak them a bit and you will need to as well.

37
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,160
Even with colors, I'm not settled on this palette and I'm pretty sure by the time we are at the end

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,480
of this course, it's going to probably look entirely different or I mean, there will be some slight

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,850
variations and that's just the way design is.

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:37,660
So don't get too held up on those little details because things will change.

41
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,820
It's just the nature of our craft.

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,340
I mean, we learn, we build, we keep on learning and we keep on rebuilding.

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,910
So don't get married to anything too early.

44
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,840
What do I have here?

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,490
So I have some nice colors.

46
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,710
We can start actually applying colors to our typographic elements.

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,780
I'm going to just switch off this.

48
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,700
Grid, which I'm using control g to do that.

49
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,280
So next thing I want to just think about is this let's just drag this in here.

50
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,630
So I want to create something.

51
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,010
I want to work on a card.

52
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:23,740
And it's going to give us an idea of just general like typographic hierarchy over here, how to display

53
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,430
imagery, also maybe some use of iconography.

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,600
First thing I want to do is let me just set some sort of baseline for how large I want this to be.

55
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,400
So what I'm going to do is control G.

56
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,420
And I want these cards to kind of just.

57
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,340
I want the next car to kind of fall off the edge.

58
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,910
Kind of like our little wireframe here.

59
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,290
But I'm making this card much more longer because I want the first image they see to be something that

60
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,150
is really, really relevant to what they want.

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,730
So it could be like if they're into gaming, it could be like a new controller or something like that.

62
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,670
Let's actually just jump in and grab an image.

63
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,910
So I'm just going to grab an image just to get started.

64
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,000
So let's just type in controller.

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,570
Perfect.

66
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,380
So we have a bunch of different things here.

67
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,170
Let's look for something that looks more like a product shot.

68
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,550
It's a little too dark.

69
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,770
What do we have here?

70
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,250
So I'm just looking for just product shots.

71
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,050
I think I selected two images accidentally, but we'll see what they are.

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,360
So let's delete that one.

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,780
Let's resize this one.

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,280
Bring it closer.

75
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,180
So there we go.

76
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,960
We have one.

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,240
And we're going to actually remove the background on one of these.

78
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,120
So remember what I said about just like visual exploration a while back.

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,560
When you're using images, you don't need to just necessarily plop them in there.

80
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,570
You know, you can you can do different things like removing backgrounds, adding different types of

81
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,950
gradients to the background.

82
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,740
So we have something interesting to play with and I'm just going to keep this here for now.

83
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,860
I mean, I'm not going to touch it.

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm actually just going to jump right into typography.

85
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,070
So I'm going to take this.

86
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,680
Resize it.

87
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,080
I don't want it to pass the width of this card and I'm going to do is I'm just going to put a price

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,680
tag.

89
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,880
So 65, 99 is the price tag.

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,150
And actually we can make sure that that's just the width and we can start thinking about just hierarchy

91
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,510
here.

92
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:46,270
So I have 16 pixels, let's just like that 16 pixels and bold or we can even jump all the way up to

93
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,740
20 pixels and bold.

94
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,280
So like we have just like the item amount.

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,020
And I think that's pretty crucial.

96
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm not sure exactly.

97
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,750
It's like right here I have the product name and the amount below, but you know, maybe it's we can

98
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,660
just explore with having that up there.

99
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,710
What about if there's like a sale?

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,190
So I think I actually have a style for that.

101
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,410
Let's see.

102
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,080
Yeah, I do.

103
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,860
Perfect.

104
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,510
So I have a style for that.

105
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,700
And if there's a sale, what we're going to do is we are going to have something right beside it.

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,700
Maybe it's like 79, 99, and we are just going to make that a little less obvious.

107
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,300
So we're building a hierarchy not only through color.

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,260
We are also doing it just through size and typography as well.

109
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,990
So that's much more prominent.

110
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,900
And there you go.

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,330
These are spaced.

112
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,880
We can space them out eight pixels.

113
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,400
Oops.

114
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,220
Perfect.

115
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,170
So that looks pretty good.

116
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,070
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to duplicate that and let's think about the product name.

117
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,020
So this is an Xbox One controller.

118
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,590
And I want to create some hierarchy between the image, I mean, sorry, the product name and the actual

119
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,430
product price.

120
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,690
So remember we talked about typography and creating that hierarchy.

121
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,980
We can just bring it down a bit if we wanted to.

122
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,590
We can also just we just bring it down.

123
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,210
Let's see what options we have.

124
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,350
Like we can do something like that.

125
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:31,380
And you know, our main larger typographic element is the price.

126
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,570
So that shouldn't detract from that.

127
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,700
This is just our assumption.

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,400
It could be wrong.

129
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,410
And that's that's just totally fine.

130
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,480
Like I said, it's all about exploration.

131
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,880
So we have something great here, which we have, I think.

132
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,100
What do I have below?

133
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,270
I have some lorem ipsum.

134
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,490
Let's actually just copy paste that.

135
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:03,710
So that is there and we are just going to go like body small over here and there we go.

136
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,260
I mean, I think we can probably afford to have two lines.

137
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,160
So what I like to do is I'll just go like this.

138
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,050
Okay.

139
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,040
Just so we can start thinking about that content there, that's a little to see.

140
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,650
Like right now I'm realizing that maybe I don't have too much variation between these two colors, so

141
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,720
I may need to think about that.

142
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:37,530
And this may be really too thin, but what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create I'm going

143
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,370
to create a frame.

144
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,730
I'm starting to think right now even about just general structure, so I can just create a frame, call

145
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,350
this price and just start thinking about like auto layout as well.

146
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,260
So I have a horizontal layout.

147
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,200
And so the great thing about this is if I start to adjust this, things are going to just adjust with

148
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,900
it as you can see the price moving back and forth.

149
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,650
So that's just going to help us speed up our workflow.

150
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,780
I think we're missing something else here.

151
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,870
Like maybe we can have like a 20% off tag.

152
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,300
So actually I don't think we need this anymore right now.

153
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,250
So let's actually create another frame and I'll show you what we can do here.

154
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,660
So we're going to create a frame.

155
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:26,340
We're going to put text in this frame, and we're going to just say something like 20% off.

156
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,160
Whoops, let's go back.

157
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,700
Whoops.

158
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,990
There we go.

159
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,850
So we have 20% off.

160
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,280
Perfect.

161
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,580
I think I even have one for a pill or.

162
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,300
Yeah, there we go.

163
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,420
Perfect.

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:49,330
This is great because, you know, using maybe 16 pixels is too big, but using styles can really,

165
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,050
really help your workflow a lot.

166
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,890
So I like to start thinking about all these different types of things.

167
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,600
Earlier on.

168
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,490
And it helps me just influence what I plan to do with just general things like typographic elements

169
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,300
and color.

170
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,220
If I get those kind of nailed down a little bit earlier before I jump into this, then it makes it easier

171
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:19,390
to kind of iterate based off of just applying styles, quickly editing those styles and just generally

172
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,710
just keeping you going.

173
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,140
So we've got 100 pixels.

174
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,640
We're going to take a little pill here.

175
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,270
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make 16 pixels on the side at the top.

176
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,770
I'm going to just do zero, see.

177
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,370
So we're going to need like an eight pixel top maybe.

178
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,450
Okay.

179
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,530
So the Phil, let's think about the Phil.

180
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:51,090
We can do like a nice background like that and that can be the darker.

181
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,790
So there you go.

182
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,300
We have something nice coming along over here.

183
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,360
And I'm just actually going to throw this here.

184
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,360
Let's just make sure that's like that.

185
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,280
That's a little too small.

186
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,830
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to command C and I'm going to select inside.

187
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,760
And there you go.

188
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,960
There's our little pill, just letting us know, hey, you got 20% off.

189
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,910
This is an amazing deal.

190
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,020
And let's okay, we can keep that centered.

191
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,530
And I'm actually going to create the exact same thing over here.

192
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:37,190
I'm going to select everything and make a frame and call it card details.

193
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,560
So I'm really liking where this is going in terms of my exploration I'm going to.

194
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,840
I'm going to just create an auto layout again.

195
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,220
So you'll see that just moved over and that's fine.

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,100
I'll show you how we're going to fix that.

197
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,320
We're going to adjust this just to get it right.

198
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,260
So this is going to if we just move it, we can move it wherever we want.

199
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,880
I'm moving it all the way to the left and you'll see it change at the top as well.

200
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:14,290
So there's our kind of layout and like we do have a lot of contrast now with our typography, which

201
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,640
is really great.

202
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:22,000
Maybe this price is a little too large and we'll fix that.

203
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,780
Maybe we just know.

204
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,780
Maybe that's too small.

205
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,870
We'll leave it for now.

206
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,390
Okay, so let's think about the image.

207
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,980
I really like where we're going here.

208
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,760
You can see, like, this whole thing is starting to come together in comparison.

209
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,280
And I wouldn't have really known that if I hadn't gone through different types of explorations earlier.

210
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,770
So I want to do something interesting with the image like, Here, I'll show you what it will look like

211
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,690
if I just kind of plop it in here.

212
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,380
So we're going to plop this in here.

213
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,550
And we're just going to make it the size of that rectangle.

214
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,700
I mean, that looks pretty good.

215
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,010
Let's let's make a copy of that.

216
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,810
What about if we do something a little bit more interesting?

217
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,910
How about we do something like this?

218
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,220
Okay, so we have something and like now we can use the background any which way we want.

219
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,380
So I'm just going to rename this as image and I'm going to lock this layer for now.

220
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,310
So just you can do shift command l to lock it.

221
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,570
So I have the image in the background and like what we can do is we can do a bunch of different things,

222
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,940
like we can set that like that.

223
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,530
So you can set the radius.

224
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,810
So I mean, we have options like if we want to use like a secondary color or something like that, we

225
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,620
can.

226
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,300
So I mean, I'm kind of liking I'm taking the way this kind of looks.

227
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,270
It's very like unorthodox in the sense that we usually just see product images.

228
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,880
So this may not work and that's totally fine.

229
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,520
If I'm thinking about like development and scalability, this is probably not the route to go just because

230
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,070
you'd have to do it for every single product image.

231
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,810
So this makes sense, you know, just in terms of like we want to release something, we don't want

232
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,120
to go through all of our product images and do that.

233
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,110
Maybe this is like av2 or a version two to a version one.

234
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,110
I'm already thinking about maybe scalability issues here, but I really like the way these cards are

235
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,560
turning out.

236
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm just going to delete this one for now.

237
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,460
Actually, I don't want to delete it.

238
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,140
I just want that image there.

239
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,060
But I'm going to delete this card.

240
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,910
I'm liking the way this image is turning out.

241
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,790
I'm going to actually make this.

242
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm going to rename this to Image Background and I'm going to unlock this image and I'm going to group

243
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,120
them in a frame and I'm going to call this.

244
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,720
Product image.

245
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,610
So as you can tell, like I'm already starting to create different types of cards here.

246
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,670
I have one card built out that I really like.

247
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm not sure if I'm going to go in this direction.

248
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,410
Maybe for the other ones I'm going to start just inputting like like regular images.

249
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,010
But this is kind of what I'm thinking right now.

250
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm going to actually create another frame and I'm going to group this all together and call this a

251
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,970
large card.

252
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,590
So we're starting to already think about things like

253
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:41,140
layout and just hierarchy and color and how we plan to use that.

254
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,800
So as you can tell, that's how it will look on the screen.

255
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,750
You'll be able to swipe through that.

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,310
That's it for the larger cards.

257
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,770
In the next video, I'm going to start working on maybe a more interesting piece that can fit here,

258
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,140
maybe not deals because that could be redundant.

259
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,620
Maybe we can work on like category cards or something like in relation to the users interests.

260
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,270
So that's it for this.

261
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,630
And let's jump into our next video.
