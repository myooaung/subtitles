00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.390
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.270
Let's talk about individual items now when it comes to CSS grid, because up until now, we've just

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.480
used this container and performed operations or changed views to all the items.

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.700
But what if we wanted a bit of a funky grid system that has different sizes?

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.920
In that case, we can just select individual items within this container.

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.720
If we go back to our HTML page, we see that we have these zones, but each zone has different color.

7
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.500
So let's use one of these colors, for example, green, which we have to of to have some special CSS

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.460
grid properties.

9
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.000
So let's have a green class.

10
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.230
And I'm just going to do it up here instead of the bottom just to so we can keep all the CSIS great

11
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.190
things at the top.

12
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:59.930
Now for individual items, I can say something like grid column and say what we wanted to do in terms

13
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.790
of the column grid system and the way this works is we can give it where it should start and where it

14
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.780
should end.

15
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.070
What does that mean?

16
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.170
Well, if I do grid column start and I say one.

17
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.440
And then have a grid.

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.390
Column.

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.090
And.

20
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.570
And I give it to and I refresh the page.

21
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.900
Nothing changes.

22
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.680
What if I do grid column three and I refresh?

23
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.640
Whoa.

24
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.170
What just happened here?

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.720
In order for us to understand what these numbers mean.

26
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.070
Let's open up the developer tools once again.

27
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.420
I'm going to select the items.

28
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:56.470
And as we'll see over here, we see that we have a grid zone and this fox is now taking up two grid

29
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.310
spaces.

30
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.500
And the way CSS grid works.

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.690
It has a numbering system where the first line over here is one.

32
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.370
The second line over here is two, and then this is three.

33
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.010
Let's just make this a little bit bigger to show you.

34
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.970
That's better.

35
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.650
We now have three grid systems or three grid items.

36
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.870
We have one here when the first one begins to where the second one begins, and then three where the

37
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.920
third one begins.

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.430
So what we're saying here is that when it comes to columns, start at one which is right over here and

39
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.740
then end at three.

40
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.810
So that if I do four here and I refresh.

41
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.920
You see that it now covers the entire length.

42
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.530
But as soon as we make it a little bit bigger, well, it only is going to cover the one, two, three,

43
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.700
up to four.

44
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.140
And if we make it a little bit smaller.

45
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.400
You see that?

46
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.380
Because we said one, two, four.

47
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.740
It doesn't actually make it as responsive the way it was before, and it actually extends to make sure

48
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.600
that it fills in 1 to 4.

49
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.600
And there's a shorthand way of doing this.

50
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.670
Instead of saying, great column start and great column, and we can just say Great column and then

51
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.600
give it the start number and then slash the end number.

52
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.130
If I refresh.

53
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.250
You see that?

54
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.330
It's the same thing.

55
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.520
Let's make this a little bit bigger and let's just do three here just to keep it small.

56
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.650
All right.

57
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.890
I'm going to close this.

58
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.730
And we see that our grid items now have well, this looks pretty good, actually.

59
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.350
We have the green classes that span over more grids.

60
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.200
Now, a trick here is that sometimes we just simply don't know what the user is going to see.

61
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.040
And we might want this to spend the entire length without having the rabbit come in.

62
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.170
And then the frog and the lion come in.

63
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.490
And we can actually do at the end here something like minus one, which means all the way till the end.

64
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.410
If I refresh here, there you go.

65
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.700
And make this larger and smaller, we see that.

66
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.260
We are saying start at one and then keep going all the way until the end.

67
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.500
And CSS grid minus one signifies the end of the viewport.

68
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.880
So that now we see that we have a nice responsive grid again that just adjusts according to our viewport.

69
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.770
Very, very cool.

70
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.460
Now, sometimes we don't really know how many grids we're going to have on our page, and we also might

71
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.240
not necessarily want it to span it all across from beginning to end.

72
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.540
So a useful syntax here is to do something like span two which says span across two grids.

73
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.770
If I refresh here, you see that green is spanning across two grids.

74
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.690
If I do three, it's going to span across three grids.

75
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.480
And as you can imagine, the default is span one spanning across one.

76
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.810
But the interesting thing about this is if I do, let's say span two and I refresh.

77
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.670
As this gets smaller.

78
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.930
You see that it's always going to span across to make sure that it covers whatever the two grids are,

79
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.870
which is once again very useful.

80
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.160
Finally, we can also do the same thing with rows.

81
00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:04.260
If we do grid rose or grid row, I can say, well, we want it to span to start at, let's say one and

82
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.660
end at three.

83
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.950
If I refresh your.

84
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.710
Well, what just happened here?

85
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.990
Well, let's take a look.

86
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.720
We started one and end at three.

87
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.400
And because Green is also this unicorn over here, it automatically moved it all the way up because

88
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.260
we want it to start at one as well.

89
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:38.200
And remember, our grid system now is row and if I open the developer tools and select the grid, one

90
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.750
starts here, then two, then three right here where it ends.

91
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.690
So you have to be careful with the positioning here that this is going to move whatever it needs to

92
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.180
all the way up to one.

93
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.800
But we're able to move things around and adjust the rows as well.

94
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.140
Very, very cool.

95
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.970
Our grid system is starting to look really, really nice.

96
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.280
Let's do a bit more in the next video.
