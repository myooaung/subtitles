Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.939
In the last video, we had this problem of the view getting a little bit ugly with our navigation as

3
00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.520
we became smaller and smaller with our viewport.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.110
How can we fix this?

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
And here I want to show you a topic that I actually cover in my next course.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.880
But just because it might be useful for this case, I'm going to introduce you to something called media

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.720
queries.

8
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.830
And media queries allow us to create responsive websites and tell our web pages what to do when the

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.980
size of our screen gets small or big.

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.690
And I'll link to this website over here.

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.480
But essentially what it allows us to do with media queries, we can have devices, tablets, laptops,

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.290
wearables that have different screen sizes and tell it how to display our Web page based on those sizes.

13
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.070
For example, here it shows us what our view ports will be for iPhone four and iPhone four.

14
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:12.620
S And using this syntax of at media only screen and giving it some minimum device width and max device

15
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:21.950
width, we can tell it how to display our page or have CSS properties specific to just this view size

16
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.550
that is minimum view size is going to be 320 pixel and max is 480 pixels.

17
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.250
And as you can imagine, there's a lot of these based on different devices and viewpoints now.

18
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.540
Things like CSS, Grid and Flexbox actually resolve a lot of this.

19
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.890
But I want to demonstrate just one use case with our little example.

20
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.450
That is.

21
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.320
This contact's getting smushed.

22
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.910
So let's create our own media query for our navigation.

23
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.900
In order to do that, all we need to do is say at media.

24
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.310
We say only screen.

25
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.490
And this is saying, what do we want our media query for?

26
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.070
And you can do things like print here, for example, when you're printing something, but 99% of the

27
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.840
time you're just going to have screen.

28
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.410
And here we're going to say and we'll say that max width.

29
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:30.340
Is going to be 600 pixels that is use this CSS properties that we're about to define right here only

30
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.980
when max width is 600 pixel.

31
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.570
That is as soon as this is less than 600 pixel in width.

32
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.460
I apply these properties here.

33
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.790
So I'll say main nav, we'll have a font size.

34
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.820
We can do different things here, but let's just say a smaller font size and maybe we'll do padding

35
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.730
of zero just so they're closer together.

36
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.640
If I save this and refresh.

37
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.420
Look at that.

38
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.390
Everything fits in because our font size is smaller and we've removed any extra padding that we may

39
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.930
have.

40
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.320
But notice here as I make things bigger.

41
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.340
You see that?

42
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.540
As soon as I pass 600 pixels, we restore our defaults with larger font size.

43
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.210
Look at that.

44
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.730
So using media queries, we just made our nav bar more responsive.

45
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.450
Nice and easy.

46
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.260
And this is a common pattern that I recommend with your navigation.

47
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.700
That is having our nav element with an unordered list and an ally list.

48
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.600
Our main NAV, which will be a Flexbox and we'll have a push class that uses this margin left auto to

49
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.630
push whatever we want to our nav to the right side.

50
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.330
Usually something like contacts or log in to have it all the way to the right.

51
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.750
So hopefully this wasn't too bad.

52
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.600
Like I said, you don't need to memorize this.

53
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.660
You can even copy the code that I'll leave for you at the end of these videos.

54
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.690
Once you get used to this syntax, you now have a solid foundation to build the navigation.

55
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.190
But we have three more things to go, so let's get to that in the next video.
