00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.780
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.840
And we're going to jump right in to sketching more flows.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.420
This time we're going to focus on screen flows.

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.580
Now, here, you should really focus on a user's actions through a specific flow.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.370
It could be a small sequence, a sequence of screens, or it could be a journey that branches.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.560
So let's think about our client again.

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.340
This could be a user who actually searches for a product.

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.870
So let's get in there.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.360
So I'm just going to just title this.

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.220
I mean, it's really hard to kind of draw on this tablet, but I'm not going to really title everything

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.390
we can just say, like.

12
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.630
Search.

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.500
Zoom out.

14
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.320
And what we're going to do is we're going to just draw a frame here.

15
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.760
Perfect.

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.680
Once again, not really worrying about the details here, but we're going to just focus on how does

17
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.530
a user complete this flow properly?

18
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.200
How do they achieve their goal of finding a product?

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.950
I'm going to do is I think they'll come to the home page and they may access our search bar.

20
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.750
There may be a navigation.

21
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.690
I'm not sure what those navigation items are just yet, but this is what the make up of the page is

22
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.530
thus far.

23
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.770
After they interact with that.

24
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.610
The next sequence is a user sees results.

25
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.240
So.

26
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.560
Pardon my messiness, but that's okay.

27
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.780
So they'll see some results.

28
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.500
And over here we'll have some images.

29
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.400
I know that there's going to be some sort of content here, and this is going to really help me start

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.840
building some sort of requirements that I need to account for when I'm designing elements.

31
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.450
So like, I know that there's these cards that have an image, they have some text.

32
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.650
I'm not sure what that text is.

33
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.490
It could be a product name, it could be a combination of that plus price plus other elements.

34
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.250
But I do know that when they do click over here in this area.

35
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.870
We're going to move over.

36
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.980
Step three would probably be something like a product description.

37
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.380
So we'll just write item.

38
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.000
So I mean, you don't need to copy exactly what I'm doing.

39
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.360
I really urge you to think outside the box, take some time to just sketch out.

40
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.970
I mean, you can use a tablet, whatever really works for you.

41
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.130
The item description.

42
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.890
I'm starting to really think about some of the content that's going there.

43
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.050
It could be like a name.

44
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.410
Let's get in there and start writing a little bit of content.

45
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.350
Price could be over here.

46
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.690
There could be like options to change color.

47
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:42.350
I'm not sure exactly, but there's some text and then maybe there's like a button sticky to the bottom

48
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.820
that's just like add to cart.

49
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.110
Just double tap with two fingers in concept and you'll be able to actually just go back.

50
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.310
So if I go like this double tap, perfect next step, they've clicked that button.

51
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.910
They've added that to their cart.

52
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.780
Step four.

53
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.130
Actually, you know what?

54
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.320
If they add that to the car, they found the item.

55
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.990
They'll probably just go to the car and we'll end the flow right here.

56
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.200
I think we can actually start thinking about alternate scenarios.

57
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.150
So they've added their item to a cart.

58
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.620
Perfect.

59
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.760
And maybe there's a checkout button.

60
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.600
Over there.

61
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.220
Another interesting thing is we start thinking about different things like hierarchy.

62
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.940
So if navigation sticky to the bottom, maybe we start using that for primary buttons and start sticking

63
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.650
other things to the top, which are a little bit more harder to access on mobile.

64
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.340
Just different things we're starting to think about in terms of page hierarchy.

65
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.380
It's really going to help us influence like ways we start building site maps and actually start building

66
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.370
that page hierarchy.

67
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.160
Let's think about different alternate flow.

68
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.590
What we know here is that we made the assumption that they're going to come in and they're going to

69
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.700
click that search bar.

70
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.190
But there's other ways to actually find a product.

71
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.350
And this is where we can start thinking about other ways to make this process a little bit easier.

72
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.680
So we'll label this one and we'll just call this home.

73
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.820
But weapons, if we really think about like placing products strategically there.

74
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.360
Products for our user.

75
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.130
So we do know that the application that we are building is for a personalized shopping experience,

76
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.220
like a really personalized shopping experience based off of their habits, based off of their interests.

77
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.020
And we can really push items at the front and really hope that these users will go down that funnel

78
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.400
instead of actually just searching.

79
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.640
We want to make this experience much more enjoyable and more catered to them so we could really take

80
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.170
advantage of that.

81
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.400
So we'll start thinking about maybe there are images here.

82
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.040
Of products that they could like or products based off of their interest, products that maybe they're

83
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.760
in their wish list and are on sale.

84
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.410
So we start thinking about these different types of scenarios.

85
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.550
It looks like enough.

86
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.870
I just fix that.

87
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.470
So if they do come to the home screen, they could actually tap on one of these products here.

88
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.150
And if they do.

89
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.120
The next step in their flow would be to actually go for the item description page that we actually built

90
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.840
over here.

91
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.330
So we start thinking about all those different scenarios and look at that.

92
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.690
We already kind of came up with a little user flow and an optional user flow.

93
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.450
We should always think about more than one scenario when we're building something like this, because

94
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.500
there always is more than one scenario and one route to get to a certain page or reach a certain goal.

95
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.480
This is really going to help influence our page hierarchies, like I mentioned before, and site maps.

96
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.910
That's how you draw screen flows.
