00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.870
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.780
We're going to jump right into creating our very own sitemap.

3
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.510
So I have a copied instance of that initial component that I was talking about earlier.

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.540
So this is going to signify which page we're on and the different types of hierarchies and content within.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.370
And yeah, this is going to be great.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.780
I'm going to show you one quick thing.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.950
It's within a frame.

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.390
If you notice, the frame has a thing called auto layout and auto layout.

9
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.290
Essentially.

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.910
It's really great for something like this.

11
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.620
So I'll show you how that works.

12
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.090
It's going to structure the content vertically and you can set the spacing between, so this is the

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.430
container for the pieces within.

14
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.970
So you can set the space on the top and bottom, you can set the spaces on the sides, you can also

15
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.430
set the space between components.

16
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.540
So that's really cool.

17
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.400
And if I add a component or remove a component, this whole container will grow.

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.260
So it's really great for something like this where we don't have to constantly resize something.

19
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.209
So let's go ahead and just position this in the middle of our frame.

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.840
Perfect.

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.330
And what we're going to do is we're going to rename the title to home and let's start thinking about

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.340
the different types of content within.

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.590
So we're definitely going to have a search that's going to be public.

24
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.330
We're going to have something like a shopping interests thing.

25
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.900
I'm not sure exactly what that's going to be, so I'm going to have to sketch that out later.

26
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.760
So shopping interests and.

27
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.030
And habits.

28
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.680
So we'll have that.

29
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.890
We will probably have a login and a sign note on that page.

30
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.110
So the reason why I'm even breaking this page down even more is so I can really understand what other

31
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.100
pages I can get to or what other pieces of content I can get to from here.

32
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.720
It also allows me to really understand maybe how I should structure that content when I'm thinking about

33
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.140
how I place those items on a page, especially through wireframe.

34
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.110
So what we'll do is we'll duplicate the search and here.

35
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.690
I guess we're just going to have to detach this whole instance, and that's totally fine.

36
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.960
Perfect work.

37
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.010
So we have search.

38
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.720
Maybe I want shopping.

39
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.620
Interesting habits to be right at the forefront and maybe I'm not sure what that looks like right now.

40
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.880
But I know we're going to probably have to have categories in this section because we don't really have

41
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.200
it in the NAV at the moment.

42
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.230
But we're going to reach out with categories, deals.

43
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.270
We'll probably have a deal section.

44
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.310
Let's just copy this a couple of times.

45
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.140
So this is all going to be public.

46
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.580
Man.

47
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.970
We're going to have a cart.

48
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.450
OC What else?

49
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.380
Let's think about the other things we're going to have that are related to members only.

50
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.830
So we are definitely going to have a wish list, a way to get to the wish list.

51
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.270
We are going to have orders.

52
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.420
What else do we have?

53
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.170
And a profile.

54
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.170
So these are the different things that we will have.

55
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.240
I've kind of listed the navigation in here that I've kind of proposed prior.

56
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.920
It's up to you, really.

57
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.980
It's going to depend on whatever your preference is.

58
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.490
It allows me to really think about the structure of the entire page as well as the navigation and one

59
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.880
shot.

60
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.330
So that's like I said, that's just a little bit of preference.

61
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.430
So I'm going to copy this all the way over here and let's start thinking about shopping interests and

62
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.290
habits first.

63
00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:03.090
So I'm not sure what that's going to look like, but let's start thinking about that, at least the

64
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.110
structure of the page.

65
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.860
So we do know that this is definitely going to be a members only page.

66
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.340
And if you're not signed in, then login or sign up is probably going to be at the forefront of that

67
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.450
so we can go ahead and delete all these different public links.

68
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.320
So probably there'll be a way to, like, discover new products.

69
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.060
Maybe.

70
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.040
Like my interest portion, like where you can edit them or see what you're currently interested in.

71
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.290
They'll probably be some categories based off of those interests and there'll probably be maybe some

72
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.980
deals.

73
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.460
I think that's pretty sufficient right now since we're just trying to get a sense of what the overview

74
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.960
of our app looks like.

75
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.880
The second step is categories.

76
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.320
Let's build that one or two.

77
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.330
So categories, we won't necessarily need to have more log ins.

78
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.140
We can go ahead and actually select all of these.

79
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.110
Oops, we can delete these.

80
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.620
And a quick way to switch to the.

81
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.550
Public instance is to just go into our instance panel over here and select public and automatically

82
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.690
that changes to the color.

83
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:27.700
So let's think about what could be on the category page and what links me link elsewhere.

84
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.950
We may link to certain pages that may seem redundant, like trending items or whatever that means.

85
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.900
That may just link to like a page that is like a default list that we reuse over and over again, but

86
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.740
we just name it differently, whether that's like deals, results.

87
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.320
So just something to think about.

88
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.380
Trending items maybe there.

89
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.040
Oops.

90
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.380
Can't see what else may be on the categories page.

91
00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.010
Probably like this is going to be a page where we can get to the different categories throughout the

92
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.270
entire application.

93
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.410
We do know, like with larger products like this, they'll probably be like categories around like gaming

94
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.210
all the way to like fashion and maybe health.

95
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.510
So it just is probably pretty vast.

96
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.250
So we'll probably have to break this out just a little bit like and make it more interesting.

97
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.650
So we'll probably have like a trending item section or something like that, maybe some more like most

98
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.360
popular categories.

99
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.900
We'll definitely have like an all categories section and we're going to probably have like a deal section

100
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.290
again.

101
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.450
So you'll start seeing like there's a deal section here and deals section here and like we probably

102
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.910
won't show all the deals, but we'll give them a sneak peek and they'll probably be redirected to some

103
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.080
sort of redundant type of page that we kind of reuse over and over again.

104
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.990
I shouldn't say redundant more so than just a reusable kind of like page, so I think that's pretty

105
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.210
sufficient for categories.

106
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.270
What else do we have here?

107
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.060
Deals.

108
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.820
Okay, so we've got deals.

109
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.980
And like I said, this could be something easily accessible.

110
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:19.330
So you can get it primarily, but you can access this from like the categories page and elsewhere.

111
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:27.970
So the deals page probably has like the trending deals probably has deals based off of categories.

112
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.090
So I'm not sure if these are the right choices right now.

113
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.620
And that's a good thing to remember when you're designing like everything that you're doing without

114
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.640
user research is definitely an assumption and you should treat them as such.

115
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.240
So just something to think about as you're building.

116
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.330
Don't just build the first thing that comes to mind.

117
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.940
Go out and test with users.

118
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.380
I'll definitely cover that.

119
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.960
In another lesson.

120
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.900
So we'll have here all categories.

121
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.740
I'm just going to go member only so they'll probably be like a member only section if you are signed

122
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:11.450
in and if you have enough content or data that are developers will be able to pull from and match you

123
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.260
with certain deals like deals just for you.

124
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.170
There you go.

125
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.210
Deal is just for you.

126
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.140
I like that.

127
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.660
I think that's pretty sufficient for now.

128
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.910
See, now we're getting a sense of like what each page should probably have and where you can access

129
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.320
it through the hierarchy.

130
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.330
Wishlist.

131
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.100
I'm going to call it Wishlist for now.

132
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:38.390
We've been calling it saved, but I don't think that really does a good job of indicating what exactly

133
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:38.900
it is.

134
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.350
I'm going to actually steal that button.

135
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.280
Because this is going to be a members only section, definitely a members only section.

136
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:58.580
So we have probably like years saved items, maybe there's multiple lists, but we can handle that.

137
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:04.250
Once we start wire framing, sharing it, we'll be able to share.

138
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.950
So we have to think about maybe where that leads.

139
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.030
And similar items.

140
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:19.480
So another way to get them into the funnel of buying other items that are probably relevant to their

141
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.050
needs.

142
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.420
So we have a wish list.

143
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.690
What else is there?

144
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.670
Let's copy this.

145
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.550
And so we have orders over here.

146
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.140
So that again is going to be a members only section.

147
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.570
So let's do that.

148
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.240
So we'll if they do come into these pages, I'm thinking about having them.

149
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.350
Be hit with like a registration block.

150
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.690
So you can't necessarily create a wish list if you don't have an account with us or you can't really

151
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.430
order if you don't have an account with us.

152
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:58.130
So if somebody comes in and they don't necessarily sign up yet, then they'll be blocked to actually

153
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.660
access these types of pages.

154
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.600
So we're definitely going to let them try out our app, but they're going to be blocked for majority

155
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:05.930
of it.

156
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:13.160
Search and filter will probably be on the order screen, so they'll be able to search through past orders.

157
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.540
What else do we have here?

158
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:22.610
We have in progress orders and past orders.

159
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.930
Maybe there is somewhere like a customer service based thing, like a help.

160
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.870
Maybe a health section.

161
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.950
So that's that's good to just think about what happens if an order is lost.

162
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.660
What happens if an order is late?

163
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.530
So customer satisfaction is very important.

164
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:49.070
And we have orders, profiling cards.

165
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.840
Let's think about CART first.

166
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.680
This is not a members only page.

167
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.480
You can view your cart.

168
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.900
You just won't be able to check out.

169
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.730
Let's just switch that with public.

170
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.840
So we'll be able to see like items in cart.

171
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.350
What else we'll be able to see.

172
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.190
Let's duplicate that a couple of times.

173
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.860
We'll probably be able to see maybe similar items.

174
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.490
I'm not sure if that's relevant right now, but I'm going to put it in there anyways.

175
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.590
And I think that.

176
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.530
Is fine.

177
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.030
So items in the car and the last one, we're running out of space.

178
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.850
So I'm just going to shift these all over a bit.

179
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.550
Bom, bom, bom.

180
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.200
And there we go.

181
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.870
And profile.

182
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:50.120
So this is definitely another member's only section, so I'm just going to copy that and bring it in.

183
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:52.990
Oops.

184
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.940
You see how they just kind of like with auto layout, you can just kind of like place things so easily.

185
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.460
It's really great if you're like designing for one use case.

186
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:08.040
Figma has yet to really implement something that makes it totally responsive, so I wouldn't necessarily

187
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.570
use them, like when creating containers for a responsive website for mobile.

188
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.130
If you're focused on just creating something that's maybe like growing or shrinking, then I think it's

189
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.160
really great and we'll build that out as well eventually.

190
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.560
So profile, what do we need to think about?

191
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.490
If they are not signed in, they're definitely going to get hit by a wall here.

192
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.980
So let's just do a members only section.

193
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.280
And so the different types of things they can see here.

194
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.680
They'll be able to see like my profile, I'm guessing or account.

195
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.940
Hmm.

196
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.950
So account settings.

197
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.880
And see.

198
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.120
So we're just going to.

199
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.950
Copy these.

200
00:12:53.080 --> 00:13:01.030
So I'll probably be able to see like their interests, maybe stuff like customer service will be it

201
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.010
could be here tucked in somewhere.

202
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.750
What else could be here?

203
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.350
I think that's fine for now actually.

204
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:14.260
So their account settings that could be anything from like their profile image to payment methods to

205
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.790
address settings.

206
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.900
Interests is definitely just like categories that they fall into.

207
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.650
And we have customer service just in case.

208
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:29.850
We can link back to if they need help with something and possibly orders.

209
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.310
Maybe it's another way to get to the order screen.

210
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.100
Okay.

211
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.500
So that looks like the first kind of tier.

212
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.800
We can easily lay this out nicely.

213
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.830
What I want to do is just select all of them.

214
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.840
And.

215
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.880
Go and click up here and distribute.

216
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.130
Horizontal spacing.

217
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.030
So now they're all evenly distributed and we'll just center that as well.

218
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.440
What we can also do is there's a plugin called Auto Flow.

219
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.560
So we'll click that plug in and there it is.

220
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.310
And this is really cool.

221
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.470
I'll show you how it works.

222
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.040
So if I select this container and then this container, it will automatically create a line and you

223
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.750
can customize what that line will look like.

224
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.900
Right now it has a 100 pixel radius.

225
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:27.430
If I select zero, it will just make a straight line so we can use that.

226
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.220
That looks great.

227
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.080
So now we have our structure.

228
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.930
I like this a lot.

229
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.640
And we can remove that for now and we can just select all of these.

230
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.090
And, you know, I'm not really worried about like the structure of what my current page structure looks

231
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.550
like here on the side.

232
00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:02.810
I mean, these are meant to constantly be reworked, shared with others and kind of like constantly

233
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.240
recreated and refined.

234
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.300
So don't spend too much time on making things perfect.

235
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.680
So that's our first layer.

236
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.970
Let's take another look at it.

237
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.260
We have shopping interests.

238
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.430
We have categories, deals, wish lists, orders, cart profile.

239
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.470
That seems pretty sufficient.

240
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.810
And let's stop here in our next video.

241
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.420
We'll get into building this out just a little bit more.
