1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,330
Okay.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:01,680
Okay.

3
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,040
Andre, can we finally submit this form?

4
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,050
All right, in this video, we'll finally see what happens when we submit this form.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:16,600
But there is one last thing that we need to include, and that is the name attributes.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,550
And I'll explain towards the end of this video why we need those.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,510
So we want to add in each one of our fields a name attribute.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,250
So this one will be first name.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,420
And I'm just going to copy and paste here just so it'll be a little bit faster.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,480
We have last name email.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,860
Password.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,420
Birthday.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,120
We already have these for the radio buttons, which is good.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,210
And we need here.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,530
Cat.

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,790
Dog.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,980
Volvo.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,070
Volvo.

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,300
Okay.

20
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,900
Now, we don't need it for the buttons because while there's no user information there.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,630
So I'm going to save that and I'm going to make this full screen so you can see I'm going to refresh

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,520
the page and let's enter some fake data and see what happens.

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,660
So I'm going to say fake man email address is fake password would be one, two, three.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,340
Birthday will be male.

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,860
With a cat and has an Audi.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,530
I'm going to click register now but keep an eye out up over here to see what happens when I click.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,600
Did you catch that?

28
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,760
Let's copy this.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,050
Because when I clicked register, this got attached.

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,900
I'm going to minimize this and print this out here so we can see it for ourselves.

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,490
First we have a question mark.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,500
Then first name, fake.

33
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,750
That's exactly what we entered.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,770
We have last name, man.

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,900
Email is fake.

36
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,880
Something, something gmail.com.

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,810
Password.

38
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,650
One, two, three.

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,270
Oh, they know our password.

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,320
Birthday.

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,580
Gender.

42
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,080
And Cat on.

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,759
We didn't select Volvo.

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,970
I'm not sure why.

45
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,280
I'll take a look at that later.

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:19,230
But you can see over here that the value that the values that we entered into our form, we're just

47
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,060
attached to this link.

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,510
And this is actually called query strings.

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,750
And what it is, it's one way for us to send our information to the back end or the servers, because

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,660
we have to store this form information somewhere so that when we come back onto this page, the website

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,680
remembers us.

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,940
This was automatically generated in HTML five with a form but form.

53
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,360
Was using an attribute called get and this get.

54
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,420
If I left it as this, we'll do the exact same thing.

55
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,310
It will attach the form information to the URL and send it to the server.

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:09,210
There is another option where you can do post and you can try it on your own here, but you wouldn't

57
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,490
see any query parameters, so this wouldn't change the bar or the top one change.

58
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:21,360
And that is because it will be attached to the body of the request, which we'll get into when we get

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,960
to that section.

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,420
I don't want to confuse you too much, but you can see the difference here of why we might want to use

61
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,760
post instead of get because well, what if somebody was over my shoulder and they can see my password

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,840
right there in the bar?

63
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,410
I just want you to get comfortable with the idea that we are sending this information to the back end.

64
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,280
The way we handle that, we'll get into later on in the course.

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,980
Right now, we're just focusing on the front end.

66
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:55,170
The last thing I want to show you was that form also has a action attribute which used to get used a

67
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,590
lot.

68
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:05,610
If you saw old PHP based websites, they'll have some sort of an action dot PHP which said submit this

69
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,090
form.

70
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,860
And when you submit this form to the back end to the server, run this script, this file that's on

71
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,560
the server, but there are better ways of doing this now, so I'll show that later on in the course.

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,200
Let's take a look at this.

73
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,690
So we have a question mark.

74
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,990
And this is the standard anytime there's a query string.

75
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,460
So we're adding a piece of data to our URL.

76
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,770
It starts off with a question mark.

77
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,520
Which states?

78
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,450
Hey, coming up, we're going to have a bunch of data for you.

79
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,680
The first one is first name, which again corresponds with the name that we have in our form and that

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,270
was equal to fake.

81
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,690
So that's property and value.

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,550
So you can think of name as property and the value as man.

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,860
So last name, first name you can see here that there's an ant sign.

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,360
So that's again saying first name equals to fake and last name equals to man and email equals to fake

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,610
some gibberish gmail.com.

86
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,000
This is because of something called the URL encoding and because the URL has special meaning for some

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,390
characters such as this and the question mark, it's encodes the ad sign with something that it understands,

88
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,910
but it won't affect its encoding.

89
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,620
We have password.

90
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,550
One, two, three.

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,150
Birthday gender on and cat on.

92
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,500
And I've actually realized why the Volvo and Audi information didn't register.

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,370
And that is because for the query string to work, as you can see, it needs to have a name associated

94
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,940
with a value.

95
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,670
So we have first name and fake.

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,090
If we look at the radio buttons, we have a name which is gender.

97
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,380
And we have on.

98
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,590
So you see over here how we didn't send any value.

99
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,850
We know that the gender, some button was clicked in the gender.

100
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,060
So it's on, but we don't know which value.

101
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,630
And that is because we should have included.

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,650
A value for the mail so that if that's the one that's selected, a value will be sent.

103
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,130
And finally value.

104
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,880
And now, same with the select.

105
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,920
We should have had our name of the select field.

106
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,320
B cars.

107
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,830
So that now the name can be associated with the value.

108
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,100
So let's give that a try one more time.

109
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,110
I'm going to delete this.

110
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,850
I'm going to save the changes that we just made.

111
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,370
I'm going to make this full screen.

112
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,330
Let's refresh and enter some new information.

113
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:16,390
Fake new email is new fake gmail dot com.

114
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,970
Password is one two, three, four this time.

115
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:29,030
Birthday let's do female dog and Audie, I'm going to click register.

116
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,490
And let's see what we have here.

117
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,570
We have first name, fake last name is new email, new fake ID gmail.com, password.

118
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,470
One, two, three, four.

119
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,490
Birthday.

120
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,500
Gender is female.

121
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,480
Good dog is on.

122
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,980
So we've selected dog.

123
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,460
That's great.

124
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,620
And then cars is Audie.

125
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,550
There you go.

126
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,600
And that's as complicated as forms are going to get.

127
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:02,210
You'll encounter this a lot, and there is definitely a most websites that you build, whether it's

128
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,740
a landing page, a website that requires registration.

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,420
This is something that you'll see a lot.

130
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,570
Once you understand this, once it makes sense, you can call yourself an HTML developer.

131
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,060
So I'll see you and the next one.

132
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,810
Bye bye.
