1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.480
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.180
Let's make this website a little bit prettier than it is now.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.040
And I'm going to introduce you to some CSS properties.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.780
Properties are, as the name suggests, properties that we want to change within a Web page.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
And you might be asking yourself, how many properties are there?

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.830
And as we did with the HTML section, I have a recommended resource for you and that is CSS tricks this

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.400
website.

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.990
Any time you Google any questions about CSS, most likely some of the top ten answers are going to include

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.310
something from this website.

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:46.290
So I highly, highly recommend it, especially if you go to the menu and almanac because within this

11
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.480
almanac we have all the CSS properties listed on here.

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.330
So any time you have a question and you want to say what is justify content, well, you can click on

13
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.510
it and it will actually give you examples.

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.410
You can play around with it and learn about the specific property.

15
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.820
Just like with HTML tags.

16
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.830
Although there are way more properties, you don't need to know all of them and memorize them because

17
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.910
that's not realistic.

18
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.600
That's not the best use of your time.

19
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.440
We're going to focus on the ones that you'll encounter most often, and any time you see nuance pop

20
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.000
up while you're working, you can always look them up and learn about them because they're very, very

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.530
simple to read into.

22
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.750
So let's try a few of these.

23
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.040
I'm going to start off with our style of CSS over here, and let's change a few things.

24
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.800
We want to have our home being the center.

25
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.720
Let's start off with text.

26
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.630
The line.

27
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.850
And if I type in center and I save.

28
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.490
My text is now centered.

29
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.920
We also want to add a border to this image border.

30
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.070
And this is a little bit unique.

31
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.460
You can do something like this.

32
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.430
You can do five pixels, which is the size of the border, what style of border you want.

33
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.410
So you can do that.

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.830
And then the color of the border will do purple.

35
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.320
So I save refresh and we have a border.

36
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.910
You can also do solid and if it's solid, it's a solid border.

37
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.690
OC What else can we do?

38
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.090
It'll be nice to have an image, maybe an entire image for the website.

39
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.170
So how do we do that?

40
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.560
Well, the tag that we would want to apply it to is probably body.

41
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.500
So if I go into body.

42
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.850
And you might notice something here.

43
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.660
As I'm creating these selectors, I'm going from top to bottom.

44
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.180
The body, which is the parent of almost everything, is at the top.

45
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.340
And as we get more and more specific, we trickle down to smaller elements.

46
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.510
Again, we'll get into that in a later video, but just keep that in mind.

47
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.710
So for Body, it would be awesome to have a cool image on our website so we can do background.

48
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.870
And you can see that sublime text actually auto fills or has some suggestions for us and we can look

49
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.490
through this and pick the one that we want, but based on the name, looks like we want background image.

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.960
With background image we want to specify a URL.

51
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.560
In our case I actually have on my desktop saved a nice little picture and let's title it something.

52
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.920
Simple like background image.

53
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.430
And I got this from a website called Unsplash.

54
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.540
If you haven't checked it out, they have a ton of high quality free images that you can use.

55
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.900
So again, here we are referencing our let's put this actually in here.

56
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.640
So it's in our project folder and then within our project folder we can say that it is background image

57
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.720
dot jpeg.

58
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.790
So I save this, I refresh.

59
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.000
And look at that.

60
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.440
We have this image, but you can see that it's a big image and doesn't fit the screen.

61
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.970
So how can we do that?

62
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.330
We can do background size.

63
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.230
Cover.

64
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.310
So if we do that and refresh, look at that.

65
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.649
We have a beautiful background on our website.

66
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.010
Okay.

67
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.860
Let's say we want to remove these little dots next to our links.

68
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.950
We can do that by going into what we want to change our life elements.

69
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:36.350
So we go into style and we can put in here Ally and we'll do something called list style and we'll go

70
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.740
none and refresh and look at that.

71
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.330
Those little pesky dots are gone.

72
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.460
Whenever I select about I want the cursor to not be this.

73
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.900
I want to change a cursor to maybe have this little hand gesture.

74
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.780
I like to call the Mickey Mouse hands.

75
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.400
So we go into our H two and we could do something called cursor.

76
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.360
And let's say you don't really know what properties cursor has or you don't even know the property.

77
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.060
You can go into CSS tricks and again go to see.

78
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.300
Look at cursor and you can kind of guess by the name what it does.

79
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.170
And it tells you all the information you need to know.

80
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.810
But you can see over here that they even have a demo of what you can do with cursors.

81
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.590
So we want the pointer so we can just put pointer here safe.

82
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.670
Let's go back to our website, refresh and look at that.

83
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.800
We now have a pointer when we hover over about.

84
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.620
And maybe the last change we want to do is that we want to make sure that our home about and login are

85
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.690
on one line.

86
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.370
This is a little awkward when they're stacked on top of each other.

87
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.110
And we can do that by selecting let's look over here.

88
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.690
We want to select our lives and we can use something called display.

89
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.290
And Display has a few properties that you can use.

90
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.020
One is block.

91
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.200
And by default, this is actually already a block.

92
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.870
But there is also something called in line block.

93
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.020
And if I save this and I refresh, look that we have everything in line now, we want to change a few

94
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.590
things here.

95
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.590
We want to make sure that our colors are better than just purple and and green and pink.

96
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.660
And what if we want some specific color and we have a certain design that we want for our website?

97
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.610
Well, colors are very, very interesting in CSS because there's a few ways that you can do them.

98
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.940
And I want to show you one of my favorite websites for picking colors.

99
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:50.470
What this website does, it actually gives you the colors that you can use along with a nice edition

100
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.780
of what it will complement that color.

101
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.530
So you can play around with this and change a bunch of criteria as you can click over here and see what

102
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.060
color combinations work.

103
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.900
But let's say we wanted to use something like this, and if you hover over and click, you'll see over

104
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.300
here that I get a couple of numbers that we can use.

105
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.770
So the first one is a hex number.

106
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.590
So hex number has a hash and then the number associated with it.

107
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.330
So I just copied it from the website.

108
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.850
You see the numbers a little bit different.

109
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:32.880
Essentially, they can use anything from 0 to 9 and then all the way to F, so A to F and this represents

110
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.320
a specific color.

111
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.750
So if I copy this and let's make our color, let's make it the color of our header.

112
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:47.700
If we go back to our CSS and save this and refresh, you'll see that our color changes.

113
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.650
We also want the border again to complement the color.

114
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.320
Let's do this border color.

115
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.960
We also have something called GB.

116
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:05.660
And our GB, again, you see over here that there is a hex color and an RGB color.

117
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.490
These are both the same color.

118
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.470
So you can pick whichever one you want.

119
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.130
In the case of an RGB color, you can do something like this.

120
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:20.240
Let's say we want for our border to have our GB color of these valleys.

121
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.140
So that is the value of red, green and blue.

122
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:28.340
So that's what our GB stands for and we just wrap it like so.

123
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.179
So now if I save this and refresh, look at that.

124
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:38.570
I have a nice little outline just to show you of what exactly I mean by red, green and blue.

125
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.820
If I set all of these to zero.

126
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.520
So that means that Redd is in full force and green and blue are nonexistent.

127
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.070
If I save and refresh, that is red.

128
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.690
If I change this to green, then that's in green effect.

129
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:59.630
And you can imagine here that if I change the blue to 255 and everything else is zero, this will be

130
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.500
blue.

131
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.740
There you go.

132
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.990
So let's go back here to what we had before, because I like the other colors way better, so let's

133
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.830
refresh.

134
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.700
Perfect.

135
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:19.960
Now, RGV, let's do one other cool thing, and that is called RGV A and that is stands for Alpha.

136
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.000
You can actually set the opacity.

137
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.570
So with the fourth number, you can actually do something between zero and one and one being, well,

138
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:35.380
opaque, and you can still see everything to zero where it's completely transparent.

139
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.330
So let's do 0.5 here.

140
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.350
And you can see that there's a bit of a fade now in our color.

141
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.740
Perfect.

142
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:49.720
So using a tool like this, you can really pick what colors you want your website to have and choose

143
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.360
the one that complement each other.

144
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:58.010
Well, I use this website a lot when creating new websites and thinking of color templates to use.

145
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:04.510
It's a really, really good resource and you can use Hex and GB, whichever whichever one you want.

146
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:09.030
Just it's good to have some consistency if you want to add some opacity.

147
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.900
So the alpha this last number then definitely use our GBA OC.

148
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:21.730
So going back here, our website is starting to look somewhat OC.

149
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:28.270
But in the next section I want to talk a little bit about selectors and more things that we can do with

150
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.630
them.

151
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.330
I'll see you on that one.

152
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.110
Bye bye.
