00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.870
Icons are a really important part of any design system.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.100
We use them for a variety of things like forms, navigation, buttons.

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.390
They're used almost everywhere.

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.330
Now there are a couple of figma plug ins that you can use, and the main one I like to use is icon.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.390
I also like to use material design plugin, which is really great.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.640
I've used it through some lessons and let's use it today to kind of put something together.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.990
So let me show you how it works.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.360
So let's open our plug ins.

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.010
Let's go into something like Icon Ify and this is our plug in here.

10
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.200
And now you'll notice that there's different things we can do.

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.090
We can actually search by sets.

12
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.960
So we have like Google material icons, we have unicorns.

13
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.750
We have all these different types of icons that we could use, which is really great.

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.760
You can search something up over here.

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.120
So if I search for something like home and press enter, I can filter by an icon or I can see all of

16
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.050
them and go through different of a variety of icons here.

17
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.660
I typically use this just to grab icons very quickly.

18
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.030
So if I need to fill in a wireframe with some iconography or I'm just kind of testing out some concepts,

19
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.930
this is what I'll do.

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.540
I'll just kind of grab this like that.

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.370
And here I can kind of just.

22
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.950
Set anything I'd like to set, I would import the icon.

23
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.070
And there we go.

24
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.650
I can update the frame copy.

25
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.700
I can work with the vector.

26
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.590
I can name it whatever I want.

27
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.370
Let's go through a little demo on how to kind of fill in a navigation and how to do that pretty easily

28
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.690
with something like Icon Ify.

29
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.470
I'm going to actually just create a new frame click.

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.780
F Actually, let's create a mobile frame.

31
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.020
So we're going to click off and we're going to just pick the iPhone again.

32
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.180
And what we'll do is we will create another frame and we'll just sticky that to the bottom.

33
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.360
So we don't need to really worry too much about our sizing right now.

34
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.140
At least I just want to focus on getting some icons in here.

35
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.490
And we can actually create a grid in here.

36
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.590
So we'll do that.

37
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.660
We'll create a grid instead of there.

38
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.060
Well, we're actually going to set up some columns.

39
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.050
So we're going to pick four icons.

40
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.920
So we'll set up four columns for those icons to sit within and we'll create a gutter of 16 pixels,

41
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.360
all using 16 on mobile.

42
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.270
And for a margin, I'd like to use 16 or 24.

43
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.190
So we'll just do that.

44
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.990
And there we go.

45
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.290
We can also make this nav really nice if we want.

46
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.020
We can create a nice drop shadow behind it.

47
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.380
Set that blur to something like 30.

48
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.690
Negative ten.

49
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.670
And let's fill this.

50
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.740
That's a little too harsh for a drop shadow.

51
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.120
But this.

52
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.320
A little more subtle so we can toggle our grids with control.

53
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.270
G Just like that.

54
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.710
So I'm just toggling on and off.

55
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.920
Now what I'm going to do next is I'm going to start thinking about what type of icons I want here.

56
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.390
So if I'm thinking about our client habitual, I'm thinking about maybe I need a home screen.

57
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.990
So.

58
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.430
Well, first of all, what I really want to do is I want to make sure that I'm picking from a certain

59
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.330
icon set.

60
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.360
So let's go all the way back to the beginning.

61
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.690
And we can actually just select like material design icons.

62
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.610
And if I search up just based off of that here, let's select it.

63
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.400
I search for home.

64
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.780
And there we go.

65
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.870
You can tell everything's part of the same family here.

66
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.710
They even have rounded options as well.

67
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.750
Let's just grab this icon.

68
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.900
We can drag it into there.

69
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.970
So we've got 24 by 24 pixel frame.

70
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.690
You got the home icon that sits within.

71
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.030
Let's think of another option.

72
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.750
We could have.

73
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.310
We could have a heart.

74
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.850
So for a wish list section.

75
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.310
So there you go.

76
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.010
We have our heart.

77
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.110
Let's not move that outside of the frame.

78
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.769
Let's keep that frame.

79
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.730
It's going to help us.

80
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.350
Maybe another option is something like orders.

81
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.240
Oh, we don't have orders.

82
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.040
We can kind of do something like this.

83
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.940
Like a list.

84
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.440
I like that.

85
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.670
I'll work for now.

86
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.120
And the last one we can do is settings.

87
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.930
So maybe a gear.

88
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.480
Yeah, that's going to work.

89
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.280
Okay, let's close this.

90
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.230
Now we have our icons.

91
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.590
That's awesome.

92
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.890
And we're going to drag them within that navigation frame.

93
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.530
So let's reading this to navigation.

94
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.210
Remember to always kind of name your frames, keep track of them.

95
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.150
Things can get really messy, really easy.

96
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.780
So I'm going to do is I'm going to place this in the middle.

97
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.140
You know, places where in the middle you see how they're kind of snapping together.

98
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.050
They're equal in terms of their horizontal and vertical positioning.

99
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.560
We can kind of go in there and just fix that a bit.

100
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.220
What I'm going to do is I'm going to actually have some text as well.

101
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.950
So that could also help in navigation.

102
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.540
Just pairing an icon with some text that's a little too big.

103
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.940
Use something like 12 or even ten.

104
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.980
It doesn't need to be too big.

105
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.470
Great.

106
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.470
I like that.

107
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.070
We're just going to copy that.

108
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.700
Over.

109
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.370
Remember to set your constraints.

110
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.420
Two left and right.

111
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.550
So if we do happen to resize this, it'll stick with your actual columns.

112
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.710
So let's do that over here as well.

113
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.030
We call this one wish list.

114
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.090
We got some variation over here in the column sizing.

115
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.920
We'll call this one orders.

116
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.370
And this one we are going to call settings.

117
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.820
Great.

118
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.390
Now what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that these are just a little bit above.

119
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.570
The text.

120
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:41.330
And if we actually select them all and we want to align them on the same horizontal grid or horizontal

121
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.280
line, we'll just go up here.

122
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.110
That's perfect.

123
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.470
So let's center these to make sure they are actually centered.

124
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.340
Boom.

125
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.260
Center to the text.

126
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.460
We can actually turn off that grid now, I think.

127
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.680
And there we go.

128
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.970
We have our own little navigation and we can.

129
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.160
To the overall opacity through the pass through over here on this layer, so we can turn them down to

130
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.450
like something like 20 and so we can see that our home is active.

131
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.910
Now what we want to do here is we want to set this to center and center.

132
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.920
These icons will all be set to center and center.

133
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.080
And so if we do somehow want to make this, like, responsive and we want to scale and not have to worry

134
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.960
about these icons, we won't have to.

135
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.260
So let's zoom in here and I'll show you what I mean.

136
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.640
Oops.

137
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.480
The overall frame.

138
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.230
I forgot about that.

139
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.220
It's most important.

140
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.940
There you go.

141
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.250
And you can see that they're not scaling, but they are staying centered to their own column.

142
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.490
So if we turn those columns on, you can see that they're going to stay within them.

143
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.790
We won't necessarily do this on mobile a bunch at least, but this is just a helpful tip for when you're

144
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.230
actually working with your layers.

145
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:15.030
If you don't want to use a plug in like that, you can actually go to the material design website and

146
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.810
use their actual website to download those plug ins.

147
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.800
Like you'll just have much more control you'll be able to select based off if you want it to be outlined,

148
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.500
if you want it to be rounded, you can do all of that.

149
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.480
If you do really like Google material icons and you want to go through Icon Phi, there's actually a

150
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.410
plug in for that.

151
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.600
This right here, material design icons.

152
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:41.580
And here you have all the icons in every which style and you can use these to really help you pick just

153
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.170
based off of material design icons and it's the same kind of concept.

154
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:54.000
So you just select your icon and I'll drop it immediately into your Figma file, and that's it for putting

155
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.190
together a quick navigation with some plugins.
