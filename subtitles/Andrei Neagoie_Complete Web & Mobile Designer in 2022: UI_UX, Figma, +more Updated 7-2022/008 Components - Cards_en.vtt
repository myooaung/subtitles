00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.610
So let's talk about cards now.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.460
Cards can be really complex components.

3
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.109
They can be really simple components.

4
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:08.800
It really depends.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.340
I have the whole spectrum right here to show you.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.990
These are all the different types of cards I've designed in this design system.

7
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.440
I have something as simple as just like an icon in a title card.

8
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.860
I have something simple, like just even text and icon imagery.

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.620
I have something really complex like this.

10
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.460
So many different elements, other components in there as well.

11
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.200
You'll notice that I have like pills which is over here.

12
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.590
These are really simple components, kind of based off of our buttons.

13
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.820
So let's go back to cards.

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.310
I have icons.

15
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.170
I have typography.

16
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.750
I have imagery, so I have different things.

17
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.580
Even in this one, I have all of that.

18
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.840
Plus I have buttons.

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.370
So and these ones kind of have like an interaction built in.

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.400
So these are the different types of base components I've built for cards.

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.000
And I want to show you how I went ahead and built these.

22
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.740
So you'll notice that I have a base card over here that has everything included.

23
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.730
It has reviews.

24
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.880
It has, like, a staff pick pill.

25
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.910
It has a percentage pill of a sale.

26
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.770
It has a strikethrough, as I thought about all the different use cases that you can have in a card.

27
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.090
And I'm not saying that every card is going to look like that, but it may be rare that every card is

28
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.860
going to have all this information.

29
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.990
In fact, most cards will look like this.

30
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.870
You see that?

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.440
I've turned them.

32
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.980
If turned out all off in this variation, I've created a new component called the large default product

33
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.520
card.

34
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.470
And all I have is.

35
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.850
I have my.

36
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.200
Party name price.

37
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.780
I have a small description on these larger cards.

38
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.710
I have the amount of reviews and the level of the review.

39
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.470
This is like a five star product and I have the category.

40
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.100
Now I do have a variation where there is a sale and I have a strikethrough added and I have a sale.

41
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.600
Now I have one with just a staff pick and I have both.

42
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.520
So I've created all different components for those use cases.

43
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.290
You know, I may not use these all the time.

44
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.640
I may use them just to show variation within my designs, but I'm mostly using them to communicate with

45
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.900
my developers that, you know, these are the different types of options that we need to think about

46
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.710
in code.

47
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.800
So if I were to take a variation of this.

48
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.060
I can easily go ahead and I'll show you what the makeup of this card has.

49
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.030
So if I wanted to say that this card is liked, let's go into my save button.

50
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.970
So you see my I have my product image section, which is like my top layer and I have my product info

51
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.220
section, which is my bottom layer.

52
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.640
And everything else.

53
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.500
And this is also to an auto layout.

54
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.990
And the reason why I'm using Leo in this instance, this instance is because it isn't going to be responsive

55
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.950
in my designs.

56
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.630
I'm only using it like in one screen and I'm showing you how that looks.

57
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.050
But what you could do is, if you really wanted to, you can use auto layout to help space things out.

58
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.250
And then once you're happy with that, you can just turn that off and it'll just automatically revert

59
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.730
to another frame, a regular frame with the same spacing that you've applied.

60
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.160
You just won't get the nice variation of like.

61
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.340
If this copy went over the line, the card would not grow.

62
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.890
That's what I really love about Leo.

63
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.210
Anyways, let's get into the different type of ways we can customize this card.

64
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.020
So if I was thinking about this heart, I may want to fill it.

65
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.060
So I have heart.

66
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.090
I want 24 pixel heart.

67
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.160
And I'm just going to fill that with a red accent or someone to think about what images I have.

68
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.220
So I've set it up in a way where I have a lot of variation.

69
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.850
I have electronics, I have music, I have books so far to turn that off.

70
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.350
I have music.

71
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.190
So there's different ways we can turn all these on and off.

72
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.820
Boop, boop, boop.

73
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.850
So I have, like, a record player.

74
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.260
I have, like, different types of CDs or vinyls.

75
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.610
If you wanted to show like fashion.

76
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.470
I have.

77
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.090
Let's get into that.

78
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.430
I have different variations.

79
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.840
I have glasses.

80
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.220
I have shoes.

81
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.650
I have shirts.

82
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.790
So what I've done is I've used that plugin called Remove Background to create easy ways for us to have

83
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.870
like a nice pale background, this nice gray background, and have just the image of like the product

84
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.030
that we are trying to show.

85
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.500
So let's see what, what we have here for electronics sounds like an ultra wide screen monitor that's

86
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.610
really ultra wide.

87
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.250
I have like a VR kit.

88
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.230
I have a MacBook.

89
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.300
I have Bose headphones.

90
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.180
I have an iPhone in here.

91
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.010
I have an Xbox elite controller and I have AirPods.

92
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.650
So say if I were to use the Xbox controller.

93
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.930
Xbox Elite controller.

94
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.940
And you know, we're in Canada over here.

95
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.940
So this is going to be really overpriced maybe.

96
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.740
I think it's like maybe $100.

97
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.460
I don't know.

98
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.930
And we have a description.

99
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.590
This controller is going to change your life.

100
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.690
Mainly because it is awesome.

101
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.390
So.

102
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.900
I can also change like the category.

103
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.220
I can say something along the lines of this is in gaming.

104
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.620
Oh, maybe this can fit into two categories.

105
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.450
Maybe if I want to.

106
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.350
Just kind of.

107
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.760
You know, I'd more if I wanted to.

108
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.370
That's up to you what you think is best for the product.

109
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.740
It may just be best to kind of narrow it down to just the one totally up to you and totally what's best

110
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.490
for the product.

111
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.670
So I can also change the number here.

112
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:39.910
There's four and there is maybe it's a four star and the reviews are like there's 2034 reviews.

113
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.140
So different ways that you can kind of customize that card.

114
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.860
I've also created like smaller horizontal cards.

115
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.640
You'll see that there is a sale.

116
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.710
I don't have a sale here just because there's not enough screen real estate.

117
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.750
I did give myself enough for, like, maybe like a staff pick, but.

118
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.980
On the supply cards.

119
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.450
These will be used like on category pages where we're just kind of stacking them in a grid.

120
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.780
And these cards are much smaller just in nature.

121
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.560
So that is what I've done for just my standard vertical cards.

122
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.480
I've also created horizontal cards, so I've even broken these down.

123
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.130
So these are more like standard.

124
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.150
Let's remove this.

125
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.190
These are like your vertical cards.

126
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.910
They can be used for different instances, but when I mean vertical, I mean image on top and the descriptions

127
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.890
on the bottom horizontal cards.

128
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.840
I've used them in search results, so this is my default.

129
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.470
This is my sale version.

130
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.050
And my staff pick version and my sale and staff pick version.

131
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:49.160
So you'll see the system is very much following like a set of rules, like these unwritten rules, like

132
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.020
everything is placed like left aligned, similar over here.

133
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.450
My staff is always going to be on my right side.

134
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.020
Same with my cell.

135
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.810
I'm keeping things incredibly consistent.

136
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.230
While we're creating this design system, we're also creating a language.

137
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.190
So I also have wishlist cards.

138
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.120
So if something is in my wish list, I have a default where it is saved.

139
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.910
If I click that, that would remove it from the wish list.

140
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.000
I have more of the important details here.

141
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.250
I care less about if it's a staff pick at this point.

142
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.450
I've already adding it to my wish list.

143
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.870
I care more about its price.

144
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.250
And you know, maybe it's reviews, it's category, that kind of information.

145
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.540
And I've given it a little to where it's an add to cart button.

146
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.059
People can easily add that to cart.

147
00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.039
So if there is a price change that that is also reflected in this cart.

148
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:42.580
So like I'm saying, like there are cases where I have a wishlist card, but I don't have to create

149
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.390
like unnecessary options that will never see.

150
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.140
I don't need to create a stock pick option because we'll never have that option here.

151
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.230
I've also gone ahead and taken this variant.

152
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:01.590
So if you notice the search result cards and the wishlist cards are both the same variants of the horizontal

153
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.510
product card here.

154
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.030
Now what makes them work is on a layout.

155
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:14.570
So if I were to go into my default component here, you'll see that I've actually hit in that primary

156
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.900
button.

157
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.100
If I were to show it, everything would just pop right back up and center itself.

158
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:26.570
So, like I said, create a one based version and allow that to be like your source of truth and iterate

159
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.290
on that.

160
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.900
I have a smaller horizontal card which I'm using for order cards, so when you have an order that's

161
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:39.650
maybe shipped order in transit, I've created like a little link, a text link here with a little icon

162
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.120
and delivered.

163
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.740
I want people to know that they can click this and interact with it in some way, shape or form, maybe

164
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.830
to see a receipt or maybe to see like all those order details.

165
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.140
And for my horizontal product cards here, these are more simple where it's just a product name in a

166
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.710
sale.

167
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.120
We're not worried about anything else at that point, and I'll show you how that's used in a recipe.

168
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.520
We have our car cards, which are pretty standard.

169
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.770
We have our like our default and then our quantity version.

170
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.720
When we swipe left, we can edit the quantity and we have our color cards here.

171
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.160
Very simple.

172
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.870
These are our growing cards.

173
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.180
So they will grow based off of the content.

174
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.070
So if I select a new image.

175
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.610
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to bring this all the way up so we can see.

176
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.080
We have our electronics.

177
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.190
I'm going to hide that.

178
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.470
And if I bring in.

179
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.940
A new image.

180
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.260
It'll shrink.

181
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.480
Same with fashion.

182
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.640
Same with.

183
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.600
Anything, really.

184
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.300
So I've done the same exact thing for this.

185
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:50.370
So if I want to create like a text button or maybe like this is a checkbox kind of thing, know like

186
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.940
select all the different types of categories that you're interested in.

187
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.020
And this one could be gaming.

188
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.940
If I select it, then it turns with a yellow background with the black text on top.

189
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.500
So just to show it's selected, I have a text button, I have just a text card.

190
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.580
And you know, I've created these just because I don't know if I'll ever use them.

191
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.970
I don't even think like if I if I were to use something like this.

192
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.100
And there is my variation.

193
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.450
I don't think I would use orange.

194
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.340
I would probably use something more subtle.

195
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.500
Maybe I would use like nice light gray.

196
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.370
So, I mean, you don't have to stick to the colors that you're creating these components and they're

197
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.410
meant to be used in any which way you like.

198
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.840
And then I have a fixed button here.

199
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.930
So nothing's going to change as I.

200
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.090
Ad copy.

201
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.510
And that's meant to be that way on purpose.

202
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.600
So that way I know I'll have maybe two lines of text.

203
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.920
Here are three lines at most, and these will all be able to say maybe like if I.

204
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.780
Create like a grid.

205
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.330
So I'll show you what that looks like.

206
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:58.980
And they go like, I have a grid that is able to accompany things like just the rest of the page.

207
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:04.710
So it really complements if I want to create like a section here that says like, you know, latest

208
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:09.210
trends and so on and so forth, and just to point people into other funnels.

209
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.440
So that's how I've set up cards and cards like you can see they're incredibly complex.

210
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.970
Like these ones are pretty complex.

211
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.060
But, you know, these are kind of like necessary, especially for our use case.

212
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.190
We're using a lot of cards, especially with products.

213
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.750
There's a lot of descriptions.

214
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:32.010
There are a lot of different elements like prices, old prices, pills, reviews, categories, names,

215
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.590
buttons, icons, imagery.

216
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:42.270
So this is an example of a really complex component and how we can use them if we look into our assets.

217
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:51.000
Just very quickly, we can see we have our cards here and I can see all my different cards.

218
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.050
So if I wanted my larger vertical cards, I'm going to go to my vertical.

219
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.150
I'm going to see all the variation.

220
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:05.620
I see large scale, large staff pick, I want a sale card and right there I can go right in.

221
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.710
And you may be thinking, why is there so many different folders?

222
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.560
I mean, if there weren't, it would be a mess.

223
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.410
So have 20% off sale and I can just easily add to that.

224
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.940
If I wanted to.

225
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:26.390
I can take this and be like, okay, I'm creating some sort of recipe and we're going to do that soon.

226
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.080
I'm creating a recipe and I want Oh, I don't want another sale card.

227
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.750
I actually want a large default card.

228
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.490
And this is where it's so powerful within Figma to create these variations and easily swap them.

229
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.800
Oh, I don't want another default card.

230
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.350
I want a sale and staff pick.

231
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.270
I don't want a sale and staff pick.

232
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.430
I want just a staff pick.

233
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.300
So you create those variations for those different use cases and you'll see like just like that I've

234
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.800
created four different variations and I can go in there and select all the different options and customize

235
00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.520
them the way I like.

236
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.350
And I'm not going to create a component based off of that, but it just gives me all the options I need.

237
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:09.680
And that is how I've built out cards for our design system.
