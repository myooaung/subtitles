00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.870
And welcome back.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.890
I want to show you a property that is commonly used with images.

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.670
So I have a really funny picture here of an alpaca.

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.900
So we're going to copy that.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.660
Actually, we're going to use the link for this and we're going to add an image to our website.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.960
Let's just make our font size a little bit smaller.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.770
Perfect.

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.830
And I'm going to try and add a picture to the left over here.

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:33.650
So if we go to our about page and in our section over here, we can try and add a picture.

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.570
So let's do an image tag.

11
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.360
And if you remember, we have a source.

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.030
And that source, I just copy and pasted the link.

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.520
And if I save this and refresh.

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.940
Oh, that's a big picture.

15
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.690
So as you may remember, we have to do with.

16
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.630
Let's do 50 pixels and height, 50 pixels.

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.800
Let's say then refresh and you can see that we broke.

18
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.840
Let's make that a little bit bigger, actually.

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.890
Let's do.

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.120
202 hundred.

21
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.350
Perfect.

22
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.950
You can see here that we actually broke a bit of our case.

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.140
And that is because if you look over here, we have used this selector which says immediate neighbor

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.070
of H two.

25
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.500
We can just do this for now.

26
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.020
Refresh and there you have it.

27
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.320
But I kind of want the text to be on the right side over here.

28
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.390
How do we do that?

29
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.860
Well, we can.

30
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.880
Select the image and use a property called float and float.

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.640
You can do right or left.

32
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.470
So if we do left.

33
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.090
And refresh.

34
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.750
It floats the image to the left and you see that the text wraps around and this property was created

35
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.680
specifically for these reasons to have images floating to either left or right and be able to have text

36
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.970
wrapped around them.

37
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.840
You'll see instances where float is being used for positioning elements.

38
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.660
And that's not the best practice because it has some funny properties for now.

39
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.330
Just use it with images if you can.

40
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.750
And one thing to note with Float and just to show you that I can do it on the right as well.

41
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.440
If I go like this and refresh, it floats to the right.

42
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.570
I kind of like this better, so we'll keep that there.

43
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.460
The other thing I want to show you is that if we added anything, so after the image, we want to have

44
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.200
a footer.

45
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.430
And in this footer, it'll say website made with love.

46
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.540
Close that and save.

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.100
And we also want to make this actually a lot smaller.

48
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.980
So I'm going to do five pixels because I want to show you something.

49
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.840
So you see over here, I've made this line hide very, very small.

50
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040
But I wanted to demonstrate for you because this is floated to the right.

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.340
Everything just kind of tax on to the left side over here.

52
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.270
And if we wanted to make sure that our footer is at the bottom of the website, we would have to use

53
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:32.040
a property that always, almost always comes with float and it's usually put in the property after the

54
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.030
float is being used.

55
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.380
So in our case footer and we have to specify clear both so if I save and refresh.

56
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.620
We have that at the bottom and let's align it to the center here and refresh.

57
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.510
Oh, I didn't.

58
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.970
And let's do center.

59
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.950
Save and refresh.

60
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.360
Perfect.

61
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.130
Now we have website made with love with a whole bunch of gibberish.

62
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.550
But I wanted to show you that property float for images and make sure that we clear so we can start

63
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.890
on the website on its own.

64
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.970
Pass the image.

65
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.640
I'll see you in the next one.

66
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.170
Bye bye.
