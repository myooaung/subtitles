1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,410
The next important part of the canvas is the target user section.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,660
Now there are often two types of users.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,390
Those are end users and stakeholders.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,630
Now the goal here is to identify groups of people who cooperation will be required to make this project

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,470
successful.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,880
Now the groups are united by common goals and concerns and include varying roles or occupations.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,200
End users are the most they're the most obvious target users.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,290
So those are probably the users we think about, pretty much only.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,420
You know, because they are the primary audience for using the application we're trying to build.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,240
Their goal is provide opportunities for developing features to help them get there faster, easier or

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,180
with more engagement, whereas their concerns help us understand what may hinder successful usage and

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,280
offers an opportunity to address them.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,010
Examples of an end user would be something like a job function.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,020
So if I were thinking.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,280
Maybe like a mechanic, that could be an end user.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,320
If we were thinking more specifically about our product and end user would be like a shopper.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,180
That's pretty vague.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:19,750
If we want to dig even deeper, we can say a family shopper, a person who shops for their family.

19
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,900
Or if I were thinking another thing, it would be maybe if we're thinking about more like a method of

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,940
use that could be like mobile user or desktop user.

21
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,770
Or maybe.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,910
Typical situational users.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,530
It could be like a last minute user.

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,550
So a person who is maybe shopping very quickly, like their situation really depends on getting in and

25
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,580
out of the product as quickly as possible because they don't have much time.

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,990
And that happens to everyone sometimes.

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:05,580
You know, we may embody different types of thought, one, but we embody different types of users because

28
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,740
sometimes they are very situational.

29
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,230
So let me just put these together.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,050
Perfect.

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,230
Generally, what we want to do is we want to get these users and we want to again, we want to get together.

32
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,160
We want to diverge.

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,780
Everyone write down on stickies, give them like 5 minutes to do that, come together.

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,570
And figure out what are the users we really want to target for this project?

35
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,060
In our case, we know maybe it's going to be a mobile user.

36
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,760
We want to really focus on last minute shoppers.

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,560
We can bring this one in here, too, so we can say that, hey, we're really focusing on this for this

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,100
project.

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,560
Family shoppers we'll think about at a later date.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,120
And we don't forget about them.

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,350
We just keep them to the side.

42
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,720
Now, next thing we're going to do is we're going to actually think about end user goals.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,680
So what questions we can ask are the following.

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,510
What frustration or pain point are we trying to help alleviate?

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,470
This is where we can ask these types of questions.

46
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,890
Get our participants.

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,180
To start writing down on stickies.

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,160
So we'll do something like this.

49
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,040
What are we trying to alleviate?

50
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,920
What results are we helping to make better?

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,650
What limitation are we helping them overcome?

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,420
What type of device would they most likely use to perform these tasks?

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,960
So we need a mobile products, mobile fast product.

54
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,280
I often get answers like that, but I usually ask them to dig a little deeper.

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:46,090
I want to a more seamless product experience.

56
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:52,750
You know, there could be like if there's a web application, maybe that translates really well to the

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,040
mobile application.

58
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,430
Maybe there's different touch points that are important.

59
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,320
What's another thing we can say?

60
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:05,830
Maybe a more personal shopping experience.

61
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,890
You know, understanding those goals really help us to think about this application in a different way.

62
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,160
And the next part after that is let's make red stickies.

63
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,100
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,450
I like the color code sometimes because it helps afterwards when we have to debrief all this.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,170
We want to talk about the end user concerns.

66
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,340
What would make them hesitate to take on a new application?

67
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,640
What ill consequence is likely to happen with this application?

68
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,390
What competitive level should this reach to be the preferred choice for this problem?

69
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,900
So there's a lot of tough questions to answer here.

70
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,860
One example could be like irrelevant results.

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,650
Or bad results.

72
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,520
Four searches.

73
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,620
Another one could be.

74
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,810
This could be more of a developer based answer like application stability.

75
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,970
Another one could be foggy UX.

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,280
So like I'm just writing foggy UX and that is very vague.

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,880
But that could be like, you know, users really want to know like the status of their order.

78
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,640
And if we don't allow for a really great user experience, people are just going to drop off and never

79
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,960
use our application again.

80
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,950
So these are the types of questions you're looking to ask and these are the type of answers you get.

81
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,140
And this really starts to kind of define what type of things you're going to be focusing on in this

82
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,860
project.

83
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,480
Now, what you want to do is next, we're going to just do the exact same thing for other users.

84
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,780
Now, the next set of users are stakeholders.

85
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,690
Now, these are less obviously important target users, but often prove very important to the project

86
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,500
success.

87
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,500
So you aren't really going to be like publishing an application or you're not going to be able to get

88
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,700
by like all that red tape if your stakeholders aren't on board with you.

89
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:16,400
And that's really the main factor here is to get their understanding of what their goals and concerns

90
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,880
are.

91
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,460
Many projects start as an opportunity to prove that something can work effectively to some key stakeholders.

92
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,930
Key stakeholders will include Let's remove this.

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,740
They may include something like investors.

94
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,390
They may include C-level execs.

95
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,740
They may include.

96
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,790
Buyers.

97
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,110
So an investor who uses early traction to invest in the company's success.

98
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,430
We have buyers who, like a salesperson, is trying to convince to become a customer.

99
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,200
You know, the success of the project can rely upon these stakeholders, sometimes more than the end

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,710
users.

101
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,510
And this is why we really need to focus on this part to understanding the goals and concerns of these

102
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,760
key stakeholders can inform decisions and reveal opportunities to validate the direction of the product

103
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,720
early and often.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,050
This really reduces the probability of failure throughout.

105
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,540
What will help make this project real?

106
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:27,770
You know, external teams, stakeholders, investors, sponsors, departments, partners, etc. all

107
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,000
those types of people are actually going to be the ones that are maybe paying for this project.

108
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,390
They're the ones that are pumping life into this project.

109
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,060
And we need to take them into consideration as well.

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,220
Questions could be, are the APIs available?

111
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,980
How responsive can the external team be to changes to validation rules or model design to meet the project

112
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,700
goals?

113
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,810
How can we engage with stakeholders throughout the process, whether that's like with demos, user acceptance,

114
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,480
testing, design reviews.

115
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,380
What information do each of the stakeholders really care about?

116
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,220
Some concerns may be like a question you want to ask or what are the risks?

117
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,100
Each of the stakeholders are primarily concerned about.

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,940
Generally that's going to be different for each type of user.

119
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,520
In summary, the end users help make decisions on what to build, and key stakeholders provide an opportunity

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,390
to involve those that can influence the success of the project early.

121
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,400
So their input comes in right at the beginning stages and not like when you've been working on High

122
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,690
Fidelity Designs.

123
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,630
It's really important to identify all these different types of user groups, so that way it really can

124
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,549
help inform the success of your project.

125
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,169
And that's it for target users.
