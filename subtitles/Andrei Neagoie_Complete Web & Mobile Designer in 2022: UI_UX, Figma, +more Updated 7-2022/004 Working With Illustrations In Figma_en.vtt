WEBVTT

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.890
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.430
So we're going to talk about how to use illustrations for your product.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.760
Now, illustrations are super fun when they look good.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.220
There are tons of resources out there for imagery that could really help your designs have that extra

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.240
bit of polish.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.550
I listed some in the beginning and we can go through how we can use those plugins for our product.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.700
Now the first plug in I mentioned was called Blush.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.540
So what we're going to do is we're just going to grab the plug ins over here and we are going to go

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.470
up to blush.

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.290
And there we go.

11
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.160
This is blush.

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
Now Blush is a really great plugin.

13
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.910
It's entirely free to an extent.

14
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.600
You do need to sign up if you want larger pngs.

15
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.500
If you do want SVG, you need to pay.

16
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.550
But it's a good way to get a sense of what you may want before you actually purchase it.

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.710
It also may give you some inspiration and if you're feeling brave, you can go and make your own illustrations.

18
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.010
So what I want to do here is let's kind of put together a quick onboarding screen.

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.550
So I'm going to do is I'm going to select my frame tool.

20
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.510
So I'm going to press f, I'm going to actually select something like the iPhone 11 here and I'm going

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.210
to Press Command R to rename it and we can rename it to onboarding.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.540
Great.

23
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.010
Let's just create a quick onboarding screen.

24
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.600
Let's start with something for a search.

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.890
So let's do this quickly.

26
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.670
Let's not worry about any grids or any sizing or anything too much.

27
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.450
These are just some concepts that we're coming up with for our client habitual.

28
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.470
So let's just quickly select our type tool with T and here we go.

29
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.960
That's a little too big.

30
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.240
What we can do is we can scale down.

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.090
Search for anything that you want.

32
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.370
That could be a little headline.

33
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.430
Usually these onboarding screens have like a catchy headline.

34
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.820
They'll have an illustration, then they'll have like some buttons at the bottom, some text explaining.

35
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.860
Onboarding screens are really great for getting users excited about the app before they even get to

36
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.430
use it.

37
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.780
That's our little onboarding headline.

38
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.160
You can use the phrase like open sands or.

39
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.160
Let's go for bold.

40
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.260
Let's bring that down just a bit.

41
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.710
Up 40, 40.

42
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.000
Good.

43
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.450
We're going to stick with 40 and 115%.

44
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.600
And for the opacity, let's just do something like 70, maybe 90, 90 is good.

45
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.480
And what we're going to do here is we're going to duplicate that and we're going to bring that size

46
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.200
a little down.

47
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.410
I want you to kind of play around as I'm doing this.

48
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.000
You can play around with whatever plugin you'd like and just come up with some screens.

49
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.910
You don't have to use exactly what I'm using.

50
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.500
So another plugin that I like to use, I mentioned it before, Content Reel.

51
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.850
It's a great way to kind of just fill things up with content.

52
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.980
We've got Lorem ipsum and we're just going to put that in right there.

53
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.050
So 16.

54
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.740
Not bold.

55
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.240
We'll just do regular.

56
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.700
We'll open that up just a bit.

57
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.690
We can actually just kind of set it to a defined line height.

58
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.810
So I'll send it to 24 pixels.

59
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.340
There we go.

60
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.490
A little more space and we'll bring that opacity down.

61
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.750
So it's a little bit more readable.

62
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.810
Okay, cool.

63
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.810
This is great.

64
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.360
Quickly, create a button here.

65
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600
Great.

66
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.450
So we lost it there.

67
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.800
And there it is.

68
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.410
So we have a button.

69
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.520
Let's just quickly choose a color here.

70
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.860
I know their brand is a little bit like a yellow.

71
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.210
I don't have that yellow right now, but that's totally fine.

72
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.260
We can kind of work with what we have.

73
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.700
So we have.

74
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.190
Continue.

75
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:38.380
And then what we can do is we can have a little bit of text that just says back big distinction between

76
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.080
our primary or secondary button here.

77
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.200
We don't really want our users to hit that back button, but they shouldn't be trapped in our flow.

78
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.080
Now that we have that, let's close this plug in and let's look for illustration.

79
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.290
So we're going to bring up blush more time and let's look for some illustrations that can kind of suit

80
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.100
this screen.

81
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.420
So what do we have here?

82
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.170
So we have a bunch of different options.

83
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.000
I like.

84
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.220
Let's see what this one has.

85
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.720
Cool.

86
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.970
There's a couple of different scenes that we can choose from.

87
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.550
We have these ones.

88
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.230
Small talk proposals, backgrounds, charts, living rooms, windows.

89
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.210
I like that one.

90
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.460
That kind of suits the brand a bit.

91
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.800
We got Windows perfect.

92
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.250
We can even customize the plants within there.

93
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.590
That's a little redundant, but.

94
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.580
We could do something like that.

95
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.660
Perfect.

96
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.960
That's already placed right into our file, which is so convenient.

97
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.990
You can also get a person in here as well.

98
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.460
Let's let's kind of reverse.

99
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.650
We just hit command Z.

100
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.570
We're going to also get a person.

101
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.220
There we go.

102
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.140
So we're going to put this dude right here.

103
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.770
And now we can actually just customize this person.

104
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.720
This person could be standing.

105
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.830
They could have jeans, pants or shorts.

106
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.040
They'd be really happy.

107
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.910
This guy you can't really see as happy face because he's a mustache.

108
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.110
Well, that's much better.

109
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.720
Say Hi, arms up like he's so happy he can search for anything that he wants.

110
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.640
Maybe something that's a little bit more on brand.

111
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.650
It looks pretty cool.

112
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.640
Or you could even be running or jumping, which is pretty awesome.

113
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.850
So there you go.

114
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.040
Like, we can quickly make an onboarding screen just with something like this.

115
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:52.400
I know they're PNGs, and you may not get exactly what you want, but this should inspire you to start

116
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.750
searching for something.

117
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.730
And then you can buy those illustrations or you can even start building them as you see fit.

118
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.370
These aren't too hard to build once you kind of have an understanding of what you're going for.

119
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.160
Especially like the backgrounds play around with something like this to kind of set a scene, think

120
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.440
about what you want to convey to our users before they even get into the product.

121
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.410
Get them excited.

122
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.630
Now the next plugin I love using is something called illustrations.

123
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.610
Let's bring that plugin up.

124
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.900
Here it is.

125
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.120
It's kind of cool, right?

126
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.270
Got all these different looking dudes, guy in a bikini.

127
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.850
It is fairly limited, but at least you get the actual SVG layers with something like this.

128
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.410
And you know these aren't all that bad.

129
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.450
If you go into here, you can open up a bunch of different options here.

130
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.240
So we have like doodles by Pablo Stanley.

131
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.830
So he's put this plug in together.

132
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.800
So these are the doodles collection.

133
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.620
You have peeps which are kind of cool.

134
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:01.690
You also have humans which you can select different parts and then.

135
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.050
Work with those parts any which way you see fit.

136
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.940
I just grabbed the head here.

137
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:14.500
You can give this person like green hair or yellow hair, and then you can actually start creating scenes

138
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.360
based off of your brand colors.

139
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.000
You know, they're faceless and it's kind of limited, but it's pretty interesting what you can do with

140
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.880
something like this with just your imagination.

141
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:32.080
Now, the next plug in and the last option that I have for a figma resource is called humans.

142
00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:37.240
I just showed you humans, but this is a plugin just dedicated to it.

143
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.970
So here we go.

144
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.880
Humans for figma.

145
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.910
They already have set scenes, which makes it a lot easier instead of just picking individual human

146
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.570
parts.

147
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.760
You can still do that here, but I find that this is much more easier to use because it isn't as like

148
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.520
zoomed in.

149
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.890
And you have different things that you can use as well.

150
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:03.020
Like lamps, different objects, which is pretty cool.

151
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.930
So what we're going to do is we're going to create another onboarding screen.

152
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.360
So I'm going to press F.

153
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.420
And select another frame over there.

154
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.940
I'm going to select the iPhone Screen Command R for renaming.

155
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.150
Let's rename that to onboarding again.

156
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.110
And so what we're going to do is we're just going to.

157
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.800
Grab everything over here.

158
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.430
Command.

159
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.090
See?

160
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.660
And what that's going to do is we're going to click on this frame and it's going to paste everything

161
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.730
right in there.

162
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.690
That's kind of interesting.

163
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.590
Let's actually create this frame one more time.

164
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.380
We can actually just drag that over.

165
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.620
Okay.

166
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:54.770
Now, let's rename this to, like, get results super quickly or super quick.

167
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.170
And this will be maybe like the end of our flow here.

168
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.180
So we'll discover new products.

169
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.230
Want to make sure buttons have great UX copy?

170
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.240
We want to get people excited, like I said, about the product.

171
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.870
So instead of saying something like submit or something like Next, you know, try to have some fun

172
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.470
with the way you write that copy, just give it some extra thought.

173
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.980
So.

174
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.570
Something like Discover New Products.

175
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.050
It gives more meaning to this actual action.

176
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.280
So let's use humans for figma over here.

177
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.880
So I'm going to see what I have here.

178
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.710
I'm going to pick this lady.

179
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.330
Great.

180
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.460
And then the command.

181
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.990
See, click and see.

182
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.900
Let's not worry about the frame, at least right now.

183
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.970
We're going to paste it right into our.

184
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.980
Frame.

185
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.400
And over here we can edit some of the colors.

186
00:10:54.850 --> 00:11:03.610
So you can see I want to match our brand colors so we can do something like this really quickly.

187
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.170
It doesn't need to be perfect, especially if we're just kind of building out a concept.

188
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:23.440
But it's a good way to kind of get an understanding of, Hey, does this illustration actually what

189
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.070
I need?

190
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.290
For this.

191
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.830
We can do like a nice teal or something.

192
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:32.940
I like I like teal.

193
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.230
Teal can work.

194
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:38.890
T like that.

195
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:45.910
Let's copy that hex code because I think there's a darker red that we can use it on.

196
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:47.520
Perfect.

197
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.670
Let's bring that down.

198
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.630
And there we go.

199
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.810
We kind of have like a little composition here and we can even build off of this.

200
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.290
Let's bring in some background pieces to make this a little more interesting and maybe make it actually

201
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.600
convey some sort of quickness.

202
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.350
So what do we have here?

203
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:08.050
Let's find some background images like we can have something like this.

204
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.750
So you can bring this into the frame just to add a little bit more visual interest.

205
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.100
So send it to the back.

206
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.120
Perfect.

207
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.320
We have a clock.

208
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.780
So definitely a clock could work.

209
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.200
And there you go.

210
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.000
I mean, it doesn't take much to actually just start creating a scene.

211
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.820
Let's paste that right in.

212
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.340
I mean, this may get a little too busy.

213
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:49.530
But we have something really nice and it doesn't necessarily match our brand colors just yet.

214
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.640
But I mean, we're well on our way to kind of going through that visual exploration.

215
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.440
And understanding what's going to work and what isn't going to work.

216
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.120
I really like this style here and this style.

217
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.320
Actually, it's fun too.

218
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.880
It really depends on the tone of your brand.

219
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.170
Like this seems much more fun, much more joyful.

220
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.020
There seems a little bit more serious.

221
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.970
It really depends what you're going for.

222
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.220
Use these as inspiration.

223
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.710
Just get creative and you can make some really exciting and interesting scenes.

224
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.400
And just like that, we have a couple of onboarding screens that we can work with.

225
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.280
So take some time by yourself.

226
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.350
Go through this process.

227
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.440
Figure out what illustrations could work for an onboarding screen.

228
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.510
Think about what our client would want, what the goal of our product is.

229
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.550
Users can get results really quickly.

230
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.800
You just can get personalized results.

231
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.020
Personalized products, personalized recommendations.

232
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:48.410
So you can play on that and try to find some illustrations that could really suit that and really get

233
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:53.630
our users excited for the next step within that tutorial, or even just getting excited to actually

234
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.710
use our application.
