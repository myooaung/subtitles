00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:02.230
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.850
How was the exercise?

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.220
Hopefully it wasn't too difficult.

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.900
But if it was and you weren't able to finish it, don't worry.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.430
We're going to go over the steps.

6
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.210
And luckily for you, once we do this, you'll have a template that you can use for all your websites.

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.390
Because what we'll build will be something responsive that you can customize to your own liking, but

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.960
you will at least know the best practices after this video of how to do these common patterns that we

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.580
see in a lot of websites.

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.380
So let's get started.

11
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.980
The first thing I want to do to convert this page is, well, a few things.

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.630
Let's go to the HTML page first and let's start off with the navigation.

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.500
That is the header over here.

14
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.660
A lot of websites have some sort of a header at the top.

15
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.990
The first thing I want to do is to actually use semantic HTML and be more descriptive in what we are

16
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.710
doing.

17
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.250
So in our case instead of div, I'm going to use the nav html element and this something that we've

18
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.240
already talked about.

19
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.480
And instead of just having header here.

20
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:20.870
I'm going to have a ull class or ull element that will have a class name of main.

21
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.270
Nev.

22
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.770
And in here we can just have lye elements.

23
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.150
That will have an anchor tag.

24
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.070
And because we don't really have we won't have any links for this example, we can obviously do whatever

25
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.810
new HTML page that we want to reference, but for now we can just leave it blank.

26
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.150
So the first one will, let's just say, be about and we can copy and paste this for the other items

27
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.690
as well.

28
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.420
We'll have, let's just say, products.

29
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.160
We'll say our team.

30
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.970
And then finally.

31
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.920
We'll have.

32
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.250
Contacts.

33
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.390
If I save this and refresh, there's.

34
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.410
Our navigation.

35
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.030
Doesn't look very good, does it?

36
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.920
In real life, most of the time we see the navigation at the top, and sometimes we also see that there's

37
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.530
navigation links at the top and one all the way to the right that's pushed to the right edge, such

38
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.760
as contacts.

39
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.720
So let's try and do that where we have about products in our team at the top over here and then contacts

40
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.210
all the way to the right at the very edge.

41
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.590
So for that, we can create a new class at the very last item that we want to, let's say push and we'll

42
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.930
add the CSS classes now.

43
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.300
If I go to or let's say this first, if I go to style class.

44
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.710
We can create our.

45
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.940
Navigation here now.

46
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.960
We have the main nav class which we've created, and in here we want to use Flexbox.

47
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.030
So I'm going to say display flex to activate Flexbox.

48
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.430
It sounds cool when I say activate Flexbox.

49
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.910
I want to make sure I remove these little dots in front of the name so I can just say list style non

50
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.820
which will remove these little pointers.

51
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.860
And let's say that we want the font size to be, let's say 0.7 m.

52
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.000
Fi save and refresh here.

53
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.300
All right.

54
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.680
Things are a little bit better, but still not perfect.

55
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.950
One is we want to remove any margins.

56
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.650
So I'm going to say margin.

57
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.480
Zero.

58
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.440
If I refresh.

59
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.190
All right.

60
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.770
We've removed some margins, but still not pretty.

61
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.060
We want to perhaps add some spaces in between these things.

62
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.740
I'm going to just have the class, which is our navigation items, and I'll just say that we want the

63
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.050
padding to be 20 pixels.

64
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.160
I refresh.

65
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.779
That's a lot better.

66
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.390
Okay.

67
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:25.140
And just to clean things up, let's say that our anchor tags, we also want them to be able to have

68
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.100
a color.

69
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.500
Of let's just use EF five, EF five, EF six, five refresh.

70
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.930
It's nice and whitish that looks good and we don't want those underlined.

71
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.400
So I'm going to say text.

72
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.770
Decoration?

73
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.370
None.

74
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.310
Refresh.

75
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.120
All good.

76
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:56.570
Now, because I want to start structuring this as a an actual Web page, I'm going to go to our zone

77
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.730
class and just remove our padding and margin because we don't really need it.

78
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.380
Refresh here.

79
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.840
Things are going to start looking ugly, but at least we've moved all this white space.

80
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.290
And then finally our display.

81
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.930
We are no longer going to use inline block.

82
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.530
We want to start using our Flexbox or CSS grid.

83
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.920
In our case, our main nav is going to have flex display, so we don't need our inline block anymore.

84
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.120
I'm going to save and refresh and that's a lot better because Divs are automatically blocked.

85
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:40.760
R displays for these bottom ones are now going to just be blocks, but our top one are nav bar has flex

86
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.500
now, which is great.

87
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.650
But you'll notice here we have a bit of a white gap.

88
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.110
And this is very common when you're working with CSIS.

89
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.180
Sometimes browsers by default have some sort of CSIS attached to them.

90
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.950
In this case in Google Chrome are.

91
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:11.420
Body element already has some predefined CSS classes that are built by Chrome, so we can actually remove

92
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:18.530
those and make sure that our margins are zero by saying margin auto zero.

93
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.710
And this is something I'll make sure I spell that right.

94
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.570
This is something that you'll see a lot of and you'll do a lot of when it comes to just making sure

95
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.920
that the styles or at least the margins are correct when you start off.

96
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.250
So if I refresh here, look at that, margins are gone and everything is filled on the page, which

97
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.820
is great.

98
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.040
The last thing I want to do is to move contacts all the way up to the right.

99
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.100
And remember the push class that we added.

100
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.050
Well, that's going to be super easy to do.

101
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.660
All we need to do is to add a.

102
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.080
Push CSE class that says margin left.

103
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.380
To be auto.

104
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.390
And with this auto if I refresh.

105
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.850
Contacts goes all the way to the right.

106
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.950
If I inspect this element.

107
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.920
So I just right click and click on inspect and let's make this a little bit bigger so we can see.

108
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.240
If I hover over, I push here.

109
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.520
We see that each element has its own box.

110
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.030
But because we did margin left auto.

111
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.020
Our ally element, it's going to get automatically pushed because it has this automatic margin that

112
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.640
it creates to the very end.

113
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.690
If I did margin write, for example, and I refresh here.

114
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:52.700
Our margin would now actually be all the way to the right to fill up the entire width of the viewport.

115
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.240
But let's go back to left.

116
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.040
Whoops, let's go back to left.

117
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.230
Save and refresh here.

118
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:09.530
The neat part about this is that with this margin left auto, I can now resize our page and you'll see

119
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.740
that contacts is always going to be to our right.

120
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.660
This is something that you'll see in a lot of websites, and we did that fairly fast.

121
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.920
Not too bad, right?

122
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:26.510
The last thing that I want to fix here is, as we'll notice as we get closer and closer, it kind of

123
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.100
overlaps our team.

124
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.530
And, well, now we have this weird little context that overflows.

125
00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.940
How can we fix this?

126
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.950
Let's tackle that in the next video.
