00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello and welcome back to another video.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,880
We actually have a couple of great videos coming up about the history of the Web.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,760
And you might be asking again, come on, let's get to coding.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,570
But this is really important because we need to understand what problems we had in the past and how

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,900
we found solutions to those problems and where we are now.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,570
We need to understand what this whole thing of being a web developer means and what problems we're solving

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,000
and what we did in the past and what we do today.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,540
So today we're going to talk about Tim Berners-Lee, the person who invented the World Wide Web in 1989.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,130
And I have a picture of him right here, and we're going to talk about him because he's the first web

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,730
developer.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,130
And in order to explain that concept, we need to make a distinction between the Internet and the World

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,850
Wide Web.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,510
I have this website that I'll share in the links below.

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,360
It's really, really good if you kind of want to get a history lesson.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,110
But essentially the Internet started off with the ARPANET in 1969, basically a military project, and

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,370
it was more of a test.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,870
It connected a few universities such as Utah, UCLA, and throughout the seventies, the eighties.

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,670
It kept growing.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,890
But there was one problem that they had, and that was essentially for the academics.

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,890
They needed a way to share documents.

21
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,640
And up until the World Wide Web existed, the Internet was there.

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,150
But it was really, really hard for computers to communicate with each other, to share academic papers

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,200
between each other.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,500
Most of the time, each computer had their own way of doing things.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,790
You can think of this as languages, so it's kind of like communicating with people from different countries

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,620
and a language that you don't know.

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,220
Yeah, sure, you can make it work, but it's very, very difficult.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,050
So that was the problem.

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:53,280
And Tim Berners-Lee, what he did and he was working at CERN at the time, he actually created the World

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,060
Wide Web.

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,800
And what the World Wide Web is, it's the w w w that we see whenever we type in Google.com over here

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,310
is essentially a common language that computers can speak with the World Wide Web saying, hey, from

33
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,410
now on, everybody, if we want to communicate together, if we want to share images or if you want

34
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,910
to share files, let's just have this agreed upon language, agreed upon protocol in order to share

35
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,170
these documents together.

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,460
So that's what it is.

37
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,060
The servers, the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the browsers all work on top of the World Wide Web.

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,400
So you can think of it as the Internet is.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,630
Your phone and the World Wide Web is Instagram that runs on your phone.

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,420
So it's essentially a decentralized application.

41
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,960
Now, how is Tim Berners-Lee, the first web developer?

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,370
He actually created the first browser and the first server.

43
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,020
And later on, we're actually going to talk about what he did with the files over here as well.

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,030
But he created the very, very first server and web browser, but also the first website, and they

45
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,470
actually still have a copy of it.

46
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,110
This is the very first website ever.

47
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,230
And it's from 1991, and this is what it looked like.

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:17,140
He created this ability for people to communicate and link to other documents so that we have this growing

49
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,760
knowledge base of the world.

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,820
In the next lesson, we're going to be talking about the history of these files, what they mean, what

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,340
problem they solved and how they came to be.

52
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,850
I'll see you in the next one.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,560
Bye bye.
