00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,170
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,660
So I want to take a break here and talk about something that well, I think it's really exciting and

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,870
should get you excited.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,120
That is that technology is evolving.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,710
What does that mean?

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:24,630
It means that what you're learning is going to change over the years because everything in tech is fast,

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,480
is moving fast, is changing fast.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,770
But the good news for you is that you're learning the latest and greatest right now.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:40,260
So if the best developer in the world stopped to learning three years ago, they're going to be behind.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,250
Your advantage of just getting started to code is that technology is moving so fast that for you to

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,250
catch up to somebody, well, you can do that in a really fast time.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,280
As a matter of fact, if really good coders aren't always keeping up to date with the latest trends

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,600
they fall behind.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:09,120
This is a good thing for you because text editors, dependencies, APIs, libraries, best practices,

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,290
even programming languages are constantly evolving and changes.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,110
Some of these words on the screen may not even mean anything to you.

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,780
Maybe you don't even know what they are.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,740
Don't worry.

19
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,500
We're going to learn in the course all about these.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,060
But you see, the reason I created this course and I created this course back in 2018.

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,510
That's a long time ago.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,260
Since then, every year I update the course because technology is evolving.

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,040
I want this course to be up to date.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,590
I want this course to teach the latest trends so that you finish the course and you can go off on your

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,790
own and get hired.

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,810
That's the goal.

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,190
But you see, every year, as I was updating the course, I realized that the old videos are actually

28
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,850
extremely valuable because all the courses out there, all the other courses out there teach you just

29
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,040
that, a snapshot of what the current development practices are.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,930
But what I can do with my course, since it has been around for such a long time, is provide a historical

31
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,830
snapshot.

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:21,480
I can take you from the very beginning of a popular library like React and show you how it evolved,

33
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,490
how the best practices evolved.

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,520
And this way, the way you learn with this course isn't that you just learn all these new things.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
You also get to learn the all things and then how to update them.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,260
It's as if you were working for years as a developer.

37
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,880
You have these battle stories to tell of the old ways of doing it and how we do it in a newer way.

38
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,640
So as you'll see in all of our projects as we learn new technologies.

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,920
New APIs, new best practices.

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:02,170
I'm going to start off with how we used to do it and then show you how to update, for example, libraries,

41
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,110
how to update projects to the latest version.

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,490
This way you actually experience what a developer does.

43
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,650
A developer is maintaining software, maintaining programs.

44
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,030
When you finish coding a project, it's never done.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,600
It's constantly evolving.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,330
New things are being discovered in the world.

47
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,790
New technology is being created.

48
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,150
Even small little libraries are being improved upon.

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,600
So your job as a developer is not just to write code, but to also maintain it, to constantly improve

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,470
it, to make sure that it's running years and years from now.

51
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:46,000
So as you go through this course, I want you to see every video that I show you how to update something,

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,860
every video where I show you how we want to maybe change a version of a library or how an API such as

53
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:00,490
in the final project are clarify API changes over time and we have to fix things in order for our projects

54
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,160
to work.

55
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,030
That's the life of a developer.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,550
You're a problem solver.

57
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:15,010
You are constantly fluidly changing, evolving with the technology, and if you're able to do that,

58
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,660
then you're a great developer.

59
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:23,740
And I'm really excited about this course because I've kept these old videos and then shown the updated

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,340
videos right after that video to show you how you would have experienced it a few years ago and how

61
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,840
you experience it now.

62
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,640
And I think that's a great way to learn.

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,990
I think that's an exciting way to learn, to give you experience without necessarily having that actual

64
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,890
experience.

65
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,680
All right, I'm talking too much.

66
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,940
Let's get back to coding.

67
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,630
Bye bye.
