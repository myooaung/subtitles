00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.160
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.580
So we're going to be talking about portfolios now.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.340
We have a lot of different images here that we've been working on which are like our final compositions.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.030
And like when we get to a part in our project where we are really happy with the final results, even

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.180
though projects are forever changing, I mean, we always iterate on them.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.340
There will be a point where, you know, we kind of like take our foot off the gas pedal and we're ready

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.230
to just kind of display our work and just talk about it a bit with the community, get some feedback.

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.590
And also it's great to use it as a means to find a new job and impress potential employers.

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.710
So what I've done here is I've taken a bunch of different screens, as you can see, and what I'm going

10
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.320
to do is I'm going to export all of these to my desktop, so I'm just going to select them all and I'm

11
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.400
going to go down here.

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:58.500
And so right now they are all set within a frame size as the iPhone X and I'm happy with that for now.

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.630
And I'm just going to click export.

14
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.510
And over here you can export them to whatever type of file type that you like.

15
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.120
I typically just use PNG, there's JPEG, there's SVG if you're using like vectors and stuff like that

16
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.380
and PDFs.

17
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.680
So I mean there's different options here, but I always feel like the PNG is probably the best option.

18
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.300
You can export with the contents only if you have a transparent background, you can kind of remove

19
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.520
that background as well.

20
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.630
In this case, we're going to actually keep the fill in the background of these frames and we're gonna

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.770
show that in the export.

22
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.740
So I'm going to export these six layers and they're going to go straight to my desktop over here.

23
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.600
So let's just save that.

24
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.020
So now that we have those images there, what we want to do is we want to display them in some sort

25
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.890
of way.

26
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.720
Now let's create a new page and we'll just call this page portfolio pieces.

27
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.270
And what we can do here is we can do shift command K and that is going to bring up our image placement

28
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.090
kind of dialog box over here and we are going to drop those images into this file.

29
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.380
So they're all placed.

30
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.560
So here we go.

31
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.500
Now they're actual just pings.

32
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.230
So we are just going to place these nicely together.

33
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.240
And then.

34
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.800
There you go.

35
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.670
So now that we have all these images that we want to work with, nicely placed together, what we're

36
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.760
going to do is we're going to bring up the iPhone mockups so you can find these types of mockups anywhere.

37
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.100
So I have a couple of different variations here and these will be available to you as well.

38
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.570
So I have like an isometric view if you kind of like that.

39
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.380
Look, if you just want that view of like a realistic iPhone X, you can get that with this.

40
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.710
Same thing with these visas.

41
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.160
These are just kind of colorized a bit.

42
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.830
So this is kind of like a grayish purple.

43
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.510
We have a yellow border.

44
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.730
So if you see, like, I'm just going to take this off.

45
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.210
We have like a yellow border, so it can go with the type of content that you're working with.

46
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.000
So what I'm going to do actually is I like this yellow a lot.

47
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.850
I'm actually going to take this whole frame and I'm going to just copy it into our Portfolio Pieces

48
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.450
section.

49
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.310
So over here I have my portfolio pieces section and I'm really happy with that.

50
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.850
So you can see this is where the screen is.

51
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.490
So we can just call this onboarding.

52
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.980
So we'll place the onboarding image in this one.

53
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.170
So we have the onboarding the onboarding frame over here.

54
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.160
And what I like about this is we're going to kind of just create like a really nice composition that's

55
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.790
going to show off just our general design here.

56
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:05.050
So I'm just going to copy that option and drag and a command, see that and then go into this iPhone

57
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.750
and I'm going to try and find where I can place this.

58
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.680
So it actually displays really nicely within the screen.

59
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.920
So it's probably within content here.

60
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.750
And there you go.

61
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.250
So I've placed it in here.

62
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.930
You can kind of remove that screen, that placeholder, and there you go.

63
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.120
You kind of have this perfectly placed image inside of this iPhone.

64
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.570
And there's so many different ways you can do this, like if I wanted to.

65
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.530
So now that I have this iPhone, let's just place it nicely.

66
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.170
So now it's just displaying this one image.

67
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.410
So if we wanted to kind of show multiple images, we can like do side by side if we want if we want

68
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.520
to show like a flow, the entire onboarding flow, we can do that.

69
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.700
We can also show kind of like a little bit of a stylized rendition of our images.

70
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.290
If he wants to just kind of make it a little bit more dynamic.

71
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.070
Something like that if we want to show like different variations.

72
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.130
Now, this is purely speaking from, like I would say, from a dribble perspective, if you just want

73
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.020
to take a quick snapshot of your work and then post it there, this is like an awesome way to do it.

74
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.650
And look at that.

75
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.820
It took us like 5 seconds to just put together a quick composition.

76
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.310
Even if I wanted to change the background color, I can do that if I wanted to add a little bit more

77
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.990
depth to that background color.

78
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.390
I can do that just by kind of adding a little bit, a darker color on the outside so we can kind of

79
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.340
just like make this.

80
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.610
A little bit of a gradient.

81
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.460
So I mean, there's different ways you can do this.

82
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.130
And there you go.

83
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.880
Like, we already have, like, a dribble shot ready to go.

84
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.090
It just took us like 5 seconds.

85
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:56.240
Really high quality and very interesting to look at now from a perspective of like showing off different

86
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.930
types of pieces of your work for like your portfolio website and stuff like that.

87
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.080
You can still do something like this, but I would argue that if you wanted to show off certain interactions,

88
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.650
like that's the place to do it, you could also just really scale things up a bit more.

89
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.350
So if you really want to showcase like how this interaction worked, like you would really zoom in to

90
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.320
like how this slider would be featured.

91
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.940
So definitely think about that when you're exporting your content for your portfolio, whether that

92
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:33.150
be like on something like Behance or something like portfolio website, just be very mindful that you

93
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.290
want to showcase not just like, oh, look how pretty this looks, but I want to showcase different

94
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.430
interactions.

95
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:45.360
I want to showcase how a slider like our carousel like this would work or what happens when I click

96
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.570
on the different navigation pieces, or just like a general flow, like what happens when I go ahead

97
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.190
and I click a search?

98
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.230
Like, what does that look like?

99
00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.920
So keep that in mind when you're exporting like different types of designs for the sake of your portfolio,

100
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.600
because this will really help you just kind of show off your work much more easier.

101
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.430
And there's so many different resources out there just like this, this and this.

102
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.440
So let's take this, for example.

103
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.210
We'll bring that in really quickly and let's see what that looks like.

104
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.520
I just copied the screen.

105
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.380
So let's let's do that again.

106
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.310
There it is.

107
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.290
We'll do iPhone X minimal.

108
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.450
And we're going to bring that into our portfolio.

109
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.580
And for this one, we'll take this.

110
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.730
So I'm going to copy that and go to my screen.

111
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.440
It should work.

112
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.770
So what you can do is there's a plug in.

113
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.400
That can turn your.

114
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.610
Your screen shot over here, like into an isometric view.

115
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.390
So like that.

116
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.360
So this is just a 45 degree angle.

117
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.640
And so what we're going to do is.

118
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.460
Is this going to flip it?

119
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.980
Just make sure that fits.

120
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.480
And there you go.

121
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.980
So with the use of like a plugin, you can really help make your designs look a little bit more dynamic

122
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.210
with something like that.

123
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.930
What you can also do, you can just copy and paste something like this over and over again.

124
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.710
So this is different shadows.

125
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.760
So you can copy and paste this.

126
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.740
If you want to group it, you can group it.

127
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.550
And make multiple versions of it.

128
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.420
You don't need to have a drop shadow on it if you don't want to.

129
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.440
Just kind of have it floating there.

130
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.830
But you can show like your entire application in just like one shot of all the different screens.

131
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.750
So that's how I would approach building out your portfolio images.

132
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.950
Use real devices.

133
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.780
Sometimes you don't need to like if it's a web based product, you could just kind of show just the

134
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:33.090
screenshot of the entire screen, but show off your beautiful work and it's really easy to do.

135
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:40.170
So just search even on Google for mock ups, for iPhones or Google pixels or whatever type of device

136
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.730
that you're using, even web browsers.

137
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.430
And there's so many figma options out there.

138
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.230
So all of these will be available to you and go out there and start exporting the designs that you created

139
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.340
to show off.
