00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,839
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,720
I want to show you another easier way to put your page online on GitHub.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,190
That is fairly new.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,140
All we need to do is click on a new repository.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,160
We can create whatever we want.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,330
Startup of the Year.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,860
We'll call it that for now.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,100
We'll make sure it's public.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,750
We can add a description if we want and we can initialize this repository with a read me.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,840
Now if I click Create Repository.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:42,680
I now have an empty project and all we need to do here is click on upload files.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,720
And we can just drag and drop our files.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,080
In my case, I can just grab these three files we've been working on, drag them over here.

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,790
It's going to upload them and we'll just hit commit changes.

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,850
And check it out.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,320
Once that's done.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,500
We have our page.

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,900
Now, in order for this to work, we have to make sure that there's an indexed HTML file.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,170
And all we need to do is now go to settings.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,690
Scroll all the way down to GitHub pages right here.

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,740
Select the source as the master branch.

22
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,990
And don't worry, we're going to go over GitHub and how it works later on in the course.

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,610
We have a dedicated section for it, but I just want to make sure that we can put things online so you

24
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,900
can show off to your friends.

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,100
If I scroll back to GitHub pages now, you'll see that I have your site is ready to be published right

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,460
here so I can actually copy this link.

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,050
Or click on it and look at that at this URL.

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,950
My website is now online and as you can see.

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,370
It works just like we had.

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,310
But this time it's an actual website online.

31
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,229
So this link I can send to my friends and show off.

32
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:14,390
Now, one thing I like to do here when I create a page on GitHub is to copy this link.

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,030
Go back to.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,900
The project.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:27,060
And added to the description here as the website so that in the future.

36
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,900
I can just click on here and I'm directed to my website.

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,260
All right.

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,460
That was a lot of work.

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,040
But congratulations, you have your website online.

40
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,150
Go share it with your friends, with your family, with your dog, with your enemies.

41
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,220
And I'll see you in the next video.

42
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,120
Bye bye.
