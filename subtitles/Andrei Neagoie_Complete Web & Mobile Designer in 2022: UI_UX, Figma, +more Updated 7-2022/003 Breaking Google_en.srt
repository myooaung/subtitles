00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:08,780
And the last section we talked about how we have Google.com and if we enter an IP address, we essentially

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,090
get all these files from Google.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:18,080
So if we look back at the diagram that we had, we see here that the Google servers just send us a couple

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,230
of files which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,390
Again, something that we'll cover later on.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,700
But for now, based on that knowledge, we should be able to break Google.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,680
So let's play something.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:38,300
If you open up Google Chrome and you go into view, then developer, then developer tools.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,360
You're going to have a screen over here that pops up.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,740
You might want to move it up and down just so you can see better.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Let me just scroll this down a bit so you can see you'll see over here that there is a little icon on

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,100
the left with a pointer and a window.

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,180
If you click on that and now go to the website, you'll see it selects a bunch of different things.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,630
So it's just an element selector.

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,460
So let's just click on this.

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,960
So when I click on this, it takes me to the part of the HTML file that essentially tells Google to

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,370
put in Google search here.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,640
So based on that, we can do something fun.

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:23,720
We can get the valley over here of google search and let's change it to Andre search press enter.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,750
Look at that.

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,510
We have we now just changed Google to have Andre search over here.

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,070
That's very, very cool.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,790
I want you to play around with that and see what you can do.

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,030
For example, if I now select this, I'm just like, I don't want this.

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,130
I'm going to press the delete key and just delete it.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,640
Look at that.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,870
I can delete that.

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,250
I don't like that either.

30
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,790
I'm going to press delete on that as well.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,140
And let's see.

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,830
You know what?

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,760
On the entire website.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,160
I want this entire body thing gone.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,760
Delete.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,360
Look at that.

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,860
We just completely deleted Google now you must be freaking out.

38
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,050
What happened?

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,530
Am I going to get sent to jail?

40
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,000
I just deleted Google Wallet.

41
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,260
No, not really.

42
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,460
Press enter and Google is back now.

43
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,300
Why is that?

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,870
Well, if we go back to our diagram, we have Google servers and we were playing around with one of

45
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,820
these files and we just modified it.

46
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,700
We essentially just set delete, delete.

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,750
So Google was gone.

48
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,460
But when I made that request, again, Google servers, no problem.

49
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,810
We have these files.

50
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,520
They send these files all over again back to the server.

51
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,550
Hopefully that made sense to you.

52
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:43,810
We see that the browser essentially is a tool, a piece of software that can receive files from servers

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,280
and it knows how to read them.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,910
So that look that we get pretty Google and we can type in all the searches that we want in the world.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,310
All right.

56
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's get to the next section where we talk about the Internet backbone.

57
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,590
See you in the next one.

58
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,220
Bye bye.
