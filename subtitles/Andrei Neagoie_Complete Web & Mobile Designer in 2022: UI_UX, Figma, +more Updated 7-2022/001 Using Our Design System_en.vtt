00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.160
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.540
So we're going to be talking about how we bring everything together.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.650
So we talked about how to create different types of components.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.280
We talked about like creating recipes for our design system.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.830
Let's take a look at what that looks like right now.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.910
So over here we have our major like foundational base styles.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.580
We have our colors, we have things like typography, iconography.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.920
If we go into our components, we have stuff like avatars, checkboxes, different various inputs.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.380
And you may be asking me, Well, Daniel, how do I bring this all together?

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.790
Like, how do I use these things?

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.090
So at this point, you've probably have started to created some more high fidelity designs.

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.960
You've settled on more of a specific style.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.460
So as you can tell, like things have come together a bit more and there's much more like style definition

14
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.910
in the different types of components that we've created.

15
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.050
So you can tell that we definitely have a direction to go in.

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.030
Now, as I said before, design systems are always changing.

17
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.030
We are constantly iterating on them, but they give us a great way to have like a bunch of components

18
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.770
in one place that you can update and have it update through the rest of your application.

19
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.280
So this is my current iteration of the design system for habitual and what I've created.

20
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.000
Here are a bunch of recipes like I've showed you, and now I want to show you what it looks like when

21
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.560
we actually start bringing it together.

22
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.170
I have a bunch of different pages laid out.

23
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.250
I have our onboarding pages, registration, and as you can tell, they all have that very similar style

24
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.920
and there's a lot of visual cohesiveness.

25
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.680
So let me show you how I went about and actually did that.

26
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.080
So let's go to the wish list.

27
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.060
I think that would be a great place to start.

28
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.810
So you can tell like a lot of things have changed since the last time.

29
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.340
How did I create this actual page?

30
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.230
So as you can tell over here, I've created a frame called the header.

31
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.350
Let's just bring that up so we can see.

32
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.930
So I have everything that scrolls.

33
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.820
I have our footer, which is our nav.

34
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.570
And what I've done here is I've actually gone to my assets tab here and I'm looking through here and

35
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:34.330
I see my main navigation component and I want the wish list component, so I will just drag that into

36
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.590
my frame.

37
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.560
Like I've done here.

38
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.170
And then I set my component there.

39
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.940
And then if I change that on my design system, then it will automatically update in this mockup over

40
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.390
here.

41
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.990
So I have one for wish list.

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.180
I have one for our cart or a shopping bag.

43
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.000
I have four orders.

44
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.650
And you see, we have different variations.

45
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.740
Now, if we take a look at what we have over here, this is our swipe container.

46
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.340
And you may actually remember this from when we created a recipe for product cards.

47
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.470
So we had large product containers.

48
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.630
And what I've done is I've actually just kind of taken this recipe that we've put together.

49
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.720
And I've just copied it over there.

50
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.570
Now, do I think we're going to use this forever?

51
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.890
Probably not, actually.

52
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.680
I can guarantee that things are going to change.

53
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.310
Different types of details will change within these product cards.

54
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.510
But this is our iteration right now, and this is what we think the user wants right now.

55
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.600
So if I go back, I have a recipe over here and I will continue to use this anywhere.

56
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.570
I see a large container that needs to be used.

57
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.220
And that's what I mean about having so much reusability within your design system.

58
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.280
You may also find that there's some components that you may have forgotten or some certain styles that

59
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.450
you may have forgotten.

60
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.760
It's very hard to build an application from the ground up so quickly without taking into account all

61
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.140
the different use cases.

62
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.470
Now more specifically, I'm talking about like the heading over here.

63
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.210
The last time I thought I was going to use a more traditional, just like a capitalized text.

64
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.060
I've done an all caps header for the different types of content that follows below.

65
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.670
And then I've done a gray link or a underlined link that's all capitalized right beside the on the right

66
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.269
side.

67
00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:29.520
Now, I didn't think about this before, but as I started to build out the fidelity of our application,

68
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.660
I found out that I need a little bit more variation with my typographic styles.

69
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.640
So I'm going to either create a new style or I'm going to just kind of create a variation.

70
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.970
So I have like the link here, which is this style, the interactions link style, and I've just kind

71
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.010
of capitalized it on my own and I may go back into our typography section and actually create a capitalized

72
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.760
version there.

73
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.270
So that way it's just easily accessible since we're using it so much.

74
00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.040
You may also find that, wow, I use these two typographic elements together and I use them a lot.

75
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.950
So I may actually I may actually take them out here.

76
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.570
I'm going to actually create a frame around them.

77
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.610
And we'll call it content header.

78
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.280
And this content header will be like another recipe that we use.

79
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.610
You'll notice that whenever I move this frame then die gets moved as well.

80
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.130
This can have that on both sides.

81
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.400
So we'll see what that looks like when we start to shrink it down.

82
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:40.220
So now we have our own recipe for that section and we can just kind of copy and paste that from our

83
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.010
design system whenever we need it.

84
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.220
So remember, your design system is kind of like that source of truth and you know you're never going

85
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.720
to get it right in the first try and you're going to continually iterate on it as you see your application

86
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.540
grow and as new demands need to be met.

87
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.960
Like if you new learnings that you found out through user testing or just general analytics, you'll

88
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.630
find out that maybe we should have like a big button on the bottom of these cards that says Add to Cart

89
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.200
and I'll show you that and how we can iterate later on.

90
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.720
So this is what I've done for the Wish List page right now.

91
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.150
I've also created like different variations.

92
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.100
I'm thinking through these different use cases more in depth right now, like I've done the user flows

93
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.640
for them.

94
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.240
And I thought, okay, when you come to the Wishlist page, there's a couple of different scenarios

95
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.450
here.

96
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.170
We have like a logged out version where, you know, you haven't logged in yet.

97
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.450
So we have that CTA at the top pushes them to like a sign up or a login screen.

98
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.290
I also have like a card here that says you have no saved products.

99
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.180
You know, you can start saving to add to Wishlist or create one now, so I don't have a login.

100
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.400
This is probably going to prompt me to create one.

101
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.500
So I have that.

102
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.520
I've also incorporated different elements like illustrations.

103
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.530
So let's take a look at that really quickly.

104
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.550
So what I've done here is I've started to use these illustrations through a plug in and I'll show you

105
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.230
what that plug in is called.

106
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.270
It's actually just called illustrations.

107
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.920
So let's launch that.

108
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.780
It's running right now.

109
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
So pretty funky plug in over here.

110
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.310
And what I've done is I've just taken like one like this.

111
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.290
Let's just throw that in there.

112
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.340
Let's close that plug in.

113
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.460
So I've taken this illustration that we've gotten from that plug in.

114
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.990
I'm going to shift option.

115
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.720
Hold that so I can scale it appropriately.

116
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.690
And what I've done is I've just used our brand colors, so I'll use like the primary to replace that

117
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:38.130
and to replace the block, I'll use like just a lighter gray and just like a little use of an illustration

118
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.860
like that makes this card much more better.

119
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:47.550
Like, if we remove that, it doesn't necessarily have the, the same effect that it did prior.

120
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.380
So let's just move that up.

121
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.970
So as you can tell, it's really plain that illustration adds a little bit more of a dynamic touch to

122
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.270
it.

123
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.290
It makes it a little more exciting.

124
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.870
It gives your application a little bit more personality.

125
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.050
So that is what I've done here.

126
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:12.050
And like I said before, I've noticed that I've started to use cards like this to prompt users to do

127
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.600
certain things with like a primary CTA button.

128
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.780
I have like secondary copy and I also have the primary copy over here.

129
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:27.530
And then in illustration I'll create card and I may actually create a component out of this now because

130
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.280
I found that I'm using a bunch of different illustrations.

131
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.380
I'm using this a bunch of different scenarios that it may be reusable.

132
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.659
So that's another example of how you find more reusability as you start to design.

133
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.400
I've also created like a title over here with a background, so this is our header.

134
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.720
So all that has in there right now is the background color.

135
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:57.170
It has the wish list copy, and the avatar can actually come in here as well.

136
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.620
Okay.

137
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:07.310
You can throw that in there and then you can just say log in CTA.

138
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.730
And right now we have a nice header component as well.

139
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.420
So that is another way to start to build out your design system a bit more because we do have some top

140
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.770
navigation options.

141
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.550
Now let's take a look at some other options we have on wish list.

142
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.770
So over here, when you actually have an active list and you've logged in, you have your avatar, you

143
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.180
see how things have changed a bit.

144
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.580
You have like your wish list at the top.

145
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.980
So right now I have like a personal wish list.

146
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.850
I'm using this component in here as well, which is like your invite.

147
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:44.240
I'm using horizontal component that possibly opens up like a list where you can share this, you can

148
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.730
invite more people possibly or actually just delete the list and it'll probably open up an overlay within

149
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.850
whatever operating system you're using, whether that's iOS or Android.

150
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:58.510
As you can tell, I'm using our small wish list components that we've created these horizontal card

151
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.120
views.

152
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.290
I've created another list over here and I have another CTA, which I'm using the secondary button.

153
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.310
Now, as you can tell, like this seems like a pretty standard thing that we're going to probably be

154
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.630
using a lot of.

155
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:17.660
And this makes sense to probably create either a component out of something like this or just a recipe

156
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.160
so that we can reuse that.

157
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:26.260
And again, I'm repeating this same kind of thing over here, like a suggested for U.S. possibly showing

158
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.930
them results that are based off of their recommendations and based off of their wants within their wish

159
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:32.310
list.

160
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.890
So I have like some Bose headphones over here.

161
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.450
You know, they coincided with maybe the music that this person is listening to or, you know, just

162
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.770
general technology.

163
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.570
So that's just another option we have in Wishlist.

164
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:51.780
And the last option I have here is what happens if the user comes here and they don't have a wishlist

165
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.800
but they are logged in.

166
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.890
So now what they'll need to do is all we need to do is create a wishlist, they'll select this CTA over

167
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:04.680
here and it will prompt them to kind of name a wish list, invite some people, and then they can go

168
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.240
ahead and start saving to it.

169
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.560
So that is what we have here thus far for wish list.

170
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.270
There are so many other scenarios like what happens if we don't have a wish list?

171
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.860
What happens if we do have a wish list?

172
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.530
But what happens when we first click this?

173
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.820
Where will it go?

174
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:27.720
Will it prompt me within a modal to say I want to save to this specific wish list or that specific wish

175
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:27.960
list?

176
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.660
So as you can tell, as you start building out the application, you'll realize that, wow, there's

177
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.430
so many different use cases that I haven't necessarily thought about, and that's totally fine because

178
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.890
that's just the nature of the job and that's just the nature of actually designing from low fidelity

179
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.970
to high fidelity.

180
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:51.630
So this is how we've built out wish lists thus far, using some of the components that we've created,

181
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.820
using the recipes that we've created, and actually finding some new components and new recipes along

182
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.390
the way.
