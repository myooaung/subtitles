00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,040
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,220
So as you can tell, there are a bunch of different components a user can interact with.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,360
And maintaining those components is pretty crucial for any project.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,610
And this is generally a large task.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,340
So you want to set aside a lot of time to do something like this, especially if you're creating something

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,280
like a design system or if you're just creating a bunch of different variants of inputs because inputs

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,060
can be the most complex UI elements that we deal with.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,650
So here are some tips to building some of your very own components within Figma.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,330
Step number one, let's learn about master components.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,940
So when we create inputs within Figma, remember we need to adhere to our base unit.

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,360
I'm using eight pixels, so let's create something very simple like a single line input field.

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,660
So I'm actually just going to create a massive frame.

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,690
Where we can play around.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,950
We can call this.

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,710
Master components.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,760
And I'm going to do is I'm just going to select another frame.

17
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,680
And this can be my input field.

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,460
It's going to be 40 pixels in height.

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,910
It's going to have a border radius of five pixels.

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,840
And it's going to have a nice little stroke.

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,210
So that is our stroke.

22
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,770
Perfect.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,970
I just changed the border radius to two.

24
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,380
Okay.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,060
And let's give it a fill of white.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,070
That's fine.

27
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,050
Okay, so this is our input field.

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,680
What should we call it?

29
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,760
There we go.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,800
Input field.

31
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,070
Now that this is done, we're going to use components.

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:04,100
Now, this page over here, we're going to build out a couple of different components within it.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,320
And it will serve as a kind of like our source of truth.

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,530
And by using master components, we can really reuse them across all of our designs.

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,020
So let's turn this input into a component.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,560
So to turn it into a component, you can right click and create a component, or you can use the quick

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,240
shortcut, which is option command.

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,590
K So now you'll notice it's a component.

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,580
If I go back and Press Command Z, you can also create a component up there.

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,810
Now it's a component, which is pretty awesome.

41
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,040
Let's copy it somewhere.

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
So I'm going to copy it right here.

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,000
You can tell that the little icon has changed and that means that this is now an instance of the master

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,450
component or the parent, whichever you want to call it.

45
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,590
I call it the master.

46
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,900
And that's what Figma calls it as well.

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,280
You can copy this component anywhere you want as much as you want.

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,200
But as soon as we kind of edit the master component, it reflects in the instance.

49
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,860
So this makes managing inputs so much easier.

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,660
So let's take a look at how we can update some inputs across our designs by changing something in the

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,020
master.

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,060
So this is our master.

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,130
What we're going to do here is we are actually going to give it a fill.

54
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,670
Of like a very light grey and you can tell that it's changing their.

55
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,530
There you go.

56
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,310
We have a couple of copies and we can just change them all.

57
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,370
And you can tell that they all adhere to that master component, which is totally awesome because if

58
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,010
you're creating an individual input for every single instance that you use it when you want to change

59
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,950
one, you probably are going to want to change everything else because you want to keep everything very

60
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,910
consistent.

61
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,450
Using components totally helps you do that in such an easy way.

62
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,710
So that's how you create components within Figma.
