1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,280
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,510
So I often get the question, how do I pick a typeface for my project?

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,300
And that's a very good question.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,390
I mean, we always face this dilemma when starting a project that doesn't necessarily have typeface

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,200
chosen.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,350
Sometimes a client will come to you with an established brand guideline, with established typeface

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,450
guidelines, and, you know, sometimes they're okay, and that's an optimal scenario.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,130
Sometimes they aren't necessarily optimized for web.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,800
Sometimes the typefaces don't have enough variance, and they really stop you from creating enough contrast

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,400
on the screen.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,140
And, you know, they may not be good for mobile and whatever type of application or product you're

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,860
trying to build.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
That does happen.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,620
And I feel like sometimes you just need to sit down with your client and have a real good discussion

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,230
on what you can do to extend that type family or extend that type system.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:03,810
Another scenario is often people come to you with just one typeface and it happens often.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,450
Sometimes that typeface is very good.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,680
It has a lot of styles and it just doesn't suit the tone of their product or their company or their

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,670
organization.

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,960
So let's come up with a little, little fake organization over here.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
So so if we call something like the Phillips.

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,190
Foundation.

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,520
So I did have a client come up to me one time and they were a charity and we were building a new website

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,060
for them.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,360
And their font was monserrat.

26
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,630
Don't get me wrong, I love this font.

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,070
But to be your only typeface.

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,120
I mean, even if the font family is huge, let's take a look at this.

29
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,950
So many different styles.

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:00,250
It doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to suit what you're trying to achieve.

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
So let's just.

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,580
We're going to create a quick logo over here.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:05,810
So.

34
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,240
I'll use similar colours to their brand.

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,480
They had this, like, yellow, like that and like a teal.

36
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,030
So we'll just grab like a teal over here.

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,010
Okay.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,560
Cool.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
So this is their logo.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,350
Looks cool, right?

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,700
Not really.

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:44,130
I mean, it's quick, but so we have the logo for them and we noticed that OC there are type system

43
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,520
isn't necessarily the best they may have like a headline.

44
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,620
They may have some body copy.

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,160
And what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to lie plugins and grab Lorem ipsum.

46
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,560
We'll do this really quick.

47
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,210
So we have one paragraph.

48
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,190
That is huge.

49
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,590
So it's just going to go down in size just like 16.

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,520
And we are going to go to regular and to make sure the line is around 150%.

51
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,100
So, you know, they may have a headline like that.

52
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,070
They may have like other.

53
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,060
Types of things like a button.

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,470
So let's just create a quick button.

55
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,600
We're going to make that a frame.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,910
And then what we're going to do here is going to go to auto layout.

57
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,150
And we're going to we're doing this really quickly, just so I can show you what this kind of looks

58
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,720
like.

59
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,780
So a 48 pixel button in height is good.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,460
So you can see the frame over there.

61
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,490
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to give it a border radius of five pixels.

62
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,370
Still can't see anything.

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,050
The selection colors is the text.

64
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:02,980
So I'm going to change that to White and I'm going to turn this on the fill and make it black.

65
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,720
And we can even, like use.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,060
You can use the color.

67
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,470
We can make a little darker.

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,280
And let's make that typeface bold.

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,180
Too bold.

70
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,080
Okay.

71
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:22,690
So you may get, like, something like this and for like a foundation that wants to really evoke a sense

72
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,650
of, like, tradition.

73
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,260
I mean, something like this is just it's a good font, but it's just not enough.

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,660
So what I usually do is the first step is to kind of break this out a bit.

75
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,690
So I start thinking the headline can be like, What can you do to help?

76
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,300
So maybe this is like a section on their website.

77
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,930
And I think maybe that's one of the main titles and I may bump that up a bit to like 40 pixels and then

78
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,340
I may have like a subheadline and I could be like charity.

79
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,220
Our donations.

80
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,780
I may keep that in all caps.

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,570
What I'm trying to do here is create a lot more variance in the types of like headlines.

82
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,440
We have body copy just to see if there's enough variance in here that would actually like match the

83
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,450
tone of the brand.

84
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,750
So what I'll do here is I'll just create a little more letter spacing.

85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,230
I may bump this down to like 24 pixels.

86
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,520
You know, start matching the brand colors, maybe using those a little bit more could help.

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,420
And, you know, they can.

88
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,470
They definitely can.

89
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,640
So what I'm going to do here, I'm just going to keep on extending this out because we're going to we're

90
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,720
going to work here.

91
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,920
So we have learned more.

92
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,740
But in.

93
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,830
Let's stop moving.

94
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,490
There we go.

95
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,390
I may grab, like, a pillow quote.

96
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,570
Maybe this is like a.

97
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,060
Medium metallic, and this can be pumped up to like 24 pixels.

98
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,610
It's all about experimentation.

99
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,190
In the end, you really want to kind of have fun with it, try to figure out like different ways you

100
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,730
can create a little bit more visual interest.

101
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,500
You know, that's starting to work.

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,390
It's not looking too bad at all, but I don't think it's enough at this point.

103
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,260
Right now.

104
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,350
What I would do is I would go kind of searching for different fonts.

105
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,640
And when I think about charities and when I think about different types of organizations that have been

106
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,410
around for so long, I start thinking about like the different types of typefaces that would really,

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,120
you know, capture that.

108
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,220
So I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to start thinking about maybe some serif

109
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,300
typefaces.

110
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,840
So one serif typeface that I like a lot is called Palladino.

111
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,900
So let me grab like a serif typeface like that.

112
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,360
And all of a sudden, you know, it starts to have a little bit of a different feel, maybe something

113
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,050
else.

114
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,580
Let's search for it all the way.

115
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,920
Allegra is a really nice one.

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,330
A really nice Google font.

117
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,440
So we're just going to search all the way up.

118
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,310
All the way up.

119
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,990
What do we got here?

120
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,760
We're getting closer.

121
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,460
Okay.

122
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,340
There it is.

123
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,560
So, like, this is nice.

124
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,110
And, you know, it's it's a little bit modern.

125
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,400
Which is totally fine.

126
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,020
100%.

127
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,250
Maybe that's not enough.

128
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,660
Line height.

129
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:41,380
But the goal here is to start creating a little bit more contrast, but also introducing another type

130
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,710
pairing that could work really well with something like Montserrat.

131
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,540
I think this is still fine.

132
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,210
We could even bump that down just a bit.

133
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,230
Over here.

134
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,020
We can also apply that the.

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,700
That typeface.

136
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,540
Like, look at that.

137
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,330
And all of a sudden, like we start thinking about this now looks like an organization that has more

138
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,310
history, organization that's much more traditional, you know, not too traditional.

139
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,920
It still has some modern elements to it.

140
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,250
So when I approach like type pairings like that, I'm really thinking about the brand.

141
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,510
I'm always going back to that and like the utility of the typeface and how they work together.

142
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,700
Is there enough visual contrast here?

143
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,810
Another test I'd like to do is I like to use the squint test, I call it.

144
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:37,500
So I'll just squint very, very hard and I'll look and I'll start seeing if if everything starts to

145
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,309
blur together and then make adjustments based off of that.

146
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,630
So over here we kind of start to build a little bit of a type system.

147
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,570
We start to see that, okay, this may be like our body copy, this may be like our sub headlines,

148
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,250
our main headlines.

149
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,670
This will be like a quote or button text and you just keep going based off of what you know, based

150
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,460
off of the wireframes you created, based off of the like the sitemap that you created and all the different

151
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,190
type of content that you believe will be on the product that you're creating.

152
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:18,630
So that's one way to handle a scenario where a client comes to you and they may only have one typeface

153
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,400
to work with.

154
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,300
We went from something like this.

155
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,590
To something like this fairly quickly.

156
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,850
And I think if we are going for a sense of tradition, if we were going for to match that the tone of

157
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,500
the brand and what they stand for, then something like this probably works a bit better.

158
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:44,100
When you come into that scenario, remember to just talk with your client, explore all your options,

159
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,990
like go through.

160
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,100
Go through the process of building, trying to work with what they have and to see if that typeface

161
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,720
can work.

162
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,620
Is it versatile?

163
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,190
Does it match the tone of the brand?

164
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,380
And then, you know, explore beyond, you know, maybe this isn't the right font for here.

165
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,090
Maybe it's like a medium.

166
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,980
Maybe it's a different font altogether.

167
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,730
Those are the types of things that you can do to really help your clients out in terms of picking typefaces

168
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,300
for them.
