00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.580
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.670
Now we're going to get into the Design Properties panel.

3
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.270
Now, this is where you're going to be doing a lot of work as well.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.030
So I've created another square in my frame.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.950
I placed it in the middle and I'm over here on the right.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.320
So you'll notice three options design.

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.570
Prototype and inspect.

8
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.880
We're going to be focusing on design, and I'm going to go through all these different options that

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.960
you may see.

10
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.290
And it's going to be different and really, depending on the different things that you are going to

11
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.220
be doing, like text and a shape, we'll have different properties and we'll go over that.

12
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.340
So let's go through it.

13
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.810
So the first thing you have is.

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.170
The alignment.

15
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.850
This is going to align this object based off of its parent.

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.880
So in this case, if I click left, it's going to be to the left.

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.430
If I click to the middle, this is the middle, the horizontal middle, right top.

18
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.330
Middle.

19
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.800
Bottom.

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.900
So if I want this to be centered perfectly now it's centered to the middle vertical.

21
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.570
This is the middle vertical and this is the middle horizontal.

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.560
If I want to be left and bottom bottom left, that's all I would have to do.

23
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.260
So if I wanted to be right, I would click this option a line, right?

24
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530
And in a line top.

25
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.350
So this is really great if you need to align an object to your canvas or your frame.

26
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.200
But if you wanted to objects what you can do as.

27
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.800
You can align them together.

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.500
This is really great if you have two objects.

29
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.820
So if you don't want to drag over these objects and say if you have three objects and you just want

30
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.280
to select two, you just select one.

31
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.530
Hold down shift, select the other.

32
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.500
And now they're both center to each other.

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.259
And then you would move them manually to be centered to the actual frame.

34
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.610
So those are the ways to align your items.

35
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.910
So I'm going to delete these other two squares, bring this one back to the middle.

36
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.950
Next.

37
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.620
We have these different values.

38
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.650
We have a bunch here.

39
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.260
We have your X and Y values.

40
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.780
We have your width and your height.

41
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.190
So these are your positional.

42
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.510
So if I select something like 200, let's move 200 to the left.

43
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.950
So your x is your horizontal axis and your y is your vertical zero is going to set me to the top.

44
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.550
So let's go back.

45
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.170
Your Y and your h are your width and your height and this little chain is going to connect them.

46
00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.320
So if I affect this property right here, if I say change it to 400, it's going to actually be 400

47
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.370
height as well.

48
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.080
But if I unlink this chain and I say set the height to 200, now the width won't change.

49
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.020
So let's go all the way back and we're going to do is just set this all to 500 and I'm going to center

50
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.210
it again on my frame.

51
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.290
So we have a 500 by 500 pixels square.

52
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.800
Next we have our rotational value.

53
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.380
We can change this to say 90.

54
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.980
Which in a case of a square, it's not going to do anything.

55
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.600
But if we do 45.

56
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.820
There you go.

57
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.350
Or if we do 15.

58
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.840
So you can do that manually.

59
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.320
But if you want to actually not do that manually, you can do it just by going over here and you see

60
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.810
how my cursor changes as I get close to a corner.

61
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.600
If I hold that, I can spin it.

62
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.780
If I hold shift, it will go in increments.

63
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.420
So I think it's 15 degree increments.

64
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.530
And you can spin it any which way you want.

65
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.640
And this is your corner radius.

66
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.940
So if I want 100, it's going to make it rounded.

67
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.649
You can even select this little dot here and pull it in.

68
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.700
So now I have 250 radius and that looks like a circle.

69
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.540
Or I can make it small, like a little card on a UI.

70
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.110
That looks really good.

71
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.990
Now, if we go back and just reset it to zero.

72
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.700
We'll go back to our square.

73
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.220
Below that, we have constraints.

74
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.350
Now, constraints are really good for responsiveness in general.

75
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:51.650
And basically, it's how your item reacts to when your frame is being stretched or contracted.

76
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.940
So in this case, if we look at our constraints, they're left in top.

77
00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.450
So that means if I resize my frame from the right in the bottom, it's not going to do anything.

78
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.400
So I'm going to command Z and go back.

79
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.420
But if I select from the top left, it's going to move with that top left.

80
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.770
So pretty cool right now.

81
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.560
This is where it gets really interesting.

82
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.960
Now, if we want to make like say responsive cards and stuff like that, all we need to do is set these

83
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.800
properties.

84
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:31.420
So in this case, say left and right and top and bottom, let's scale this.

85
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.930
You'll see that now it's going to scale with your the way you scale your actual frame.

86
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.530
So this is great for responsiveness.

87
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.170
If you're working on like different screen sizes and you want to create like maybe card components that

88
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.840
you want to be able to reuse at different sizes and the content moves easily within this is the way

89
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.470
to do it.

90
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.250
So I'm going to commend Z all the way back to when we had a beautiful square.

91
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.660
And there we go.

92
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.970
Next, what we have is different blending modes.

93
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.360
So this is kind of something you would see in Photoshop.

94
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.220
We have like multiply, we have screen, all these different things really great for if you're using

95
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.690
like multiple colors.

96
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.760
And I say I want to make this multiply.

97
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.060
We can do that also within figma.

98
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.160
So those are your blending.

99
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.550
Your blending modes.

100
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.330
Next, we have our fills.

101
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.730
This is very self explanatory.

102
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.660
You just need to click this little section here and you can edit the hex value.

103
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.900
You can even change to Wragby, you have HSL, CSS and so on, and you can go and just drag your cursor

104
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.550
and change the color.

105
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.690
You could change the queues.

106
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.850
And you can go up and down, get all those different values.

107
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.140
And get some really nice colors.

108
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.240
So they got we got kind of like this nice turquoise teal, bright color right here.

109
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.550
You can toggle that to turn on and off.

110
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:12.390
If you're working with different layers, maybe different components, you can also add more color fills

111
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.350
on top of one layer.

112
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.060
So in this one, this is a linear one.

113
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.900
You can change that up here.

114
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.720
So in the case earlier, we had a solid color.

115
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.180
And we can change that opacity to say like 20.

116
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.730
So you can see the layer below it.

117
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.780
So if I go back and I go up here, I can change it to linear.

118
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.880
I can change it to radial.

119
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.240
Angular diamond and you can even have an image.

120
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.030
So a lot of different options for you right there.

121
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.680
So let's go back.

122
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.710
Let's actually remove this layer just by clicking this minus button.

123
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.110
So we still have our nice fill over here.

124
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.700
You can add strokes.

125
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.720
So you see a light black outline around this shape.

126
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.640
We can change that over here.

127
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.250
So if I change that to ten, that's the value.

128
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.930
There we go.

129
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.700
So there's different ways you can have it centered.

130
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.290
You can have it inside.

131
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.430
Outside.

132
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.030
That's sometimes up to preference.

133
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.180
Depends on what you're doing.

134
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.770
Say if I'm using a button, I'll usually have it set to inside.

135
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:22.490
So it doesn't affect like different sizing in terms of the pixel width of the actual button itself and

136
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.390
the pixel height.

137
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.690
You can have different effects here.

138
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.059
So if I click that plus button, if the default effect is going to be a drop shadow, you'll see that

139
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.860
very faint drop shot.

140
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.610
All right there.

141
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.789
So.

142
00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.030
You can edit the values of that drop shadow.

143
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:46.600
So I have it set to like ten Y, so it's going to move it down ten and if I want to move it ten to the

144
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.070
right, it's going to look like the shadow is being cast to the right.

145
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.500
That means the light source is coming from like here, and you can blur it any which way you want.

146
00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:02.860
So I've blurred it to say 20 and you can set the opacity and the color of that shadow.

147
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.920
So in this case, let's make it like a dark blue.

148
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.510
And we can see that right there.

149
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.220
That's one effect.

150
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.890
Other effects that you can do are inner shadow.

151
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.020
You can do layer blur and you can do background blur.

152
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.830
So let's stick to our regular job shadow.

153
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.060
The last part of here is the export.

154
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.230
So you can export any which way you want.

155
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.060
You can do multiple exports.

156
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.950
We can set the sizing, kind of like the prefix.

157
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.150
You can set the which file type you want.

158
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:50.130
Really easily be able to export those to whichever desktop you have file folder and easily access all

159
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.150
those files.

160
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.950
Next we have text, so I'm going to delete this.

161
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.300
Nice square that we made.

162
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:05.890
So I'm just going to click Delete or Backspace and I'm going to select RT for the text tool and I'm

163
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:06.670
just going to click.

164
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.720
I'm going to write hello and a command which will select all of them.

165
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.310
And you'll notice that they still have the similar properties like we don't have the corner radius here.

166
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.980
Yeah, that's basically kind of what we don't have.

167
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:28.270
But now we have a text and we can change the copy to be whatever font or typeface that you want.

168
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.390
In this case, we can do like Helvetica or something like that.

169
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:41.890
We have our different font options or weights and we can adjust the size we have, letting we have all

170
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.940
those different options.

171
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.680
We have kerning in there too.

172
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.410
So this will like this will affect your line height.

173
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:54.040
You can set it manually, you can set your kerning and your letter spacing to whatever percentage you

174
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.700
want, and you can still use those different options.

175
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:04.210
Like if you have text over image, you can select like a drop shadow effect to fix that if you have

176
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.610
any legibility or readability issues.

177
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:15.090
And that's all you really need to know for designing within Figma at least using the design panel over

178
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.600
here.
