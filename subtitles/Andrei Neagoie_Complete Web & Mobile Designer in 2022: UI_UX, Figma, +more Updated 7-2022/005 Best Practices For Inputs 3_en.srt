00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,950
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,290
So we're going to talk about icons in forms or in inputs more specifically.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,600
So what do we have here?

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,560
Icons.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,360
Inputs.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,240
Who would have thought?

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,620
Let's go over the three different scenarios that we often see when we're using them.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,410
So just purely for aesthetic reasons, icons can be used like this over here.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,680
They serve really no purpose, but just to reinforce the label or what is asked of the user.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,460
These are generally in line with the input and left of the text.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,280
So we have here just email and we have a little email icon and on over here in this credit card input,

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,470
we have a little credit card icon.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,180
You can zoom in just so you can see that.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,070
And they really serve no purpose other than to reinforce this.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,970
This label over here.

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,700
So keep that in mind.

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,100
They really help sometimes for accessibility reasons as well.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,520
I mean, just another layer of information that we're giving users for purely aesthetic reasons.

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,860
This is where they're typically used.

20
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,870
Now let's think about actionable.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,730
Now some icons will add functionality to your input.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,940
Some examples of this are chevrons for dropdowns.

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,630
What we see over here on the Select Amount Dropdown, also, some examples are like clear show, hide

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,340
or any info like that that help to give the user additional ways to interact with your input.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,310
So if we have like a password input, we have like a show hide little icon.

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,860
And what that could do is if a user started typing in their password, you can show the password and

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,960
what's actually being typed or you can hide it and just show the little circles just to hide that password.

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,710
So these are the ways that we can easily incorporate icons for just actionable reasons.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Now, typically, when we are actually creating dropdowns or like select inputs like that, there's

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,900
always some sort of arrow or this Chevron.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:02,220
So keep that in mind that you'll probably need that just to indicate to a user that this is a dropdown

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,270
input so they understand what they need to do.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,130
So make sure that you understand that you need to use this icon in this scenario.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,340
You don't necessarily need to use this icon right here.

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,250
The Chevron does let users know that this is a dropdown menu.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,510
It's totally built into this already.

37
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,900
Now let's take a look at feedback.

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,440
So feedback is another reason why we may use icons.

39
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,330
And typically where you do see that is to help users understand if an action was successful or not.

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,820
These are often used in addition to color that is super important for accessibility because some colorblind

41
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,560
users cannot tell the difference between red and green and they will rely on icons.

42
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,610
So what I have here is valid username and invalid username.

43
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:56,900
So if you look even closer, you can see that there's a little icon here beside that, the error text

44
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,040
and success text.

45
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,450
So this really just helps to reinforce what's happening and just give the user enough feedback to understand

46
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,870
that something went right and something didn't.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,980
So that's using icons in inputs.
