00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.780
Hello and welcome back to a very exciting section.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.620
Why is it exciting?

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.370
Well, we finally get to code and we're going to start off by learning HTML and then finally building

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.200
our very first website.

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.960
In order for us to get started, we need to set up our environment and we do that by let's open up Google

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.920
Chrome and we're going to search for Sublime text.

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.630
This is a text editor that a lot of developers use.

8
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.820
I myself have used it for years.

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.080
Absolutely love it.

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.050
In your day to day job you'll use something like this.

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.700
I highly recommend Sublime text if you have a mac, the version over here.

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.520
If you have a PC running windows, you'll have the download link for Windows.

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.770
So for me, I'm going to download for the Mac and you can see here it's downloaded and I can drag it

14
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.940
to my applications folder if I want and we can double click.

15
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.099
And if this is your first time downloading Sublime text, you'll get something like this to give it

16
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.780
permission to load.

17
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.920
And there you go.

18
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.290
We have sublime text.

19
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.660
Now, what is a text editor?

20
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.470
A text editor is a program that allows us to write code.

21
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.130
You can see over here on the right hand side of sublime text that it just says plain text so I can type

22
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.570
anything that I want.

23
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.100
And there's nothing much different than if you wrote this in word or a text file.

24
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.620
But the power with a text editor, especially with something like Sublime that's geared towards coding.

25
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.150
If you click on plain text here, you'll have a whole bunch of options of what type of code you're writing.

26
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.910
So in our case we're doing HTML.

27
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.520
So if I click on HTML, nothing changes except for the bottom part over here.

28
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.490
But now if I type something, well, everything looks the same.

29
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.890
But if I start typing HTML.

30
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.930
They'll actually recognize it and help with syntax.

31
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.870
So here.

32
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.030
Now if I write HTML.

33
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.450
Look at that.

34
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.730
A nice little color completion.

35
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.480
So for us for now, we're going to be writing HTML.

36
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.280
You can see over here that there's different options.

37
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.870
There's where is it?

38
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.290
There's CSS JavaScript, which we'll learn later.

39
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.350
So we're going to be using sublime text for this.

40
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.870
For now, click on HTML and let's write our very first web page.

41
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.860
In order for us to have a web page, we write HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

42
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.180
So bear with me here.

43
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.240
This is going to be new, but keep in mind that this is exactly what every single HTML page has.

44
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.810
These are the set of rules that all HTML files must follow.

45
00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.820
And it goes like this We define a doc type and don't worry, I'll get into what that means in the next

46
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.360
video.

47
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.210
Then we have HTML and we close these tags hml the second part.

48
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.080
We have a head and a closing head.

49
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.310
You can see over here some patterns forming.

50
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.990
Don't worry, I'll get back to these tags and explaining what they do in a bit.

51
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.950
And then we also have body.

52
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.370
And then closing tags.

53
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.040
And finally, here in the head.

54
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.560
We have something called.

55
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.070
A title tag OC.

56
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.630
So this over here is the rule that every single issue email file must follow.

57
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.530
Just looking at this right now, without knowing any HTML, you can get an idea of what everything means.

58
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.790
So HTML were defining that this is an HTML.

59
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.560
We're saying that this is the head of the HTML with a title and we're saying that this is the body of

60
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.250
the HTML.

61
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.410
So let's try something here.

62
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.940
Let's save this file.

63
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.980
And we're going to save it.

64
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.440
Let's do desktop.

65
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.050
And we're going to call it index HTML.

66
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:25.150
You can see that it's already completed the HTML syntax for us save and we have an index HTML file here.

67
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.860
Let's drag this all the way down to our Google Chrome and open it up and well, nothing happens, but

68
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.790
let's add a bit of text to it.

69
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.680
So in the title I'm going to say my first website, exclamation mark.

70
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.530
And then in the body I'm just going to put.

71
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.430
Hello there.

72
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.890
Okay.

73
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.400
So if I save this.

74
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.680
And just to show you from now on, I'm going to be doing command s to save.

75
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.980
Just go be faster.

76
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.070
And now if I refresh this page.

77
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.460
I have.

78
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.390
Hello there.

79
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.690
And you can see the power over here of what we just did.

80
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.370
We have.

81
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.480
Hello there.

82
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.940
As the text, which is.

83
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.770
In the body.

84
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:25.420
And then we also have my first website as the title and you can see over here in the file that we're

85
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.380
referencing indexed HTML on my desktop.

86
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.880
So we can see here that we have HTML, we have the head, which we haven't really talked about yet,

87
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.970
but we see that the titles in the head kind of like a header.

88
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.850
And then we have the body which by looking at this we can assume that it's whatever shows up onto the

89
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.280
web page before we expand on this and make it a little bit prettier because now it's just simple text.

90
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.720
I want to reiterate the fact that what we've just done is very similar to what a server does.

91
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:06.340
If we go back to our mockups here, you remember that when we enter Google.com, the servers send us

92
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.170
an HTML file back when we move the indexed HTML file all the way down to Google Chrome.

93
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.320
That's what we just did.

94
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:22.000
We mimicked a server and we gave it to the browser to load up the HTML file.

95
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.260
And because browsers are built to know what HTML files are, it can read the syntax and say, okay,

96
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.820
yeah, this is the HTML.

97
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.370
You want my title to be my first website and you want my body to say hello there.

98
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.840
That's perfect.

99
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.550
These are the default HTML rules that you'll see all the time.

100
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.830
It is a little bit confusing at first, but this is it.

101
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.340
You just have to remember that there is a tag.

102
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.440
So an HTML tag, a head tag, a title tag, a body tag.

103
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.050
And these tags usually have an opening and a closing.

104
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.000
There's some exception to this rule and we'll get into that a little bit later on in the videos.

105
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.890
But just remember this for now.

106
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.170
So I want you to try creating your very first website and seeing how it works.

107
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:20.170
And once you're done with that, I want to show you that sublime text actually has a nice shortcut so

108
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.870
you don't have to keep writing those tags over and over.

109
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.580
So the way you do that is you type in HTML and then press the tab key.

110
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.080
And it loads all this up for you.

111
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.450
Okay, so now that we've done this, I want you to go off and create your very first website.

112
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.790
I know it's very, very simple.

113
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.880
You can put whatever you want in the title and you can put whatever you want in the body.

114
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.650
And in the next video, we're going to start expanding on our first website.

115
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.180
I'll see you in the next one.

116
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.810
Bye bye.
