00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,960
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,590
So I'm going to give you some really helpful tips when you are creating color palettes.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,380
And then we're going to jump right into Figma and do it ourselves.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,870
So when we're looking to create a color palette, we need to follow some proper color harmony.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,720
So using the color theory formulas, basically those color schemes that I showed you before, now I

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,310
love Couleurs Eco.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,060
It really helps with generating harmonious color palettes if you need it.

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,140
It's just a great resource.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,430
There's a bunch of other resources out there, like Adobe has one.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,530
I mean, there are resources even within Figma like plug ins that will help you create color palettes

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,750
and we'll get into those later.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,750
But if you need help there, definitely resources out there to help.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,540
You actually come up with some ideas for color palettes.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,790
You should always know that your colors should be scalable and additive within your color system.

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,660
For your UI.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,450
We need to make sure to always have multiple shades of gray and low saturated colors to work with.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,210
There should be some sort of systematic pattern in place that can be added to as your color system grows.

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:09,440
In this case, we see that each hue over here has its own kind of palette or mini palette that can be

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,940
expanded on when needed.

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,580
This could be my main palette over here, and I can get darker variations of that, you know, for accessibility

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,970
reasons or just I have a lot more flexibility within my interface.

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:25,280
You don't necessarily need to stick to maybe like the three or four brand colors that you may have or

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,300
your brand may have.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,530
You have to build off of that in order to make a really great user interface.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,910
I think one of the big things is to always kind of tend to your grays and your blacks with a hint of

26
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,140
your brand color.

27
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,550
It adds a little bit more depth to your blacks and grays, and if you leave them untouched, it could

28
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,110
come off as too harsh.

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,870
You know, sometimes you could add a little bit of blue.

30
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,800
I mean, this could be a little bit too light if you want something really dark.

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,510
But if you look at this gray, if you had a little bit of blue to this gray, it just looks that much

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,660
better and it matches your brand much better.

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:06,170
And the last tip that I have that is pretty huge is that you have to be aware of the contrast between

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,860
colors.

35
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,170
Contrast helps with proper visual hierarchy like we have here, like a headline and a sub headline.

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,850
I touched upon this a little earlier in terms of wanting to read a darker color before you read a lighter

37
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,480
color.

38
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,870
And it's also a big part of ensuring accessibility.

39
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,820
There are a couple of tools that we can use to check, like conscious ratios of our colors.

40
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,760
Color is a great web tool that you can use just to get a quick glimpse of what is accessible.

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,430
If you just type in two colors in terms of like a foreground and a background, and it'll definitely

42
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,460
tell you if it is accessible and there's a bunch of resources within Figma that we can take a look at

43
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,080
when we're creating our own color palette.

44
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,780
Those are some really helpful tips that you can use when you start creating and building off of your

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,560
color palettes.

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,950
We're going to jump into Figma next and do it ourselves.
