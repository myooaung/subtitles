1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,660
All right, let's get going here.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,630
Now, the first thing we want to do is change this.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,830
Hello to, well, the biggest startup event of the year.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,760
Very dramatic.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,270
I know.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,230
So let's do that.

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:20,120
I'm just going to say the biggest startup event of the year.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,890
That's right.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,870
Okay, let's save.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,440
So I'm doing command s or if you're on Windows Control s and then refresh command R or if you're on

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,860
Windows Control R.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,270
All right.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,110
There we go.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,980
That's great.

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,590
We also seem to have a button that says Find out more.

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,220
So let's do that as well.

17
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,450
We'll say button.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
Find out more.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,280
There we go.

20
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,500
If I refresh here.

21
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,340
There you go.

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,500
Our startup landing page is, well, frankly, still looking fairly ugly.

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,710
Now, the next thing we want to do is we want to have this background image.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:10,150
But before we get to that, I want to talk a little bit about how we can set up our HTML page so that

25
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,790
we have good responsive design.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,510
So right now, nothing much is going on.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,060
You can see here that I can adjust the screen size, but we don't have much happening on our page.

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:30,070
So if we go back to the bootstrap documentation in the Quick Start guide, if I scroll all the way to

29
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,530
the bottom, you see that I get a starter template here and you might notice here something that we

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,860
haven't seen before, which is this part over here called a required meta tag.

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,730
And you can see here that this is actually something that we can copy and paste and place right below

32
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,780
our title here.

33
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,830
Just like that.

34
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,860
Now, let's make this a little bit bigger so we can see.

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,850
And I'll make the writing smaller just so you can see over here exactly what's happening.

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,130
So this meta tag allows us to.

37
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,800
Add new information to our TML page, and there's different things that we can provide.

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,860
Now, in most websites, you'll actually see these two lines very often.

39
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,800
As a matter of fact, it's recommended that you always add them.

40
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,410
Now, what exactly do they do?

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,600
Well, if we scroll down here, you'll see that we have the responsive meta tech.

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:40,390
Essentially this line here which says viewport allows us to create Web pages that are developed mobile

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,020
first.

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:50,220
That is, we let the page know or the browser know that this page should work on mobile devices and

45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:58,350
things like scrolling or touching or zooming on a mobile device is going to work with this stat.

46
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,760
Now, this is something I'm going to leave for you to learn more about.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,280
And it's something we'll talk about later in the course.

48
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,850
But these meta tags are just useful things to add to our projects.

49
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,860
Any time we create a new page.

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,390
And then finally, this top meta tag uses UTF eight encoding.

51
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,320
Essentially it's saying, Hey, we're going to use this form of encoding to write text on our pages.

52
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,730
Again, something that, if you're curious, you can read up on your own.

53
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,560
But now that we've set this up.

54
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,820
So that it's good for mobile as well.

55
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,170
Let's try to include this background image into our page.

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,690
Now when it comes to background images on a website, that's a very common thing.

57
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:53,170
You'll see a lot of people adding background images to a website or maybe patterns or some sort of colors.

58
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,570
And when a common problem happens, I always like, well, googling.

59
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:06,500
And one of the first things that you'll encounter is this perfect full page background image by CSS

60
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,450
tricks, which we've seen before.

61
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,120
Now, if you scroll all the way down.

62
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:20,160
It tells us a way for us to make sure that we use the image in a full page background so that it stretches,

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
it flexes as the view port changes.

64
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,110
Now over here, it actually gives us a copy and paste way that we can use it ourselves.

65
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,480
So I'm going to just copy this.

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,950
Go to my style page.

67
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,670
And just add this.

68
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,490
To our CSIS.

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,250
Now you'll see over here that we're using background over here with the URL.

70
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,520
So we want to adjust it to header dot jpeg because that's the URL of the header.

71
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,040
And the key here is these lines.

72
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,070
It's saying, hey, we don't want to repeat the image.

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,590
We want to keep it centered and we want you to keep it fixed.

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:12,250
And by using this line, it stretches, or at least it fills the entire page with our image.

75
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,430
And as long as we have background size as cover.

76
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,030
Well, let's see what happens.

77
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,610
I'm going to refresh.

78
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,350
Hey.

79
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,060
And look at that.

80
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,560
Now I have this image.

81
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,960
Adapt to our page.

82
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,390
But the cool part is if I open the developer tools here, lets say view developer tools.

83
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:47,240
You'll notice that the image actually bumps up so that the center of the image well is always centered.

84
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,680
How cool is that?

85
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,820
So this is a very useful trick to have your background very flexible.

86
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,940
All right.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,470
So we have our background.

88
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,160
Unfortunately, our writing right now is hard to see.

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,990
The button still kind of ugly.

90
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,320
So let's fix a few things in our HTML page.

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,910
Now remember we have bootstrap so we can start using some bootstrap classes.

92
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:23,110
Now, one thing that I want to do is with this H1 tag, I want to maybe use a strong element to emphasize.

93
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,030
The header, so make sure we close this and I'm going to make this bigger just so you can see.

94
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,920
And if I refresh.

95
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,450
All right.

96
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,220
That's emphasized a little bit more.

97
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,070
We also want to make sure that this h one tag we can actually see so we can go into our style.

98
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:51,080
And just create a new H one style that will have, let's say, a font size.

99
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:02,430
Of, let's say, 3 a.m. and then we'll give it a color of what should we do here?

100
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,110
Well, one thing that I always like to do when I'm trying to figure out what color I want is to.

101
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,920
Go to a page, let's say, like the start up over here, open up the developer tools.

102
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,290
Make sure this is a little bit bigger so we can see and then find somewhere on the page where you have

103
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,550
this color palette.

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,250
If I actually click on this and I'm on Chrome.

105
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,500
Look at that.

106
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:39,990
It opens up a little color palette for us so I can actually move around things and grab the hex of the

107
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,040
color that I want.

108
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,400
In our case, I want the color to be.

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,480
Well, let's find out.

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,940
How can I copy the color of this page?

111
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,220
I can just click on select an element, this little icon here.

112
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,400
And then if I hover over this, look at that.

113
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,150
It shows me exactly what color this element has.

114
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,910
You can see over here that this is the hex color.

115
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,140
So I'm just going to copy that, come back and paste it in.

116
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,370
Now, if I save both of these files and refresh.

117
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,450
That's much better.

118
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,530
I like that a lot.

119
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,320
All right.

120
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,960
We're making progress with our page.

121
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,520
It's getting closer, but we still have a lot to do.

122
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,170
So let's take a break and I'll see you in the next video.
