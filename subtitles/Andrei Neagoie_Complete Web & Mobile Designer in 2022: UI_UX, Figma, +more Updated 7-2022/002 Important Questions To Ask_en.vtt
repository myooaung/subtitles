Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.250
So we're going to talk about some important questions that I ask myself before I even start using colors

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.080
or even like searching for colors.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.530
So there are two pretty big questions and there are a couple of questions in between and there are a

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.570
couple questions that actually make up those two bigger questions.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.950
So let's jump right in.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.700
The first thing I want to do is I want to understand the type of problem we're trying to solve.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.800
I want to know, do I understand this product?

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200
What type of problem is the product trying to solve?

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.180
What does it want to communicate?

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.630
If we had a session where we were mapping these things earlier in like a kickoff and using our stakeholders

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.480
kind of research to really understand what the big business problem was, these types of things could

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.180
really help influence your color palette choice.

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.220
You know, remember when we briefly talked about brand personality, you know, this applies here to

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.990
understanding what the brand is trying to say, helps us pick colors and understanding the problem the

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.580
product is trying to solve is integral.

17
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.120
Some clothes are better suited or associated with different types of products.

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.380
You know, maybe blues with fintech, nothing is set in stone.

19
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.610
It's a good to understand the landscape when approaching a color palette, so just keep that in mind.

20
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.670
When you're starting to create your own color palette, the next thing is we want to understand who

21
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.600
our users are.

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.190
Do I understand the user as well?

23
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.290
Who are the users we are targeting?

24
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.850
What region do they belong to?

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.470
That's a huge thing.

26
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.300
What is their culture like?

27
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.380
Colors are instrumental in how we perceive the world, and that couldn't be more true within the interfaces.

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.640
Colors guide us to predict, understand and make decisions.

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.390
Think about what colors mean to you.

30
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.130
So I want you to take a second and just think about this while I'm going through it.

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.900
Ever since you were a child, you've been trained to pause at words colored in red.

32
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.960
You know, think about error text, or if you see a negative balance in your account or a stop sign

33
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.070
or a red light.

34
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.770
Or a bad mark on your essay and you relax relaxant maybe numbers in green or text in green.

35
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.509
You naturally want to read text in black before you do texting gray.

36
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.150
You want to click on things that are blue.

37
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.100
It's embedded into how we experience products that we never give it really any extra thought.

38
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.660
Now let's go one step further.

39
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
And certain colors have a different connotation when it comes to things like culture.

40
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.880
Think about who you're designing for.

41
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.740
Even age and gender.

42
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.910
The psychology of color is incredibly interesting, but it's a massive topic.

43
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.890
These are the two main questions I always ask myself before I even get started.

44
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.120
And you should too.
