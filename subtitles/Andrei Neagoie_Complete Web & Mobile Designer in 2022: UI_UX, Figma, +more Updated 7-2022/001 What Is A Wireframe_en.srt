1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,580
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,019
So we're going to be talking about wireframes.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,930
So we're really going to get into designing very soon.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,360
But, you know, we're done our site map, we're done user flows.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,950
You know, we've done a lot of sketching and, you know, we have a good understanding of the content

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,200
and the structure that is going into our product.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,530
So now I think Wireframe is pretty much the next step.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,790
But the big question is, well, what is a wireframe?

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,420
Now, you may have seen images like this when we were sketching, and wireframe is a low fidelity layout

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,120
that serves three simple purposes.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,380
It presents the information that will be displayed on the page in a little bit more detail than our

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,360
sketches and our user flows.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,590
It gives an outline of structure and layout of the page, and it conveys the overall direction and description

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,210
of your user interface.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,720
It's basically, as you can see here, it's just like a blueprint of a building, but instead of a building,

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,730
it describes the details clearly and specifically, while giving everyone involved a good overview of

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,540
the product.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,630
It's kind of like that middle ground between your sketches and higher fidelity designs and prototypes.

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,990
They help you really plan layout interaction patterns for your users without worrying about distracting

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,530
details like colors or copy or, you know, typography.

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,470
You know, all those things can really bog down your design process.

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,370
Another thing to really know is that they're really heavily influenced from your prior work.

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:36,150
So if you've done story mapping, you have user stories, if you've done things like user flows or site

24
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,190
maps, I mean, all these different artifacts should really influence the way you create your wireframes.

25
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,740
So just keep that in mind that you shouldn't just be like jumping in and creating a whole bunch of wireframes

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,450
and not necessarily really understanding the type of content that needs to be there and the requirements

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,020
that need to be there.

28
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,970
So really consult all those artifacts that you have and if you don't have them, you know, talk to

29
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,470
the right people that can get you that information, whether that be product managers, clients, stakeholders,

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,510
internal stakeholders, you know, use your voice if you need those requirements to even start.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,880
So why do we use them?

32
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,560
Two big reasons.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,170
I like using them because they really help to test your concepts and your structure, so they really

34
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,230
help you to understand how users will navigate your product.

35
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,210
Sometimes you can use your wireframes to highlight certain areas that you think need to have prominence

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,220
on a page to test if that piece of content is actually working and if the user flow makes sense.

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,080
So this is one of the big reasons I use that so that it could be like user flows again, but in much

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,950
more detail.

39
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,250
Understanding the different types of interactions and putting it into a wireframe makes it a little

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,870
more easier to test with users to get, I guess, better results.

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,830
The next best thing, actually, I think this is the number one thing actually you need to use them

42
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,430
to learn.

43
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,850
You know, they are fast, cheap and impermanent.

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,560
Don't get attached to wireframes.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,670
They're meant to change.

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,910
As you gather more information through research and feedback from your clients and from your users,

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,770
they're a great place to fail.

48
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,540
And I don't mean that negatively on a project you want to fail as quickly as possible, and that means

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,270
you want to test your assumptions as quick as possible before it gets to high fidelity designs or even

50
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,110
development.

51
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,110
You know, they serve as that common language for your team as well.

52
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,150
They're complex enough to inform everyone, but simple enough to not get bogged down by too much detail.

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,830
Now, the little kind of graph I have here is the build measure learn graph.

54
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,230
And if anyone's read Lean Startup, I think like that's amazing because it's an amazing book.

55
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,050
But if you haven't, you should definitely read Lean Startup.

56
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,890
It talks a lot about building, measuring and learning.

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,930
So what that essentially means is you build and that could be a wireframe, that could be a sketch.

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,610
You measure it against something.

59
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,720
What metric you're testing against it could be like, I want to know if this interaction works.

60
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,960
I want to know if the users actually are interested in my product.

61
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,200
You learn from those results and then you build again.

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,240
So wireframes really help you to kind of implement that build, measure, learn cycle.

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,610
So I want you always to think about that.

64
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,790
Whenever you're kind of testing with users or just talking to other clients or stakeholders, you keep

65
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,260
that in the back of your mind because the design process isn't linear, it's very iterative.

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,050
So how can we use them?

67
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,390
They're useful for three big reasons right now.

68
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,790
You know, they help your team estimate the type of work they're going to complete clarity and common

69
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,010
understanding across the team.

70
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,200
They help your team understand what is going to be built.

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,610
I mentioned this a little bit earlier.

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,710
It gives them an opportunity to chime in as well.

73
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,210
If you're presenting to them and you should always be presenting to them, even if it's just like ad

74
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,330
hoc, you know, talk to your peer really quickly.

75
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,760
The specs are kind of dated and wireframes can be really much more collaborative than that.

76
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,550
So get your team involved as much as possible.

77
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,070
The next thing is user testing.

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,260
We use them a lot for user testing.

79
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,850
The sooner you test, the better.

80
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,930
And that's the big thing.

81
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,910
You know, like I said before, fail fast.

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,660
So you can get quick feedback without necessarily developing complex prototypes with all those different

83
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,030
types of visual things like typography, color and all the different types of details like that.

84
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,460
So testing with users really uncover like the different types of pain points and opportunities.

85
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,560
So this is a little customer journey map.

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,610
You know, if you've created one at this point, that's great as well because it will really help you

87
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,960
understand how the user moves throughout your product and other products.

88
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,440
So really document how your user can move through your wireframes, understand like what their pain

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,100
points are.

90
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,290
And usually there you'll understand that there are certain opportunities that you can really benefit

91
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,770
from.

92
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,890
And I also like to I think this is kind of inevitable.

93
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,820
I really like to use these to demo to clients.

94
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,080
It's a good way to get really quick feedback instead of like going all the way and sprinting towards

95
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,290
like that beautiful design or that beautiful complex prototype.

96
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,300
I mean, you got to remind them that it isn't the final design because, you know, you may have a client

97
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,790
that is just like this has no color or this has no like typographic elements.

98
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,900
Like, what is this that doesn't look good and it's not necessarily meant to look good.

99
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,370
So you need to explain that to them just so they can give you some quick feedback on certain things

100
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,620
like interactions and, you know, flows and just placement and layout and hierarchy.

101
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,280
Another thing about getting quick feedback is that making changes to high fidelity designs is like really

102
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,130
time intensive and you don't want to be making bigger changes when you're nearly done the product.

103
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,630
You want to be making those changes as you go along and the earlier the better.

104
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,210
So that's how we can use wireframes.

105
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,880
We can definitely use them to like test.

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,850
And I think like that is the biggest thing is testing early and testing often and not worrying about

107
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,720
the details.

108
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,700
So I'll teach you next how to create them.
