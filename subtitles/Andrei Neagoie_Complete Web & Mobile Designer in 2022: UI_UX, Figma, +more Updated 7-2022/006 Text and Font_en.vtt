00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.350
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.620
And in this video, we're going to be talking about text and font.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.040
Let's go back to the about page.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.350
Looks quite lonely and empty right now.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.030
I'm going to turn off the hover effect because it can get kind of annoying after a bit.

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.460
To remove that here and refresh.

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.570
All right.

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.140
Perfect.

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.270
In the about html, let's try and make this text a little bit prettier.

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.710
So I'm going to do our little short comment with sublime text.

11
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.950
So lure him and then make sure I close off this P tag.

12
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.850
All right.

13
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.940
So I'm going to show you a few text properties that we can add going back to style.

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.060
And I'm going to remove the pink color.

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.680
So we only have this P to worry about and refresh.

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.800
And you'll see here that it's still not green because this has higher specificity than this.

17
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.590
Again, if you don't know what that means, just check out my previous video.

18
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:10.100
The first one I'm going to show you is called text decoration.

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.210
And very simply, this one you can do underline, refresh, you get a nice underline.

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.550
You can also do a line through.

21
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.350
Refresh.

22
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.610
And there you go.

23
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.360
Nice one.

24
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.410
Through the next one is text transform.

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.960
And this one, you can do something like uppercase.

26
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.760
And you can transform the entire text into uppercase.

27
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.780
You can do lowercase with this as well, but you can try that out on your own.

28
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.090
Next one is line height.

29
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.250
So in line height you can put the pixels.

30
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.010
So we want 20 pixels of space.

31
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.310
There's a line height if we do 200 pixels.

32
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.920
You can see that that's a lot of spacing.

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.980
So let's keep it at 20 just because that looks nicer.

34
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.540
Refresh.

35
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.560
Perfect.

36
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.940
Next one is I kind of like this.

37
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.590
I'm going to keep this.

38
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm going to add it to the bottom.

39
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.930
The next one is font style.

40
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.620
You can set something like italic save fresh, nice italic lettering.

41
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.170
The next one, let's do font weight.

42
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.070
And here you can actually do a number between 109 hundred.

43
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.220
Or you can do just simply something like bold.

44
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.900
And obviously that changes the weight of the font.

45
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.090
We also have something like font size.

46
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.320
Obviously we want to change the size of the text and you can do something like percentage.

47
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.040
So 100% if you do that, nothing changes.

48
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.290
But if you do 150%.

49
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.390
Well, that gets 150% bigger.

50
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.170
If you do 80, you will get 80% of the original.

51
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.330
And then finally, I also want to show you font family.

52
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.870
So this is where you get to pick what kind of font you want.

53
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.760
So if you want something like Georgia, I saved refresh.

54
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.360
We got that nice little font.

55
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.830
If you have something that is multiple words, you'll have to use quotation marks.

56
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.290
So if you have something like Time's New Roman, you'll have to write it like that.

57
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.630
And a special quality of font family is that you'll see a lot of this.

58
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.980
This means that on who's ever lopped off the website opens on.

59
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.390
If that computer doesn't have Time's New Roman, then print the text in Georgia and you can have multiple

60
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.460
of these separated by comma.

61
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.040
And that might sound surprising to you, but fonts are simply pieces of information that each computer

62
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.360
has, but it's not equally distributed amongst everybody.

63
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.750
So some computers might have certain kinds of font like times New Roman and others might not.

64
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.830
And you can check online which fonts are available in Windows and Macs.

65
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.090
But keep that in mind that you want to think about fonts and how your website's going to display because

66
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.140
a user might not have that specific font on their laptop.

67
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.500
Now, two questions might pop in your head right now.

68
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.190
One is, Well, Andre, what if I have this super awesome custom font and I want to use that?

69
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.680
And the second one is how do we make sure that a user always sees the same font on a website, even

70
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.180
if they don't have it on their computer?

71
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.410
So how can you do this?

72
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:44.690
One way is to actually include a font file that you have on your computer with all your website files.

73
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.000
But I'm going to show you an easy way that a lot of developers use, and it's free, and that is Google

74
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.780
Fonts.

75
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.720
Google Fonts actually has these free fonts that you can use and there's a ton of them.

76
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.320
Anything that you find here is more than enough.

77
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.580
And I've used this many times when building websites.

78
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.120
It's a great, great resource.

79
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.560
I really like this one.

80
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:23.150
So let's pick this 1.1 and you can see over here that you can play around and see what it looks like.

81
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.770
You can also see the size difference.

82
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.770
And if you click the plus sign over here.

83
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.250
You'll see at the bottom that I have a selected item and if I click on it, it shows me how I can add

84
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.720
it to my website.

85
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.330
So first thing we want to do is we want to copy this and this might look familiar.

86
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.360
And this link tag, which is a style sheet.

87
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.230
Has a reference to fonts, Google APIs.

88
00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.570
We're saying, hey, grab the fonts before you load up this HTML file on my web page.

89
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.320
Load it up with the fonts that are found at this website.

90
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.940
So yes, if this website is down and let's say there's no Internet access, they won't be able to load

91
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.390
those fonts.

92
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.440
But it's Google.

93
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.330
We can trust them.

94
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.440
Most likely they're going to be online.

95
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.390
And the second one, you can see over here what we can add to our CSS file.

96
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.680
So we just copy that.

97
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.460
Go to a stylesheet and let's change this to our new Google font.

98
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.320
I save that.

99
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.770
Let's go to our page and refresh.

100
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.300
Look at that.

101
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.760
That is nice and pretty.

102
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.870
Let's make that bigger just so we can see it.

103
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.400
Well, we obviously need some line spacing here so we can do line height.

104
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.760
50 pixels.

105
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.920
There you go.

106
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:58.340
One thing you might think about and this is something that we'll get into in the advance section, is

107
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:06.950
that by loading this, we're actually making our website a tiny bit slower because now in order for

108
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:13.160
this website to load, we need to grab the stylesheet that we've created.

109
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.870
Plus go to this link and grab our font.

110
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.720
Again, something that we don't want to worry about yet, but things to keep in mind.

111
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.890
And in the advanced section, we'll cover that a little bit further.

112
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.260
But there you have it.

113
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.970
There are your general text based, font based properties.

114
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.510
I'll see you in the next one.

115
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.130
Bye bye.
