1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,290
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,540
We're going to be talking about buttons.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,840
Now, buttons are a really important part of any UI.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,070
I mean, they're not only used for forms, but can be used to link users to other parts of the site

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,420
or within the same page.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,280
We should treat buttons with a lot of care.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,510
And I'm going to show you a couple of things you can do to make your buttons that much better.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,310
So let's jump right in.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,480
So what do we have here?

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,910
We have a nice little submit button.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,520
Now, button should describe the action you want the user to take and I think submit and cancel or you

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,770
know, they're okay in most technical applications, but they usually feel way too dry or generic.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,830
Now consider using words like sign up or send information or create account.

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,900
I mean, those are much better options.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,170
I'm just going to change this to create account.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:55,280
And it's just a much more descriptive or you can say more action based word or more action based copy.

17
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,510
Now, this also helps you emphasize the value of completing a certain action.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,790
We want our users to keep motivated.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,010
And the way we can do that is to remind the user of the benefits with completing this flow.

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,640
So try something like sign up and you know, or something like create account.

21
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,370
Just be more descriptive instead of just using something generic like submit.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,470
Now we do have sign up down here.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,870
And like I said, like, sign up is a pretty good option.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,470
I like it.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,260
Now consider writing in the first person.

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,350
This is another option.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,520
It really depends on the tone you're going for with your brand and like your entire UI and your UX.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,540
Now the button is that final interaction that takes a user elsewhere.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,150
There's times you can try making it personable.

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,470
It has been proven that buttons that use words like I, me or my have higher conversion rates instead

31
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,340
of sign up.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,380
Why don't we try something like create my accounts?

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,700
I think that sounds a little bit better.

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,250
A little trick I use is that whenever the copy is in the button I will precede that by.

35
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,530
I like I want to.

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,530
So it makes grammatical sense.

37
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,550
I want to create my account.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,150
This is what I would do if it matches the tone of what you're going for, but I mean, isn't necessarily

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,900
limited to that.

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,080
I think being personable and, you know, combining that with what we learned before about having more

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,190
descriptive and action based words just makes your buttons that much better.

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,780
So you remember this scenario, right?

43
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,650
Differentiating between buttons.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,860
Usually you should have a primary in the secondary button.

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,330
You may need to use two buttons at certain points and it happens quite a lot.

46
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,320
And you should come up with a primary secondary that are easily distinguishable.

47
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,190
The rule is that buttons that function differently should appear differently.

48
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,070
So remember to make the primary button that should take the user to the expected path should be much

49
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,880
more prominent.

50
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,630
So.

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,600
In this case.

52
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,920
Something like that works like we saw before.

53
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,480
But when a user is on mobile you should make buttons easily.

54
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,230
Tappable.

55
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,350
I think 40 pixels to 48 pixels is a good height for a button, especially on mobile.

56
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,570
And it works really well with using a base unit of eight pixels.

57
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,970
Remember, keep them easily distinguishable.

58
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:27,110
And also remember that when you're on mobile you need to have a bigger tappable area just so.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,930
You don't necessarily have something like this.

60
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,980
And when you're on mobile, it's just it's not fun to try and top something like that.

61
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,510
You may actually top the cancel by accident, so try to avoid doing anything like that.

62
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,270
40 to 48 pixels is generally a good rule of thumb.

63
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,020
Now there are times where I would use a clear all.

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,420
I mean, I've been guilty of doing this a couple of times.

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,740
So if you have a set of filters that you need to apply, you may want the user to be able to reset everything.

66
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,390
Or if there's a large form, sometimes people I don't know why you would do that, but I've seen it

67
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,900
before in terms of like a resetting or a clear all on a form.

68
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,329
You should probably try and avoid using some sort of like reset button like this.

69
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,400
IT users rarely use this and it's kind of vulnerable to being clicked accidentally.

70
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,110
This resulted in frustration, data loss and possible abandonment.

71
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,060
So what I would do here is just keep it to view results.

72
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,280
But it also depends on the use case as well.

73
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,190
So if you find that your users use your product in a way where they're constantly adding and removing

74
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,070
a bunch of content, then it may make sense.

75
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,190
I could see that being used for like a CRM tool.

76
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,340
It's like an internal tool for a team to use to search up users or search like clients or something

77
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,060
like that.

78
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,040
And they want to easily add and remove filters and they just do it on a day to day basis.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,740
So it may help them with their day to day flow.

80
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,510
But a user that's coming to a website and just adding filters like to search for like rentals or something

81
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:15,560
like that, typically they would be more inclined to change those filters manually rather than lose

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,660
all their filter changes in one go.

83
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,120
So keep that in mind when you are designing longer forms or filters or something like that.

84
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,880
And the last one I have here is disabled.

85
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,870
Now, this isn't disabled, but consider having the disabled button for your user.

86
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,760
A disabled button is a good it's really good for cases where a user can't progress unless they fill

87
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,290
out all required fields.

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,050
So in this case, what I would typically do if a disabled button here let's let's make the background

89
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,010
color like.

90
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,970
Maybe like 30% or something.

91
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,050
Yeah, that's, that's fine.

92
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,740
So we have a 30% on the background color and the foreground for the text would be something like 75%.

93
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,090
Maybe that's a little too much.

94
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,700
We can do something like 50%.

95
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,770
You can even go even lower.

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,090
We can do 25.

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,350
Yeah.

98
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,330
This looks like a good disabled submit button, and this usually comes in handy when you're doing stuff

99
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:21,080
like credit card information or even entering login information, registration based information.

100
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,640
So keep that in mind.

101
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:28,610
Your users may be more inclined to actually fill out all the required information rather than rushing

102
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,950
to submit and then seeing errors everywhere.

103
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,060
Make sure to test this with your target users whenever you can.

104
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,180
And that's it for best practices for buttons.
