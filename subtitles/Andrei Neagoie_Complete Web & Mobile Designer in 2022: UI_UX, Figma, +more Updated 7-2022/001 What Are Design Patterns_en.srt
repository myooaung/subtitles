00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,380
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,110
In this lesson, we're going to learn about design patterns.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,590
So what are design patterns?

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,480
Well, design patterns are the reoccurring solutions that solve a lot of our design problems that we

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,800
always have the solution for.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,370
And these are kind of like your standard reference points as a designer.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,860
That can mean like infinite scrolls that just keep loading.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,190
That could mean also like breadcrumbs.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,659
And these are a few examples of design patterns that we're all kind of familiar with.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,060
Now, if you're designing a new product, you'll want to figure out the easiest way that users can interact

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,630
with it.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,620
So let's think of something that we always do.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,300
Log in in registration.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,930
Now, we always ask people to sign up, sign in, log in and log out.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,180
And each of us use numerous web and mobile applications on a daily basis.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,630
And I think we can all agree that constantly entering your name, like over here or your password over

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,150
and over again, it's tiresome.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:15,480
So like this completely tiresome to constantly enter your email, your name, your username, your password.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,670
And there are design patterns that solve that.

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,150
So we can usually use like a pattern like this where there's like a social login or there is some kind

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,730
of like, remember me?

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,420
These are design patterns.

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,320
Now the first step is finding the problem.

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,010
So users understandably are short on time and patience from having to complete small tasks repeatedly

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,860
to access their information or get their work accomplished.

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,210
So in this case, our problem is that users want to sign in quickly.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,130
Now we often try to find ways to eliminate that pain point.

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,260
That's the next step is like the solution.

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,090
So we want to find ways to eliminate or at least diminish this pain point for them.

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,110
So over here a solution could be like social login like I mentioned before, or having like a remember

31
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,670
me checkbox.

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,139
So those are ways that you can kind of solve that issue that we're all very familiar with.

33
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:18,360
Now, there is no need to recreate the wheel every single time, although we could design our own solution

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,350
to the problem.

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,420
Several useful solutions have already been designed in the past, and they're proven to be effective.

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,020
So there's no need to for you to go out there and kind of retry or redesign something like that over

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,860
and over again to get a different result when there's no need to.

38
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,440
So for example, like I mentioned before, some sites like have the ability to allow users to sign in

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,850
using social media.

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,310
Others sometimes don't even ask users to sign in until they really need to, and others save the user's

41
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,150
data and kind of pre populate that within the sign in fields.

42
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:59,040
So there are different ways that we can actually solve for this without necessarily having to do extra

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,610
work.

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,540
Now let's talk about the categories of patterns.

45
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,870
So there are six categories of design patterns.

46
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,640
And, you know, this kind of changes based off of people's ideas of what design patterns are.

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,840
And they mean there's no one truth, but these are the six categories that I usually follow.

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,660
So the first one is data input.

49
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,470
So over here we have like a kind of like a drag and drop that is considered like a data and input category.

50
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,250
And these patterns handle data input and feedback that a product gives in response to the data it receives.

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,890
The second one is content structuring.

52
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:43,050
So these patterns streamline the overall kind of flow of our user experience and they ensure accessibility

53
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,970
of all page elements.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,270
So users feel confident while they're browsing your product.

55
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:54,600
So that can mean like just natural flow of the page, allowing users to have that really accessible

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,230
and easy flow and just the way you kind of structure your content.

57
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,470
So over here, like just the different options and how it's neatly structured is one way that we kind

58
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,910
of find design patterns.

59
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,530
Another one is navigation.

60
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,240
So these patterns ensure like effortless navigation through your product.

61
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,480
So like over here we have an example of just a sidebar navigation.

62
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,829
That is one design pattern.

63
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,780
There are many different types of navigation design patterns and so they're just kind of structured

64
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,510
and we can go much deeper into what navigation necessarily means and how to have an effective navigation.

65
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,450
Next is incentivization.

66
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:38,020
So these patterns kind of push your users to perform certain actions with rewards or successfully completed

67
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,830
actions.

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,100
One thing that comes to mind that I think of is like workout based applications where they reward users

69
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,190
based off of things that they complete or games.

70
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,810
So these are different types of ways to kind of include those design patterns and those are the types

71
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,860
of scenarios that you would necessarily see them in hierarchy.

72
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,740
So these patterns help you craft a visual hierarchy so you can easily distinguish primary elements.

73
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,680
So over here we have like primary buttons, secondary buttons, even just like elements in terms of

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,500
like what is selected and how things are kind of laid out on the page.

75
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,680
So a bunch of different types of design patterns for that as well.

76
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,950
And I will link a resource for different types of design patterns.

77
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:28,280
Its UI patterns dot com I believe, and that is a great place to see all the different types of patterns

78
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,280
and different types of categories that you can kind of dig into.

79
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,850
And last one is social media.

80
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,870
So these are patterns that kind of encourage users to share and interact with others online.

81
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,210
So that could be like links that could be just like share buttons or reply buttons.

82
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,690
I mean, there's different ways that users can interact through social media.

83
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,290
Like tags, I would say, are kind of a part of that as well.

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,960
So there are a bunch of different types of design patterns in relation to social media, and that's

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,570
it for our categories on design patterns.
