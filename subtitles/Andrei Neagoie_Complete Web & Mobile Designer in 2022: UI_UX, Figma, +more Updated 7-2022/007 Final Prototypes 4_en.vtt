00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.860
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.710
So we are in another prototype here.

3
00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.580
Super, super complex.

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.600
I mean, not that complex.

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.720
I mean, it looks much crazier than it actually is.

6
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.180
But let's get right into it.

7
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.470
What I want to showcase today is just how a user can add something to a cart and just my thought process

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.280
around that.

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.200
So what I have here is I have like a little interest picker on the home page.

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.130
And when users kind of select or drag any one of these options, it's going to smart animate the options

11
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.430
here.

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.980
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

13
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.440
So we're just going to push these other options out and these will be able to be selected.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.710
So what I really want to focus on is the rules that I was trying to follow before and around just motion

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.090
in general, showing proper state feedbacks, allowing users to actually see like what's happening without

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.710
making like certain interactions instantaneous or happen instantaneously.

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.780
So like if I swipe this, it doesn't mean that like in an instant we're going to jump to the next page,

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.070
but I want to see that smooth transition and understand that, hey, that's how I got here.

19
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.540
So now that we're on this page, what I'm going to do is I want to continue with that kind of philosophy

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.480
and I want to click this controller.

21
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.980
And what's going to happen is this image is going to animate into here and this is what I'm talking

22
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.100
about, how things need to be named properly.

23
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.240
Let's take a look.

24
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.800
So I've named this one product.

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.480
It's like a frame within a frame.

26
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.480
So there's a frame here and then there's the product container frame within this I need to name this

27
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.800
whole thing, product container.

28
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.810
If I want things to work out the proper way, I can't remove this from the product container, this

29
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.870
item, because the product container creates that little animation there.

30
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.050
And this is what I was talking about when we were creating prototypes.

31
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.620
When we have so many different moving pieces and parts, it makes it a little bit more difficult.

32
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.770
So what I would rather do now, I would probably break this into its own prototype to showcase this

33
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.280
interaction.

34
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.910
And then after maybe once I'm happy with that, I can rename this to whatever I wanted to and probably

35
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.460
take this out of the frame and then have less frames to worry about in the following in the following

36
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.150
interactions.

37
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.210
But I just want to showcase everything at once.

38
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.360
But if you're going to go back and do it, do it a little bit more differently now.

39
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.150
So if I want to click on this, it's going to pop up.

40
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.850
You'll see that this image is going to animate and grow.

41
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.950
So let's click that.

42
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.970
So we have that image animating and growing and you'll notice that, hey, this actually led just to

43
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.630
this page.

44
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.440
What happened?

45
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.060
Like, why does it look like this?

46
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.150
Well, that's because I didn't want everything to pop in at once, because that's pretty jarring as

47
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.690
well.

48
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.220
So I've settled delay and it's only a one millisecond delay.

49
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.240
So what's going to happen is this is going to pop up and right afterwards we're going to start another

50
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.830
animation and it's going to take 400 milliseconds, which is just under a second.

51
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.350
And we're going to smart enemy move in these items.

52
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.380
Unless they're already there.

53
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.670
So if I select this.

54
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.280
It's not there.

55
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.360
It's going to move in.

56
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.310
What about the carousel?

57
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.510
So if I go into product, the carousel dots are there, so they aren't going to move in because that

58
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.680
would be kind of weird.

59
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.580
What they're going to do, though, is they're going to actually just dissolve in.

60
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.820
So, like I said before, if you have a matching layers, they're going to just be handled properly

61
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.330
as is.

62
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.880
So this is such like a zero opacity.

63
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.880
This is just going to kind of come in, it's not going to move in with the rest.

64
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.160
So let's take a look where we are right now.

65
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.380
So at this point, there's a couple of things we can do.

66
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.390
And what I want to showcase is, you know, the different variations of how we can look through different

67
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.110
products.

68
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.450
And I thought about bringing in a little bit more fun.

69
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.770
I thought, you know what, if we use gifts to showcase some product features?

70
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.360
So we see, oh, wow.

71
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.670
Like this starts to become a lot more interesting.

72
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.720
There's a lot it's much more dynamic as a product.

73
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.060
Things are happening on my screen.

74
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.560
I'm wowed as a user.

75
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.540
And now we're just back to the normal one.

76
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.180
And you can tell, like everything else changes accordingly.

77
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.730
So that way it's easier to see.

78
00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:22.730
Really nice.

79
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.530
And the way I did that was because the screen background color on this image is black.

80
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.360
I needed to be able to set this background to black, but I also needed to break this out into several

81
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.400
frames so we don't get some weird black coloring coming through.

82
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.410
So I've kind of just hidden it to the side in this frame.

83
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.660
And then once we swipe through this frame, we're going to have the same kind of delay.

84
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.140
So we can see that here if we zoom in.

85
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.790
So after a delay one millisecond and then the 200 millisecond push in and nothing is going to change,

86
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.960
the only thing that's going to change is this item's coming in now and then.

87
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.490
Same for when we swipe out.

88
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.120
So that item is just going to be on the edge again and we're going to pop over to this.

89
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.730
So let's take a look again.

90
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.690
So we're able to.

91
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.070
Swipe in and out.

92
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.850
And it's really smooth.

93
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.180
You can actually catch a little bit of the black background here.

94
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.320
It's not going to be perfect.

95
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.400
See if we can catch it.

96
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.410
You see it right there.

97
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.920
But it happens so quickly that you don't even notice it.

98
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.380
Just barely enough.

99
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.670
Nothing's going to be perfect, but it's enough to give people an understanding of how you want things

100
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.120
to work.

101
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.500
And all within figma.

102
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.540
So super, super amazing.

103
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.230
So let's jump in now.

104
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.250
The next thing I want to showcase is what happens when we want to add something to our cart.

105
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.410
So I've been thinking a lot about the cart icon.

106
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.210
I actually like the bag icon a little bit more.

107
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.760
It kind of coincides with the brand that we have.

108
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.590
So I've kind of like this little bag button alongside some of the details here.

109
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.830
And what happens here is if there are options for the user to select, I want that to kind of pop up.

110
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.540
So in the case that there isn't, then users can go straight to the cart.

111
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.760
But let's take a look.

112
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.290
So when I click this button, we're going to smart animate, and that means all the layers are going

113
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.360
to act accordingly based off of the naming.

114
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.450
So this is named footer and this is named Footer.

115
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.890
So this is actually going to apply its own scaling and positioning.

116
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.810
So this is going to slide up.

117
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.930
And we're actually going to have this dissolve in since it's called new product details and not just

118
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.760
the regular product details that is here.

119
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.980
And like I said before, creating these kind of little micro interactions, you have to also take into

120
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.330
account like what happens.

121
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.000
Like, this is not really much.

122
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.920
We want to kind of pop this up as well.

123
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.850
So I was thinking this pops up, pops up a little bit too much.

124
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.370
And as after that delay, this starts coming in and this shrinks down.

125
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.210
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

126
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.700
So we kind of have a little bit of movement here now.

127
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.520
Let's go back a couple of pages.

128
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.790
Let's do that one more time.

129
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.790
So we see that kind of pop down and then we have our cart and I've just made the whole bottom of the

130
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.370
screen like a big yellow CTA.

131
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.140
It's entirely covered.

132
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.600
I want users eyes to be attracted right there.

133
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.010
I want them to actually convert.

134
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.530
I want them to click and I want them to kind of check out.

135
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.850
So at this point, we can do a couple of things.

136
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.980
We can access our selection.

137
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.400
Who knows?

138
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.440
Maybe the price does change when a user selects like a blue controller versus a black controller.

139
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.540
Maybe it doesn't, but we want to give the users all these different options and how that reflected

140
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.440
here if need be.

141
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.740
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

142
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.120
So what I've done here, I've just applied a smart animate like I've done before in the past.

143
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.620
If the user clicks, we just kind of have that dissolve.

144
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.020
If I go back, I can see my selection is reflected there.

145
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.890
And my selection is reflected there.

146
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:24.080
So really simple way to kind of showcase just the changing of colors or the changing of options around

147
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.800
a product.

148
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:32.539
And then the last part, when a user does click on this button, what's going to happen is things are

149
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.049
going to shrink, the image is going to start to shrink down as well.

150
00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:42.559
And then we're going to kind of go back to the state that we had before around the cart, just like

151
00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.600
the larger image that you can swipe through.

152
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:50.630
Another thing to think about is I've actually taken that animation that we created way back and placed

153
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.960
it in here.

154
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.710
It's a little pixelated, but it's the gift that we created of the ball bouncing.

155
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.070
Within fake motion, and I'll show you what that looks like.

156
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.140
So we're going to add this to the cart.

157
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.340
And there you go.

158
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.500
We kind of have our little notification saying that, hey, you have something in your shopping bag,

159
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.140
it's just going to bounce over and over again.

160
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.280
And if we want to remove it, we can start from scratch.

161
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.450
So keeping things really simple as much as possible.

162
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.720
Also kind of understanding that there's a couple of layers, especially to a page like this and different

163
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.710
types of states.

164
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.610
So we want to kind of reflect that.

165
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.140
We want to give users good enough feedback that, hey, you have something in your cart.

166
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.450
Go and actually, like, take care of that.

167
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.590
Hey, you can go straight to the card if you want to or you can remove it.

168
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.840
Making this CTA the primary one.

169
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.630
This is much more secondary and.

170
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.230
Right here.

171
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:52.280
We've probably used the remove button in a way where it's not necessarily the type of button.

172
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.430
That we would use.

173
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.790
So we'd probably do like a 16 style.

174
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.560
This would be like just like the text button.

175
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.700
And to see UI gray.

176
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.620
And there you go.

177
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:11.690
And if we wanted to if we really wanted to kind of de-emphasize that, just remove the font weight.

178
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.960
So we were on an extra bold note.

179
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.130
We just thought bold.

180
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.100
But like I said before, once you create like a typographic system or just like components, you're

181
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.210
not locked in.

182
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.640
There's certain variations that you need to create.

183
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.080
You may want to create just so you have a little bit more depth of your in your designs.

184
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.530
And it's not necessarily too much to handle for a developer.

185
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:39.630
So what I've done here is now we're on the final screen and users can see that they have an item in

186
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.020
their cart.

187
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.630
And this will be reflected on the navigation as well.

188
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.130
What we can also do is say we take this home navigation.

189
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.810
We're going to go to our checkout.

190
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.210
So we have another checkout over here.

191
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.780
Actually just leave that for now.

192
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.390
If we wanted to say, go home.

193
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.110
And we wanted to place this gif.

194
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.860
Let's see.

195
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.830
Where is this located?

196
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:14.860
Okay.

197
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.810
So we have a shopping bag.

198
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.390
Okay.

199
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.300
So our gift is in here for some reason.

200
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.720
Probably bring it all the way on top.

201
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.010
And like if we wanted to, we can actually remove this frame, we can keep it there because nobody's

202
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:30.430
scrolling.

203
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.150
But okay, so we have that and.

204
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.890
So if we did want to change.

205
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.320
The cart.

206
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.760
We can easily do that here to the cup bag.

207
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.880
And what I'm going to do is.

208
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.310
Oops.

209
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.050
I kind of just paste that in there.

210
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.140
So it's a really long, weird name.

211
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.660
We can rename that just to give.

212
00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.910
Okay.

213
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.220
So we can just place that right here.

214
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:10.040
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to connect this page to that page.

215
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.000
It's just going to move in.

216
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.020
No more animation.

217
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.650
That's it.

218
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.620
So we can start seeing how that gif will look if we actually have it in our navigation.

219
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:27.110
So you know what I really want it to showcase here is that we have a bunch of different options in terms

220
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:33.020
of like dragging, showing that state feedback, also switching it up when the user is clicking on an

221
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:40.400
item and going into like a new page like this and keeping that really smooth as a transition, but also

222
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.780
making sure that there are transitions when users are clicking certain buttons like that.

223
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.860
If they if they click above that, it kind of just goes down.

224
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:55.100
But we notice that things are very, very clear on how users are getting from one place to the next.

225
00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:01.490
And that is what we've done for the product page and adding an item to a cart.
