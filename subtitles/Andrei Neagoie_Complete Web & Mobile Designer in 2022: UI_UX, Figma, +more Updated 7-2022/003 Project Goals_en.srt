1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,350
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,810
So what we're going to do is we're going to start with project goals.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,280
And I'm actually going to take this little canvas here and I'm going to duplicate it.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,740
I'm going to take this copy out.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,720
And what we can do is we can just make

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:16,860
our own.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
You can barely see that.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,820
But we're going to bump that size right up.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,600
So we'll bump it up to 80.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,500
OC perfect.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,670
We are just going to make sure that that is like that.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,170
So the reason why I have this set up the way I do.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,500
It is because.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,510
Well, everyone in the room to come in and bring their own thoughts to the table without having to raise

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,630
your hand, having to, you know, talk out loud about it.

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,280
Sometimes people are shy.

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,220
Sometimes there are more dominant voices in the room.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,790
Give me 1/2.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,160
What is the goal of the project?

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,640
Sometimes people just clam up.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,970
They don't really express what they truly believe is best for the project.

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,140
Sometimes, you know, generally if there's like a CEO in the room.

23
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,570
I find that's usually the case if there's like a boss and somebody does want to speak up.

24
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,430
So what I usually do is I give everyone stickies.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,570
So we're going to have to do here is run out to create a frame and this is going to be our sticky.

26
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,990
So like I say, you can do this in Figma if you want.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,440
Perfect.

28
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,270
That will be our sticky.

29
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,630
That's a pretty big sticky.

30
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,290
So what we're going to do here is we're just going to center this.

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,550
And this frame is going to.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,260
So yeah, we can do this in Figma.

33
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,090
I've done it in Figma before.

34
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,580
I thought it was really helpful.

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,210
We're just going to set our constraints so that way when we resize this box.

36
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:35,090
Everything gets resized within OC so we can actually get rid of a lot of these colors.

37
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,570
And we can just rename this OC perfect.

38
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,460
So what we're going to do is we're going to ask the main question of a project, what is the project

39
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,260
goal or what is the goal of the project?

40
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,330
And we're going to get everyone to write down on stickies what they believe is the goal of the project.

41
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,350
So basically using like that Google sprint model of, you know, diverge, go off and do your own thing.

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,080
And then after post those stickies on the whiteboard or the digital whiteboard, whichever one year

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,870
feel comfortable with or whichever one you're forced to use in the moment and then converge, come together

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,700
to kind of rank them, ask questions about them, see which goals there are.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,750
There's usually multiple goals, whether that's user goals, whether that's business goals.

46
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,500
But we get a good understanding of what like the main project goal is here.

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,630
Now let's get started.

48
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,120
Like I said, we want to figure out what a successful outcome looks like at the end of this project.

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,180
And like I said prior, it's done collaboratively.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,080
We really want to reveal everyone's perspectives, and then we can resolve any conflicting priorities.

51
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:55,610
Now understanding specific activities the softer will help people do should help provide a solid foundation

52
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,760
for making product decisions moving forward.

53
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,430
Some questions and answers are as follows.

54
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,640
What problems are you trying to solve for this project?

55
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:18,980
So some people may write something like We want to extend the capabilities of the application, so you

56
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,870
may be working on an existing application.

57
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,690
So you may want to have like updates and that's perfectly fine.

58
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,160
That happens sometimes.

59
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,990
So that could be one.

60
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:39,620
Another one could be we want to create an application.

61
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,000
To support a specific user task.

62
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,470
And generally this is what we kind of see, rather see people wanting to build a new application or

63
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,950
extending the capabilities of an existing application.

64
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,580
Sometimes we want to build an application for something specific that a user needs to do.

65
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,420
I find that the best question to ask is something like What outcomes do you hope this application helps

66
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,920
you achieve during and maybe directly after this engagement?

67
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:21,140
So some answers may be something like make a sale to a customer.

68
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:33,010
Or sometimes a project will be more based on an MVP, like we need to present a proof

69
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,200
of product to potential investors.

70
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,430
Now, you may be thinking, Oh, wow, these are way crazy goals.

71
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,380
Like this is not something I would have thought about.

72
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,240
I was thinking maybe something like, I want to create an application to make sure people wake up if

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,170
it's an alarm.

74
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,980
But generally, sometimes there are other goals that we need to think about, and this helps us really

75
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,420
prioritize the type of work that we're going to be working on in order to showcase certain things.

76
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,470
Like an example is with this sticky, I often got this in my career.

77
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,010
I still do.

78
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:13,030
Sometimes we want to create like a minimum viable product or an MVP so that we can show that to investors

79
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,210
to show them why our product is viable and what is the quickest way to get there.

80
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,010
So what I usually do is I usually get all these different types of answers.

81
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,930
I get people to come together.

82
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,180
And they're going to rank these.

83
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,760
Sometimes there will be overlap.

84
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,260
Sometimes another person may say something like this.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,360
Create MVP, which is a minimum viable product, and these people will come together and be like, Oh,

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
this is pretty similar.

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,780
So we'll just map these together and we'll just call this one a proof of product.

88
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,200
And generally, if there are a lot of stickies that are similar, you'll know that that's a priority

89
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,480
for that team or that client.

90
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,000
And that's when you can really start ranking them.

91
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,050
But this is done collaboratively.

92
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,010
Now, what we really want to do is we want to get these people in the same room, like I mentioned,

93
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,510
working together.

94
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,240
And you want the right people there that are going to really help define the success of a project.

95
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,760
And over here, you'd be able to really pull out what the goals of the project are.

96
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,680
I'll give you one more example of what an answer could be.

97
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,510
One could be.

98
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,980
I want to attract

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:45,260
early users and show that there is traction.

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:53,690
So if I think about this goal, I think about maybe an example of our product with habitual.

101
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,380
If we want to attract early users and show that there is traction, maybe we will focus on different

102
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,370
parts of the application.

103
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,970
We'll say, what are ways that we can do this?

104
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,120
An example being we want to show that users are signing up.

105
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,260
We want to show that users are selecting different types of categories or interests that pertain to

106
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,210
them and they're interacting with the application.

107
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,080
They're coming back.

108
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,610
The application is sticky.

109
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,990
Pardon the pun.

110
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:27,010
There are different ways that these goals can actually translate into things that you need to work on.

111
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,920
And that's it for project goals.
