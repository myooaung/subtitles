1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,620
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,130
We're going to be talking about product search and that prototype.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,440
So like I said before, I mean, these prototypes can get pretty, pretty complex.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,030
We have another complex one over here and I'll run through how this worked out and how I did it.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,530
So I have the homepage leading directly to search.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,890
So before in a lot of my wireframes and a lot of my sketches, I was thinking about what happens if

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,630
search is actually at the top.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,160
I didn't like that implementation.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,690
I wanted to keep search right at the bottom, you know, make a little bit more interesting, a little

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,770
bit more easier for users to reach.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:43,150
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you what that looks like very quickly and I'll break it

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,720
down.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,220
So here we go.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,340
We have we have our containers.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,160
Now if we want to click search.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,510
A little bit vague, but you see, that's smart animation.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,580
Back and forth.

18
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,520
Beautiful.

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:10,680
So what happens here is when I click this button, it's just going to slide in and you can see the animation

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,180
over here slides in.

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,260
We have a 300 millisecond animation and it's just going to bring in all these elements that don't match

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,810
any elements on the other page, but it also brings in a nav.

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,010
And as you can tell, I've taken care of the knob, I've taken it out of the component structure just

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,950
so I can actually create a better prototype.

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,290
I've had to create the active bar and take it out of each individual frame, which is fine for the prototype.

26
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,760
I mean, when you think about the component, then it makes sense to kind of break that up a little

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,150
bit more.

28
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,520
But over here we've taken it out just so we can have that sliding animation, which is really, really

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,210
slick.

30
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:54,050
So what's going to happen next is if the user clicks this search, they'll pop up, the keyboard, will

31
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,370
get an active search.

32
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,640
And then if they select the back button, we can go back, they select the keyboard we're going to kind

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,660
of pre fill for them.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,100
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,520
So we have a change.

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,479
We can go back.

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,540
If I select any one of these buttons, then we have some new content.

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,550
And within that new content we can see like music, musicals, music for babies.

39
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,260
We have that type pre fill.

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,800
If I clear that search, we're going all the way back.

41
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,070
So if I go to music, then I'm going to result.

42
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,690
So let's hang on there.

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,050
So what I want to do is if we this is the happy flow.

44
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,600
We go through the music, we find a results.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,290
It's up here.

46
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,810
We can clear that and go back if we wanted.

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,490
We can also press this button.

48
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,860
I haven't linked it, but we can if we want to do that over here we have our home button.

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,040
We can go back, but now we have all the different results.

50
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,210
Let's take a look at what the filters look like.

51
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:02,570
So what I've done here is with the filters, when the user clicks, we have a move in.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,860
And it's not going to smart on me because I just want like a kind of like a brand new overlay.

53
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,230
And this is our these are our filters.

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,350
And so this will just kind of reverse that.

55
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,370
We're going to move out.

56
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,490
So we're going to move down same type of timing, same type of transition.

57
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,950
And over here, I've just started to think about what other types of filters we want to show here.

58
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,750
We're going to sort by the standard stuff like Price and Customer Review.

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,220
We have different categories we can possibly sort by price range.

60
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,700
We have customer reviews of four plus stars, three plus stars and so on, and another footer over here

61
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,460
showcasing how many results are actually going to show up.

62
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,220
So that's what I've done.

63
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,180
If users even click that, it'll just kind of do the same thing.

64
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,620
Now let's go back.

65
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:02,020
So that's what happens if users actually are able to slide in and get those results much more easier

66
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,510
than if they selected something else.

67
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,610
So we're going to actually go from here now.

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,430
So let me just.

69
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,190
So if a user does click music from here, like from maybe suggested searches, they'll go straight to

70
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,300
those search results.

71
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,130
Same type of animation.

72
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,730
In the case where they select sneakers.

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,680
I want to show a different scenario.

74
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,860
So we're going to navigate and we're going to have a dissolve effect.

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,850
So everything is going to stay the same up here and down here.

76
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,800
But we're going to have a nice little dissolve effect showing, oh, no, like we have no results for

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
your type of search.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,880
And I want to make this a little bit more interesting.

79
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,070
I want to have an illustration here.

80
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,260
We could actually improve this a little bit more.

81
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,260
We can probably suggest a little bit more in terms of searches.

82
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,650
But for the sake of the prototype, this is what we've come up with.

83
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,350
If the user does, click on here.

84
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,280
They can go back to.

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,040
Like if they click here to make it active, they can hypothetically type in them.

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,810
That would bring them back to kind of the MOS, the beginning of music.

87
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,700
So let's take a look at what that all looks like.

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,770
So we're gonna go back.

89
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,230
We have our suggested searches.

90
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,070
Oh, no.

91
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,700
OC.

92
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,630
We clear that we'll go back there?

93
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,890
Let's go check out our suggested searches here.

94
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,280
So if we click on here, then we get that carrot.

95
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,830
We can make that probably a flashing care if we wanted to and we'll go back to music we search based

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,670
off of that.

97
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,550
We have our music pop in.

98
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,190
So our search results, sorry about that.

99
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,650
So this is essentially easy way to kind of showcase what our search will look like.

100
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,590
As you can tell, it's easy to get to let's remove all these lines.

101
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,260
It's very easy to get to in our bottom nav.

102
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,180
And then once we do get there, this kind of whole experience is very streamlined.

103
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,680
We're trying to get them suggested search as based off of the recommendations right away.

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,790
And if they do actually want to search manually, we can hand that off really easily with the type ahead

105
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,720
over here.

106
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,690
We're trying to get them more relevant results based off of that search.

107
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,570
And then once they do, they're right in to their results and they are easily filter able.

108
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:31,180
So making this search much more easy to access, easy to use, was a big part of my thinking when approaching

109
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,300
these prototypes in the High Fidelity Designs, and that is how we've prototyped search.
