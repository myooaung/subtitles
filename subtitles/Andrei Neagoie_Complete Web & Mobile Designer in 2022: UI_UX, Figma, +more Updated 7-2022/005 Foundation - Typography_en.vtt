Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.110
We're going to be talking about typography.

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.280
Just like your whole entire design system, not just like your foundation.

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.970
Now, this typography, like, makes up a lot of your components, a lot of your actual designs.

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.570
And I don't think designers put enough thought and care into how they distinguish variations between

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.610
typography and how they use it.

7
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.330
So what I've done here, I've taken a lot of time and I put a lot of effort into just creating a nice

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.200
type scale.

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.690
As you can see, we're moving 12 to 20 to 24, 32, 36, 40.

10
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.150
So four pixels is what we're basing a lot of this off of.

11
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.330
And a pixel.

12
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.590
So that's the line height.

13
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.400
My font size is 12 pixels, 16 pixels, 22, 28, 32 and 40.

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.980
And I think that creates enough variation just for headings.

15
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.640
I created six kind of like your standard set and we may not use all of this, but I've created it to

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.630
give us enough variance.

17
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.680
Maybe in the future.

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.060
So as you can tell, like I have the style name here and these are our local typography styles.

19
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.650
And what I've done is I've broken it out just so it's easier for other people to come into this design

20
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.070
system and just understand it.

21
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.140
And in the beginning I mentioned what is a design system?

22
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.610
A design system isn't necessarily just providing styles, but it's also providing so many different

23
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.330
things like context, more deeper understanding of these styles.

24
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.550
So if a developer wanted to come in, they would be able to easily understand that the way is assembled.

25
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.790
Wait, the line height is set to 40 pixels and the font size is set to 40 pixels and they can easily

26
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.740
implement that into a component within your digital design system.

27
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.530
So keep in mind that this isn't just a language for designers.

28
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.040
A design system is for your team, for your product.

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.220
Everyone is using it in one aspect and you may have variants of different things like for marketing.

30
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.970
In marketing may not be the exact same as how you have treatments within user interface, like in terms

31
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.710
of applications and products.

32
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.010
So you can distinguish that within your design system.

33
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.400
You can create different design systems, you can create different categories.

34
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.760
You can have just a design system just for your marketing website.

35
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.110
You can have a design system for just your product and so on.

36
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.700
So I've done this in a way where a developer could easily come in here and understand, this is my H

37
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:48.600
one, and these are all the different parts of my H one that I can actually create into a component

38
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.000
and reuse through just code.

39
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.460
You also got the code section over here that will tell you all the different types of styles.

40
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.760
So you have my font style, my font weight, we have my font size and so on.

41
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.900
So that is how I've broken out headings and headings is very straightforward, you know, you just have

42
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.510
like a pretty standard scale moving from large to smaller and or vice versa.

43
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.300
Now for text, I've decided to use the category called text just to kind of encompass different things

44
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.590
like body copy.

45
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.750
So I have different variants of that.

46
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.400
Let's go over here.

47
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.620
So I have like a body large, I have a regular, I have a small enough, an alternate small if I need

48
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.010
it.

49
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.900
These are kind of your standard body copy styles.

50
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.480
We have like our font size, so you'll see that I'm reusing a lot of different types of font sizes.

51
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.560
I'm not all over the place.

52
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.180
I'm not like using like 14 pixels, 13 pixels, 12 pixels, 11 pixels.

53
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.540
I have definitely a method to all this madness.

54
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.790
I mean, I'm using 16 pixels for my body.

55
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.920
I feel like you going any smaller than 16 pixels on a mobile screen, you're going to have some small

56
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.540
issues with readability.

57
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.340
I think that's fine with copy.

58
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.420
That isn't so important.

59
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.060
But when you're trying to display things like product names or more important information, stick to

60
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.890
16 pixels and above.

61
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.560
That's what I have for my body copy.

62
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.940
We don't have a lot of body copy within this application.

63
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.990
I'll show you where we kind of use them.

64
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.770
I have labels, so I have a label style, which is just your 12 pixel with a pixel line height.

65
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.570
And it's just a simple label over here and I have a hint.

66
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.930
I've given myself a ten pixel hint.

67
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.050
This is just in case I need to incorporate something that's even smaller, maybe like a very small hint,

68
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.700
maybe some fine text, but I've given myself that option and we can change that in the future.

69
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.030
So this is how I've gone ahead and created my styles.

70
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.440
You've seen me do this in the past.

71
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.120
It's in the text section over here and I named it Hint with a ten pixel font size, and right beside

72
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.160
it is 16 pixel line height.

73
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.900
And just like that, we have a textile that we can apply.

74
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.780
If I wanted to say go ahead and apply something different.

75
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.880
Very easily, you can apply something different.

76
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.970
So textiles are super important.

77
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.540
And then in my last section, I have a pretty important section called interactions.

78
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.460
And here we handle different things where users are going to interact with our text elements.

79
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.500
Links maybe strikethrough as I've created a strikethrough style just because we have prices and if we

80
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.200
want to display something like a sale, then we have a strikethrough.

81
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.710
This isn't necessarily something that somebody can interact with, but I thought that it placed well

82
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.490
within here.

83
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.140
Because it is very much in relation to our pill text.

84
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.220
We have a pill text over here as well and that is more so for little pill containers.

85
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.450
They could be pill checkboxes or they could be just ways to show like little 20% off on the card.

86
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.350
So I've created like even text variants for that.

87
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.820
And really there isn't much variance between some of these things.

88
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.340
Like you'll see this is an all cap version and that just makes it much more easier for me to apply something

89
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.450
without having to worry about like capitalization.

90
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.320
This will just automatically do it for me.

91
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.720
Same for things like strikethrough or underlines for links and you'll see like my variants as well.

92
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.150
There isn't much difference between my regular version here and my alternate version, but it's just

93
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.540
enough.

94
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.680
Makes your life easier.

95
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.740
So create those variants if you need them, even create them.

96
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.740
If you think you may need them, they may come in handy.

97
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.210
But this is how I've set up my typography system within this larger design system, and I'll show you

98
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.010
in our next videos how we kind of go in and use these different types of elements.
