00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.550
Hey, let's jump right back into creating some more user flows.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.390
So where do we leave off?

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:06.930
Lost?

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.520
Well, we actually finished creating a user flow for finding the right product through search.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.680
And right at the end we finished with the product description page and I think that's a good kick off

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.890
to possibly adding an item to the cart.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.800
Let's just duplicate this.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.440
Let's rename it so on, daughter.

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.970
What should we call this?

10
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.330
Making a purchase.

11
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.070
Perfect.

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.890
Let's delete this.

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.730
Let's start cleaning this up just a bit.

14
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.090
So hypothetically, the user has added this to their cart.

15
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.340
They're back at the home screen.

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.320
Let's delete all of that.

17
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.640
Let's put our title.

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.920
So our title is making a purchase.

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.200
Very nice.

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.620
Okay.

21
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.090
Step one.

22
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.770
Okay.

23
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.780
Just quick before we jump in, I'm going to click this.

24
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
And right now, this is the instance that we're on this button.

25
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.350
What we can do is we can click right here and our panel and click the instance section so button and

26
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.060
I can replace it with anything I want.

27
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.280
So I'm going to replace it with Field.

28
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.560
And there you go.

29
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.040
You don't have to keep on going back to your assets toggle if you don't want to have your tab over here.

30
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.750
So we actually didn't make a navigation and that's totally fine.

31
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.090
I'll just make one really quickly right now.

32
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.410
Okay.

33
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.920
Let's spread that all the way to the end.

34
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.860
That is going to be on the edge.

35
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.170
Another figment tip if you wanted to spread these all across evenly on the horizontal plane.

36
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.180
We're going to do this go up here.

37
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.620
And distribute.

38
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.960
Horizontal spacing.

39
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.400
Perfect.

40
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.520
So we can just do something like this.

41
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.950
And then.

42
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.670
So this is going to be our car icon for now.

43
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.440
If we really wanted to, we can jump in, grab the icon.

44
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.100
But we're just going to just use this and we're going to create another circle.

45
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.370
So think about when we usually have something in our cart.

46
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.910
We're using an app that has it in their car.

47
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.250
We usually have some sort of notification that's constantly there to basically push us to check out.

48
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.500
So we have a little notification there on top of our car icon, which totally looks like a cart just

49
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.080
to nudge the user in that direction so

50
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:11.330
the user is able to see a cart notification that they can interact with the user.

51
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.990
These are tips on the cart's navigation item.

52
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.870
Okay, so that's step one.

53
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.300
Let's duplicate this again.

54
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.200
Step to Nice.

55
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.680
So what do they see now?

56
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.260
Doo doo doo.

57
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.800
Kay.

58
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.340
There's probably some text at the top that says cards and our sketches before we started building out

59
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.690
what the screen looks like.

60
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.560
So we kind of have some sense of hierarchy here.

61
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.460
So let's just take some items.

62
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.370
So.

63
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.310
Whoops, there it is.

64
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.690
Let's bring that in.

65
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.600
So this is our item in our cards.

66
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.030
It's looking fantastic.

67
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.860
Grab a button.

68
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.920
You notice how quickly we're just creating these user flows with our components?

69
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.890
I mean, it's all about speeding up your workflow.

70
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:22.029
We don't have time to go over and recreate the wheel all over again every single frame.

71
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.350
So make your life easier, set yourself up for success.

72
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.650
Okay, so I have a beautiful card screen.

73
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.880
Totally a card screen.

74
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.230
So what we're going to do here is we're going to just write a description for this task.

75
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:46.900
The user is able to review the item slash as items in their cart.

76
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:59.630
Once they are happy with this information, they can proceed to the checkout process.

77
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.950
Okay.

78
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.740
That is perfect.

79
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.880
So step one, cart notification nudges them.

80
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.780
Step two, they go into the cart screen.

81
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.030
Now, step three.

82
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.450
So let's actually give a little bit more detail here.

83
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.400
Once they are happy with this information, they can proceed to the checkout process by tapping the

84
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.910
CTA.

85
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.840
I know we're kind of moving quickly, but it's always good to just go back and do your best to add any

86
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.670
details that you think are relevant.

87
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.760
I like to kind of break it into two different sentences.

88
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.370
I mean, they don't have to be limited to that, but they also don't need to be paragraphs.

89
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.930
So the first sentence is what the user sees, and the second sentence would be what they plan to do.

90
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.840
Sometimes that's kind of molded together like we have here.

91
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.400
The user is able to kind of review their item in their cart, so they are kind of doing something at

92
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.120
the same time.

93
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.100
But once they are happy with that, once they've seen that information, they're able to do something

94
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.400
else.

95
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.140
So in this case, they're clicking that CTA to actually start that checkout process.

96
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.880
Awesome.

97
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.900
I love it.

98
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.850
And it is coming together.

99
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.160
Let's go to the next step.

100
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.430
So review purchase details is probably what we would do next.

101
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:35.040
The user is able to review any details in relation to the total price.

102
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:43.440
User payment details, user address details.

103
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.090
And that's probably it.

104
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.980
I'm trying to think.

105
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.670
So total price.

106
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.540
Hmm.

107
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.550
Maybe some checkout details.

108
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.210
Maybe those are things like shipping.

109
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.880
We're chipping the price.

110
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.230
What else could there be?

111
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.050
There could be like promo codes.

112
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.110
So we do really need to think about all those different scenarios as well.

113
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.620
So see how the details are kind of just coming to me as I'm building these screens.

114
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.970
It's never going to be perfect.

115
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.030
And that's honestly, it's all about iterations, about putting something down on paper or digitally

116
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.120
and then building off that and getting better and better and just providing an overall good experience

117
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.810
for your users.

118
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.260
Don't just jump right into the pretty and fancy stuff just yet.

119
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.240
So what would you have here?

120
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.840
The user is able to review any details in relation to the total price.

121
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.760
Check out details, user payment details and user address details.

122
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.560
I'm just going to break this off.

123
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:49.250
Once the user is satisfied, they can complete their purchase.

124
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.220
Great.

125
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.980
So let's just kind of break out this screen a bit so they'll probably have the item details there.

126
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.230
What else could they have?

127
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.620
They'll probably have some information regarding.

128
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.070
Like.

129
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.140
Their account.

130
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.880
Yes.

131
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.560
And payment details.

132
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.890
Maybe that's at the bottom.

133
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.150
I'm not sure about the hierarchy just yet.

134
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.570
That's something that you just kind of test over time.

135
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.300
You prototype with people just to get it right.

136
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.360
Maybe there's a field for a promo code.

137
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.360
I don't know what it looks like just yet.

138
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.169
For this checkout process, there's probably, like, a headline.

139
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:35.419
Okay.

140
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.850
So we have like our item, we have our promo code.

141
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:48.320
Maybe some details around the product or I mean, sorry about the users details like their method of

142
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.770
payment.

143
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.800
If they're address that, maybe they'll be able to edit.

144
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.360
So I'm starting to think about that kind of stuff that I need to design for and think about.

145
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.710
Maybe this is a good place to throw in.

146
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.670
Like this is what the total could be.

147
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.480
Okay.

148
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.470
Perfect.

149
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.120
That actually kind of looks like a receipt.

150
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.240
Totally unintended, but I like it so.

151
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.230
What do you think the user should do after here?

152
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.360
The user probably confirms so.

153
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.820
Once the user is satisfied, they can complete their purchase.

154
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.730
The user gets a confirmation screen.

155
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:43.530
And is able to return back to the home page.

156
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:50.660
So when a user gets like a confirmation screen or something like this, that's a pretty big deal.

157
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.150
I think.

158
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.130
Personally, I think it's a huge deal.

159
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.650
And I think this is where we can start thinking about, well, a user just did something pretty amazing.

160
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.990
They made a purchase on our platform and we should kind of reward them with something, whether that's

161
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.400
like a micro interaction or some sort of animation just for delight.

162
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:17.940
So maybe it's something like we can start making a note here that just says Possible animation for purchase

163
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.930
confirmation.

164
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.480
So we can just kind of highlight that there and we can just label it a different color because I want

165
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.050
to really start thinking about these types of things early.

166
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.850
I don't want to leave it to the end because it's not good to leave it to the end, especially like how

167
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.230
we spoke about that in terms of when we were sketching and sketching interactions.

168
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.670
So we can kind of break this out a little bit more and start thinking about, well, what does this

169
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.360
look like?

170
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.730
What is the possible animation that we want to build here?

171
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.920
If we do want to build an animation, do we want to build an animation around like the notification?

172
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.590
So I'm going to probably leave a note here too.

173
00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:06.710
So Command C and Command V, that perfect possible animation round notification.

174
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:13.730
So I'm starting to pick out some key details here in this flow just so it makes my life easier when

175
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.610
I come back to this or when I'm building, I'm building this out further and that's it.

176
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.200
There you have it that's making a purchase.

177
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.240
So step one is the user is able to see a notification.

178
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.620
Step two is they well, they click on that notification, then they go to step two and step two would

179
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.780
be in their cart screen.

180
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:38.810
Look, I kind of think I forgot something here, maybe in their card screen they possibly see.

181
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.210
Additional items that they would like.

182
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.390
So that's something that probably think about.

183
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:51.270
I'm not sure if that's feasible or if we want to distract them here, but something to think about as

184
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:51.780
well.

185
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.140
Anyways, so step two is they go to their card screen and they're able to review this information and

186
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.830
if they're happy with that, they're going to go straight over here.

187
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.740
And when they're done here.

188
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.900
Reviewing their whole order payment details, other types of input fields.

189
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.370
Check out total.

190
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:20.900
They're able to click on this button to place their order, and once they're done that, they go to

191
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:26.510
a confirmation screen that basically gives them a high five for doing what they're doing.

192
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:34.580
So like I said, keep these user flows simple because there will be more user flows 100% as we saw.

193
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.610
Like there's probably a couple of flows that could come from this.

194
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:44.390
Like what happens if the user needs to change some payment details?

195
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.310
We can easily create a user flow for that.

196
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.430
What happens if the user deletes the item from here?

197
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.370
Where do they go?

198
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.350
Just keep making your user flows purposeful.

199
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.820
I mean, they need to have a purpose.

200
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.290
They need to be detailed.

201
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.070
So that way you can keep track of them and other people can really understand them.

202
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:07.250
And then from here we can really start defining much more of the structure of the app and also much

203
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.340
more of the details that we're going to need to design for.

204
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:16.550
And that will definitely lead right into us actually creating some wireframes with some content.

205
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.230
That's it for user flows.

206
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.640
This is making a purchase.
