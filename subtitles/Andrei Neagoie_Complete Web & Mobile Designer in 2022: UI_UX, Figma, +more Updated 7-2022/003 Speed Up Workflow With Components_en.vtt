00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.790
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.080
Now we're going to jump right into creating user flows in just a second.

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.040
What I want to do is I want to make our workflow just a bit better.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.690
We have these pieces here.

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.440
Let's go over to our Layers panel.

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.470
If you notice that they're just basically their own kind of rectangles and stuff like that, and that

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.280
kind of isn't that good for reusability.

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.740
We're actually going to pull some of these out and we're just going to create like a little components

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.340
page.

10
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.850
That's what we're going to name it, components.

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.710
And I'm going to show you how to create some reusable components pretty quickly.

12
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.350
Okay.

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.310
So let's pull some of these out.

14
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.210
You can delete that.

15
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.070
We can delete that.

16
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.380
I'm not sure about all the different types of components from going to need, but this is a good starting

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.950
point.

18
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.930
I think that's fine.

19
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.660
Actually, that's pretty repetitive.

20
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.790
Maybe we'll create some.

21
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.250
Header copy.

22
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.900
Maybe this is some other copy.

23
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.960
So we're kind of just creating some concepts based off of our user flows.

24
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.060
Our interfaces don't necessarily need to be super detailed right now.

25
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.390
We can refine those over time.

26
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.410
And we're going to definitely refine those when we start our wireframes.

27
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.170
Now, how to create a component.

28
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.340
So this is going to be our screen background.

29
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.720
And what we're going to do is we're going to right click or you can actually go up to here.

30
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.320
The short form for it is option command K.

31
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.690
So if we just command Z, option command K creates that as a component.

32
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.920
And what we can do here is we can create a new one.

33
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.480
I've option shift clicked and that is now an instance.

34
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.400
You'll notice it in the panel down here.

35
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.790
So this is now an instance and you can create new components from this instance.

36
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:14.860
But one interesting thing is if I click that and I start modifying that, it modifies the actual instance

37
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.310
as well.

38
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.250
So the instance will inherit pretty much everything from the master component.

39
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.770
It's a great way to create a lot of clarity within your product.

40
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.440
It's a great way to actually just have some consistency, even when you're thinking about user flows

41
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.640
or something as simple as that.

42
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.990
So that's why I'd like to do.

43
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.810
Let's group rename these as.

44
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.490
Also command are and we're selecting all of them and we'll just call these text.

45
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.060
And we'll group them in a frame.

46
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:55.660
And that frame is essentially we'll call that text and option command K to create a component.

47
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.140
And there we go.

48
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.400
We have a text component.

49
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.710
And all of a sudden now we can start putting things together.

50
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.710
So we have a text component that's due for the arrow over here.

51
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.930
Okay for the arrow, we'll call this one large product.

52
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.850
So large products option command k.

53
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.290
We'll keep these very.

54
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.610
Close together because they help us with our flow.

55
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.590
So we have that.

56
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:42.620
We call this headline option command K and really there is no perfect way of doing this.

57
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.160
If you want to follow along, I advise you, you just use our resource that we have there and you can

58
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.200
definitely start creating components as well.

59
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.480
So we have large product.

60
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.530
We have.

61
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.400
Text.

62
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.110
Maybe this is field.

63
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.230
So field option.

64
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.550
K There we go.

65
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.420
We got a field and we can even make that smaller.

66
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.820
So.

67
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.310
It sets a scale currently.

68
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.360
But if I.

69
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.720
Adjust the constraints to top and bottom.

70
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.100
Now it's going to actually work with the frame.

71
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.440
Okay.

72
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.680
That's great.

73
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.590
These are small products, so I'm going to batch rename them.

74
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.160
So I have them all selected commander and call them small products.

75
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.720
Small products.

76
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.630
And Option command k with them select it will create a frame and that component and that component will

77
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.810
name it small products.

78
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.260
Great.

79
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.700
Hmm.

80
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.840
What should we call this?

81
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.540
We can just call this confirmation.

82
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.900
And this one up the field together.

83
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.540
Oops.

84
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.740
Put the pen in there.

85
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.970
Perfect.

86
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.550
So this one is going to be our button option command k and perfect.

87
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.860
So now we kind of have our own UI here.

88
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.550
Let's see what else we can do.

89
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.670
We can make everything pretty equal.

90
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.050
This one, if we want to have it as a carousel, we'll just keep it like that.

91
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.370
For now, everything else looks about good.

92
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.940
We're ready, basically, to start creating our own components.

93
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.270
And we're ready to start creating our user flows.

94
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.320
So what we're going to do here, just to give you just a sample on how this works.

95
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.810
Option and dragging.

96
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.570
So if I have that there, I have a headline.

97
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.680
I have another one here.

98
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.030
I can alter this component if I want.

99
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.620
That's totally fine.

100
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.560
That's good.

101
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.360
We can take this component.

102
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.960
And then half a.

103
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.120
And then you go, We've created a really simple concept page here, and it's kind of like our messy

104
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.590
sketches that we had before.

105
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.340
And now we can start creating more components or we can start creating more screens from this.

106
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.000
Next, we're going to jump into actually creating a user flow.
