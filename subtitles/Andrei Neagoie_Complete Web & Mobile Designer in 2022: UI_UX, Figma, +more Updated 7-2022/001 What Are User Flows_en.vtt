00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.600
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.670
We're going to be talking about user flows.

3
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.290
I know we talked a little bit about it when we were talking about sketching, but now we're at the point

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.170
where, you know, we have a bunch of sketches and we really want to go in and find some details there

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.320
and maybe explore some of those screen flows a little bit more.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.450
So what our user flows.

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.540
I see this question asked about user flows all the time.

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.130
I mean, a bunch of people always want to know what exactly they are because a lot of people work on

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.049
them, but they never really share them with the team, which is mistake number one.

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.020
And when they do create them, they're usually just this mess.

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.200
And we're going to get into what that looks like and how we can remedy that.

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.160
So what our user flows, user flows are as simple as that.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.150
I mean, not necessarily that simple, but that is essentially a user flow.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.130
A user flow is a series of steps the user takes to achieve a meaningful goal.

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.520
So step one, whatever is here, they click on it, they get to their step two, and then they go to

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.420
step three.

17
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.460
And this is their goal at the end.

18
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.099
So why do we use them?

19
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.610
Well, they're used to communicate the intended flow of a user through various pages and actions in

20
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.550
a product or an app or in whatever website.

21
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.940
That is essentially what a user flow is.

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.630
So how do we make them?

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.310
Well, your flow should include a name, steps, users, and a description of what happens at each step.

24
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.390
So let's scroll down here bit.

25
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.840
This was created by Ryan Singer, and he created this great shorthand for user flows.

26
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.130
He actually calls them UI flows, but same thing.

27
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.620
What the user sees, what they do next.

28
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.980
And the next step is what they see next and what they do next.

29
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.930
That's how simple it is.

30
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.990
So you should think of your current screen as what the user sees and what they need to do.

31
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.440
And that arrow over here will lead to the next screen.

32
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.610
And there they'll see what they see next and what they need to do next.

33
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.270
But ultimately, user flows are just another method that we use to define the product experience website,

34
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.020
etc..

35
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.650
But wait, it isn't just another method.

36
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.040
They have the ability to really define scenarios or sections of something abstract or technical from

37
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.480
the perspective of a user.

38
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.480
So if we're thinking about a user onboarding or a user checking out, I mean, that could be a very

39
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.240
technical, especially when we're thinking about building features and writing user stories for development.

40
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.580
But if we break them down into individual user stories, depending on the different routes that certain

41
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.760
user flow may take.

42
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.230
All of a sudden it starts coming much more from a user's perspective.

43
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.530
Let's get into this.

44
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.310
First, I want to talk about an example here.

45
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.320
So step one.

46
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.720
A user goes to a welcome screen.

47
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.600
Their goal here is to register for a product.

48
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.190
Step two, they've actually gone through some sort of social login.

49
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.810
And step three, they get instant access to the product.

50
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.770
So there's three steps, some sort of welcome screen, which takes them to a social login, which is

51
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.390
really easy design pattern, and then they're right in the app.

52
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.610
You may be asking, Well, why do they help?

53
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.530
Well, they're the best way to solve the issue of communicating the way we want our products to work

54
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.450
and the way users really interact with our products.

55
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.380
They help us think about our product and the users who interact with it in three simple questions.

56
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.570
What is the goal of this thing?

57
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.470
Who is doing it and how do they do it?

58
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.660
So before we actually jump into like understanding the dos and don'ts and building our own, I want

59
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.350
to talk about the process of actually creating a user flow first.

60
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.060
So let's jump right into that.

61
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.960
Before we begin, let's start with step one.

62
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.460
What is the purpose of your user flow?

63
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.330
You need to name your flow and that name describes its purpose.

64
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.570
That is the goal the user achieves by completing the steps.

65
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.970
So surprisingly, a lot of people actually forget this part or they make it really vague.

66
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.550
I want to know what the user wants to do.

67
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.930
So I know at the end of this the user is going to find the right product.

68
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.860
So really describe that actual title and don't forget it.

69
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.120
Step two.

70
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.320
Despite popular belief user flows go in one direction, limit your decision points in each flow so you

71
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.890
can avoid these crazy huge site maps or huge prototypes.

72
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.760
I mean, they have their place, but not really for describing user flows.

73
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.830
It's okay to have multiple decision points, prototypes and a site map, and we'll get into that later.

74
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.260
But right here, we want to convey a distinct interaction.

75
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.050
User flows really work best.

76
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.590
So just keeping it simple.

77
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.100
And you may be asking yourself, well, why is this the case?

78
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.060
Well, we're telling a story and it's easier for anyone to remember a story like this.

79
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.210
Then a large site map or a series of cards in JIRA or Trello or whatever project management tool that

80
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.130
you may be using.

81
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.820
So try your best to tell.

82
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.000
A nice, simple story that goes in one direction doesn't sprawl everywhere you use.

83
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.070
Your flow should represent a complete task.

84
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.930
To ensure that your product is organized.

85
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.890
The scope of each flow should really be a single task or goal for your user.

86
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.370
So even though over here we have like a negative experience, we need to possibly break that out and

87
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.350
get them back into some sort of funnel.

88
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.570
Right here is the end goal and we're describing each of our steps to get there.

89
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.500
But we're not making this crazy, sprawling map like I spoke about before.

90
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.970
So keep them concise.

91
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.090
If they're too short, then you fail to really tell a story.

92
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.390
And if they're way too long, then you basically lose the meaning.

93
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.460
Remember, your user flows should be the clearest model of your product and you can do that if you follow

94
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.660
the rules I laid out.

95
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.380
Just remember, number one is what is the purpose of the user flow?

96
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.980
Number two is go in one direction and number three is represent some sort of complete task.

97
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.480
Keep them concise as well.

98
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.540
Next, we're going to jump into the do's and don'ts of user flows.
