00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.740
So the next part of the canvas we have here is the customer journey portion.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.470
Now I've taken this template off of plug in that I showed you earlier, which is the product planner

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.100
program.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.840
And essentially what we're going to do here is we're going to map a user journey and you may be asking

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.280
why or how.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.270
Now what we're going to do is we're going to use all of the resources that we had from before.

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.070
So project goals.

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.870
We have target users.

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.020
And we're going to do is we're going to take our main target user.

10
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.980
So what I like to do is I'll just take our last minute shopper.

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.840
To that.

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.850
We have a last minute shopper.

13
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.990
So just to explain this section a little bit more in detail.

14
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.570
Now to start this section, the most important end user is identified and their primary goal.

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.770
So, you know, like I said before, when people come together, they're going to mark which goals are

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.180
the primary goals?

17
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.340
There could be more than one goal in this sense.

18
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.190
What I want is maybe this is our primary goal, a more personal shopping experience.

19
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.440
So we have our primary goal.

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.350
We have our key primary user.

21
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.450
Now what we want to do is from the perspective of the most critical end users primary goal.

22
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.710
We're going to start the user journey mapping session and continue with the next most important goal

23
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.270
from any end user group.

24
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.120
So you can do this more than once.

25
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.750
You can do this only once.

26
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.860
Typically, we only have time to do this a couple of times before we have to actually move on because

27
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.670
it is pretty time intensive when you have everyone in the room working on something like this.

28
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.920
But the sense a good basis of what the user journey could look like.

29
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.660
Now this is usually done in a collaborative session where the client project team and any subject matter

30
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.090
experts are participating in the session.

31
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.850
You know, given the target user and the goal of the groups lists all the tasks that the user will have

32
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.190
to do to make this goal a reality.

33
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.820
Now the goals are listed one task per post, and upon completion the group puts them in chronological

34
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.840
order on a whiteboard.

35
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.500
So.

36
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.280
Let's dive deep into what a user journey is.

37
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.990
So on the most basic level, a user journey is from beginning to end the steps a user needs to take

38
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.490
to complete the goal.

39
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.000
Now, there are different ways we can actually come to create a user journey, and the most basic way

40
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.720
I found is literally get a whiteboard.

41
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.070
Yet you're stickies and just start throwing them up there.

42
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.910
Okay.

43
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.690
So I'm actually going to get some blue stickies here.

44
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.570
Perfect.

45
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.080
So we're going to grab our stickies and we're going to start from the beginning.

46
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.450
Before we begin, we're all set up here.

47
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.490
Now, like I said, that is the easiest way to actually create a customer journey.

48
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.810
Now we can come back and we can actually write little things in here.

49
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.760
We can actually fill this out.

50
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.640
We can think about is the customer experience positive or negative?

51
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.130
Are there needs, are certain interactions, are there improvement opportunities?

52
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.270
These are the ways that we can really note areas within that process where we can make that experience

53
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.100
much more delightful for users.

54
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.470
So this is like a more traditional customer journey map, but I like to rock with something like this

55
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.110
where we're literally just listing tasks to get a good understanding of all the different types of features

56
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.730
we may need, all the different types of tasks that really need to happen for this user to actually

57
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.690
complete the school.

58
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.040
Now, usually unclear or controversial tasks are going to be reassessed, and if the consensus isn't

59
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.340
reached after a short discussion, we will assign certain features, kind of like a backlog or an area

60
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.410
where we need to kind of reassess them later.

61
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.870
So let's get started.

62
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.390
Now let's think about all the different tasks that we need to complete this goal.

63
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.260
A more personal shopping experience.

64
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.430
A user needs to register for app.

65
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.620
I mean, it can even go beyond the application.

66
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.560
It could be like, how does the user even know about the application?

67
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.220
Let's do this.

68
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.370
One user enters their key information.

69
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.340
So that's another one.

70
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.870
User is directed to main home screen.

71
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:54.430
You can see all the products that pertain to them.

72
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.770
User finds.

73
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.550
A product that.

74
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.800
They like.

75
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.510
User makes purchase.

76
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.000
So as you notice, this is very vague.

77
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.940
And I mean, there's only six steps.

78
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.520
And the reason is I'm kind of oversimplifying things.

79
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.550
There are probably steps in between, like I mentioned, what happens before user registers for the

80
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:38.940
app, like how do we market to people, receives email for promo code, like how do we hook people in

81
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.820
enters the key information like this is where we may start breaking it down a little bit and think of

82
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.110
what is the different types of key information that we really need to find here.

83
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:57.210
So that could be something like they're like we maybe need to know their personal details.

84
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.420
I don't know if that's relevant, but that's something we can talk about as a group.

85
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.970
That's why we really need all these people in the same room.

86
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.990
Another example could be like interests.

87
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.910
Interests.

88
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.070
Products they like.

89
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.590
Maybe we use products they like as a way.

90
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.160
To understand a bit more about the user.

91
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.310
What else is there?

92
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.060
User is directed to the main home screen, so that's fine.

93
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.690
And so maybe they can see products that pertain to them.

94
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.560
That's pretty vague.

95
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.670
So an example could be something like interest picker.

96
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.050
I remember we designed that.

97
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.250
An interest picker.

98
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:49.080
Maybe there are deals on products they like.

99
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.230
I mean, you can start seeing how we start to build this out a bit more and think about this much more

100
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.990
deeply.

101
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:02.130
We really want to figure out how we can get them from registering to that personal experience.

102
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.600
And ultimately, that personal experience should lead to some sort of conversion, like making a purchase

103
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.010
or maybe, you know.

104
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.190
Save product.

105
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:19.100
So or maybe adding a product to a wish list if they are waiting for a sale or something like that.

106
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.620
So we start to really define a bunch of features just by creating the user journey.

107
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.010
And that's why I love using the user journey as a way to do that.

108
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.660
Now the next step is to find a similar alternative.

109
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.180
And those details about a task that are listed in the same column as they all represent, like a same

110
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.430
task or a step.

111
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.810
So as you can tell, like I've broken this down, they all kind of resemble something here that is very

112
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.510
similar.

113
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:52.310
This is like seeing products that are relevant to them, so deals on products they like, interest pickers,

114
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:58.570
etc. Or if we think about this a little bit more deeply, we can name this column to like onboarding.

115
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.520
Like that is the actual name of the activity.

116
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.600
So.

117
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.390
We can do that as well.

118
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.990
If we want to break this down further and I'm going to show you how we're going to use this.

119
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.090
So what we've done here is we added a clear task at the top.

120
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:23.790
One larger test like this will basically have multiple little activities, and then from there even

121
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.670
smaller activities that can arise.

122
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.310
Typically, usually, like I said, is like linear.

123
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.010
It's from left to right of a user trying to complete a goal.

124
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.809
But this is kind of a different take on that.

125
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.799
This is more like a story map and I'm going to get into start mapping soon.

126
00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:44.070
But generally what we're doing here is we're creating the journey, but we're also thinking about the

127
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.160
key type of details that it takes to get there.

128
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.770
If we think about if we need to get ready for university or something like that in the morning, it's

129
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.450
not just I need to get ready for university.

130
00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.810
I mean, I need to wake up, I need to turn off my alarm, I need to take a shower, I need to eat breakfast.

131
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:06.440
And even within those smaller tasks, there are different things that we can break out from there.

132
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:12.780
An example being like, I need to pour my cereal, I need to get a spoon, I need to get a bowl.

133
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.880
So there are different types of little requirements that we often forget if we just gloss over it and

134
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.580
just think about the larger tasks at hand.

135
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.900
Now the end result probably will look something like this.

136
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.880
You know, it could look like this without those larger tasks at the top.

137
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.820
I'd like to start kind of putting them up there, starting to think about this in a larger way.

138
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.920
Generally, you know, I kind of do this once because as you can see, just from taking this primary

139
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.930
goal from this primary user, we start to think about all these different requirements that are coming

140
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.880
through with our application here.

141
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.160
So if I think about registering for an app, I need to think about email.

142
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.680
The user needs to enter their email.

143
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.890
Maybe it's not an email.

144
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.960
Maybe it's just a phone number.

145
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.680
I don't know.

146
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.600
We need their name.

147
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.340
When I think about the home screen, I think about navigation.

148
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.840
I think about like navigation options.

149
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.560
I mean, I'm just throwing a bunch of stuff out there, but you can start seeing how we can break this

150
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.120
down to different types of journeys or different things that we haven't thought about doing.

151
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.210
Multiple journeys could really help break this out even further.
