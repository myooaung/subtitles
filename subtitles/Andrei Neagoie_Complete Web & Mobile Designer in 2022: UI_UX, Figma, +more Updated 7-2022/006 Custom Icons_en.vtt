00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome back to the second part of icons.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.760
There are a bunch of icon sets out there.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.939
I mean, I couldn't even name them all if I tried.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.780
But another option that we do have is that we can actually design our very own icon.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.080
I know that sounds pretty scary, but I promise it isn't.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.050
I mean, it is time consuming, but if you do have the time, go for it.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.640
So icons are pretty crucial to a design system.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.510
And before we even build, we need to really take into account a couple of things.

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.430
First is size.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.430
So if we think about base units, that has to come into play again and your icon should be designed

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.390
based off of it.

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.790
Our base unit is eight pixels, so let's create a grid.

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.500
So we're going to create a frame.

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.140
And it's going to be a small frame.

15
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.190
It's going to be only 24 by 24 pixels.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.030
Let's zoom right in.

17
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.010
There we go.

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.340
Let's rename that to Icon.

19
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.480
So we have our little grid right here.

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.940
And what we can do is we can create a layout grid, not a little grid, but we're going to create an

21
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.500
actual grid.

22
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.080
So you'll notice that this is a defaulted ten pixel grid.

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.060
So I'll have ten pixels by ten pixels.

24
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.160
We want an actual just a one pixel grid.

25
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.170
So that's going to work for us.

26
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.310
Perfect.

27
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.110
So another thing is when we're creating an icon, we want to only use one color.

28
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.980
Anything more than that, that's just a bit too much for product use.

29
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.410
So I would just stick with one color all times, unless it's something like a marketing website where

30
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.020
icons are a little bit more blown up, a little bit more larger, like 40 pixels or something like that.

31
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.240
That's fine if you want to really use more colors to reinforce your brand.

32
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.670
But for typical product interface use and stuff like that, stick to one color.

33
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.940
Now that we have our pixel grid, this makes it much easier so we can stick to it.

34
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.460
Our icons will render much more nicely if we stick on to these pixel lines here and onto our grid.

35
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.810
So the first icon we're going to make is just a simple checkmark.

36
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.260
And what we can do is we can just press P for our pencil and we can just stick to our grid like this.

37
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.190
Click it.

38
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.430
And if we hold shift, we can stick to a certain angle.

39
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.240
So if you're on a 45 degree angle, we could just give that.

40
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.530
And do something like that.

41
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.090
And there you go.

42
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.220
I mean, like, it doesn't have to be hard.

43
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.370
This looks a little too rigid.

44
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.410
But if I select these points, so if I lose this and I click it again, if I double click it, I can

45
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.050
select this point.

46
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.630
And if I hold shift, I can select that point and I can go over here to our vector.

47
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.470
Little toolbar and I can just change.

48
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.040
That will change if it's an actual outline.

49
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.030
If it's an actual stroke, you can go here and I'll show you both scenarios so you can round those corners.

50
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.930
But if I didn't do that and I did something like this.

51
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.850
Increase the stroke.

52
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.300
And then I did something like this where we're going to click out of that and I can outline a stroke.

53
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.690
Then you can go over here and you can outline the edges.

54
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.250
So what we can do here is we can start moving it any which way we want.

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.630
That looks fine.

56
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.740
We can also just leave it.

57
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.470
We can bring this in a bit more, which is much better, and we're going to center that.

58
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.040
So this is one icon that we've just easily made.

59
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.660
I'm going to just pump up the stroke on that because it's going to be harder to see.

60
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.620
And I'm going to like I said before, I'm going to go and adjust the caps to make them round.

61
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.770
And you can also.

62
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.160
Adjust their.

63
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.650
To make it a little bit more rounder.

64
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.540
There you go.

65
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.760
We have an actual Czech icon and you can duplicate that and you can actually make a variation of it.

66
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.060
You can make this a little bit smaller if you want.

67
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.589
Let's copy that and then put that there.

68
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:23.870
And you can actually go ahead and make a circle and make another variation of it.

69
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.560
So it's sitting on those lines.

70
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.150
Send that to the back.

71
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.770
And this is what I'm going to do here.

72
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.260
I'm going to make this black.

73
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.480
And I'm going to make this white.

74
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.910
And this is great if you want to kind of create another variation of an icon that we just created.

75
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.730
Some people like to create like circle based icon sets or just having a circle variation of like a checkmark

76
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.410
for other applications.

77
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.260
Another easy icon that we can make.

78
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.690
There's something like a cloud.

79
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.270
So if I select our ellipsis tool up here or if I select oh for the.

80
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.030
Shortcut.

81
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.780
I can just create a quick cloud like this.

82
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.590
I'm going to bring down the middle and this one is going to be much bigger.

83
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.030
There we go.

84
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.500
And if I double click this, I can take this point and bring it down here.

85
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.950
That doesn't really look like much of a cloud, but if I select that and I delete it, there we go.

86
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.040
We have our cloud.

87
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.350
I'm going to select all these shapes and combine them.

88
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.570
And then to press e to flatten that layer.

89
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.940
You can also take our.

90
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.450
Aerial tool and we can draw an arrow like it's an actual.

91
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.350
Download Icon, let's adjust that cap again to round.

92
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.110
And we were using two pixels.

93
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.960
So let's try and say consistent.

94
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.930
Yeah, that's not going to work there.

95
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.700
So we're going to stick to one pixel on this one and we should probably stick to one pixel on this one

96
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.330
too.

97
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.750
If we're going to create like an actual set, it's going to be a little hard to see.

98
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.980
That's the only issue.

99
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.990
But there are different ways you can get around that.

100
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.880
So there we go.

101
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.490
And if I wanted to create like an actual see through icon, so like right now this is not see through.

102
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:38.370
If you take it off the canvas, it's still white and it's not one actual shape.

103
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.140
So I'm going to create outlines.

104
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.980
So I'm going to right click on that, create a outline that's.

105
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.260
Perfect.

106
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.930
And I'm going to select them and I'm going to go back up here and I'm going to click, subtract.

107
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.830
And what that's going to do is it's going to subtract this shape from the shape, and now it's one shape.

108
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.450
All we need to do, you'll notice that you'll still be able to see them here and you'll still be able

109
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.590
to move them around.

110
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.440
Now, if we don't want to ever to happen, we can just.

111
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.790
In that right here.

112
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.110
So all we need to do is right click that and press flame or a command and there you go.

113
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.510
You have a cloud icon.

114
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.750
Let's create a couple more.

115
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.390
This is probably like you can create a location service icon there.

116
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.610
Really much more easier than you think.

117
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.020
So if I'm just going to do that, I'm going to double click and I'm going to hold shift.

118
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.370
So before I click this, I'm going to double click in here.

119
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.060
I'm going to click that hold shift and pull upward.

120
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.040
And just like that.

121
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.040
We have our very own location icon.

122
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.900
And it's pretty easy to make.

123
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.550
We can do that even for a map and we can do some pretty cool tricks.

124
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.820
Not everything is as complicated as it looks.

125
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.240
So let's just create a little circle here.

126
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.190
We'll create another, larger circle.

127
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.100
So this is going to be our inside.

128
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.200
Let's bring that to the front.

129
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.620
Select them both and bring that here.

130
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.720
Great.

131
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.190
We're going to double click into that back layer and we're going to grab this point and bring it down.

132
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.910
They were going to bring this down, select there and we can use our grid.

133
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.770
Let's press control G.

134
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.970
Let's zoom in.

135
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.309
We can use our grid to say that I want it on this point so I know that when I do this.

136
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.360
And I'm bringing on that point, too.

137
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.260
Now, that's not really nice at the bottom.

138
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.850
It kind of curves down.

139
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.470
What we can do is command.

140
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.330
It'll bring both of those points in and from there.

141
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.470
You can round it by clicking up there.

142
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.080
See.

143
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.310
Just click that point.

144
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.090
Go up here, press one or whatever number you desire.

145
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.590
And there you go.

146
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.710
You have your map pin.

147
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.500
Like I said before, what you can do is you can subtract that.

148
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.900
And then pressing command e to flatten it and you have your very own map pin icon.

149
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.830
Okay.

150
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.090
Last one.

151
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.620
Let's create a heart.

152
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.440
This one's really fun.

153
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.580
So I'm going to actually select my line tool.

154
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.710
Hearts are really hard to make.

155
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.900
I mean, I even have a hard time drawing hearts to this day for some sort of reason.

156
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.090
I have a hard time even making them in here.

157
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.270
But this is a little cheat code that I often use.

158
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.110
Let me actually press my pencil.

159
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:40.680
Let's go.

160
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.310
Like this.

161
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.360
Boom.

162
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.770
Hold shift.

163
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.620
Hold shift.

164
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.230
So we have two lines at 45 degree angles.

165
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.900
And that's it.

166
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.950
And what we're gonna do is we're going to select each and.

167
00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.740
We're to go into our stroke settings in our advanced stroke settings, and we're going to press rounds

168
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.530
and we're going to bump that right up.

169
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.700
And there you go.

170
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.750
You kind of have your own heart.

171
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.010
You can't really see it right now.

172
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.830
If we bring this in a little bit more, we can start playing with it.

173
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.630
That looks really good.

174
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.740
If I hold command and click.

175
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.290
On this.

176
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.990
We can start creating a really nice round heart.

177
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.510
And that is great.

178
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.800
We can also just kind of manipulate that just a bit if we want to.

179
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.340
Now what I would like to do here is just kind of outline that stroke.

180
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.000
You see, there's a weird outline and sometimes that will happen with icons.

181
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.290
That's totally fine.

182
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.730
I'll show you how to fix that.

183
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.430
There you go.

184
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.120
We're going to do is we're going to double click into here.

185
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.380
So we have these weird things happening and that's even much more weirder.

186
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.460
But we're going to fix that.

187
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.310
So we're just going to drag this right to the bottom.

188
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.260
We're going to click on this and you can delete these.

189
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.160
So be careful.

190
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.060
Sometimes it will actually delete the whole fill, but if you just command Z out of that, they'll be

191
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.080
totally fine.

192
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.680
And if I press one, like I said before, there you go.

193
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.610
You have your nice heart.

194
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.430
Just make sure.

195
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.580
That you don't do that to kind of these little nooks because it doesn't really look that good.

196
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:31.750
So that's it.

197
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.940
I mean, you can easily make quick icons for whatever application you want.

198
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.410
I mean, you can create them for your own navigation, for a visual, whatever navigation you choose

199
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.390
and whatever navigation you think is right.

200
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:48.340
Maybe try actually making icons for that because it's not that hard.

201
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:55.510
And sometimes you don't necessarily need a whole icon set for a product, but you will be using probably

202
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.730
a good study like ten consistently, whether those are chevrons which are really easy to make.

203
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.200
I mean, we can even make one right now.

204
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.060
Chevrons are those little arrows that are pointing left, right and.

205
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.090
Up and down.

206
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.210
So, I mean, we can easily create our own chevrons.

207
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.710
Just like that.

208
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.960
It's totally easy.

209
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.410
So take some time, try to find that consistency within the grid.

210
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:37.320
If you're using like lined widths of like two pixels, stick with two pixels.

211
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.960
Don't have something that is like really thick and then something really thin.

212
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.510
So if like you're using something like three pixel lengths, stick with that beak very consistent within

213
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.620
your iconography.

214
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.070
But take some time, have some fun.

215
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.580
I mean, you can create your own little style here if you really have that time to do it.

216
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.600
There you go.

217
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:02.240
You have your very own custom icons and there are so many other things we can do when we're drawing

218
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.170
within Figma.

219
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:07.370
But that's a deep rabbit hole that we're not going to really go down right now.

220
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.840
Remember, have fun.

221
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.700
Don't take it too seriously.

222
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.400
Choose some icons that you want to do for our app.

223
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.050
Jump right in there and just do it.
