00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.690
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.280
So in the last video, we created this nice, simple, monochromatic color palette.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.000
And in this video, we're going to cover how we can actually apply that to a blank interface.

4
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.450
Let me jump right in here.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.390
Let's zoom in just a tad.

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.860
Okay.

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.190
So what I like to do is I like to start creating styles based off of our colors before we even start

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.620
using them, because, you know, it could become a mess when we don't have styles and it keeps everything

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.190
nice and neat.

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.550
And if we do want to change a style in the future, all we need to do is change or edit that original

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.930
style and it's going to apply across the board wherever it is applied.

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.050
So here, I'll show you exactly how that works.

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.210
This is my primary blue.

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.380
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go over here to the style icon.

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
I'm going to press the plus sign to create a style.

16
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.810
And I'm just going to call this.

17
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.950
BLU zero one and I'm going to call it primary.

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.860
So that way it's under a new heading when we actually go and select our styles and I'll show you what

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.460
that looks like.

20
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.930
So I'm going to call this blue one.

21
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.310
See it's in their primary and that's blue one.

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.010
I'm going to do the same for the rest.

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.420
So let's do this one.

24
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.710
I'm going to call this primary blue to.

25
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.320
Call this primary blue.

26
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.570
Three.

27
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.080
Now for these.

28
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.700
I'm just going to call them Grace.

29
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.730
So do you could just say UI?

30
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.420
Sometimes I like to actually break them up based off of their use case.

31
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.840
So if I know that something will be used for text, I'll actually create a heading called text and then

32
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.130
after actually put that same color or duplicate that style.

33
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.010
So that way when I'm actually using the UI in some way and I need to actually apply a color to some

34
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.180
sort of text, I'll select that color style instead of something else.

35
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.669
There may be another category called like background.

36
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.600
So whenever I use a background color, I'm going to select from that category.

37
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.290
So that way when I'm actually going through all my selections.

38
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.770
Over here.

39
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.530
So if you select a whole bunch of stuff like this and I go to my color selections.

40
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.450
They'll be over on this side.

41
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.950
I can actually easily pinpoint which one is text, which one is background based or which one's UI based.

42
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.170
So I'll show you that even later on.

43
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.180
But that's how I generally break up my styles, especially for design systems.

44
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.570
So where were we?

45
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.880
We were over here.

46
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.780
So I'm just going to I'm just going to call this UI for now.

47
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.380
We'll call it Gray zero one.

48
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.460
We call this UI GRE zero two.

49
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.980
Actually, I'm going to copy and paste from now on just to speed up my workflow.

50
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.540
Call this three and we're just going to call this white.

51
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.440
And there you go.

52
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.910
We have all our colors, styles.

53
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.030
These ones are under UI.

54
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.260
All they're gray colors and shades and under primary will be our primary like blues that we're going

55
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.830
to use.

56
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.900
So let's zoom out.

57
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.780
And if we look over here, we have an interface.

58
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.290
Now, this is a resource that you can easily get from Figma.

59
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.060
I didn't design this myself, but I'm going to use this for our demonstration because it's going to

60
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.930
easily help us understand how you can apply a color scheme in such a quick and fast way.

61
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.860
What I like to do is I'm going to start picking some primary sections, so like if we start on the profile.

62
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.150
All we'll need to do is I've selected this rectangle in the back and I go to my fill.

63
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.280
And I'm just going to select the color that I want.

64
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.480
Even for the text.

65
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.300
I can go here and I can select that.

66
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.990
For the white.

67
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.700
You can individually select them.

68
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.080
It really helps you keep your document clean.

69
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.040
I like to really be as neat as possible because if I do need to go back and fix something, it really

70
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.080
helps when you have like styles applied.

71
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.080
So I may select that there.

72
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.000
What else do we have here?

73
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.590
We have the background color and we can probably select one of our background colors.

74
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.990
That was the stroke that we applied there.

75
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.630
We may need to change that stroke.

76
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.820
So there we go.

77
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.430
We'll change the stroke to something a little darker.

78
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.130
And we'll change that.

79
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.480
Something like that.

80
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.660
So, I mean, already you're noticing that we're making some big strides with the UI.

81
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.580
And sometimes you may need to go back.

82
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.480
You may need to think that, hey, this is actually way to blue.

83
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.780
So what I'll do is.

84
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.060
I'll extend it just a bit if I need that.

85
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:30.130
I mean, I don't think you should necessarily have tons of grays or tons of different colors, but it's

86
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.130
going to really help you have a little bit more versatility.

87
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.960
So let's go in here.

88
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.940
We're just going to disconnect this and we are going to go and zoom in and we're going to create an

89
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.670
even lighter gray.

90
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.690
And what we can do is we're going to create that as a style.

91
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.000
We're going to call it UI.

92
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.390
I call it gray.

93
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.640
Zero four.

94
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.230
And that's this one.

95
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.470
We will fix that in a second.

96
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.310
So.

97
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.270
You can just adjust them over here.

98
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:17.110
So now we have a nice, nice kind of gradient going on and let's go see how that looks in comparison.

99
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.060
So we're over here.

100
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.250
And that's probably a little bit nicer if you want a little bit more subtlety.

101
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.080
Same with the background over here.

102
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.460
We can even do the same.

103
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.570
So it's a little bit more subtle.

104
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.310
I'm one for minimalist interfaces.

105
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.450
I think they're much better.

106
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.760
They perform much better than something that's way cluttered and colors that are way too harsh.

107
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.270
So.

108
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.140
Um.

109
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.310
Okay, let's continue.

110
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.200
Let's, let's see how far we can get with this.

111
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.300
So I'm just going to start selecting.

112
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.420
All these different pieces or these UI elements.

113
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.330
So this is text.

114
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.460
And I'm going to make it the dark text.

115
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.510
And, you know, we can even.

116
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.670
Well, let us know.

117
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.100
We'll let us because they're within frames.

118
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.600
So that's totally fine.

119
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.180
I'm just going to play away here.

120
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.660
And this will be like our primary.

121
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.610
Nice.

122
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.740
It's looking really sharp.

123
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.260
Och.

124
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.210
We can do stroke over here.

125
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.830
The satellite stroke.

126
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.850
And the goal here is just to stay very consistent with how you're applying your colors.

127
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:51.310
If you're going to use this primary color in a lot of places, then use it for those use cases.

128
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.700
Don't necessarily start sprinkling a different primary color somewhere.

129
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.520
You don't want your users to get confused.

130
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.530
So far, we're doing good.

131
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.050
Now we can kind of.

132
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.310
Move on a bit more.

133
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.960
So that's their OC.

134
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.710
So we're just going to select that.

135
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.810
So we're using our primary color for like buttons or like backgrounds and stuff like that.

136
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:30.550
We can also use our kind of like our primary blue number too for stuff like, like this.

137
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.679
And what I like to do is to make sure that the contrast is good as well.

138
00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.070
So I know that this is definitely accessible.

139
00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.500
Let's check if our primary blue is accessible.

140
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.450
So on normal text, it isn't accessible at the triple-A level, but it is at the AA.

141
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.640
So if we want, we can even go a little bit darker.

142
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.400
It really depends what you're trying to achieve.

143
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.220
So I think that's fine.

144
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:03.150
Where is another section where we can really apply a bunch of different colors?

145
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.810
Hmm.

146
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.320
I think we have a graph over here.

147
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.520
There it is.

148
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.300
So I'm going to use our blues.

149
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:21.790
Oops.

150
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.480
Oops.

151
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.930
Trying to select them all while holding shift in.

152
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.390
It's a little tough sometimes.

153
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.320
OC.

154
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.730
We're just going to select that.

155
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.390
You'll see selection colors down there as well.

156
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.190
And update it across.

157
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.930
So here's our selection colors.

158
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.920
This is the easy way to actually change everything at once.

159
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.160
So if we wanted to.

160
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.130
So that changed the text at the bottom.

161
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.660
This is probably going to change the actual bar.

162
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.570
And this will probably change the background.

163
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.170
So if we do that for everything.

164
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.230
You can probably go like this.

165
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.720
So all the items are changed at the bottom.

166
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.990
Let's see what that changes.

167
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.380
Oops.

168
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.750
That's a little too light.

169
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.950
There you go.

170
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:37.750
And this should change the actual bars so we can do something like that.

171
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.250
And I'm not sure what just changes.

172
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.910
We can just set it to something that's a border.

173
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.810
So this one we can probably set to something like this and wait.

174
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.740
We can set to our way.

175
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.210
And there you go.

176
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.840
We can easily apply a color palette like that.

177
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.410
Two.

178
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.310
Are you I?

179
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.250
We can even go further.

180
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.390
That's a block there.

181
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.680
So I'm just going to use that.

182
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.140
What do you got here?

183
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.280
Those are borders.

184
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.590
So I'm just going to set them like this.

185
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.080
That's a dark green.

186
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.270
Set it to the dark blue.

187
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.640
And we have a light.

188
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.720
A later one.

189
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:20.650
I let her blue.

190
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.270
And wow, what a difference that made.

191
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.690
So, you know, you can continue with this interface.

192
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:36.260
You can come up with your own, but have a go at actually creating your own color palette if you want

193
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.340
something easy to start with.

194
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:43.850
Start with a monochromatic color scheme and try applying that to a different interface or this one.

195
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.920
This one will be available in our demonstration.

196
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.290
And I'll also link to the original as well.

197
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.390
So go out there and have fun.

198
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:56.270
Come up with your own color palettes and try applying them and make sure they're versatile.
