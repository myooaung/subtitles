00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.490
Hulu.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.210
Let's build a fun image portfolio site.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.600
One of the biggest problems that people have and the hardest problem with CSS, it's always making sure

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.320
that we have our items displayed in the location that we want.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.760
That is a really, really difficult problem and there are many, many solutions to this problem.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.030
One of the new ways, and now it's probably the most popular way, is called Flexbox.

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.900
And we're going to be using that to create a beautiful image website.

8
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.860
Let's get started.

9
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.690
So I have an index.html file here and a style CSS file in the same directory on my desktop.

10
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.750
So let's get started with our typical HTML file.

11
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:59.100
We're going to title it CSS and in the body we're going to have a header of Life in the wild.

12
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.250
And refresh.

13
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.300
Perfect.

14
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.350
And in here, we're going to have a div.

15
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.970
With the class of container.

16
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.560
We'll close that off.

17
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.970
And in here, let's add some images.

18
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.220
Now, if you remember with images, I can type in this and then tab with sublime text and we don't have

19
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.090
any pictures yet.

20
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.370
So for now, let's just copy and paste and add six images.

21
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.350
Save and refresh.

22
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:41.110
Let's start adding some of these images and actually have a file full of these images for you and I'll

23
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.670
attach it to the next lesson so you can also build it yourself.

24
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.260
So I'm just going to copy these quickly.

25
00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.820
Phew.

26
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.380
That was a lot of copy and pasting.

27
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.130
Let's save that and refresh.

28
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.540
All right.

29
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.360
So we have our images and they're massive.

30
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.509
So let's make this a little bit smaller.

31
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:20.050
We can now go to our stylesheet and we can select the images and let's just do width for 150 pixels

32
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.820
and height.

33
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.320
300 pixels.

34
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.950
And you might be asking yourself, how come we don't do it here on the individual images?

35
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.780
Remember, we can add attributes, but that means if we needed to ever change anything, we have to

36
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.000
individually go into each image and change it versus just changing in one location.

37
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.550
So for now, we're going to stick to the CSS size.

38
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.640
Let's save that and refresh.

39
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.980
And obviously we need to link the file.

40
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.650
So let's add a link here and it will reference our style CSS.

41
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.390
Save that and refresh.

42
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.460
There you go.

43
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.730
We have our images.

44
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.720
Look at that.

45
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.130
Some beautiful animals here.

46
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.480
Now, Flexbox has a great resource.

47
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.120
Obviously from CSIS tricks.

48
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.600
And this is pretty much all you need.

49
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.280
It shows you all the things that Flexbox can do.

50
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.790
And as you can see, it allows you to play around with content and shift it around in a very nice way.

51
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.640
I'm going to attach this link for you at the end of this video and you can take a look for yourself.

52
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.480
For now, let's learn a few Flexbox properties.

53
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.650
We want to define that everything inside of this div is part of Flexbox.

54
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.340
Let's select it's called container, so let's do container.

55
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.490
And within this container we will say that display will be flex.

56
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.210
So that's how we activate Flexbox refresh.

57
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.850
We have a few changes, which is nice, but I don't want to scroll through this.

58
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.400
Ideally, I can see everything without scrolling.

59
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.930
So one thing we want to do and again we can look down over here at the suggestion we see that flex wrap

60
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.210
might be something that we want to add.

61
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.000
So let's do flex wrap and do wrap and refresh.

62
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.140
Okay, that's perfect.

63
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.790
So if I make this bigger, you see that everything is wrapping around.

64
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.180
Okay.

65
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.450
But I think the continents should be centered.

66
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.210
It kind of looks weird to having everything to the left over here.

67
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.520
So again, we can do something called justify content and then we can do center.

68
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.430
And refresh.

69
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.240
Perfect.

70
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.410
And if we look on the guide over here, justify content should be right over here and you can see all

71
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.850
the properties that it has.

72
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.940
Now looks pretty good.

73
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.860
And we did that pretty fast.

74
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.650
Made a nice little portfolio website already.

75
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.450
What else can we add?

76
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:12.050
Now that we have this flexible container around our website, let's make the header a little bit prettier

77
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.800
than it is now.

78
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.090
So that's the H one.

79
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:24.830
We can add an H one here and we'll say that the font family is I like this one fantasy, save and refresh.

80
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.920
Ooh, I like that one font size.

81
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.680
Let's make it a little bit bigger.

82
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.610
We'll do three M.

83
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.580
So if you don't remember what EM is, make sure you check out that video so that looks better.

84
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.090
Maybe it'll be nice to have a bit of a border as well so we can do border bottom because we only want

85
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.130
a border on the bottom and we'll do two pixels solid pink.

86
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.750
And refresh.

87
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.560
Okay.

88
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.640
Perfect.

89
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.590
That looks good.

90
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.120
But ideally, I want a border just around this.

91
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.440
I don't want the entire section so we can actually just say that for each one.

92
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.680
We want the width to be 400 pixels.

93
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.240
I save and refresh.

94
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.730
All right, perfect.

95
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.150
That looks good.

96
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:21.160
And ideally, this is centered so that the line underneath it is well on the left side and right side

97
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.870
is equally distributed.

98
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.250
So we can do something like text a line.

99
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.100
Center.

100
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.230
And you'll notice here that it's aligned in the center, but not the Web page center.

101
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.000
It's a line in the center of the width of 400 pixels, but that looks good.

102
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.060
It will be actually nice to have a border around here as well.

103
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.610
So let's add border.

104
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.820
Right, two pixels, solid pink, save and refresh.

105
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.310
All right.

106
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.090
That looks very nice.

107
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.250
And then the final thing I want to add is I want to have some spacing between these images.

108
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:10.130
So I'm going to add a margin of ten pixels here and refresh.

109
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.750
All right.

110
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.180
Let's take a look at our website right now.

111
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.320
That looks very, very nice, as you can see.

112
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:28.840
Flexbox is a very easy thing to implement and it makes your websites look really, really nice and you

113
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.540
can position your content very easily, especially if you have these container like structures.

114
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.410
I want to show you one last resource for Flexbox.

115
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:45.160
Again, this is a tool that you'll see more and more of, and ideally you'll build websites using Flexbox

116
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.200
instead of some of the older ways.

117
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.670
One way to get really, really good at Flexbox is to play this game.

118
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.180
And it's called Flexbox Froggy, I believe.

119
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.140
Let's see.

120
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.470
And here you're trying to get the frog onto the leaf.

121
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:10.750
It's a little home so you can do something, like justify content, flex and.

122
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.750
And look at that.

123
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.310
You get the frog onto the leaf and you move on to the next round.

124
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.230
I'll leave this for you.

125
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.610
It's a really, really good way to learn, Flexbox.

126
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.100
I think this is probably the best way to do layout in CSS.

127
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.660
I'll see you in the next one.

128
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.110
Bye.

129
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.440
Bye.
