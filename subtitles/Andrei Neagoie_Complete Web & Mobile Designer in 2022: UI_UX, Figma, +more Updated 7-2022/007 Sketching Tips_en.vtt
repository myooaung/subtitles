00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.870
So we're back again in Concepts and we're just going to go through some quick tips just to kind of wrap

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.640
everything up in terms of sketching.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.120
So let's just give ourselves a little title here.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
You know, I'm going to repeat a couple of things that I've been talking about, but I really want you

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.100
all to understand how important they actually are.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.470
Number one is, don't worry about being messy.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.140
Go jump right in.

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.170
Ask yourself those questions and just keep going.

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.850
Like you saw.

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.430
I created a homescreen pretty quickly and I started understanding that maybe we do need these elements

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.040
here.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.240
They're going to probably be useful and I start learning about what content I can actually get from

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.950
just like a quick sketch like that.

14
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.240
And from there, we can actually go in and start refining that a bit more.

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.040
You know, add icons, figuring out maybe that's an avatar, figuring out what type of information goes

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.580
in here.

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.440
Like we found out that we needed a heart and maybe we need a price tag.

18
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.820
Most definitely need a price tag.

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.690
But this is the kind of stuff that it's just a natural progression.

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.710
And you don't worry about drawing something like this because eventually it's going to get to something

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.320
even better into the product that we eventually built.

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.840
Don't worry about being messy.

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.440
Like I said, be lean, agile sketch quickly and save yourself some time instead of worrying about the

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.900
detail.

25
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
The next tip is it takes a little practice, but only a little.

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.830
Think about it as building blocks.

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.640
All you need are some squares, rectangles, maybe circles, and you can build a fairly decent UI like

28
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.600
we've done before.

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.890
Like our cart screen is just just an x.

30
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.280
Whatever text we have there, we have a square.

31
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.450
Some lines, another square to us.

32
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.420
We understand what we're building here and we can refine that if we're going to present it to teammates.

33
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.950
We've got a fairly good understanding of what we need to build a screen like this.

34
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.140
Don't worry about it too much.

35
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.600
If you want to have a little bit of practice like you can go and open an app that you love or a website

36
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.550
that you love and try just sketching that out, just using some shapes or like some basic type.

37
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.060
And eventually you'll just develop your own type of system for sketching.

38
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.460
And there really is no wrong or right way to do it.

39
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.990
It's just whatever is going to work for you.

40
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.120
Next step, keep your sketches safe.

41
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.590
Buy yourself a folder, please.

42
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.630
I mean, if you're doing it digitally, that's that's great, too, because, like, services like this

43
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.680
will allow you to, like, export it in JPEG or whatever file format.

44
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.170
It doesn't really matter for sketches like this, if you're using paper stored in a folder, scan it

45
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.680
right away.

46
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.840
Take a picture, please, because I can't count how many times I've lost sketches that I really needed

47
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.650
or I really liked.

48
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.450
And sometimes you lose details.

49
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.070
Just remember, keep them safe.

50
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.650
Always be prepared.

51
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.150
Keep a sketch pad near you.

52
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.750
Pencil a pen with you on my desk at home.

53
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.580
I always have my sketchbook.

54
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.200
It's a dotted line sketchbook, so it's really easy for drawing wireframes and stuff like that.

55
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.910
So keep something with you if you like to draw digitally, like on an iPad, or if you have a tablet

56
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.430
that you draw on like a Wacom tablet.

57
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.180
Keep that by your side because you never know when an idea is going to come.

58
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.370
You just never know when you need to sketch.

59
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.420
Keep it by your side.

60
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.110
The other thing I'd like to do is I like to hang my sketches up.

61
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.680
So like, say if I have some sort of like board beside me or a wall, I just like to hang up my sketches

62
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.680
for some inspiration and then I just write additional notes.

63
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.990
If I'm working from home, I have my whiteboard that I hang up and it serves as a daily reminder, just

64
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.360
so I can see what I've been thinking about.

65
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.490
I can maybe scrap some ideas.

66
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.760
I can maybe take this new idea that I have and or this old idea I have, and maybe something else comes

67
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.150
from it.

68
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.720
Because I've taken some time to just take some breathing room, you know, just put it up for yourself.

69
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.410
And if you're working with teams, they help as well because other people can kind of get into it and

70
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.810
they can start to provide some valuable insight.

71
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.150
You want to keep people in your team participating.

72
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.130
So that's the best thing I've always found is just put your sketches up, share them.

73
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.430
And that leads me to my next tip over here.

74
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.410
My next step is to kind of communicate.

75
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.300
Just please communicate.

76
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.090
Don't hide these gems that you're making in.

77
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.980
I call them gems because like every product starts from something like this.

78
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.790
And, you know, that may not seem true, but that's what really is the skeleton of your product.

79
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.410
They'll always start from like a messy sketch, so share them with people because this is a collaborative

80
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.250
process.

81
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.880
Share them with your team, talk to every teammate.

82
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.540
It doesn't matter.

83
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.610
They'll always provide valuable insights.

84
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.940
We talked a little bit about like a certain feature over here.

85
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.860
Where there was going to be a carousel, you'll just quickly draw it again.

86
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.980
And if a user swiped left.

87
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.050
The new image would come in.

88
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.730
And if I were to develop a feature like this or build a feature like this, the first person I would

89
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.870
talk to would be a developer.

90
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.730
And I would like to understand, is this feasible for our timeline?

91
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.480
What's the best way to do it?

92
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.030
And you can have those conversations early on.

93
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.000
Next thing I'd like to do is I mentioned it briefly about like putting your sketches up, but some people

94
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.790
like to get a big whiteboard and sketch on a whiteboard and that's totally fine too.

95
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.170
I love sketching on whiteboards now.

96
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.100
It's very collaborative and it's easy to involve team members in this discussion.

97
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.590
And when you're just drawing screens, everyone can kind of just come in, point certain things out

98
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.690
because it's marker.

99
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.200
Nobody really gets tied to the details.

100
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.050
Everyone's thinking about like the overall flow.

101
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.820
You have so much space, sometimes you'll be surprised at how fast you can actually fill that up with

102
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.630
your whole team.

103
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.640
And what I also like to do is I like to pin my sketches there as well.

104
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.870
So maybe they have some sort of relation to a certain screen.

105
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.170
It's a good jumping off point for yourself, so you can kind of go back to your desk or wherever you're

106
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.920
working and start thinking about different things.

107
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.260
That could relate.

108
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.830
And one of the last tips I have and I do this fairly often, sometimes I'll grab a sketch.

109
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.170
So if I have our search experience.

110
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.800
Like.

111
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.230
So it's easy to you know, it's easy to just sketch these out, but sometimes you don't necessarily

112
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.380
get like a feel for the product, you know, that's natural because it's on paper or it's just static.

113
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.230
And sometimes you want to understand how does that feel when a user actually clicks this?

114
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.900
So what you could do is you can export like individual frames any which way you want to do it, like

115
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.730
you can export this whole thing here in concepts, this whole canvas, and you can kind of duplicate

116
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.740
it and crop it to crop out each individual frame and you can bring it into figma and link it together

117
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.380
in a prototype and bam, you have like something super simple and give you a little bit more context

118
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.380
on how it will actually work in the digital product.

119
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.560
So sometimes I'll do that or I'll scan in a sketch and that will really help me to figure that out.

120
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.390
If things actually work, if while I'm tapping it on the mobile screen, it'll also give me a sense

121
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.690
on, you know, these elements need to be bigger than I thought.

122
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.250
Maybe it's not going to work here.

123
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.140
So like on a home screen, we thought about things like the little hearts, but maybe we'll realize

124
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.290
that that's not really feasible for our user to tap.

125
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.090
Maybe it is for larger images on a mobile screen, but maybe if we're thinking about smaller ones,

126
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:26.240
maybe we leave that out there because it's a little confusing and a user may go to tap that and then

127
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.490
actually tap into the image when they didn't want to.

128
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.080
Where do they go?

129
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.190
They go to like that product description page that we've been talking so much about.

130
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.150
All these different tips are going to really help you create a much better user experience.

131
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.020
It's going to help you drive that communication throughout the whole team, create that collaborative

132
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.920
process.

133
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.530
At the end of the day, it's going to make you a better designer.

134
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.030
It's going to make your users happy.

135
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:55.060
So follow these tips, follow that process we talked about earlier in the lesson, and you're well on

136
00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.490
your way to sketching some amazing interactions and different types of flows.
