00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.990
I want to introduce you to one last form element, and it's actually not an input with a type as we've

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.660
described before.

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.670
It's a little bit different, but the idea is still the same.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:23.870
So let's add cars here and we want this to be a dropdown menu again, something that we see very often

5
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.290
in form fields.

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.090
However, unlike an input tag, we have to do a select tag.

7
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.300
Closing select tag as well.

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.900
And within here we can put in our options.

9
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.490
So the option will be we'll have a value of.

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.160
Volvo and we'll say Volvo because we want that.

11
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.470
Actually, print it to the screen.

12
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.760
And again, we have to close that tag.

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.710
We'll add.

14
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.920
Audie.

15
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.490
And we'll close that tag as well and we can keep adding them.

16
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.440
But for now, just two is fine.

17
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.950
If I save this and I refresh.

18
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.720
We have cars.

19
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.910
Let's add a break here.

20
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.890
Just so it looks nicer.

21
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.450
There you go.

22
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.450
And here now we have a dropdown menu.

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.670
Let's say you want to extend this or you want to see what kind of properties you can put with select

24
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.170
the way you go about it.

25
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.300
As you know, we've done this before.

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300
We type in HTML, select tag.

27
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.370
And actually Google gives you a nice little info page over here with attributes.

28
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.740
So you can see over here we can use multiple, which is specifies that multiple options can be selected

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.460
at once.

30
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.260
So let's do that.

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.970
Let's minimize this.

32
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.200
Perfect.

33
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.150
And within select, we'll put multiple.

34
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.820
We refresh and we can actually select multiple elements, but that doesn't look that pretty.

35
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.940
So I'm going to take that out and refresh.

36
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:16.630
I actually realized that we forgot one important input type, so I'm going to throw it in there as a

37
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.200
bonus.

38
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.030
And as you know, with any registration form, we want a password.

39
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.540
So let's add that right after the email.

40
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.560
We'll do.

41
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.410
Input type.

42
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.960
And yes, there's a password type that we can add and this password type will have another attribute

43
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.380
that's kind of cool and that is min, which is the minimum characters that a password needs.

44
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.770
So let's save that refresh and let's add a break here.

45
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.000
So it looks pretty.

46
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.060
Refresh.

47
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.570
And now the password field look that it acts like a password field.

48
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.700
All right, let's submit this form and see what happens.
