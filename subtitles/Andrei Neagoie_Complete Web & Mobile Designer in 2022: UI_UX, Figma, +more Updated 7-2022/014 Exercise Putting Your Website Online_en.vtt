00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.450
We've build our beautiful website.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.030
We've created a signup form.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.880
And it's fully responsive, but.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.510
It's just on our computers.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.140
Let's actually put this online on the Internet so anybody can access it.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.650
And I'm going to show you one way to do it for free.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.140
We'll take a bit of setup.

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.020
But this way, you'll have a website that is out there and you can showcase it to your friends.

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.200
So to get started I'm going to suggest that you go to GitHub dot com.

10
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.440
And you're going to create an account.

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.910
And when we get to the GitHub and get section, we're going to talk more about this.

12
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.580
But GitHub is a platform for developers to showcase their work, but also put all their code and make

13
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.560
sure that it's saved in a location.

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.930
You can think of it as a resume for developers, so any developer that I know has a GitHub account,

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.700
so create your own as well.

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.410
It's completely free and will allow us to put our website online for free.

17
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.470
So sign up now and then I'm going to go back to my GitHub where I'm already signed in.

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.630
And right here, once you're signed in, you'll get to this page and I'll say, start a project.

19
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.820
So I want you to click on Start a Project.

20
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.460
And here, this is really important.

21
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.740
You need to put the name that you have your username of GitHub first and then put period.

22
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.120
GitHub dot I oh so you have to name your repository so you can think of this as project name.

23
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.990
And then you can click on Create Repository.

24
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.890
You'll get the screen and look very, very confusing.

25
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.520
Don't worry.

26
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.900
We don't need to worry about it.

27
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.860
We're going to have to use this set up in desktop.

28
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.420
In order to do that, we need to download GitHub desktop client.

29
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.250
So you can easily do that by downloading a GitHub desktop.

30
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.860
There's four Mac for Windows, whichever one you need.

31
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.990
You can download once that's downloaded, let's open it up.

32
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.100
And you can see here we have GitHub desktop.

33
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.200
I'm going to double click to open it.

34
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.690
You'll get this pop up, but you can just open.

35
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.740
And once you have this, you can click on Clone Repository and you will have to sign in to GitHub.

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.530
So this needs to know what your account is on GitHub.

37
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.390
So I'm just going to click sign in.

38
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.350
And again, this is you can sign in with your own credentials here.

39
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.290
And there you go.

40
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.960
We should be all signed in.

41
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.680
The next step is we're going to click on something called Clone a Repository.

42
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.340
So we're going to click on that and we're going to search for the repository we just created.

43
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.670
So if you remember your username on GitHub, I o and because it's signed in to your account, it knows

44
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.570
where to find it.

45
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.700
So from here, I'm going to click.

46
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.520
Clone.

47
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.130
And it did a whole bunch of magic behind the scenes.

48
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.510
Don't worry about it for now.

49
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.930
Now you want to open this repository and finder and it's going to open up your folder with your name

50
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.380
on it.

51
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:34.480
And in there I just want you to copy and paste the three files that you have your index, your stylesheet,

52
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.490
and your header.

53
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.530
If you have any other files for your website.

54
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.820
Just keep them all in there.

55
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.100
Just reminder to take it out of the folder.

56
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.360
There you have it.

57
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.540
I don't want to delete that, so I'm going to copy that back.

58
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.170
And once you have that there, close it.

59
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.170
And now you'll see that you have this three files that you've just added.

60
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.200
All we need to do now is just write a summary of this.

61
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.900
So uploading website.

62
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.920
And then commit to master.

63
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.070
You'll need to add a submarine here, otherwise it won't let you click.

64
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.540
You click on that and again, something happens, some magic.

65
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.589
But if you click on the history tab, you'll see that your files are still there.

66
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.050
And the final thing you're going to do is click this publish branch button.

67
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.140
If you click on this.

68
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.450
It's doing a whole bunch of work behind the scenes, and it looks like it's done.

69
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.430
Now, here's the cool part.

70
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.940
Let's go back to our website.

71
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.660
And remember this screen.

72
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.530
Well, now, if I refresh.

73
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.520
I have my files in there.

74
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.650
So now this location is referencing these files.

75
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.970
And guess what?

76
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.160
Your website's actually online.

77
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.360
Don't believe me.

78
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.560
Well, let's check out.

79
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.370
All we need to do is go to this link.

80
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.140
Type it into the bar.

81
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.210
Press enter.

82
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.580
And there you go.

83
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.700
We have our website online.

84
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.380
So now.

85
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:23.980
Our beautiful website, our startup page works and people can sign up for our mailing list and check

86
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.270
out our startup.

87
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.680
Isn't that cool?

88
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.760
We're going to be learning more about GitHub and get later on in the course and there's a special section

89
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.610
just for it because it's a very important tool.

90
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.820
But I want you to put your website online so you can show it off to your friends and family and let

91
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.430
them know that you're going to be a pretty good developer.

92
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.230
I'll see you in the next one.

93
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.100
Bye bye.
