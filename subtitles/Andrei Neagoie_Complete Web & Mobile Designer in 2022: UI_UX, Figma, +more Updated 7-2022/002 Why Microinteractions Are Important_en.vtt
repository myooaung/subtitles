00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:09.120
So in our last video we went over what exactly is a micro interaction and the structure of a micro interaction.

2
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.790
Now I know that was kind of really in-depth, but it's super important for us to understand how we can

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.200
create really great micro interactions.

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.510
Making good micro interactions can really push our product over the edge.

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.560
So let's talk about why they are so important.

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.850
I think we kind of already have an understanding, but let's get into this.

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.220
So micro interactions don't usually get a lot of attention during like just a design process.

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.500
They seem like these little small details of a broader, much larger experience.

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.990
Those details have a big impact on the type of product that you are building.

10
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.120
It doesn't matter what type of product.

11
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.420
I mean, it just has a large impact and it gives your users a good impression of your product.

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.920
That's why, in a nutshell, why they're so important now.

13
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.590
In most cases, the difference between products that we really like and products that we don't really

14
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.110
like, I think it comes down to like just the polish and quality of those micro interactions.

15
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.690
Like it's essential that we put a lot of focus on designing those small, small moments because they

16
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.250
really make up a lot of the app.

17
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.300
I know that sounds weird, but think about if Facebook didn't have those little animated reactions,

18
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.040
think about if we had like had transitions between like deleting cards and stuff like that and things

19
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.750
were happening instantaneously.

20
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.750
I mean, this goes way back to motion in general.

21
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.600
Now, it's so important that we create those really great small moments that make your app much easier

22
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.030
to use and much more delightful to use.

23
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.550
So the biggest thing is that they provide so much feedback to our users.

24
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.020
Now think about it.

25
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.480
Your product should be intuitive no matter what.

26
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.700
I mean, it's no excuse, it should be intuitive, but this is what we should always strive for.

27
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.410
So micro interactions are something that you can achieve with this, like just providing feedback in

28
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.740
general.

29
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.620
So the biggest thing to consider is like the user's journey when we're designing for like providing

30
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.550
good feedback.

31
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.450
Now if a user is in the middle of like a payment process or something like that, could you imagine

32
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.100
if they didn't get any feedback whatsoever, that would be pretty bad.

33
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.830
I mean, we need to look for places where the user might need that feedback and reassurance and like

34
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.170
this is especially a place that a user needs that think about like sending and transferring money,

35
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.820
more complicated things like that.

36
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.690
Imagine like, like I said, if a user didn't get that success or that confirmation, that would be

37
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.730
pretty jarring as an experience.

38
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.560
And I personally would be confused.

39
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.120
I would be a little concerned.

40
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.750
I would probably try and contact their customer service line.

41
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.830
I would really want to know where my money went and if the payment was successful.

42
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.480
So this is really important just in general for your product.

43
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.550
It cuts down a lot of costs when not having to talk to users because you know, you're giving them the

44
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.510
right amount of feedback.

45
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.720
You're making your application much more intuitive.

46
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.430
They also help prevent errors.

47
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.020
Now, helping users deal with error states is a common UX practice, but it's much better when we kind

48
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.590
of prevent those kind of errors from happening in the first place.

49
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.960
So what I'm thinking here, like what happens if we kind of have like in-line validation when we think

50
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.460
like this, we can create products that keep users in control of their own experience.

51
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.500
So when you just signed up to like a new product or service, they often have to enter like a password

52
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.490
or a username.

53
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.250
And generally like once they hit submit, then they're hit with all the errors at once.

54
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.530
Now that's bad UX.

55
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.370
What we should do is we can easily handle this with inline validation.

56
00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.610
We talked about this within forms, we talked about this, it just in general, that's just good UX.

57
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.590
So this is coming back again and this is a micro interaction in and of itself.

58
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.990
So having the in-line validation while it's happening, instead of actually forcing the user to click

59
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.810
like Submit or next is really helpful.

60
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.740
But it's also helpful in the state of like thinking about like undo.

61
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.680
Sometimes we make mistakes and click things accidentally and you know, your product should always make

62
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.260
it easier for users to kind of go back and undo that action that they did in the first place.

63
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.420
With micro interactions.

64
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.970
They really help communicate that state within this kind of component over here.

65
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.860
And it really helps to suggest that further action is kind of possible.

66
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.530
So let's think about what's happening here.

67
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.760
The user clicks that they click like a submit button and then they can undo with that line of text.

68
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.850
So mistakes happen all the time and just incorporating something like that could really help.

69
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.200
Now let's think about seamless experiences.

70
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.550
Micro interactions can really make seamless interactions and experiences.

71
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.250
The less effort a user needs to invest in an interaction, I mean the better usability of a product.

72
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.680
Now, this is why we kind of strive for that seamless design that we always want.

73
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.840
We don't want users to put too much effort into doing the tasks that we want them to do.

74
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.000
Micro interactions can really help here.

75
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.270
When I think about that, I think about like swipe interactions.

76
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.230
We don't want users to like tap on these little areas.

77
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.650
We want them to be able to just effortlessly slide throughout and make the app so easy to use.

78
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.110
Swiping allows the user to easily move throughout the list instead of constantly tapping.

79
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.880
So like I said, so much more easier.

80
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.620
But also another example is just pulling to refresh.

81
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.490
This is an excellent example of a micro interaction that is triggered by the user.

82
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.740
I mentioned this before in the last video, but this also allows users to kind of pull down a list of

83
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.670
items to receive more information, whether that be like emails, more posts, images, you name it,

84
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.390
anything.

85
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.370
It makes the experience of browsing much more smoother.

86
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.590
Can you imagine if we didn't have pull to refresh?

87
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.510
I couldn't really think of a design pattern that would really help you get just like a refresh button,

88
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.790
but that would be kind of weird with a pull to refresh.

89
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.830
All you have to really do is just pull the screen down and everything just kind of happens on its own.

90
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.950
So making that up much more easier to use.

91
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.300
The next is encouraging engagement.

92
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.650
Now, using emotion and design in general makes it possible to form a better connection with your users.

93
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.880
That's just fact.

94
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.090
Animated feedback works really well here.

95
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.680
Like think about a heart animation when somebody like, likes something.

96
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.720
Or maybe like a confetti pop would I have over here when somebody does something like a task that you

97
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.100
want them to do, whether they, like cleared their whole inbox, I know that's hard for some people,

98
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.870
but also in this instance, it's something really big, like you have been chosen for the job.

99
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.890
Like that is huge and we want to celebrate those little moments for people.

100
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.530
I mean, like I said, it could be something as simple as clearing your inbox to something much more

101
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.780
bigger and much more celebratory, like getting a job that you wanted.

102
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.750
So this really helps encourage engagement because it's really possible to achieve a better result when

103
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.390
a user achieves important goals or finish the tasks.

104
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.260
And these moments can really be reinforced with these micro interactions.

105
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:39.160
And by doing this, you're creating that sense of achievement and can make that little moment a bit

106
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.030
more special.

107
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.200
So that's what we're aiming for.

108
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.640
That's what I'm trying to get at, is you can use these little kind of micro interactions, these little

109
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:52.810
animations, to really bring users back into your product, keep them excited about your product, get

110
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.210
them just really loving your product overall.

111
00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:01.390
Now I'm not saying we should have confetti pops everywhere, but just choose accordingly and it's got

112
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.680
to match to your brand as well.

113
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.670
And that's the next thing you know, they can really help communicate the tone of your brand.

114
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.630
Big surprise.

115
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:13.450
We got Facebook reactions here again, but micro interactions should always have a purpose, but that

116
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.540
doesn't mean that they shouldn't be able to capture your brand.

117
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:23.590
So the last slide I talked about encouraging engagement and, you know, confetti pops may not be for

118
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.180
every single product.

119
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.250
I mean, they may not be suitable for that, but we need to think about our brand and micro interactions

120
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.179
can really align with our brand and help even communicate it further.

121
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:40.210
So if your brand's tone is fun and colorful and joyful, it's okay to try and recreate that within your

122
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.650
micro interactions.

123
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:48.420
This only works if it matches your branding, so think about these different tips about creating like

124
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.120
just better micro interactions and why they're so important.

125
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.540
Because these kind of formed the basis of just how we create micro interactions in general and what

126
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.470
we're thinking about when we actually go and plan them out.

127
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.150
So in our next video, we're actually going to jump in and create some small micro interactions with

128
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:13.150
figma, smart, animate, and then we'll create our own animation with fake motion.
