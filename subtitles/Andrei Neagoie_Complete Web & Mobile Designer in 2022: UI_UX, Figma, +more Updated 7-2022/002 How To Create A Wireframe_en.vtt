00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.460
Everyone.

2
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.270
And welcome back.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.300
We're going to be talking about how do I create my own wireframes?

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.160
So the one thing I really want to stress is to keep things simple.

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.460
You know, don't worry about fidelity, especially when you're wire framing.

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.680
You just need just enough to really get people to understand what you're trying to convey.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.480
Pencil and paper is probably the best way to wireframe quickly, you know.

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.520
This is one of my mantras like we've already done this.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.200
I mean, we sketched a bit, we did some user flows and you've already kind of started wire framing.

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.180
Even if you have a whiteboard, you can use one.

11
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.180
But I mean, pencil and paper are huge.

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.290
You know, if you do have a client, you can polish them up to showcase some of your interactions or

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.630
more prominent areas within your flows and, you know, pages that you're designing for.

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.780
You can definitely add a little bit more fidelity to just showcase or demo them, but you want to keep

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.860
your colors to grayscale.

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.950
White and black is perfectly fine and grazing between.

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.910
Don't go crazy on fonts maybe to what you can even get away with one.

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.380
You can easily show hierarchy with bolding fonts as well or increasing the size.

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.620
Avoid any flashy images you can use rectangles and squares and an X through the middle.

20
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.120
Just say that that would be an image and for videos you can add a triangle in the middle to indicate

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.350
that that's one as well.

22
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.930
So keep it simple.

23
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.510
Don't worry about fidelity, especially at this stage.

24
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.110
The next thing is you've got to ask yourself some pretty important questions.

25
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.200
You know, what are the users and the businesses goals when interacting with this page?

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.960
How can the content be organized to support these goals?

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.530
What should the user see when they first come to a page?

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.190
What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?

29
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.740
I think these questions are a perfect segway really into wire framing and, you know, consult your

30
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.420
old artifacts right here.

31
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.950
I have a story map and definitely go back to the story map if you have one.

32
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.480
Do you really consult like user stories and requirements so you can understand what will be on every

33
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.960
page?

34
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.770
We even did user flows as well and we're going to get into that right now.

35
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.070
So consult your user flows and your site map.

36
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.360
You know, as I consult my site map, I'm always looking at the key requirements and hierarchies for

37
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.020
a certain page.

38
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.400
I want to know what is the most and least important thing that should be there.

39
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.380
You know, different user stories are really great because they're better indicator of what exactly

40
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.450
needs to be built from a user's perspective and a proper like if you have a story map, like I mentioned

41
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.310
before, we would have user stories for every single instance throughout the product journey and then

42
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780
we would come together to discuss which is like the riskiest part of the product we want to tackle first.

43
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.100
So like for our client, we probably want to tackle search or the home page or maybe the initial registration,

44
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.560
all those different points where it really depends on users actually finding products or registering

45
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.190
their interests.

46
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.310
So that way the product can actually be successful.

47
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.180
They're high traffic areas and the interactions are pretty integral to the user goal and we need to

48
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.290
get them right to succeed.

49
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.570
I always, and I mean always tackle the riskiest features first.

50
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.670
So like I mentioned before, that's a perfect segue into this because everyone has a different definition

51
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.130
of what risk is and it could mean a lot of different things.

52
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.130
It could be features that dictate the success of the product.

53
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.290
It could be certain assumptions that your team and client have for a certain feature.

54
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.660
When I'm in a kickoff meeting or I'm talking to clients, I really kind of I have a list of risky assumptions

55
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.800
that we have as well.

56
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.570
And I mark all those things down.

57
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:35.640
Anything from what we assume the user wants or assume will be a good feature or certain things like

58
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.300
risks.

59
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.870
There are high traffic areas that really depend on nailing the interaction in order to succeed for the

60
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.430
business for our client.

61
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.030
If we release a search that just doesn't work or the interaction is way too complex, the product essentially

62
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.750
will fail.

63
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.790
So there's a lot of things like that that we need to account for and we should probably be focusing

64
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.850
a lot of our attention on like in comparison to another feature like profile or a wish list.

65
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.100
So always keep that in mind.

66
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.490
Another big thing is to bring your team into the process.

67
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.120
I mean, this is huge.

68
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.780
You should often be talking to every member of your team.

69
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.330
It doesn't matter.

70
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.940
Product managers for business goals, developers for development strategy.

71
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.940
You can even talk to quality assurance people like quality analyst.

72
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.040
People talk about just how certain things work within the product and what their expectations are.

73
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.470
Other disciplines will provide priceless insight into the ways you can build those wireframes, so make

74
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.020
sure that you include others in your process.

75
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.280
It may be a business goal that you aren't meeting or a technical challenge that you may have.

76
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.130
Like for certain interactions you want to come to life.

77
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.150
So tap into your peers example of trying to do things that are way too hard to develop.

78
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:57.110
So if you have a wireframe that is just way too complex, you should definitely be talking to your developers.

79
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.240
I often take a look at Dribble and I mentioned dribble a lot because it's a great place to get inspiration

80
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.720
and all that.

81
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.400
But the majority of the designs showcased there will probably never be built and have never been built

82
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.670
because they just are way too complex and time consuming.

83
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.410
I'm not saying that it is impossible because everything is possible with enough time and money, but

84
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.710
most times you want to build your way up to something that is like considered perfect and we may release

85
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.420
in different stages, whether that be like a minimum viable product that has only the features that

86
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.740
you truly need to validate if your product has any legs.

87
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.270
Sometimes we may be releasing on top of that the next best features.

88
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.040
And over time we'll get to a point where we can really hone in on the design and polish different things.

89
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.920
But generally you want to release in kind of waves instead of building out a product from 0 to 100.

90
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.280
You want to get like 25% of the way there.

91
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.050
Build another set of features, improve on other features based off of what you've learned from your

92
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.380
wireframe testing and even just basic prototype testing.

93
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.270
So remember loop your team in.

94
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.370
It's really going to help you understand what you can and cannot build.

95
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.540
It also really help you understand what kind of like different business goals you may have that you

96
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.500
haven't considered.

97
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.920
Maybe stakeholders have certain goals.

98
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:24.450
So these are the tips I often give other designers for when we want to actually use wireframes and when

99
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.220
we actually want to create our own.

100
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.930
So follow these tips and you'll be well on your way to making some awesome wireframes that are based

101
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:42.510
off of facts and different types of data and are used to actually validate everyone's assumptions.
