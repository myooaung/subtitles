1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,009
Hey, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,060
Today, we're going to be using Figma to create our very own grid.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,160
Figma is a pretty powerful and flexible tool when you're working with grids and there's so much you

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,840
can do because of the way you can nest frames and styles and constraints.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,720
So let's jump in so I can show you what we can do here.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,020
So let's utilize the frame.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,280
Now, this is super cool.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,920
We're going to create our own grid with a base unit of six.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
So we're keeping our base unit in mind at all times.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,960
So I'm going to press F and over here I have a bunch of grids I can choose from and I'm just going to

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,190
pick a standard grid.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,930
This one looks good.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,360
I've got a MacBook right there.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,670
And let's just name it.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,070
So command are for quick shortcut.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:44,820
So.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,420
Ah.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,220
Love it.

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,110
Very original name.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,580
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to select our frame and we're going to go over here and

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,540
we're going to go to live grid press the plus sign.

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,060
And automatically, when you press the plus sign, you get this grid based off of ten pixels.

23
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,030
If you zoom in there, ten pixels.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,620
Now, we don't want to use this.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,160
What we do want to use this.

26
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,010
We want to go over to here and we want to select columns.

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,630
There we go.

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,660
Now, here we can kind of set the amount of columns, the gutters, the margin, any other types of

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,770
settings that you really want.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,510
You can make your grid blue, make it whatever color you want.

31
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,730
Typically, red is what I set it to.

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,720
It's helpful if you have other grids laying on top of each other.

33
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,500
What we're going to do is we're going to set the number of columns to 12.

34
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,700
Let's just exit out of that.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,380
So here we go.

36
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,860
We've got 12 columns here.

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:55,020
We're going to set the gutter to 16 and the margin to 16, and we're going to keep this to stretch.

38
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,510
So that way it stretches when we move it.

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,160
Perfect.

40
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,210
There's our grid.

41
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,380
Let's take a look.

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,530
See, it stretches as we move.

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,440
It does look confusing.

44
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,050
There you go.

45
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,810
Now, another cool thing is that in Figma, we can start to apply grids even to frames within our layout.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,390
So that means we can apply it not only to the main frame that dictates our screen size, but we'll be

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,710
able to apply it to individual containers or even like components like UI elements.

48
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,320
So let's make a card element.

49
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,630
So I'm going to do is I'm going to press F for another frame.

50
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,560
Make this right here.

51
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,740
And what I'm going to do is the same exact thing.

52
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm going to create a little grid.

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,550
So go over here, select columns.

54
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,560
And this is a good case where you would want to probably change the color because it gets a little confusing.

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,570
Sometimes I like to even like make the opacity just a little bit darker.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,130
So I have a set of 20 there.

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,970
Now, this would be a container and you could set it to whatever you'd like.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,150
Typically, you don't want to have 12 columns on this.

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,750
But.

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,310
There we go.

61
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,640
And we can set like even a margin of 16 if we wanted to.

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,910
But let's scale down the amount of columns we have.

63
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,890
So over here we have four.

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,110
I think that's that's okay for now.

65
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,730
Like I said, nothing's really set in stone but set that grid.

66
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,820
So there's our grid.

67
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,000
It's on our elements over here.

68
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,610
You can see it's attached to that grid.

69
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,710
Now, this is pretty cool, right?

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,950
Like you could create cards and those cards could be really uniform in style based off of your grid

71
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,910
with integrate.

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,020
And they'll be able to scale.

73
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,280
Now.

74
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,560
Oh, see, it's not fluid.

75
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,940
And let's get into constraints and I'll teach you how that works.

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,400
So now they're sitting on the grid.

77
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,220
Now the constraints are much more interesting.

78
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,870
So you remember, like when we were trying to do fluid layouts, like we were just doing right now and

79
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,810
things weren't working as we expected to or as we saw before.

80
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,880
Now, Figma allows you to apply a thing called constraints to a frame.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,100
Let's look this frame over here.

82
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,650
Perfect.

83
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,530
And these are constraints on the right side.

84
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,680
This will help you control hung element resizes in relation to the actual parent frame.

85
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,760
So this is our parent frame and this is going to resize in relation to that.

86
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:27,140
So this card element, what we're going to do is we're going to just set, we're going to shift and

87
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,330
click on here and you'll see that it's left and right now.

88
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:38,690
So that means that when I resize my parent frame, it's going to change with that just so you can better

89
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,000
see it.

90
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,720
What we're going to do is we're just going to set that to Gray and we're going to you can turn off grids

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,710
by pressing for Mac users control g.

92
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,620
So I'm going to take off that grid.

93
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,150
I'm going to create these ones and give them a fill.

94
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,280
I could just do something like that.

95
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,720
So this one is the one with the constraints.

96
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,820
These ones do not have constraints.

97
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,970
And you'll notice that that stays perfectly on our grid while the others don't.

98
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,980
You can even do this for the top and bottom as well.

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,470
So you'll notice that if I'm going to do this, this will scale top to bottom with my parent frame.

100
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,020
The others won't do that.

101
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,170
They'll only move with the top because the constraint they have is top and left, and they'll only move

102
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,300
with the left because that is what the that is what the constraint is set to.

103
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:43,210
So applying these constraints allow us to maintain a fixed layout based off of our columns and gutters.

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,220
Please, for the sake of your own sanity, you should save your grids as styles.

105
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,270
That way, we aren't constantly repeating ourselves when we create a new frame.

106
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,540
Also, it keeps things neat in one place.

107
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,280
So when you need to apply it to a frame, you just select a style easily like this.

108
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,890
This is where you would select your style.

109
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,700
We don't have any styles set here, and let's just go and create one quick.

110
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,820
So let's just delete these cards.

111
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,180
This is our 12th column Standard Grid.

112
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,790
And what we're going to do is we're going to click that style button.

113
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,480
We are going to click Create a Style and we're going to name it.

114
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,810
Naming conventions and Figma are really cool as well.

115
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,060
So what we're going to do here is this is how you would set and break up your grid styles.

116
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:34,060
I'm going to just write layout grid and I'm going to separate it like that.

117
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:41,740
And the actual name of the grid, I'm going to call it my 12 colors and I'm going to create that style.

118
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,370
There it is.

119
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,410
And you saw that title that I gave.

120
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,560
It is Layout Grid.

121
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,180
We can even create another grid here.

122
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,350
Or create a baseline grid.

123
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,120
So that's an auto to the top.

124
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,370
And like I said, I like using a four pixel grid here, no offset and the gutters will be four and you

125
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,570
can combine grids.

126
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,230
I can create another column grid on top of this.

127
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,550
So set my margin to 16, set my gutter to 16 pixels if you want.

128
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:29,590
You can set the colour just to differentiate between both of them and you can see these two as a style

129
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,130
as well.

130
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,240
Right there.

131
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:46,420
And we can just name these combined and we can call it 12 call layout and four pixel baseline and there

132
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,870
we go.

133
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,450
So they're under combined and you can name them any which way you want.

134
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,660
We'll get into that much more later.

135
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,140
But this is just a perfect way to create a new frame.

136
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,860
Go into my layout grid, apply a style.

137
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,310
Change styles easily.

138
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,530
So please do that for your own sanity.

139
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,870
It will help you in the future.

140
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,250
Just kind of not have to recreate the wheel over and over again because it's not really fun creating

141
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,790
the grid, but just to apply it easily to your layout.

142
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,950
And another great thing is, if I want to edit that grid, I can do so.

143
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,800
I can go right here, edit the colors, and it's going to edit everywhere else.

144
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:38,630
So what you do is you just press this, you click on to this edit style section and you can edit it.

145
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:45,520
You can even give it a description like really awesome grid.

146
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,920
And there you go.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,770
That is how you make a grid and figma.
