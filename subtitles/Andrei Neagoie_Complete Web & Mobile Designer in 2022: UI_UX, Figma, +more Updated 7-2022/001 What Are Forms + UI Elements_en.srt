00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,540
Hello and welcome to our lesson on forms and UI elements.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,610
Now you may be thinking to yourself, what are UI elements?

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,620
And that's a very good question.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,750
You elements are basically just elements within your user interface.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,030
Like take a look over here at this picture.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:26,950
We have a cards, we have some icons, we have a navigation, we have a badge on an icon right there.

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,890
We also have like a little picker over here.

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:37,780
And these are all considered UI elements, but forms are probably the most common UI elements that we

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,940
actually experience and probably if not the most important.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,020
So let's take a step back.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,910
Forms are everywhere.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,600
Think about it.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,170
We might think that a form is just a standard set of inputs on a page, but when we're designing a user

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,900
experience, they're featured in a lot of different places.

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,700
Take this, for example.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,200
This is considered a form.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,130
When you log right into a product, you have some elements here, like a button.

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,690
You have a forgot your password link and you have different form inputs.

19
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,890
Like this is your standard password input and this is your standard email input.

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,720
And these all come together to create a form, even these social logins over here.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,120
What about when you even send a message?

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,860
This is considered a form.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,710
This, alongside these buttons, are considered a larger form component.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,700
Forms are everywhere, even when you search.

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,500
This is considered a form.

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,450
They are crucial to the success of your design and can impact the business of the product if certain

27
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,800
forms rely on optimization and hitting certain goals.

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,870
With forms being such an integral part of building products, it's critical to get them right.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,980
But don't be scared.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,960
We're going to learn how to build some brilliant forms and UI elements that are really delightful,

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,820
usable and inclusive.

32
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,750
So you may be thinking, Where do we start?

33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,670
Are you ready?

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,490
Remember how we built our own site map, what we talked about building some preliminary site maps,

35
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,759
user flows and concepts earlier.

36
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,290
When we did that, we were thinking about the types of content we would have on certain pages.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,660
Before we even begin thinking about designing a form, we need to know what type of content we're dealing

38
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,170
with.

39
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,300
So when we looked back at the home page that we built for Habitual, we were talking about the same

40
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,820
map, and at this portion we knew that users will probably want to search for products over here.

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,660
We kind of list that as a piece of content that we were definitely going to have on that page.

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,760
So with us thinking about search, we drew a bunch of search inputs.

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,550
We drew what that search overlay would look like, and that is all considered a form that comes together.

44
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,310
Now we definitely know we need a search bar.

45
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,860
Another example is registration.

46
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,260
We touched a bit on that earlier as well.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,090
This is a bit more trickier.

48
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,430
We know the standard types of UI elements that will be used to build the forms a user may see like text

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,970
inputs, buttons, maybe a progress bar.

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,660
We saw that an example earlier.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,750
But it's not that easy, though.

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,050
We also need to take into account if the registration wants to capture other content like user interests

53
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,460
or profile images.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,480
So before we even build the form, we need to think about the types of questions we want to ask our

55
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,110
user.

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,220
This takes some time to figure out and can be done through some quick prototyping, testing and iteration

57
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,670
so you can find the result that works best for your product.

58
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,650
We'll come back to this scenario later, but the goal here is to generate some ideas and come back to

59
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:39,860
them.

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,140
That always just keeps on coming up in our design processes that we need to keep on generating ideas,

61
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,100
learn from those ideas, refine them and then keep on going.

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,570
So same thing with forms.

63
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,560
We need to think about the types of questions we need to ask our users because it's incredibly important

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,620
that we get that right and then we can iterate and refine the details later.

65
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,490
So you want to start building some components for your product, right?

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,190
Well, we're going to cover a wide array of examples of different types of forms and accompanying UI

67
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,970
elements.

68
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,520
We'll be covering like forms, inputs, advanced inputs and buttons.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,899
We're going to jump right into Figma to take a look at the different types of scenarios we often face

70
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,950
as designers.
