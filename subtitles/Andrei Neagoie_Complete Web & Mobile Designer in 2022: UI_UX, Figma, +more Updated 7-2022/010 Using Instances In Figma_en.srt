00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,750
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,570
So we talked about creating a more complex component in our last video.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,460
And I'm going to tell you about how you can actually take these instances and override them for your

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,300
own use.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,170
Overrides allow you kind of to tweak and adapt these instances depending on the context of your designs

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,480
so you can change things like title, text, stroke other properties while staying connected to the

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,530
master component.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,510
So one thing you saw me do was you saw me actually create this label but hide different things like

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,780
icons and descriptions and all that kind of stuff.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,900
Now in this instance, what we're going to do, we're going to actually create an instance of this component.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,970
And if I go in here.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,360
I can do something like what should we use here as a label?

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,820
I think something like maybe date.

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,030
That's totally fine.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,600
As you can tell, like we're overwriting these properties just so we can use them and it makes it really

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,319
easy.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,900
So now that's an optional.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,260
And we can even update the text here so we can actually hide this if we want.

19
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,570
But if we do want to use a placeholder, I know we talked about placeholders.

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,890
People can still use them if they're kind of adhering to the basic rules.

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,310
So we can just kind of what else can we put here?

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,860
If we wanted to have a placeholder, we can actually adjust that or you can actually just create another

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,670
component.

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,080
So select it.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,850
So I mean, you can definitely create different instances of this.

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,640
If you wanted to give like an icon or something like that, you can do that too.

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:50,590
An example is if we go back to our original master component and go back to our assets, we can actually

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,390
throw an icon in here.

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,880
Some people like using icons with in their inputs.

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,780
And we did go over that as well and we can throw that in there.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,900
And what we're going to do is hide it.

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,460
And that should be reflected here.

33
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,380
I should be able to grab it.

34
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,250
Let's go to our input field and there we go.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,160
We can even add like show and hide icons if we wanted to.

36
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,350
We can even grab different instances of the icon.

37
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,750
So we have the input text there.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,950
Where's the icon?

39
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,990
Over here so you can grab an instance over here.

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,570
So you can use.

41
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,850
Like, what else should we use?

42
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,530
Like we can use like.

43
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,500
A different icon if we want.

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,420
I don't know if you want to use a warning sign, but.

45
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,920
Like we can do a bunch of different things just by editing that instance.

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,580
So you don't necessarily need to create a component for every single use case.

47
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:01,000
You can just have a general component that has hidden layers, possibly like I've done here, and have

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,790
other components in the background like I have on another page.

49
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,950
I have a bunch of iconic components and you can grab those and use them.

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,920
So like I've done here, as I've essentially just grabbed that check from another component.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,360
So I've checked, I have the instance I can just like select that date range.

52
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,880
I can hide this if I want.

53
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,900
And there you go.

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,290
That's such an easy way to override instances.
