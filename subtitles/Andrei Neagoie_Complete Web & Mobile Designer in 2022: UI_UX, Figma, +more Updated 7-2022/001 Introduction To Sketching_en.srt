00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,060
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,760
We're going to be talking about sketching today in this lesson.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,140
And sketching is really interesting.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,090
I mean, there's so many different ways we can use sketching for user experience design.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,180
One thing I really like to do is use it just for idea generation.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,980
And we're going to learn about that.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,930
We're going to learn about the process.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,740
We're going to learn about sketching different types of flows and some tips in between.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,690
So let's jump right in.

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,690
We're going to start with an intro to sketching.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,690
So sketching is a two step process.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,520
It's very important to remember designers consider their options and then proceed to work out those

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,330
details.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,330
That first step is called Idea Generation.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,960
And what we want to do here is we want to approach a new product and generate as many ideas as we can.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,320
It isn't uncommon for us to be missing certain ideas or elements or details, but I mean, it's just

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,810
about getting ideas out there quickly.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,950
Doesn't matter.

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,000
It isn't really focusing on the detail just at this moment.

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,560
Generally, as many approaches and then decide on which one is the most efficient for the task you're

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,450
trying to solve for the next step is adding detail and refinement.

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,600
So step by step you work on refining those sketches and then adding more detail.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,140
It's okay to kill some of your ideas here, and that's the point.

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,420
So don't really get bogged down by all the messy sketches or the lack of detail.

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,900
Just keep on going and refining and it'll come over time.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,160
Now let's jump right into how we actually take a look at that process.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,180
And we go from idea generation all the way to refinement.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,930
Now that first step is generating ideas like we just spoke about.

29
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:45,320
Now these are the initial sketches you basically create, and they have lower level details.

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,770
They have no colors, usually maybe some colors to signify key parts of the sketch.

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,770
But the goal here is to draw a lot of basic sketches.

32
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,820
You'll notice here that there's just like a square, an arrow, some text.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,800
I mean, at this point, like I said, just generating as many options as you possibly can.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,310
Don't get bogged down by those details from here.

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,650
We're going to start really kind of refining and adding some details so we can start making some sketch

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,730
like wireframes.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,100
And you'll notice that your promising sketches start to lead to more detailed view, and it may not

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,110
have all the details still, and that's totally fine, but it will have a lot of the key details and

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,590
you want to refine those from those sketches that you had over here.

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,110
So you'll notice that like we start adding a little more elements and different types of UI elements

41
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,490
up here and down here buttons, different types of inputs.

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,360
This is when we're starting to think a little bit more about interaction now.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,060
It will feature a lot more detail flows as well.

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,590
So we'll get into this soon.

45
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,550
Don't worry about that.

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,020
The next step.

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,120
So what I'm getting to visual design and start thinking much more about these wireframes in much more

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,840
detail.

49
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,170
I'm actually going to refine a lot of sketches and start to pull out certain elements that I think are

50
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:00,980
really needed.

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,900
So I'll start to realize that as I start building out these kind of components, I'm going to need like

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,430
buttons.

53
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm going to need different inputs.

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm going to need to account for different types of content.

55
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,690
And that's really going to help us in the future when we're thinking about the different types of requirements

56
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,410
that we need.

57
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,360
That is the basic process from going from ideas all the way to components.

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,320
Next, we're going to be talking about entire sketching process.
