1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,100
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,630
So we're going to be talking about building inputs with atomic elements.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,010
So I had to call this inception because sometimes components can get pretty complex.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,560
Now, if you notice, we just have a field here and, you know, essentially this field isn't going

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,990
to be the only part of the component that you use to actually create an input field.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,170
You're going to have other components as well.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,500
So one of those components could be something like a label, and we can create our own little label

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,620
component and I'll show you how that works.

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,190
So what I've done here is I have some text.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,810
I think that's fine in terms of the typeface choice.

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,420
You can probably give it.

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,740
I think that's cool.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,660
So this is our label.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,880
And we are just going to.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,560
Do that.

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,150
We're going to duplicate it here.

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,120
And you may have noticed that this is pretty similar to the type of inputs that we use in our demonstrations

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,330
earlier on, like forms, inputs and buttons and stuff like that.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,760
And I'm going to show you just how I did that.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,130
So this could be like a description.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,070
We're going to write a line that.

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,880
So what we're doing here is we're making a component just for labeling.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,410
Drop that down to 50.

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,020
We can even go probably down to 25.

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,420
Actually, let's just jump back up to 50 and we're going to make that regular.

26
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,580
So this is our other component.

27
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,260
I'm going to switch that.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,570
Okay.

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,710
I'm not going to allow my label to go further than this, and I'm not going to allow my description

30
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,630
to go further than that.

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:58,770
Okay.

32
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,750
So we set some constraints in there.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,699
What we can also do is go into our assets and select an icon that we want to use.

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,070
Okay.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,780
And now the great thing is we can show and hide these things.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,200
So we have a description icon.

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,560
So it's the info icon.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,770
So it's an instance of another an icon component.

39
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:38,910
And if we just option command G, we've created a frame and we can call this label.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,110
And what I like to do is I like to just kind of hide these images, so.

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,920
There we go.

42
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,240
Perfect.

43
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,430
And we can create a component.

44
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,110
And no, we have a label component.

45
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,340
Let's talk about how we can use this in conjunction with this input.

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,810
Sometimes we find ourselves with a component that is pretty complex.

47
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,240
You know, it may not be really, really complex.

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,220
I mean, some do get that complex, but they may feature something like labels like you've seen here,

49
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,270
different types of like text elements, different types of icons.

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,610
So what's the solution, you may ask?

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,500
We can build components within components.

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,360
So that's why I mentioned Inception.

53
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,910
You can create a component for that field element or label and place it within your input component

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,790
so we can put these together to create an input component.

55
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,430
And every time you update that, like individual element, this one or this one, it's going to change

56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,540
across the board.

57
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:40,460
Sometimes you may do this depending on the context, like changing just like border radius or just label

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,630
fill colors.

59
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,560
But it's just so easy using these kind of I call them atomic elements.

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,400
It's just a game changer when it comes to building, customizing and maintaining components.

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,230
So let me show you what we can do here.

62
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,400
So I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create just a text component.

63
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,470
I'll just call it input text.

64
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,120
And this will be the main copy that goes within our input.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,480
Could just leave it as black.

66
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,710
I think that's good.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,190
I mean, we can even bump it up in size a little bit and we're just going to do that.

68
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,540
Okay.

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,440
So that's fine.

70
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,820
So these are.

71
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,829
Master components.

72
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,400
What I'm going to do here is I'm just going to create this as a component.

73
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,570
So there we go.

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,970
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take all these duplicate them as instances.

75
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,460
Now I'm going to place this just above the input.

76
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm going to place the input just to the inside of that.

77
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,930
So if we are using our base unit.

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,010
We should be spacing with our base unit.

79
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,340
So this will be let's just check if our preferences are proper.

80
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,360
So we have our nudge amount.

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,940
So for good.

82
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,480
So I'm just going to do shift option and arrow key and there it is.

83
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,240
It's eight pixels from the edge over here.

84
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,850
I'm just going to do the same.

85
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,920
I think that's fine.

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,470
So now we have our whole component.

87
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,820
And what we can do is we can also.

88
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,340
Stretch this.

89
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,030
And you can tell.

90
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,750
That stretches just beyond their.

91
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,980
If you hold down shift control and the arrow key, you can shrink it by your nudge amount.

92
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:48,300
So I've shrunk it, as you can tell from where it was before, aligned over here to eight pixels within.

93
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,480
So now I'm going to select all of these and I'm going to create a component that automatically gives

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,230
it a component name.

95
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,280
And I'm going to call this.

96
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,220
Form Field OC.

97
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,550
These are our atomic elements and this is our kind of our larger and more complex component.

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,870
And what we're going to do is we're going to change the board arrays to 100.

99
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,760
And as you can tell, it also changes the border radius over there.

100
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,040
So if I want to get to 20 or five like I originally had it, it changes it.

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,710
If I think that this text is way too small or too large, I can bump that down a bit.

102
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,220
If this label I feel like is too dark, I can change that as well.

103
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,390
And all of a sudden.

104
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,510
This instance.

105
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,800
Has changed.

106
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,860
Based off of the changes I made here.

107
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:53,180
So build your components with atomic elements and you can easily have so much control over your larger,

108
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,710
more complex components.

109
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,640
And that's an easy way to use atomic elements within figma.
