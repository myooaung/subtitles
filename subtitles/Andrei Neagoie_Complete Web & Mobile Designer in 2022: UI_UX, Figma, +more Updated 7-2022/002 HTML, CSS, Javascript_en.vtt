00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.090
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.040
In the last section, we talked about the World Wide Web and the Internet and what the differences were.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.490
And then I promise you that we will finally talk about some HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.950
So I've been vaguely referencing these files and just told you that there are simple text files for

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.220
now.

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.830
But what are they specifically?

7
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.750
Well, initially, if you remember.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.820
We had Tim Berners-Lee, who created the very first website, and this website uses HTML and HTML.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.510
That's the first file over here is a way for us to just write text on website.

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.630
And these text on websites can also have these things called hyperlinks that can link to other parts

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.410
of the website.

12
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.350
So that's what happened in 1991, 1991.

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.270
We had a way for us to share documents and this can link to another website, another file, another

14
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.220
research paper.

15
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.960
But as you can see, it wasn't the prettiest.

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:11.290
So in 1995, 1996, two technologies came into being one was CSIS and one is JavaScript.

17
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.450
Now, what did they allow you to do?

18
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.140
Well, CSIS solved the problem of, well, this is nice and all, but wouldn't it be nice if we had

19
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.540
some visual aspects we can toy around with this website and make it look pretty?

20
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.950
And then JavaScript said, Well, ideally we'll be able to have something like this website where I

21
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.240
can click over here.

22
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.130
I can shop now I can.

23
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.190
Put in my credit card and get these fancy slippers, and I can do all this interactive things with my

24
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.910
website.

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.880
So let's play around with this and try and incorporate from this basic HTML file to add some CSS and

26
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.200
JavaScript to this page.

27
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
The way we're going to do that is we're going to go into view.

28
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.680
Developer and developer tools.

29
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.880
You might remember this from our previous lessons.

30
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.930
So once you click on that, you'll get this pop up at the bottom of the screen for some of you might

31
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.150
be on the right side, but it doesn't matter.

32
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.500
You'll get both things.

33
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.390
And we've seen this before.

34
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.440
And if you look at the top over here, it says HTML and that's it.

35
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.420
HTML is this it's this file that has this weird syntax that describes how this web page should look

36
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.840
in text.

37
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.180
So you can see over here it says, the World Wide Web.

38
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.610
These are just text on the right side.

39
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.880
Over here, you'll see something called Styles.

40
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.940
So Styles will actually let you add styles to the website, as the name suggests.

41
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.290
And that's what CSS is.

42
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.970
If we click on HTML here and actually let's click on body without knowing any CSS or anything.

43
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.110
If we define something like color.

44
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.090
Semicolon.

45
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.160
And then let's go, blue.

46
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.250
It changes the text color to blue.

47
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.000
Chrome lets you play around with websites and actually inject some CSS into this HTML.

48
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.300
Without knowing any CSS, we can kind of play around type in a letter and it will have a dropdown.

49
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.280
So let's see over here if we can do background color, let's make it.

50
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.870
I'm going to press tab.

51
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.680
I'm going to do red, make the website really, really well, frankly, pretty ugly, but that's CSS

52
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.100
right here.

53
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.700
We've just added some CSS to this basic website.

54
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.390
Let's turn this red color off because it is not pretty.

55
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.930
So HTML texts and links CSS pretty colors.

56
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.210
Now how can we add some JavaScript?

57
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.510
So remember we have three files over here.

58
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.690
JavaScript came along and said These are great.

59
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.800
We have these beautiful text websites that link to other pages and we have CSS that can make websites

60
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.730
really, really pretty.

61
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.220
But would it be nice to have some interactivity, to have dropdown menus, to make websites like they

62
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.540
are now interactive?

63
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.770
We can actually do this again with the developer tools.

64
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.670
If you click on console over here without knowing any bit of JavaScript.

65
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:26.020
For now, we're just going to show you a simple JavaScript line and we're going to type in alert and

66
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.330
let's say Hi there.

67
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.770
Exclamation marks.

68
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.500
And I press enter.

69
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.020
And look at that.

70
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.680
We just made the very first website ever made interactive with JavaScript.

71
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.920
Now, obviously this doesn't do anything, but hopefully this shows you where we were before.

72
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.060
In 1991 to where we are now.

73
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.670
Websites that are interactive.

74
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.570
Full of JavaScript, CSS and of course, HTML.

75
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.460
See in the next one.

76
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.020
Bye bye.
