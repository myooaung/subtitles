00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.100
So typically what we did was we started a project and we jumped right into just kind of sketching,

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.100
you know, wire framing, user flows.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.240
But typically what you want to do is before you start a project, you want to understand why you are

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.200
starting a project.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.360
You want to understand basically what the problem is and why we should solution for it.

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.810
So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to bring you through a different type of way to start a project,

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.900
and that is what I call a product alignment canvas.

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.640
Now, that may sound a little scary or intimidating, but trust me, it isn't.

9
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.360
It's just about asking some basic questions about why we should be doing something and also learning

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.470
a bit about our assumptions around our users and other things.

11
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.240
So let's get started.

12
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.100
Essentially what we want to do is we want to get everyone in the same room who is involved in the project.

13
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.180
That can mean the product team, clients, stakeholders, users.

14
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.209
Now the product team probably consists of yourself, maybe other designers, developers, product managers,

15
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.110
QA.

16
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.440
The client usually has like maybe one person.

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.800
It may be 50 people, there may be a CEO, there's so many people.

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.940
But the people who really determine the success of the project should be in this meeting.

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.430
Now you could have users in this meeting.

20
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.750
Users could be like existing or potential users, but generally they aren't.

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.560
And you don't have the timeline to probably get a user in a meeting like this.

22
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.970
So you would need to make a lot of assumptions and we'll get to how to validate those after.

23
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.360
Now all these people are going to contribute to the success of the project.

24
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.250
So much information and expertise is what they hold now.

25
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.410
There's a sense of proper opinion on the subject matter that you're going to have to basically pull

26
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.250
out of these people.

27
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.840
So you really want to practice your facilitation skills because what we're going to be doing is we're

28
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.220
going to be asking a lot of questions.

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.420
They're going to be brainstorming.

30
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.550
And as you can see, I kind of have this template here.

31
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.310
And what I've done is there's a plug in.

32
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.510
Right here called product planning.

33
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.620
Now.

34
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.120
Let's wait for that to open.

35
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.720
But what product planner does is it gives us a bunch of different templates on different things.

36
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.200
Like we have a brainstorming template, basically product and planning or management and planning templates.

37
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.600
So here are a couple of there's assumption grids, there's road maps, Kanban boards.

38
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.660
If you're familiar with Agile, we have a Gan chart, retrospective documents.

39
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.720
So there's a bunch of different things that you can use.

40
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.380
We even have a persona template, so I've just kind of taken them from here.

41
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.230
What I would do is because they're all in like vector format, you can't really change the copy here.

42
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.940
As you can see, I would take these templates and make them your own so that way you can reuse them

43
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.690
over time.

44
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.170
So let's jump right in.

45
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.480
Now, there's several different parts of a product alignment canvas.

46
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.650
The goal is to explore, understand and to move forward.

47
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.060
What we want to do is we want to get to the bottom of the requirements and what we need to do for our

48
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.750
project.

49
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.370
Now we need to understand what success will look like in all different aspects, whether that's the

50
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.400
business aspect, whether that's based off of users, and that's why we're coming together to brainstorm

51
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.880
here.

52
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.360
Now, at the beginning of any project, you generally know very little.

53
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.100
You know, who are the users?

54
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.920
Why do they want this?

55
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.520
What are we solving for?

56
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.310
And you generally don't have much time to get up and running.

57
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.130
We often need to literally hit the ground running.

58
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.420
So what we're going to need is you can either use Figma I've done this remotely, either do this in

59
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.220
person, which is probably best.

60
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.020
But generally you would need a white board.

61
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.600
You would need the most important people in the room, some post-it notes, markers.

62
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.250
It would be great to have a note taker there to help you.

63
00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.800
And one thing that's incredibly important is to have somewhere where you can jot down all your risky

64
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.660
assumptions.

65
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.740
So this little resource that I pulled from that plugin is really great.

66
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.190
Generally I'll just list them and then we can rank them after we're done the canvas.

67
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.910
But this actually plots them on some sort of graph here where we can delegate if they're risky.

68
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.970
How much of an assumption they are high and low risk are on the vertical axis and then on horizontal

69
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.150
axis we have the uncertain and certain.

70
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.160
So how much of an assumption this is?

71
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.590
So this could be anywhere like we don't know what the architecture of the app is going to be.

72
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.970
We have a good understanding, but this is high risk and we need to figure this out ASAP so that would

73
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.770
be placed there or we don't know who our users are, but we're going to make a bunch of assumptions

74
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.610
about them.

75
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.020
That's a very high risk card and you would feel pretty uncertain.

76
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.390
So that's something you would prioritize first.

77
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.580
And what we do next is we focus on the project goals, target users and a user journey.

78
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.090
In our next video, we're going to be talking about project goals.
