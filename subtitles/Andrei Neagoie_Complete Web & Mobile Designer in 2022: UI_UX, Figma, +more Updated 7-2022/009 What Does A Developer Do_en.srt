1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,160
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,590
In this final video, I want to show you what this course is all about, what we're learning in this

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,560
course and what we're going to be able to do at the end.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,510
You may have heard the term full stack developer, front end developer, back end developer.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:20,780
And looking at this diagram, you're starting to recognize that HTML, CSS, JavaScript you see react

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,080
in there.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,800
We'll get to that.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,760
Don't worry about it.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,980
But that's what a front end developer does.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:32,180
The front end developer is the person who makes sure that when we open up the browser and go to Google.com,

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:39,650
that we see Google, we see it nice and pretty laid out beautifully, has a search bar and essentially

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:46,670
anything that a user sees the front end developer does, and that is using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,440
React and a few other tools.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,580
The back end developer, that's the person that works with the server.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:59,360
Make sure that when a browser speaks to it, it serves up those files and it uses technology such as

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,270
Node.js, Express JS, which we're going to get into.

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,360
And then that server is going to talk also to a database.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,980
Again, we haven't really discussed that too much, but don't worry, there is going to be a section

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,140
on it and that's going to use PostgreSQL and we're actually going to be learning that as well.

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:22,190
So we want to build you up as a full stack developer to be able to work with all these technologies

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,930
so that everything revolving around a web application you're able to build.

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,070
So get excited.

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,630
You're going to learn all of this.

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,390
It looks overwhelming, but trust me, just like this, how the Internet Works section, it's all going

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,200
to make sense.

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,030
So I'll see you at the next one.

27
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,660
Bye bye.
