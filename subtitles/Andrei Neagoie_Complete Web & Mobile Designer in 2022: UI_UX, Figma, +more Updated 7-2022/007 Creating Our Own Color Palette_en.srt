1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,680
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,380
So we're going to be creating a very own color palette for our client, habitual.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,930
As you can see here, we have only one color to work with.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,770
They have no color palette whatsoever.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,290
And we're going to have some fun coming up with some concepts.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,430
Now, sometimes if you're working with a brand new product, you may need to understand the reasoning

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,250
and the personality of that brand, kind of like what we did with like typography and other things like

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,710
that.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,010
Working with a fresh brand will give you a lot of freedom to choose and play with colors, which isn't

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,670
necessarily the case with products that have defined color systems.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,500
Step one, let's take a look at what we have over here with this brand.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,360
This brand seems very friendly and approachable.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,630
We have to also think about the use case to.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,660
We have a lot of products on this mobile app and the colors shouldn't necessarily detract from all of

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:50,930
that.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,740
So we need to kind of be a little subtle with our color palette choice.

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,990
We may stick to only using several colors throughout the app and having a couple of accents.

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,150
So I'm always thinking about that kind of stuff before I even start choosing colors.

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,630
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a frame.

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm just going to name it colors.

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm going to have a circle over here.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,600
It seems like we have a yellow.

23
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,490
We have, like a very dark.

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,620
Dark gray and we'll have a white for sure.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,090
So this is what our color palette currently looks like.

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,830
It's OC.

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,910
It's definitely fine, but we run into the same problem that we had before.

28
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:50,890
We don't have enough variety here, especially to actually start creating UI in terms of visual design.

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,440
So what I like to do is I'm going to start thinking about how we can expand this in terms of color schemes.

30
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,340
You know, let's start exploring a bit in terms of colours, our colour choices.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,759
So I know that I'm eventually going to create variations of this yellow.

32
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,130
So we have that for our UI.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
But I'm trying to think of maybe different colors that we may use.

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,170
And I know one color that really goes well with yellow, solid green.

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,200
It's okay.

36
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,960
I mean, that's a very vibrant green.

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,670
I'm not a big fan of green and yellow palettes, but I mean, if we just slide this over just a touch,

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,170
then we start saying.

39
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,190
More harmony.

40
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,050
Let's think about adding maybe like a teal.

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,360
Hm hmm.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,790
Teal is a hard color to kind of get right, I find.

43
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,560
I think that's actually really nice.

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,040
And if we think about maybe like a split complementary palette, Red would definitely work.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,020
So if red was the main color, let's just pick a red first and I'll show you what I mean.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,650
Okay.

47
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,750
So we can see what we're doing, maybe.

48
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,490
That looks pretty good.

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,410
So this is a split complementary palette.

50
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,920
And essentially that means that red would be the I mean, it could be a primary color, it could be

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,430
the accent.

52
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,610
But the complementary of red is green because it's on the opposite side of the color wheel.

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,080
On both sides of green, though, are blue and then yellow.

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,720
So it is a split complementary palette.

55
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,210
Now, I think these colors are pretty cool.

56
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,460
I don't mind them.

57
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,770
I think primarily what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this yellow as my main color.

58
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,240
I think we can kind of.

59
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,160
At this little bit, she tells Tough.

60
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,760
It's tough because it's not really accessible ever unless you go really dark red.

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,090
Reds could be harsh, but I think they just really look nice together.

62
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,300
So what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to start thinking about.

63
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,490
Some options for each of these colors, but.

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,340
What I typically do is.

65
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,400
I like to just use maybe one or two colors throughout, like a mobile or even a website.

66
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,810
I mean, it really depends on the use case, but I like to keep things really simple just because if

67
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:43,050
you start having too many colors, then you run into a lot of issues in terms of it being really messy

68
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,800
and cluttered.

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,990
So you want to avoid that at all costs.

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,190
What I plan to do here is I plan to make these my primary colors and whatever variations come from these.

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,140
And this would be a palette that I could use as an accent palette.

72
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,290
So I'll show you how I'm going to break this up.

73
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:10,130
So what I like to do is if I'm thinking about creating something that is really, really scalable,

74
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:19,700
so I'm going to create like a 75% version of this, then I'll create 50% version of this and then like

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,920
a 25% version of this.

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,920
So I have enough options.

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,250
If I really do need that, I don't think I will.

78
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,900
But it's good to kind of, especially in the beginning stages, start thinking about how you are going

79
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,980
to use that palette.

80
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,020
So what size are these?

81
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,710
These are 38 by 38.

82
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,490
Let's just do that.

83
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,850
So, yeah, I'm going to just do this for all my acts and colors.

84
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,870
So this one is going to be 75.

85
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,910
This one's going to be 50 and this one's going to be 25.

86
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,700
And we can start seeing that, hey, like, och, you know, I may be able to use this on a background

87
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,660
possibly.

88
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,250
That really is nice.

89
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,310
You know, I may be able to use this read for like error states.

90
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,380
So keep your mind open.

91
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,230
Don't necessarily limit yourself to, like, one color choice or like one palette choice.

92
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,900
Start thinking about all the different variations, maybe accents that you can use.

93
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,760
We can even do this for our grays.

94
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,070
Okay.

95
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,570
What do we have here?

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,850
We can do 75.

97
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,110
You can do 50.

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,990
You couldn't even do 25.

99
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,940
So it's starting to build.

100
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,350
I think these grays may be a little too cool.

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,600
So what I will do is let's move this white.

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,920
I'll probably copy these.

103
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,540
And this will be the original.

104
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,950
We'll just keep this over here.

105
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,160
I like to kind of keep with this palette.

106
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,170
I mean, this is really cold in terms of the gray scale.

107
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,700
And I think I'm going to just tend to the gray with a little bit.

108
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,800
As you can tell, it's part of the blue.

109
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,400
So when it tinted with.

110
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,830
My yellow.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,200
Kind of like what we did when we were expanding a color palette.

112
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,980
So I'm going to tint that with yellow.

113
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,290
I'm going to expand on this.

114
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,360
Just a bit.

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,610
So I may not actually go down like by removing like 75%, 50%.

116
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,930
I mean, we can do that.

117
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,670
Let's see what that looks like.

118
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,800
75.

119
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,520
So it is much warmer.

120
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,380
50.

121
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,410
25.

122
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,130
But I'm not sure if I am totally happy with.

123
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,590
Just yet.

124
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,250
If you really think about the amount of grays you have.

125
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,400
Just because.

126
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,510
You don't want to get stuck.

127
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:21,960
With a bunch of different greys because they'll be tough to work with and it could really muddy your

128
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,130
experience.

129
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,800
So as you can tell, these are much more warmer.

130
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,430
It's kind of bordering on that.

131
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,580
Brown a little bit, but not too much.

132
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,090
I actually like this a lot better than this because I think it suits this whole palette a little bit

133
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,530
more.

134
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,520
But we can keep this to the side for now.

135
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,580
Okay, perfect.

136
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,990
So this is going to be our grades.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,040
What I also like to think about is I like to think about like UI elements as well.

138
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,950
So if I'm thinking about like reds.

139
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,200
So this could be like kind of like an air.

140
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,900
I think this may be a little too light for like a success state if we need one, so we can actually

141
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,130
pick a green.

142
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,410
And this can definitely deviate from your original palette because we are building an interface.

143
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,400
And if you're using like yellow for success, I mean, that's kind of confusing.

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,770
We should really stick to the colors that we know.

145
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,620
So here we go.

146
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,590
We have a green.

147
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,130
I mean, it doesn't need to be perfect.

148
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,940
So this can be like our success color and our air colors.

149
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,690
These could be used as our accents.

150
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,580
And another thing I'd like to do is I like to kind of experiment with some gradients.

151
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,150
So like, if I choose like a yellow and white.

152
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,550
Let's just bump up that opacity.

153
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,620
Like, you know, using gradients as a background could really be nice.

154
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,940
Same with.

155
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,480
If we change that yellow.

156
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,040
Here with like a blue.

157
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,150
That's really nice.

158
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,930
And I think, like, we could probably use that as a background for something.

159
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,270
I'm not sure what just yet, but it definitely can be used for something.

160
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,270
Try your best to kind of expand on this.

161
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,980
And, you know, have fun with it.

162
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,500
I mean, you don't need to use the colors that I'm using.

163
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,690
I may not even use all these colors, to be honest.

164
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,160
I just explore it.

165
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,810
I may actually cut this color.

166
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,890
From it and just kind of stick with these greys and these yellows, maybe some blues as well.

167
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,480
I'm obviously going to keep like a red and a green for like a success in our state.

168
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,680
I may actually incorporate some gradients if I need them as well.

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:49,100
So I'm going to continue working on this gray portion and trying to nail the color palette here, but

170
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,230
go in, take a look at the logo, pull the colors from the logo and start building off of it.

171
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,330
There's so many ways you can go with this.

172
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,060
Like you can go the monochromatic scheme if you want.

173
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,360
If you feel like that's enough, it probably could be enough.

174
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,460
Depends how you lay out your designs.

175
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,340
You can even actually go the route that I went like and try to create like a split complementary palette.

176
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,290
That's also pretty fun as well.

177
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,690
Take a look at the color schemes that we went over originally, see what you think suits the brand and

178
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,200
start choosing colors based off of that scheme and experiment.

179
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,190
You can even just try all of them and see if you have some luck there and see what you like.

180
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,140
So that's how you start creating a color palette just based off of brand colors.
