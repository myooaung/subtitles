1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,400
Now that we have our navigation, let's focus on our cover.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,420
If we go back to our HTML page.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,930
We have our cover diff here and we can just keep the diff here as it is because we won't really know

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,640
what the cover will be just yet.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,840
But I want to add a new CSS class called container here.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:29,120
And this container is going to define some properties for us that will make this truly a cover image,

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,410
just like we have in our solution web page over here.

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,300
And let's add those exclamation marks because we're excited.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,800
Not for context.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,690
For the cover.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,210
Let's add the exclamation marks over here.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,870
Nice.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,330
All right, we'll go to our style dot CSIS.

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,840
And we'll add on our.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,710
Cover style now.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,410
This is actually going to be fairly easy.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,970
We want to have.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,640
Let's say display of flex or first of all, let's make sure that we have the container class.

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,290
And we'll have a display of flex.

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,760
And I'm not using grit here because, well, we're not going to have any grit items.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,440
We won't have that many items in a cover.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,960
It's usually a button or a background image or some text and display.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,110
Flex just makes things nice and simple, and usually we want things in the cover to be centered.

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,930
That is, we want this cover to be right in the center, and as we make things smaller, it's always

26
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,430
going to be in the center.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:47,080
That's something that we see a lot of and a lot of websites, and to do that, especially with Flexbox,

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,090
is really easy.

29
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,770
All we need to say is to align items center and to justify content.

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,920
Just like that if I save here and refresh.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,320
All right, this is centered.

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,210
And as I move things perfect, everything is absolutely centered.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,330
But obviously cover image should be a little bit larger.

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:13,690
Right.

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,920
What do we do here?

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,820
And I want to introduce to you something that you haven't seen before, but don't get scared.

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,780
It's not that hard.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,030
I'm going to have height.

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,490
And just to start us off, I'm going to show you, usually you might do something like 500 pixels and

40
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,960
if I refresh, awesome, I have a nice little height.

41
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,820
But there's a problem here, right?

42
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,320
Because I'm saying 500 pixel here.

43
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,890
If the viewport if I move things around, if I lift things up, you'll see that.

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,600
All right.

45
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:56,010
The view is not responsive when I go up because it's always 500 pixels and this might not be the worst

46
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,560
idea ever.

47
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,650
Maybe you want your website to be like that.

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:06,960
But if you do want this to be responsive in terms of going up and down as well, what we can do is use

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,610
something called v h.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,620
That is the viewport height.

51
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,080
And I like using viewport height.

52
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,920
A new unit that we haven't seen before for making things responsive when it comes to height and what

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,880
this states.

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,560
It's going to look at the viewport that is the view of the web page and make sure that there's always

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,220
a percentage of that viewport dedicated to this container.

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:47,390
So if I do 50 v h and if I refresh here, you'll see that my cover will be 50% of our viewport.

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,190
If I do 100.

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,520
And I refresh.

59
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,620
You see that?

60
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,350
The cover fills up the entire viewport.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:08,710
The cool part is if I go up and down, this adjusts exactly according to the viewport height.

62
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,540
That is the window of the browser.

63
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,300
Very cool.

64
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,600
Right.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,340
And everything is still centered.

66
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,450
So I like using the VA for something like a container.

67
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,170
So let's keep it at 50.

68
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,640
And if I refresh.

69
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,450
Look at that.

70
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,780
Nice and responsive.

71
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,870
How cool is that?

72
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,930
And that's it for the cover.

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,280
Not that hard, right?

74
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,450
Let's move on to the project grid in the next video.

75
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,500
Bye bye.
