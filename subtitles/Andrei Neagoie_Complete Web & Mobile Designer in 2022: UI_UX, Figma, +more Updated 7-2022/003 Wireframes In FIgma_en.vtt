00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.740
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.960
So where we left off, we were ready to create our very own wireframes.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
And that is exactly what we're going to do.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, wireframes are very dependent on just like the type of content you have, whether that be like

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.600
what you've decided within your site map and your user flows and even your sketches.

6
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.290
So I have some sketches here and I have my user flows.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.660
I have a site map we created and I'm going to start building it a couple of pages.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.050
But before I get into that, I really want to talk about my workflow when I'm designing wireframes.

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.450
So let's jump right in.

10
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.490
So when I'm designing wireframes, I usually start like with sketches.

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.470
I go to user flows to kind of like flesh them out a bit.

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.760
Sometimes I'll do my user flows within sketches and then maybe go back into Figma like I showed you

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.360
before.

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.810
But when I'm really going into the details and getting into the details and thinking about like all

15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.150
the different types of content that is going to be on a page or for like an interaction, I'm really

16
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.590
focused on speeding up my workflow as much as possible, so I use wireframes for a bunch of different

17
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.010
reasons.

18
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.440
I use them to show to clients.

19
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.110
Mainly, I use them for myself when I'm creating prototypes so I can quickly get prototype out without

20
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.290
necessarily worrying about all the different types of like styles, that being like color, typography,

21
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.540
grids, all that kind of stuff that we gradually build our way up towards.

22
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.580
So I typically want to go and build like really quickly black and white grayscale, maybe some color

23
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.360
if I need to.

24
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.940
And the best way to do that within Figma is to like have some sort of component library or style guide.

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.930
Now there's a great resource that I have linked for this lesson, and it's going to really help you

26
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.760
just speed up your entire workflow.

27
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.820
And I'm just going to go through it quickly before we get into it.

28
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.770
I've just basically modified it a bit for myself, and what I have here is like it gives me a bunch

29
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.860
of navigation bars if I need them.

30
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.930
It has like containers, there's like tables.

31
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.090
I mean, you have everything you need.

32
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.260
Like these are a bunch of UI elements.

33
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.870
These are really great.

34
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.770
And like I said, it's, it's all about speeding up your workflow.

35
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.090
And this component library is amazing.

36
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.200
It really is.

37
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:43.800
I found that, like, using something like this, I could easily get through tons of wireframes without

38
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.650
getting bogged down by trying to create my own.

39
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.590
And essentially these components, you can just like drag and drop them into your, like, wireframes.

40
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.680
You can grab them from your assets panel, you'll see them here.

41
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.300
So if I want a UI element like a field, I can just like grab that dropdown.

42
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.660
Here it is so I can get dropdown with a label really easy.

43
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.170
And there you go.

44
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.250
It's already designed for you and you can just adjust the content to what you want.

45
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.740
So I definitely recommend using something like this.

46
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.890
I'll link the original into our resources so you can use it.

47
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.850
You can modify it the way you want.

48
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.420
I've taken out a couple of things that I don't necessarily like.

49
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.420
I've also kind of like added some icons if I need to, but this is really great.

50
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.680
I'll show you a little bit more.

51
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.820
So we have like a bunch of different icons and they're all categorized by like categories.

52
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.480
So like most use you have a count, you have badges, we even have some screen templates if you want

53
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.410
to use those.

54
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.530
I mean, like you don't necessarily need to use them.

55
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.240
You can just create like a frame that's the size of like a tablet or like a phone device.

56
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.670
And when you go to prototype, you can just select the device and it'll play within that.

57
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.280
But if you want that extra little bit, this even is good for like using it for like showing off your

58
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.540
designs if you want to.

59
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.010
What else do we have?

60
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.820
We have cursors.

61
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.010
If you want to illustrate something which is really great, like if you're trying to illustrate some

62
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.900
sort of interaction and you need a little bit of help explaining, that's great.

63
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.390
They also have like just a standard color palette.

64
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.170
So you'll see like the local styles here, right there.

65
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:30.900
So if you need them really awesome and easy to use and just some typography styles that give you a wide

66
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.380
variety.

67
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.630
So this is not like a design system or anything.

68
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.330
I mean, it's very generalized, it's very vague.

69
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.180
It's up to you to kind of put all these different elements together to create whatever you want.

70
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.170
So definitely I recommend using something like this just to speed up your workflow because it's going

71
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:57.630
to really help you get your product ideas like in Figma and ready to prototype without necessarily getting

72
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.910
bogged down by all the different types of.

73
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.860
States, different types of elements, possibly styles.

74
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.790
So this takes care of it for you and I definitely recommend it.

75
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.600
In the next video.

76
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.710
We're going to jump right in to creating a couple of pages within Figma.
