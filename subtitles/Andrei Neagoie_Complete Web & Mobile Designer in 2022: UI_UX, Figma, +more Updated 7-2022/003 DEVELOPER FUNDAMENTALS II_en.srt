1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,850
And welcome back to the second Web developer fundamental.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,540
Another very important aspect of being a web developer.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,160
And that is the fact that we have multiple web browsers.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,860
Now, if you remember, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, created it because we

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:28,170
needed a standard way to share documents amongst each other and through HTML, CSS and JavaScript were

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,240
able to read these files and actually have beautiful websites.

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,720
Now, when we send these files over.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:46,140
Each of these browsers read the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and lay out the web page for us.

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,280
But as you can see, each one of them is owned by a company and is a different browser.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,260
So that means they all have to agree on how they're going to read the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, because

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:09,240
if they don't all agree, then well, we need to create different files specific for each browser because

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,440
each one of them has a different idea of what HTML, CSS and JavaScript is.

13
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,320
And you know what?

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,650
When the World Wide Web got started, we had something called the browser wars where each browser was

15
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,800
kind of doing its own thing, implemented different things, and we still have that to this day.

16
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:34,400
To some extent, there is a governing body which kind of creates these standards now, but it is still

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,530
a pain point for developers where we need to figure out that whenever we send our files to the web browser,

18
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,290
it all looks the same.

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,380
And that is one of the biggest problems we have as developers.

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,760
And you'll see tools later on in this course that try to solve that issue.

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,920
But you'll always encounter this problem where we want to make sure that wherever your browser gets

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,350
rendered, anybody can see your website.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,340
And not only that, we also have mobile phones now that access the Internet.

24
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,419
We have iPads.

25
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:16,730
So now not only do we have to worry about different browsers and whether they agree on what code works

26
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,830
in each of these files, we also have to make sure that our websites look good on small screens, on

27
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,400
big screens, on all sorts of different screens.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,610
And that is a very important concept, something that when you get to become a web developer, you'll

29
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,550
encounter this problem where you have to test on each device, each browser to make sure everything

30
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,150
works.

31
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,970
And we'll use some tools that have developed over the years to solve these problems so that it's not

32
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,420
as much as a pain point as it is or as it was.

33
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,380
All right.

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,130
One more lesson to go and then we're going to get coding.

35
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,870
See on the other side.

36
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:54,830
Bye bye.
