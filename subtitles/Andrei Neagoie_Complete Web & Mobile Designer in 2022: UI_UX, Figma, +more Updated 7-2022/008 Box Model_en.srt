00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,500
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,830
In this video, I want to talk about the box model and CSIS.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,260
It's a very important concept and it's something that you might have been kind of curious in the back

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,130
of your head about.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,190
And that is this image right here.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,130
In CSIS, we have this idea of the box model, which has the content.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,920
It has the padding the border, which we've seen before and then the margin.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,840
So we're going to talk about that in this video.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,950
So we have our Not so pretty website right now, but I have left intentionally our login page still

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,650
kind of blank and you see that there's no styles applied to it because if we go to the login page,

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,270
I'm going to drag it over here.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,190
It's referencing style too, which doesn't have much styles happening.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,750
To really emphasize this point.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:59,550
I want to to just instead of the lorem ipsum, I'm going to create a div if I give this a class of.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:09,760
Box model, I can go into my style to which I'm going to drag over here and I can say Box model.

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,080
Border.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,810
Five pixels solid red.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,440
I save this and refresh.

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:18,270
Okay.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,800
So we have our box model.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,200
Let's add something into this div.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,700
We have a.

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,090
And right now it's covering the entire space.

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,310
But if we add three more.

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,840
Divs.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,580
We'll call this one B.

27
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:36,830
The next one.

28
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,140
See, I save and refresh.

29
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:48,440
We have these and if we wanted them all in one line, then you might remember that that was display

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,790
and line block and I save refresh.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,850
There we have it.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,450
Okay.

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,190
Let's talk about the box model here.

34
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,390
Let's say we wanted more space inside of these for the letters.

35
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,270
Well, in that case, we can use something like padding.

36
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,360
So padding I can put 20 pixels.

37
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,789
Save and refresh.

38
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,650
And there's our padding.

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,380
But let's say we want a different padding so that the sides are wider than the top.

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:27,320
In that case, we can do something like five pixels of the top 20 pixels on the right side, five pixels

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,040
at the bottom and 20 pixels to the left.

42
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,240
I refresh.

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,460
And look at that.

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,340
And that's just a standard that you'll have to get used to.

45
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,330
It's top right, bottom left.

46
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,210
You can also actually do padding, as you can see in the dropdown bottom left, top right to specify.

47
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,250
But this is a quicker way of doing it.

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,490
If we remember there was one more and that was margin.

49
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,280
So margin allows us to create space outside of the border.

50
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,330
So if I go 20 pixels here and I save refresh.

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,730
You can see that we created 20 pixels on the left side and right side, but also the top and the bottom.

52
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,230
Let's say we only want spaces between the boxes, but not at the top and bottom.

53
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,390
Well, same principle again.

54
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,930
We can do zero pixels, 20 pixels.

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,190
Zero pixels and 20 pixels.

56
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,570
So top right, bottom left, save and refresh.

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,020
There you go.

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,440
Now, this might get tedious.

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,420
There is one other shorthand way, and that is you can remove this.

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,550
So this means top and bottom.

61
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,350
This means left and right.

62
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,030
I say this and refresh.

63
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,070
Now, things should change and it doesn't.

64
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,650
And we can do the same at the top here as well.

65
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,580
Perfect.

66
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:00,330
One last thing I want to show you is that if we open up our developer tools, so again, we do inspect.

67
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,770
You'll see in our styles that we have our box model.

68
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,100
So if you see over here, we have our content.

69
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,050
We have our padding.

70
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,680
And it says 20 pixels, five pixels, five pixels.

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,450
We have our border.

72
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,880
Five pixels, five pixels, five pixel, five pixels, and then our margin zero with 20 on the side.

73
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:31,290
So again, Chrome allows you to browse around and make sure that all of these are properly done.

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,160
The last thing you might ask is, what about this content?

75
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,350
How can I change this?

76
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,860
And that's very simple.

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:47,520
You can do something like width, let's do 33 pixels, save and refresh and also do height.

78
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,430
Do 55 pixels, save and refresh.

79
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:00,640
And you'll see over here that in our box model, we now have the content with 33 pixels by 55 pixels.

80
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,510
All right.

81
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,590
That's it for now.

82
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,670
See you in the next one.

83
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,330
Bye bye.
