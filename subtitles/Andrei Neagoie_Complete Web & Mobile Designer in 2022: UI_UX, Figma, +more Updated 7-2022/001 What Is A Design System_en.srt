1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,600
Everyone.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,540
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,280
So I know I've spent a lot of time talking about components, styles and all those different types of

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,740
features that Figma offers, but they play a much larger, important role when we're thinking about

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,050
design systems.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,790
And I want to just talk briefly about what is a design system and why do we use one.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,750
So a lot of people give a different name to design systems.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,040
A lot of people like to call them UI toolkits.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,090
And, you know, that's OC.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,160
I mean, that's what they kind of are.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,970
A design system is more so involving your larger and broader team.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,680
You know, your development team is helping making those changes and implementing those systems that

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,730
you've created.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,810
So what I want to show you is how I use a design system within Figma and why it's important.

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,580
So this is a design system I've created for our client called Habitual.

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:59,190
Now I separated it into if we look over to the left here, I've separated into three different sections.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,210
Now, this isn't a full entire design system.

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,730
There's much more you could possibly even add to this.

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,590
But this is enough to definitely get you started and definitely get you creating a bunch of different

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,340
pages.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,230
Now, what I've done here is there is this section called the Foundation, which houses all the styles

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,230
that we're going to use throughout the application, including certain components which I'll get into.

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,510
We have the component section.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,500
Think of the component section, like a section of like atoms.

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,450
And when you build up atoms, they create larger components.

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,220
This section, which I call recipes now, the difference between all these different things is components

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,880
we'll use of the foundation, and recipes will be more complex components that use a bunch more components

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,780
together.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,190
It may be a bunch of like cards together, it may be a bunch of like checkboxes.

30
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,690
That's what I would call a recipe.

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,270
And they also use things from the foundation to bring this all together.

32
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,940
So let's get right into it.

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,570
I'm going to show you some examples of foundation and components and recipes.

34
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,040
In later videos, we'll go into how to create individual pieces for this design system.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,900
So your foundation will host things like colors, and these are your main styles.

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,380
So these are the colors for the application.

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,590
You can see that I've broken them into different sections and if we go down to the right we'll see all

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,610
our local styles.

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,200
And these are color styles.

40
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,730
Let's get into actually typography.

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,330
We have typography and remember how we were creating that type system.

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,880
This is just more fully fledged.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,410
We have different headings.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,540
You can see here we have different text options.

45
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,710
So body large, small, regular labels hints which are displayed over here on the right.

46
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,260
And these are all different styles.

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,540
I have icons 24 pixel and 16 pixel variants.

48
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,400
I have grids.

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,490
Let's turn those on so you can see the different types of grids I'm using.

50
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:12,450
Mostly these are just for the entire mobile screen and all these are used just so we can actually start

51
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,740
building components as well.

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,250
So if I go over to the component section, I have avatars and different versions of avatars.

53
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,370
You'll see that there is a base layer here and I'll get into that later.

54
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,580
There's different types of buttons that we will be using.

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,500
There's cards over here.

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,480
Different types of cards that we have.

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,810
CheckBoxes.

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,450
So as you can tell, there's so many different types of components that we're making and reusing even

59
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,740
in our recipe section.

60
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,510
If we take a look at something like CART, we have different types of cart lists, we have different

61
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,130
types of footers.

62
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,860
So these types of things are definitely ways to implement your recipes.

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,220
So in our next video, we're going to go over how to work with different types of elements in the foundation

64
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,600
of your design system.
