Good afternoon to you.

2
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.040
Not just Andre.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.480
This is a fun little video.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.290
I like to throw some of these every once in a while because I know it can get very exhausting when you

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.280
have a lot of information thrown at you.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.670
So I want us to copy a website really, really fast.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.320
Let's look at how we can do that.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.560
One of my favorite websites is Wait, but why?

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.940
Well, all caps.

10
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.790
I don't know why I did that, but it's just still work.

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.500
If you haven't checked out this website and highly recommended some great, great articles on here,

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.570
but let's say I look at this website and I'm like, Hmm, this is really, really cool.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.170
I wish I could play around with it.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.140
Well, before I showed you view developer and developer tools and we had a nice little pop up at the

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.100
bottom of the screen.

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.760
This time I want to show you.

17
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.150
View source when you click on that.

18
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.110
Oh boy, you get a whole bunch of stuff.

19
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.570
But if you look at the top over here, you see that?

20
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.370
It's dog type HTML is just simple HTML and this might look really, really overwhelming.

21
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.210
Don't worry, this will make sense to you at the end.

22
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.420
But you can see over here that they're commenting this out.

23
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.330
There is the HTML tag and if you scroll down, there's a whole lot of stuff.

24
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.490
But simply by copying all this so I can just select all and copy this and if I open up sublime.

25
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.380
There you go.

26
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.020
And let's just open up a new file over here and paste this.

27
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.340
That's a lot of stuff.

28
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.110
I'm going to save.

29
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.670
What save as and we'll call it.

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.120
Wait.

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.180
But why HTML?

32
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.160
All right, save it.

33
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.640
And now if I go to my desktop.

34
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.180
And I have wait by HTML.

35
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.420
If I drag it into my google chrome.

36
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.780
Look at that.

37
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.630
I have a weight by y all to myself and I can play around with it and break it and do whatever I want.

38
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.250
I can even see what the use to create these little post finger dinghies, but a really, really fun

39
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.240
way to play around with websites.

40
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.530
Hope.

41
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.460
That was interesting.

42
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.800
See you the next one.

43
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.320
Bye bye.
