00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.839
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.080
Now, this course has two paths for you to take, depending on your situation.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.430
So what are these two paths?

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.360
Well, one is to just follow along.

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:21.340
We're going to show you step by step how to go from start to finish, from sketching to having ideas

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:29.950
to final full fledged interactions, animations and final designs for the product.

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.480
If you want, you can follow along, customize however you want, so that by the end you have an entire

8
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:45.040
design system that you can use on future projects, as well as a product that you can put on your portfolio.

9
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.580
And while your employer's the other path that you can take with this course is that you already have

10
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.460
a client or you have a product that you want to create, maybe you're an entrepreneur.

11
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.410
The way this course is structured is that we show you the exact steps a designer would take from the

12
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.330
very beginning to the end.

13
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.870
So by following along the step, you can actually implement your own design systems, your own designs,

14
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.160
your own product.

15
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.250
If you already have something, we want you to create this course so that in the future, when you get

16
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.820
different clients, you can keep coming back to these sections and follow the steps all along so that

17
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.650
you have a professional, full fledged system that takes you from zero all the way to mastery to wowing

18
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.670
your clients.

19
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.670
So decide on these two paths whether you want to just follow along and customize the product that we're

20
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.450
going to build.

21
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.140
Or you already have something that you wanted to work on and follow along the steps and create your

22
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.890
own product.

23
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.800
I'm excited to see what you end up with at the end of the course.

24
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.760
Let's get started.
