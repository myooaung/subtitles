00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.790
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:07.880
So in our last video, I went over just a couple of really rough prototypes and just showcasing how

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.450
smart, animate can work in a couple of different scenarios, both with matching layers and using separate

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.450
animations or just using smart animate all together.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.100
So I want to just showcase how I've built this little application, and maybe I'll give you some inspiration

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.450
for our project.

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.950
I mean, you'll get these files.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.400
And what I would do is the files that you've started to create and I just like visually explore with

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.790
in terms of like the high fidelity designs we're creating for habitual.

10
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.880
Go ahead and put those together and start making interactions.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.660
Start thinking about like different screen transitions and stuff like that.

12
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.040
I'm sure you're going to have a lot of fun with this kind of stuff because it really brings your prototypes

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.760
to life.

14
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.050
So let's jump right in.

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.440
So I have a couple of similar screens here.

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.070
I have this kind of primary naff.

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.920
Let's actually just jump out of the prototyping of view.

18
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.080
I have this kind of secondary nav up here and you can see there's portrait, there's nature, there's

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.920
architecture, and I've created different screens for that.

20
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.300
So I have nature over here.

21
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.370
I have architecture and this is the architecture screen, this is the nature screen.

22
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.300
So this is just an app for photos that I just put together really, really quickly.

23
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.790
And what's going to happen here is when I swipe through here, there's going to be a little animation

24
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.380
that happens there, but also the content's going to change in a really nice way.

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.510
Let's go over here.

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.530
So let's click our prototype tab.

27
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.620
And what I have selected here is I just have a smart animation, so we're not changing anything in the

28
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.440
screen like we're not having any screen transitions.

29
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.990
When I am having though is I'm making sure that when I click this button.

30
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.530
Ah, this, this text, it's going to slide over.

31
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.170
So it's going to capture that movement and it's going to capture the fill.

32
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.110
So it's going to turn to a dark block.

33
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.560
I mean, I think you get darker than black, but it's going to turn into a black.

34
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.040
And the images, they're all going to stay in the same place.

35
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.140
But we're going to change the feel of the images.

36
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.150
So we're going to have a nice transition with that.

37
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.940
And that's the same thing with architecture as well.

38
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.990
So we're going to have that nice little animation that's going to happen up here and it's going to have

39
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.570
just the feedback for the fill.

40
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.220
I just thought of the pictures over here.

41
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.570
They're going to change the architecture.

42
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.090
So that is one of the main interactions that we prototype over here.

43
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.340
And let's go take a look at what that looks like.

44
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.190
Let's just select our device.

45
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.770
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to scale to fit so we can see everything.

46
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.630
So we get the nice movement.

47
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.980
We get the nice fill.

48
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.660
Beautiful.

49
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.360
So if we just click that, I've set it.

50
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.950
So if I just click, I go back.

51
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.030
If we really wanted to kind of animate it to the best possible thing that we can, we would just use

52
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.290
like a drag.

53
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.180
We could do that as well and just kind of like hijack that horizontal scroll.

54
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.870
So that way nature just stops over there on the next screen.

55
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.070
So that's another possibility, but it's just nice and subtle.

56
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.440
Users get the feedback they need for each transition, and there's good, good animation over here in

57
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.260
terms of just the duration of the fill.

58
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.880
So I really like that.

59
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.360
I'm going to show you another.

60
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.190
Interaction.

61
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.770
So what we have here as well is when a user clicks on an image, I don't just want that to be instantaneous.

62
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.980
I want to smart animate right to that image.

63
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.710
So I want it to kind of take up the whole screen.

64
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.740
All the other layers will just be removed.

65
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.600
These will be new layers.

66
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.040
And I want to see that feedback of that transition of the image going to the very top of the screen.

67
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.980
So these, as you can tell, they are rectangle two and rectangle two and they are both named the exact

68
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.520
same.

69
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.660
And this should just animate to the top and the rest of the content will appear gradually.

70
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.730
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

71
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:29.460
So if I click on this, so all the rest of the content just dissolves in and I have everything there.

72
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.350
So let's take a look at what that looks like again.

73
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.270
So if I click home and I go back, I mean, we could actually place a back button here to do the same

74
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.900
thing.

75
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.550
So that's really nice.

76
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.980
I mean, it's not too fast.

77
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:49.170
So I have 400 milliseconds on the actual duration and I have an ease in and out.

78
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.350
So I mean, it's going to take its time going in and it's going to take its time kind of coming out.

79
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.160
So I mean, when it starts the animation, when it ends, the animation is going to have a nice like

80
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.230
in and out and it's not going to be too abrupt.

81
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.960
So let's take a look at what that looks like one more time.

82
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.540
Really beautiful.

83
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.680
Boom.

84
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.940
I have another smart animation.

85
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.360
I've done it on a drag.

86
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.520
So what's going to happen here is.

87
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.940
When the user drags on these similar photos.

88
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.580
I want to go to this screen now.

89
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.940
We could hypothetically just have a horizontal scroll on these, but we could hijack the scroll like

90
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.780
we've done here.

91
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.230
And it will show a new set of items and I'll show you what that looks like.

92
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.060
I've done the exact same thing.

93
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.530
I've dragged it.

94
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.850
As you can see, the frame is bleeding off of the main mobile frame.

95
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.350
You can see it over here.

96
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.520
So if I just kind of.

97
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.880
Bring that.

98
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.260
Hmm.

99
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.120
So it's very interesting how that's not working properly, but.

100
00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.100
So when I actually slide this, it's going to drag to this again.

101
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.180
So let's take a look at what that looks like so I can see.

102
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.450
Looks really nice.

103
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.090
I bring that back and I can slide it back.

104
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.980
So it's just going back between screens now.

105
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.410
But the great thing about this is with a horizontal scroll, you can't really stop it nicely.

106
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.900
This kind of just hijacks that scroll and puts it in place.

107
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.840
So that's a great way to show off that type of animation like these are great for working closely with

108
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.000
developers because they'll be able to see how things are supposed to work because with a horizontal

109
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.530
scroll you'll never catch them like this.

110
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:43.410
So if it's beyond 50% of the space of the width, then it should automatically slide like that.

111
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.960
If it isn't, then it shouldn't.

112
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.150
So that's something really, really interesting in terms of a little animation that we made there.

113
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.190
Now another one.

114
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:54.520
Is.

115
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.360
A subtle animation with the heart.

116
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.180
So what I've done is I've created another screen.

117
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.530
With that heart fill.

118
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.420
And when I click that, it's just going to smart animate, it's going to be very subtle and the fill

119
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.500
is going to change there.

120
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.830
And it will also pop a little gift that I have created.

121
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.890
Sorry, it's a little pixelated, but I've created this in fig motion, which is a plug in for Figma

122
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.550
and we're going to get into micro interactions in our next lesson.

123
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.530
But I want to give you a sneak peek of what we can kind of do here, because micro interactions are

124
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.740
a form of animation and they use motion.

125
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.290
So we're going to get into that as well.

126
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:43.860
But so clicking this little heart here is a micro interaction, same with like interacting with this

127
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.760
type of nav.

128
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.700
So I'm going to click this and it's going to fill the heart.

129
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.670
And it's going to pop this little notification ball that's going to bounce up and down.

130
00:07:53.670 --> 00:08:00.570
So I'm keeping my animations very, very subtle, but I'm also kind of adhering to all those rules.

131
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.510
We talked about things about state transitions.

132
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:09.660
So like we've seen with moving between these different types of navigation items and also moving from

133
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.430
this screen to this screen.

134
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.110
So beautiful state transitions, we also have visual cues.

135
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.450
So this is going to be a visual cue in terms of clicking this heart and getting that feedback.

136
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.850
That's also part of visual feedback as well.

137
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.460
So when I click this, I'm going to get great feedback.

138
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:32.070
And another cue over here is this little notification that's going to pop up.

139
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.630
So let's take a look at what this whole prototype looks like from here onward.

140
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.460
So I can see I can click that.

141
00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.320
So very nice.

142
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.800
And we have our little tiny, subtle animation bouncing in the background, letting users know, Hey,

143
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.460
click me, I have something for you to look at, so let's remove that and it's gone.

144
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.190
And it's there.

145
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.110
So really nice, really subtle that it's not instantaneous.

146
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.120
It doesn't look really like jumbled or anything like that.

147
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.350
So that is a way that you can use smart animate to just make certain interactions look really nice,

148
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:15.170
bring your prototypes to life, and just to showcase what you're thinking as a designer, I know it

149
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:22.010
can be really tough with animations, and I think up until this point, jumping between so many different

150
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:28.220
plugins, jumping between different applications, Figma has really found something amazing here.

151
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.290
They have something really special with the way you can just smart, animate and create these different

152
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.590
screen transitions within the same product.

153
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:42.650
In our next lesson, we're going to jump right into micro interactions, and I'm going to get to what

154
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.340
they are.

155
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.030
I'm going to talk about why they're so important, and we're going to create our own.

156
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:54.410
So go out there, have some fun with like creating these smart animations with your own examples in

157
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.880
terms of like you can use this if you want, you can create your own app, but I urge you to use the

158
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.490
app that we're building as a way that we can create just different interactions like that and, you

159
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:09.650
know, just work on different screen transitions and different transitions in general.

160
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.390
So go out there and have some fun.

161
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.030
Our next lesson we're going to learn about micro interactions.
