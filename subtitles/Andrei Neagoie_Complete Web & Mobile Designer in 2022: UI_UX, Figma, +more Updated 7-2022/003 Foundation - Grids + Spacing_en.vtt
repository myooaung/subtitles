00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.690
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.490
So I want to get into grids and spacing.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.030
Now, this is very important because it dictates how we space elements out, how we choose different

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.050
unit sizes.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:21.210
And what I've done here is I've used the four pixel grid and I'm using multiples of eight.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.270
So let's get right into it.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.270
So I've created different grids here and we've created them together in the past, and my mobile layout

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.660
grid is just a regular eight column grid.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.830
And let's take a look at what it looks like when we go to edit the styles.

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.910
So we have an account in terms of our columns and I like using an A column grid just because on mobile

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.230
it gives us a lot of variance in terms of how we display cards, especially our application.

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.760
I think it's really card heavy.

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.240
So we have different variants in terms of like larger cards, cards that bleed off in terms of horizontal

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.750
fashion.

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.300
We have cards that stack upon each other.

16
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.420
This allows us to do two columns in terms of cards and a column, a larger column, and then something

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.520
that bleeds off, which you'll see later.

18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.680
This is how I've set it up color.

19
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.570
I just kind of use the standard color.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.700
I have an eight count type.

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.930
The stretch margin is set to 24 pixels and my gutter is 16.

22
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.570
So my margin over here is at 24 pixels, which is another multiple of eight.

23
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.930
My gutter is 16, which is another multiple of eight.

24
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.470
If we move over, I've created just a baseline grid.

25
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.090
If you wanted to use that as well within your projects, you have the option to.

26
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.200
This really helps just if you want to space things vertically.

27
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.900
You don't have to necessarily use this just within the entire mobile screen.

28
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.830
If you have a.

29
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.230
I'll show you how I would apply it sometimes.

30
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.190
So if I've created a frame, maybe this is a card.

31
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.840
And I go to my little grid styles, which is right there.

32
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.130
I can just apply it to a card.

33
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.130
And now I have a different way to track my vertical spacing within this card.

34
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.300
So.

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.510
There's another one.

36
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.730
This is an eight pixel grid.

37
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.880
Let me just change the naming to that to eight pixels.

38
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.930
So we have our eight pixel grid, which is just a little bit larger.

39
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.960
I prefer four pixel grids because there's a lot more variance within that.

40
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.590
It gives you a lot more to work with.

41
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.600
This is more of a preference thing, so still a pixel grid.

42
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.580
We also have the four pixel grid combined with the mobile grid that we've created here.

43
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.720
And I've done the same thing also for an apex baseline grid.

44
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.630
So these are the baseline grids and the grids combined and I'll show you what that looks like.

45
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.730
So this is my style.

46
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.370
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to select this little icon here that says edit style.

47
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.190
And once I've done that, you can see what I have here.

48
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.240
So if I go to edit the properties, I can see those are my rows.

49
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.690
My rows is my baseline grid and I have them set to auto account type right from the top.

50
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.620
I've changed the color just so I have a little bit more hierarchy within here so I can distinguish between

51
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.460
both of them.

52
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.790
I have a four pixel height, I have zero offset and a four pixel gutter.

53
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.790
So that is how I've set up my spacing for this project.

54
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.190
And like I said, this could change if this is a mobile app and if we were working in a responsive application,

55
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.560
we may see many more variations.

56
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.480
We may see like a desktop version, we'll probably see a tablet version, we'll probably see even an

57
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.860
extra large desktop version.

58
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.690
So keep that in mind.

59
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.920
Don't just stick to one grid.

60
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.980
You're going to have variance if you have a responsive system.

61
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.990
But this is going to really be what you base everything off of.

62
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.880
You have your grid here and your spacing is based off of eight pixels.

63
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.420
In increments of that.

64
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.100
So this is grids and spacing.
