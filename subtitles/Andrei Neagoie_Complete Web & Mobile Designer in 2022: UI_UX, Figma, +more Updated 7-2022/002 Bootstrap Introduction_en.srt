Hello.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,700
In this video, I'm going to introduce you to something called bootstrap.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,110
If you haven't heard before.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:17,160
Bootstrap is one of the most popular projects ever for developers and what it is, is just a CSS file

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,630
and JavaScript file.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,130
But why would that be one of the most popular projects?

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,420
Well, one thing you might have noticed is that writing CSS from scratch is a bit of a pain.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,120
Wouldn't it be nice if you can use something that has already been created by somebody so that not every

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,220
single developer has to keep reinventing the wheel and keep writing everything from scratch?

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,800
And that is the idea behind Bootstrap.

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:50,220
Bootstrap was created to solve this problem so that we can create websites really, really fast by using

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,150
somebody else's CSS and building on top of it.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,530
There's also another project called Foundation that does the same thing and they have their own styles.

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,160
But again, Bootstrap is the more popular of the two, so we'll focus on that if we click on Get Started

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,700
Here.

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,270
You'll have a quick set up instruction and in the next video we'll actually build something with bootstrap.

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,540
But I want to show you if you go down to components.

18
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,270
What the big sell of bootstrap is and that is it has all of these things pre built for you.

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,090
So if I wanted to, let's say, have a navigation bar.

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,700
Well, that's already built for me with dropdowns and links.

21
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,990
And all I have to do is copy and paste this code.

22
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,380
And you'll see over here that they already have classes attached to them and these classes will be associated

23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,890
with the CSS file that I will download from Bootstrap.

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,430
So any time I use something like nav bar, it will use the default bootstrap styles and there's many

25
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,720
things that you can do.

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,600
As you can see, all I need to do is copy and paste this code and I have myself a card.

27
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,330
You can imagine how fast making websites is with this.

28
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,200
Now, the one thing I do want to point out is you might be asking, why do I need to also download JavaScript?

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,720
We haven't really learned that topic yet in this course.

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,030
And there are some things in bootstrap such as dropdown menus.

31
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,550
You can see how they're adding behavior, some actions to our website.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,530
If I go to, let's say, models, for example.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,850
And I click on launch demo model.

34
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,910
Well, this uses JavaScript because there's some action within our website.

35
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,100
We won't worry too much about that, and that's something we'll get into when we get to the JavaScript

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,730
section.

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:50,500
But you can see here that with bootstrap, by just downloading a CSS file and a JavaScript file, we

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,880
have all these tools at our disposal.

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,590
Now you might be asking yourself one other thing, and that is, well, if everybody uses these, won't

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,750
we all have the same looking websites?

41
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,050
And no, the beauty of bootstrap is that these are just building blocks.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:15,020
You have all these classes that you can use, but then you can add your own custom CSS styles on top

43
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,180
of these to make it different.

44
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,630
So if I go to Bunds, for example, well, by using these classes I have all these beautiful buns.

45
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:30,350
But if I wanted to change the behavior of Bun Primary, which is this one, I could create my own CSS

46
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:37,220
file and just put it right after the bootstrap file and change the primary color to, let's say, orange.

47
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:45,470
And just to show you, if you go to the Expo tab here, Bootstrap actually has a whole bunch of websites

48
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,320
that are have been built with bootstrap.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,530
And you can see that they all look very, very different.

50
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,540
So in the next video, we're going to build ourself a bootstrap website.

51
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,200
I'll see you in that one.

52
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,190
Bye bye.
