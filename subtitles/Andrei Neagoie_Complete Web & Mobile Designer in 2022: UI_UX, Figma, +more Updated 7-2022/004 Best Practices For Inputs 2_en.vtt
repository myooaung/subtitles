00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.330
We're going to be talking about some best practices for inputs.

3
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.190
One thing that you should know is that the height of your input should always be the same height as

4
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.240
your primary button to maintain that visual consistency.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.880
Remember when we learnt about spacing and grids?

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.090
Well, we defined a base unit of eight pixels and using that we can create input field heights of 32

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.210
pixels or 40 pixels or even 48 pixels and so on.

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.420
So right now, if we look at our pixel height, we have 40 pixel height and on our button we have a

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.020
30.

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.360
We need to adjust this just because right now it does not look consistent.

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.430
Which is just that's a 40.

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.660
And all of a sudden, that looks much better.

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.050
Let's just reverse it to see what it looked like before.

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.330
Much more consistent.

15
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.790
And we can just make sure that it's spaced.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.490
You can leave extra space if you want at the end.

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.130
But that looks much more better than it did before.

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.340
Another thing.

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.019
Your input field length.

20
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.920
All inputs in a form should be the same length.

21
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.780
But, you know, that's just basically a guideline that varies depending on the type of answer you may

22
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.460
ask the user to answer.

23
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.360
A good example is when we ask users for their credit card information.

24
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.220
Let's take a look at the CVV number.

25
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.530
Now, this input field shouldn't be too long because it's generally only three digits.

26
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.400
Sometimes having longer puts for short answers can confuse the user into thinking they may have entered

27
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.450
a too short answer.

28
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.010
There's an easy way to fix this.

29
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.330
What we can do is we can just shrink this.

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.410
Shrink that.

31
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.290
And what I'm doing here is I'm holding shift shift in control, and I'm just going to nudge that over.

32
00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:00.230
And if you don't know where to nudges up here my bar if I go to preferences and I go to nudge amounts.

33
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.170
I have a big nudge of ten.

34
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.009
I would probably set that to my base unit or some variation of it.

35
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.690
So I'm going to set it to four and you'll notice that if I hold shift control.

36
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.910
I can decrease the width of this frame based off of my nudge amount.

37
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.160
So I have four, eight, 12, 16.

38
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.830
And there you go.

39
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.790
And now everything looks like it's spaced properly.

40
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.040
And that looks much better.

41
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.400
So if we go back and we look at what it looked like before.

42
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.210
This looks much better.

43
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.480
So remember, based off of the context of the type of answer you're looking for, you can adjust the

44
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.000
input size, especially for something like this.

45
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.770
Next is labels.

46
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.420
So your labels should be short and clear and easy to read.

47
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.460
It's best to keep your labels short and sweet to the point.

48
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.120
1 to 2 words is generally enough to describe what is being asked, so the label should contrast the

49
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.450
input.

50
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.980
Fine.

51
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.110
Also, so generally people bold and shrink them a bit.

52
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.470
They also lower the opacity sometimes.

53
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.680
I mean, that's a visual thing that you can do afterwards.

54
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.390
Another tip is to make sure only the first letter is capitalized for easy scanning and readability.

55
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.580
So right now we have a very long input.

56
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.240
And all we want the user to do is type their first name.

57
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.640
So the easiest way to do that is just to ask for first name and that's it.

58
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.810
I wouldn't capitalize the second word.

59
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.920
I'd like to just capitalize just the first one and let the rest drop to lowercase.

60
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.900
That also depends on the type of input.

61
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.370
I mean, you could be asking for some information that needs to be capitalized like CVB.

62
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.680
That is another example.

63
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.100
It's just based off of context.

64
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.780
But generally, this is what I do.

65
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.400
This is like kind of like a semi bold.

66
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.300
You can bold it just a bit to contrast whatever's in the input.

67
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.960
Let's see if we can change this input right here.

68
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.089
These are my components.

69
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.160
We've got a label note.

70
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.390
What we got here.

71
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.580
Default or we can do active and if we go into our.

72
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.580
Okay.

73
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.680
Well, we'll get to that in a second.

74
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.620
But generally, yeah.

75
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.510
Make sure that your label differentiates from.

76
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.850
From your input.

77
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.190
So I'm going to just write some text in here.

78
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.860
So there's my first name.

79
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.850
And what I would do is I would probably have it at whatever font size that I think is best, maybe 16.

80
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.750
And that would be something like a regular at 100%.

81
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.290
And that is definitely enough.

82
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.470
In terms of showing some sort of hierarchy within the input and to differentiate between the actual

83
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.940
label and the input text.

84
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.720
So make sure that you are doing all of that and make sure that you aren't having too long of sentences

85
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.810
or something like that when you're asking for a question in terms of a label.

86
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.190
Keep it short and sweet.

87
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.890
Okay.

88
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.480
So here's another one.

89
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.950
Now placeholders.

90
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.580
Now, this is another thing that people debate a lot over to placeholder and not to placeholder.

91
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.140
I'm sorry, I just kind of butchered Shakespeare there for a bit.

92
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:50.400
But anyways, placeholders, you know, at their best they show repetitive information and at its worst,

93
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.880
it hides important information and reduces accessibility.

94
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.230
So when a user clicks on a placeholder and starts to type in an answer, that automatically replaces

95
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.690
the placeholder with whatever the user has inputted.

96
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.820
And this can be a problem if the placeholder is being used as a label or a hint.

97
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.930
At that point, the user can no longer see that text and can't review their answer.

98
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.870
As for accessibility, they're a little harder to see due to light or color, nor often undetected by

99
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.830
page readers.

100
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.940
Let's take a look here.

101
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.990
So right now we have spouses birthday as a placeholder and.

102
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.410
Yeah.

103
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.220
That is not good.

104
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.000
So what we can do here.

105
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.250
Is just remove this text.

106
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.300
You can hide it.

107
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.870
And we're just going to duplicate that.

108
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.630
And what we can do is just type in.

109
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:52.720
Spose his birthday and I don't really think you need a hint for that.

110
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.540
You can do something like this.

111
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.810
So spouses.

112
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.810
So if we were to use this, for example, I would remove this placeholder text because like I said,

113
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.820
placeholders aren't necessarily.

114
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.130
That useful?

115
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:17.030
I mean, they are useful when you use the information there, but when it's hidden, it's gone.

116
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.100
And what you can do is just have hint, text on the right side or below whatever suits your design best

117
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.500
and whatever works with users best.

118
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:32.250
But what I've done here is I have the optional hint content right here instead of within the placeholder.

119
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.890
Do this.

120
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.520
Rather than have a placeholder because it's a better solution in the end.

121
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.640
And that's it for some best practices for inputs.
