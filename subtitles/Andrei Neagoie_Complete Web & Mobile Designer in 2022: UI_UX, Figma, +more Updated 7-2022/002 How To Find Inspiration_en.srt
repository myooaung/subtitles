1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,029
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,220
So we're going to talk about how I find inspiration online.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,280
Now, we already went over how we can stay inspired.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,370
And generally that's where I get most of my inspiration, you know, talking to peers, walking around,

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,110
studying other people's work, you know, staying knowledgeable about different topics.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,560
That's what really keeps me inspired by.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,360
I also think that a key to your product design process in this is what I find absolutely necessary is

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,150
to have a constant source of online inspiration.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,130
So there are several sites that I like to visit.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,180
These are some of them.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,250
The main one I like to visit is dribble.

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,390
So here's dribble.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,770
It's a great place.

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,710
I'm sure many of you know it already, but I love it just because I can just make a bunch of collections

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,680
of different types of design patterns that I really love.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,020
Also searching on here is really easy and it's probably one of the best places to go and get ideas for

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,560
your designs.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,720
I mean, not because there are so many people posting cool things, but it's a great way to study your

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,260
peers.

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,060
You can discover some of the world's top designers and creatives, and you can also get inspiration

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,640
from a wide range of disciplines, like anything from animation, branding, illustrations, product

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,440
design, web design, print.

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,840
I mean, there's so many different things on here.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,850
There's always a project you can learn from.

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,900
And what makes it great is that it's a place where people can post their content and get feedback.

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,480
I mean, feedback doesn't happen very often on a lot of these posts, but it's just a great way to get

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,060
a lot of different types of inspiration.

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,820
Some people even like showcasing their portfolio for potential clients or studios, and because of this,

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,510
like final pieces that are uploaded are like of the highest quality.

30
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,610
I generally love to catalog different things, like I mentioned before, and this is what I generally

31
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,840
do and this is how I use it.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,500
So I like to sometimes just browse all.

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm a big fan of like different things.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,490
I guess like an example would be like if I just typed typography.

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,650
Some people are doing some really interesting stuff that may inspire me, like just seeing something

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,630
like this print collateral and looking at all these different shapes and the way they're positioned

37
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,110
and even the way like the text is bolded and laid out, something like that could inspire me for like

38
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,030
website hero page or something like that.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,360
So like anything you can grab inspiration from and I feel like a lot of people get really hooked up

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,880
or held up on trying to find just the right solution that they can kind of mimic.

41
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,930
Don't do that.

42
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,080
I mean, that's one way to kind of stunt your creativity.

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,590
So what I like to do is like if I'm going to search for something like navigation or mobile navigation,

44
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,640
I like to see all these different types of options.

45
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,400
So like if I go into this, this is pretty cool, just the way they have these little kind of micro

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,320
interactions and animations.

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,150
So I may just like save that and I have a bunch of different like collections.

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,440
So you can see I have a collection for calculators or carousel forms color.

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,890
There's like CRM tools that I like to look at.

50
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,840
I may see this under mobile navigation.

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,490
And I can just create a collection really quickly.

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,950
So this is really cool.

53
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,630
And there you go.

54
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,140
It saved.

55
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,690
You can even like it if you want and you can start typing.

56
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,650
And some people like to give their feedback or just ask questions.

57
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,270
It's really great place.

58
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,770
So this is what we typically do.

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,110
Like, I would grab this, I would save it.

60
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,730
I would type in like mobile navigation and start creating a collection of different ways.

61
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,540
People have done this.

62
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,920
If I'm trying to solve for a similar problem that I'm stuck on now, I may not be stuck on this per

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,140
se, but I may get inspired by something like just how they have done these smooth animations, like

64
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,210
in this example I just showed you.

65
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,550
So I may really like this, just the subtlety of it, and I may want to implement something similar

66
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,810
for my product.

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,530
And the easy way to get there is to hover over your profile and go to my collections over here.

68
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,470
And you can see like I have like even a test.

69
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,720
I have a bunch of different options here.

70
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,720
So I have mobile navigation right there and I'll just kind of go through them.

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,290
I may like copy them or like make notes about this mobile navigation if I edit it and add a description

72
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,680
to it.

73
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,330
So that's how I typically use dribble.

74
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,540
I mean, like I said before, you can get inspiration from like any type of discipline, like even if

75
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,440
it's branding.

76
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,750
Like just seeing like maybe like just the way that they've incorporated a background here seems very

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,210
interesting and how sharp like in terms of contrast there is between color and shade.

78
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,280
You know, don't limit yourself just by trying to find the right solution for what you're trying to

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,640
do.

80
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,780
Look elsewhere.

81
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,420
Another thing I like to use is Pinterest.

82
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,060
This is a whole lot of library of visual content.

83
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,170
I mean, you can get inspiration for everything here, but there is a lot of noise.

84
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,730
I think the best way to get inspiration from something like Pinterest is to do what I've just done here.

85
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,540
Just have a very targeted search.

86
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,330
So I chose mobile design.

87
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,280
And yeah, there are a lot of different options here.

88
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,780
And what you can do is you can just kind of save it.

89
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,260
I have like a keto family meal plan, little kind of collection over here and you can like save those

90
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,080
collections for yourself or those boards.

91
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,260
They're called in Pinterest.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,330
I mean, one thing you can also do like is create a bunch of different boards about different types

93
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,260
of design patterns that you love.

94
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,630
So that's one way to use Pinterest.

95
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,100
I also like to just like use Pinterest just to look at different things.

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,590
I mean, it could even be like interiors.

97
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,340
It could be anything like design related, even if that's interior design.

98
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,090
Like I said, don't limit yourself just to like finding the right solution.

99
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,890
So what I typically do is I like to just kind of go into one and I'll like I'll save it to a certain

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,250
board.

101
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,190
So like I'll click save and it'll go into that board.

102
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,420
It went into the wrong one.

103
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,100
But you can kind of change that.

104
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,240
You can pick.

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,960
Basically a bunch of different boards.

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,810
You can even make a new one on the go.

107
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,040
So that's definitely an easy way to keep track of a bunch of inspiration.

108
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,980
There's also a plug in that allows you to actually save different types of content.

109
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:15,940
So if we go back to dribble, so here's my Pinterest extension and what you can do is like if I focus

110
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,010
on here, I have it pop up over here that I want to save it to somewhere.

111
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,310
Even if you're on a different site, you can save things to your Pinterest board.

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,420
Easy way to use Pinterest and collect inspiration over time.

113
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,950
The next one I like to use.

114
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:35,200
I don't use this very much, but I mean, one thing I really love about Behance is that the quality

115
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,900
is really good here and there's a lot of explanation behind some of the work.

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,730
This is another interesting place to find a bunch of different types of inspiration, whether it be

117
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,180
like graphic design, you know, all different types of design.

118
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,920
I often use this kind of like a long side dribble, but not as much as dribble.

119
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,840
A good thing to note is that big businesses will spend a bunch of money advertising job rolls here with

120
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
hopes of attracting top talent.

121
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,450
So since there are big brands on the lookout, you can expect to find lots of work.

122
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,350
You know, there's a lot of great ideas and lots of creativity.

123
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,900
So if I go here and I search like mobile.

124
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,170
Like I can already see there's a bunch of different like options.

125
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,140
And one thing that's really great about it that's way better than dribble.

126
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,100
Dribble just kind of gives you like a snapshot of a design over here.

127
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,800
Like a lot of people like to upload like so much content in regards to the actual app.

128
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Like you often only see like just a snippet that looks really good, but you kind of are left in the

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,810
dark about how the rest of the application pans out and if it's good at all.

130
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,570
So this is what like a lot of the different types of kind of things you'll see on Behance, like a lot

131
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,770
of different types of gallery image, like images like this, they'll break down like the challenge

132
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,240
or customer development.

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,340
I like this stuff way more than the pretty screenshots because I'm really interested in like how they

134
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,710
solve the problem and how they got to the solution.

135
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,100
So some people will often post things like that.

136
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,300
I like to see how people even lay out or define their style guides.

137
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:10,660
So this is really cool to see more in depth animations which look really, really smooth.

138
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,340
I like to see different types of things, like they have a transactions over here, they have card settings

139
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,370
just like how the bank cards will look.

140
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,000
It just gives you a lot more versatility on how you want to view those projects and what you're looking

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,300
for.

142
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,970
Like if you're looking for a quick solution for like a design pattern, then maybe dribble may be one

143
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,120
of the better sites to look at or patterns which we'll get into next.

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,659
But this was really great to get overview of certain projects.

145
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,090
You know, there may not be as many, but a lot of the projects on here are just top notch.

146
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,140
So another thing I really like to use is patterns.

147
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,160
So one thing you need to know is that patterns isn't free entirely.

148
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:56,340
This is essentially like a focus on mobile design patterns, and there are some great mobile app designs

149
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,000
here and you'll get screenshots of like in depth UI elements.

150
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,240
You can even search just based off of UI elements, which is really cool.

151
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,760
And like I said before, it's paid.

152
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,250
So it kind of limits the amount that you can see.

153
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,350
Sometimes what you can see is enough.

154
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,670
But I mean, if you're really looking into solving for different design patterns and you don't mind

155
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,330
paying for premium, then I think this is a really great resource.

156
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,500
So like if we take a look on the site here, we have like different categories, which is really cool,

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,320
like if I'm going to look for cards.

158
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,480
I see how different people have handled cards and I'll only get to see just a little bit.

159
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,220
I think they'll stop me like right now.

160
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,800
So it's not a lot, but I mean, it's not necessarily like everything is super pretty like in terms

161
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,830
of like the dribble effect, but you get to really see some actual solutions that have been implemented,

162
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,560
which I value I think a bit more.

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,380
What else do we have here?

164
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,800
I love to see different things like lists is another cool thing, like how people handle different lists.

165
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,820
So I mean, this is really great for just finding individual like UI elements and stuff like that.

166
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,260
I love using patterns.

167
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,200
I have a paid account through my company, so that really helps.

168
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,110
And yeah, this is how I solve a lot of like different types of like individual problems or like problems

169
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,580
that are kind of more secluded and more focused in a certain area.

170
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,560
So like if an example would be how do I handle like privacy or popover?

171
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,590
So I have privacy here and there isn't many options, but it's very interesting, like they have a verify

172
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,790
your identity option.

173
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,610
So I may think about that when implementing something like that.

174
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,910
If I think about like, popovers, I think like, you know, maybe like an overlay can come from the

175
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,410
top, it can come from the side.

176
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,840
So I see a bunch of different implementations of that.

177
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,050
And the last site I kind of use, I like this site, especially for websites, is awards.

178
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,230
So this is another great option for web based design.

179
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,980
They have an award system like you can see that over here.

180
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:02,040
And you know, it displays exceptional designers and they have expert judges and a pretty strict evaluation

181
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,460
process.

182
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:09,360
And you'll notice a lot of the latest Web trends are over here so we can search up something like.

183
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,840
Banking.

184
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,670
And here you can search by websites, you can search by like elements.

185
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,040
So if we go to load old results, we just click that.

186
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:29,830
If we if we go there, we can see a bunch of different websites based off of what we searched for.

187
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,720
And what's really great is like I searched up something like banking, which you would assume would

188
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,140
be really like rigid and strict in terms of like their design and their design principles.

189
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,730
But you see a bunch of different like takes on what banking could look like.

190
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,680
I mean, not all of these things are necessarily banking related, but there's a lot of inspiration

191
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,190
here.

192
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,820
So like we could just click over here, we have a small banking business and this is Lone Star National

193
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,390
Bank.

194
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,010
It's a really great site.

195
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,440
I can see just a bit of the hero.

196
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:10,070
And if we click into that, we'll go to the actual website and be able to actually experience that experience.

197
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,610
So this is obviously a little bit different than what we saw.

198
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,460
But, you know, maybe they've had a design update and maybe for the better or for the worse, but it

199
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,490
gives you good context as well into like the solution, you know, going back to pretty screenshots

200
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,030
and not necessarily knowing if certain things have been implemented, these are pretty much all been

201
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:34,310
implemented and you can see how that actually functions when you go to that website and try those different

202
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,540
like interactions or you know, explore navigation schemes and stuff like that.

203
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,020
So these are basically the top ways I get my online inspiration.

204
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,900
I mean, I mentioned before that I get a lot of my inspiration by just staying inspired in general and

205
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,090
like staying knowledgeable on different topics, whether that be like design trends, whether that be

206
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,550
like development trends, everything like that.

207
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:05,030
So I think it's really important that you kind of catalog some actual visual design inspiration online

208
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,180
as well, and these are some resources that you can definitely use.

209
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,670
So if you want to categorize everything from all different sites, Pinterest is probably best to have

210
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,610
like one source of truth in terms of like a board.

211
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,940
But if you want to stick to certain sites like dribble, you can like save collections there and have

212
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,350
it all in one place over there.

213
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:31,160
So this is what I use and you know, go out there, I'll find don't copy people, but just try and stay

214
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,670
inspired online and surround yourself by online inspiration.

215
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,940
So that way when people come to you for ideas, you're kind of on the ball.

216
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,610
You understand a bunch of different design patterns and you just have general knowledge of what are

217
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,840
the latest trends.

218
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,430
So go out there and have fun.
