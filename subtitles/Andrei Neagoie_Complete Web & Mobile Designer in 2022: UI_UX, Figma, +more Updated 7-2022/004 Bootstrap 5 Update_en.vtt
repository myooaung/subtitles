00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.170
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.260
Now, the one thing I really wanted to make sure with this course is that I show you how your day to

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.060
day tasks of a developer actually look like in real life.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.530
And the thing is, in our world, packages, libraries, tools are constantly being updated.

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.420
So once you build a website, once you build a project, you have to maintain it.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.510
And maintaining a project means making sure that the project still works.

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.570
Years after you built it, making sure that you update the libraries because libraries like bootstrap,

8
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.560
well, they update constantly with new features, new privacy features.

9
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.810
So part of your job is also maintaining your projects.

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.920
Now, throughout the course, I show you how to update all of our projects to the latest version of

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
a tool or library that it uses based on the current year.

12
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.880
So we're going to do the same with this startup landing page.

13
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.180
We haven't built this yet.

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.950
We're still working towards it, but this is the finished product that you're going to have as well.

15
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.130
And I'll also provide the code for you at the end of this section.

16
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.830
But let's say a year passes, you've created your startup landing page, and guess what?

17
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.190
Bootstrap comes with a new version.

18
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.530
Look at that.

19
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.190
The current bootstrap version is this, and maybe your client says, Hey, can you make sure that our

20
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.340
website is up to date, that all our libraries that we use like bootstrap are up to date?

21
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.730
So you say, sure, no problem, boss, and you get to it.

22
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.680
But how do you do that?

23
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.270
Well, let's set up this example.

24
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.330
You can pause the video here and try it for yourself if you like.

25
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.240
But if I click on Get Started Here, like we did in the previous video, we see that we now have the

26
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.030
same thing as we did before, this time with the latest version of Bootstrap.

27
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.640
So what I can do, let's say if I was updating my project, so let's just copy that.

28
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.940
Go back to my text editor and where I import it or use the seed.

29
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.720
And for bootstrap, which you can see that it has a lower version that it currently is.

30
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.410
I simply replace that with the one that I just copied.

31
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.950
I'm just going to replace this line with this new one.

32
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.760
So you can see here that we have the latest version of Bootstrap.

33
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.120
Finally, if we were using JavaScript in our project, we can also update the JavaScript by copying

34
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.840
this.

35
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.400
Now we won't worry about this because in this project we don't use JavaScript and that's something that

36
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.960
we'll cover later on in the course.

37
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.840
But you can see here, I just simply updated the version.

38
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.570
So now when my HTML file looks for a bootstrap, CSS file is going to go to this location that points

39
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.890
to the latest version.

40
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.970
So let's save this and open up our project fi refresh.

41
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.500
Everything should still work.

42
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.570
Everything should still look the same.

43
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.740
So good.

44
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.110
We just updated it just like that.

45
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.840
So now if I click on Find Out More, you'll see that I'll get my little subscribe form.

46
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.560
Now, one thing to note here you might encounter some issues based on what type of plugins your browser

47
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.190
uses.

48
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.450
For example, here in this case, I'm using a ad blocker.

49
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.580
On my Google Chrome.

50
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.560
And you can see here that it doesn't let me see the sign up form here.

51
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.260
So what you might have to do is using the URL that you've created in your MailChimp.

52
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.140
So remember if you created a campaign with a landing page, it gives you a link usually, which is this

53
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.520
one over here, which again, I'll show you how to create and the rest of the videos.

54
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.030
What you can do is you can copy that link, open up the incognito mode and then in here paste it and

55
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.520
you should be able to see the email subscribe button.

56
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.950
So just a heads up in case you see that.

57
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.110
Anyway, we got sidetracked.

58
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.110
The good news is that now we have the latest version of Bootstrap and in similar fashion.

59
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.820
In the future, when you want to update your bootstrap project, it's as simple as that.

60
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.570
Simply pointing it to the newest version of the CSS file.

61
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.100
I'll see you in the next one.

62
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.970
Bye bye.
