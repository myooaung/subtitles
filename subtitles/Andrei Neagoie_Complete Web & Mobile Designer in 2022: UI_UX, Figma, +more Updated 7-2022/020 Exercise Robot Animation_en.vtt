Hello.

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.250
This is your new robot friend, and I have a fun little challenge for you.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.820
I've created this robot that is actually pretty cool.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.460
So as you hover, his head grows big and he can also dance.

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.470
Now here's the challenge.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.090
I've created majority of this robot, but you first need to assemble it so it looks like this.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.460
And in the next section.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.440
I've left a few files for you.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.380
An index file and a CSS file.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.850
The only problem is that these parts are all over the page, and I need you to assemble them so that

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.990
you can have a robot friend as well in the following section.

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.400
After the exercise, I'll have the solution that you can use, but give it a try and hopefully you'll

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.750
have a new robot friend to.
