00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.650
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.620
So I left off in the last video, kind of on a cliffhanger.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.060
Now I'm going to teach you how to get some really good, constructive feedback.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.230
The first step is context.

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.930
You need to be clear about the context of the meeting.

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.430
It's so important.

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.590
If you don't, each person may have a different understanding of how far along your design is.

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.830
They may also try to give you feedback on irrelevant portions of your idea and with a larger crowd.

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.790
This can get so out of hand and it can get out of hand quickly.

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.240
Try preparing your invitees ahead of time with a quick intro before the meeting, or you can send them

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.020
a quick message beforehand before everyone actually sits down.

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.730
It doesn't need to be lengthy, but it can be a good or it can actually set a good baseline.

13
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.020
So everyone is really understanding of the context of that meeting.

14
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.630
You also really want to have clear goals.

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.880
You want to point out which aspects you're looking for feedback on and you want to state the non goals

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.150
that are out of scope or just not relevant to your design yet.

17
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.260
Another big thing is you want to let people know what stage you are in in terms of design process,

18
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.510
let them know how far along you are.

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.000
This really helps set expectations.

20
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.840
This matters since our fidelity naturally increases over time.

21
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.430
We may start with sketches and gradually build ourselves up to like a really nice high fidelity mockup.

22
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.770
Visual feedback can really bog down the discussion, especially if you aren't even there yet.

23
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.020
So it's really good to kind of set that precedent and set those expectations right off the beginning.

24
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.400
You want to ask those open questions, raise any open questions that you or your team has regarding

25
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.670
your designs, and that way your attendees can actually bring value and insight for you.

26
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.180
The next is an invite.

27
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.110
Only the people you need to.

28
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.460
This may be harsh.

29
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.730
I know.

30
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.090
I get it.

31
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.100
You may not want to do this.

32
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.260
You may want to invite a bunch of different people.

33
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.880
And you.

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.470
You may think that they'll give you a lot of feedback.

35
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.910
While this type of openness is good, not all feedback is equal.

36
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.650
And that's just the ugly truth.

37
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.060
For your feedback to be constructive, it needs to come from the right people.

38
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.860
It may not be the CEO or others with big titles.

39
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.400
It could be somebody else who understands the space much better.

40
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.840
Could be like a customer service representative who talks to users all day.

41
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.570
So really think about the problems you're trying to solve and who has the answers to your questions.

42
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.970
Figure out who's mandatory.

43
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.950
Those with the most knowledge of the problem space.

44
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.590
Maybe even developers who are implementing your design.

45
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.750
So who can give you feedback on stuff like that.

46
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.000
Also, people who you need buy in from those people can be like your internal stakeholders.

47
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.770
Or maybe it is like somebody like the CEO or like the product manager from the client side.

48
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.370
So you need to really think about those people that are really mandatory for that meeting.

49
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.250
But you also need to think about who is optional.

50
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.660
You can invite others, but you want to try and keep it a little small.

51
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.350
When you do direct your questions, direct them to the people who you really feel may give you the feedback

52
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.050
you need and optional attendees, they may bring some more insight as well.

53
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.790
You may be surprised at who brings something up that is really interesting or may really help you with

54
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.600
your designs.

55
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.470
The next thing you want to do is mobilize your group, put them to work.

56
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.110
Open critiques have their place, but you may run out of time if the discussion gets out of hand to

57
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.110
come out of your meeting with the feedback and priorities moving forward.

58
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.310
You need to really get your group involved, make sure you get everyone involved.

59
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.480
That means all the different types of people in that meeting, even yourself.

60
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.000
And I'm going to tell you how you can do that.

61
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.030
So step one, what you want to do is you want to use a whiteboard that's large enough for your group

62
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.780
so they can add their feedback or questions to stickies, get them to do that time, boxed them and

63
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.600
give them like 5 minutes to really think through things that they want to bring up so they can have

64
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.160
a discussion about it afterwards.

65
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.020
When they're done, they can just post their stickies right up to the wall or the whiteboard.

66
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.180
You really just need a big space.

67
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.590
Step two.

68
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.910
This is the voting time.

69
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.000
So you want to time box this and set aside enough time for everyone to go through the list of stickies

70
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.470
and vote on which ones they think are of highest priority.

71
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.080
You know, they should always vote on the ones they find impactful, relevant or important to discuss

72
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.710
together.

73
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.630
Step three.

74
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.290
Now, this is where everyone kind of comes back together.

75
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.650
They go through what they selected and they discuss the top voted stickies aren't necessarily the best

76
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.080
ones, but if enough people voted on it, it may mean that it resonates with them.

77
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.930
It may be a good point to talk about that during that meeting or, you know, writing that down and

78
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.690
talking about it later if it isn't too relevant.

79
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.820
You know, you've got to be wary about your conversations and your feedback meetings getting derailed.

80
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.370
It definitely happens.

81
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.100
Sometimes feedback may not be entirely relevant to the topic you want to focus on, and others may get

82
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.200
so excited about it and it could derail the conversation.

83
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.880
It happens all the time and that's totally fine.

84
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.890
It's just natural.

85
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.670
The group activity that we just outlined should stop this, but in the event that this issue does arise,

86
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.910
bring up its relevance to the goals you stated for the meeting.

87
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.860
Somebody is bringing up something totally irrelevant and maybe we're talking about a checkout flow or

88
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.140
something like that, and somebody brings in something like product pages and that don't necessarily

89
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.270
mean anything to the checkout flow.

90
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.120
Then you should kind of bring up that goal that you first stated in the beginning and maybe hopefully

91
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.800
you'll get back on track.

92
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.850
I feel like it's always good though to bookmark the feedback that does come so that way.

93
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.890
I think it's always good to bookmark the feedback that you do get, you know, and come back to it as

94
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.480
a group at a later time.

95
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:06.120
You know, I always show or I always I always show and I always like make sure that my attendees know

96
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.610
that I've booked marked their actual feedback so that they don't think I'm ignoring them.

97
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.820
So this is a process you can use to get great feedback.

98
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.100
Just remember that you want to give them the right context.

99
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.630
You want to set the goals for your meeting.

100
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:31.070
You want to get everyone together that should be there and get them to actually work together to give

101
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.960
you feedback as a group.

102
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.930
So that way, one voice doesn't just dominate a room.

103
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.120
And also so you can get the right feedback from the right people.

104
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.710
And always, always.

105
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.640
Stay on track and that's how you get some constructive feedback.
