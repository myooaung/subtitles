00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.640
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.550
So I'm going to give you a quick demonstration on how you can come up with a really simple color scheme.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.530
The color scheme I'm going to choose right now is a monochromatic one because I feel like those are

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.000
so easy to work with.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.970
And I'm going to show you just how we can create one and we can apply it to a UI easily.

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.660
So step one is we want to choose our base color first, like the primary or dominant color of our UI.

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.180
And usually that's your brand color.

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.009
So I'm just going to go over here.

9
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.710
I'm just going to select the Ellipse tool.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.580
Right here, you can just press, Oh, I've done that.

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.010
I'm just going to create a little circle.

12
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.910
And we're going to rename that to just call it color because we're going to make a bunch.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.240
So first step.

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.580
Choose our brand color.

15
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.410
I think I'm going to go with like a blue.

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.480
It's a very easy color to work with.

17
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.590
Uh.

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.220
I think something like this is good.

19
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.630
And now this is our primary color.

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.790
Now the goal is to choose like colors based off of this primary color.

21
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.060
And then we can actually choose darker colors and grays based off of this color as well.

22
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.170
And this will serve as our entire color scheme.

23
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.000
So let's go in here.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.180
And what we're going to do is we're going to press option shift.

25
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.150
And dragged that over.

26
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.970
Next step would be to choose like colors near your base color.

27
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.890
So let's give ourselves a couple of options here.

28
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.040
I'm not going to adjust the hue.

29
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.310
I'm just going to adjust the saturation or brightness.

30
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.780
I'm going to leave that hue alone.

31
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.950
So this is the hue.

32
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.230
We can even go a little bit more.

33
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.030
Maybe there's not enough contrast there.

34
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.990
Okay.

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.889
We're going to duplicate that.

36
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.880
And we're going to choose one more dark one.

37
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.120
Just a little more darker here.

38
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.060
And there you go.

39
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.900
We have some colors to work with here, and it's going to give us a lot of variety when we start applying

40
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.790
this to an interface.

41
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.760
So you don't want to kind of like just have one color to work with because that's just going to not

42
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.750
give you enough variety.

43
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.150
You're going to be stuck trying to apply it everywhere.

44
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.890
You want to have different variations.

45
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.230
So that way, you know, if there's text that needs to be highlighted or there's certain element like

46
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.880
a card that needs to be highlighted with a color, you don't need to just stick to like this color you

47
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.030
could use like this color or a different type of gray.

48
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.410
So don't necessarily stop yourself from.

49
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.080
Experimenting and expanding your palate.

50
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.390
So those are three kind of colors that I think I'm going to stick with.

51
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.310
I'm going to actually duplicate this one.

52
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.300
And I bring it down right here.

53
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.430
And I'm actually going to make a very, very dark.

54
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.110
Blue.

55
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.570
Almost like black.

56
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.010
Remember what I said about tinting your blacks and your grays?

57
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.510
They really kind of give them a much more depth.

58
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.560
And I'm going to choose a couple more grays based off of this.

59
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.240
No, I'm just going to do is I'm going to start going in this direction.

60
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.590
Okay.

61
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.270
We can get a little bit later.

62
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.060
Do you notice how this is where a regular gray looks like?

63
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.650
It's kind of bland.

64
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.380
And you know what?

65
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.070
It really depends on your color palette, too.

66
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.910
Like if you have a black and white color palette that kind of has like maybe some accent colors, then

67
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.000
maybe like going the black and white route is totally fine as long as it suits your brand and the tone

68
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.690
of your brand.

69
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920
But in this case, it doesn't necessarily suit our monochromatic scheme.

70
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.350
So I'm just going to go here.

71
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.280
I'm going to just pick from that blue just a little bit.

72
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.860
And I want a nice light gray.

73
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.590
I think something like that is going to work really well.

74
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.720
Maybe we can go just a tad lighter.

75
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.540
Okay.

76
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.630
And then I'm going to pick a really, really light one.

77
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.870
This is a really light grey.

78
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.080
You'll notice that it still has a little bit of the blue in it.

79
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.520
And if we want just for the sake of having a white, that's that's always an option.

80
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.060
And I'm just going to outline it at the stroke.

81
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.740
So there you go.

82
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.040
Like, we have our own monochromatic scheme over here.

83
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.290
And in the next video, I'm going to show you how you can easily apply this.
