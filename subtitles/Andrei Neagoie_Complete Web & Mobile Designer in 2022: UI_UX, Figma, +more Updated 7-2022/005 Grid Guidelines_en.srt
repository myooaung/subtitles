1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,460
So now that you know how to design your own grid, you're going to need to know how to use it.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,410
I mean, there are rules, after all, and these guidelines that you're going to learn are going to

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,840
really help you work with your new friend, the grid.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,870
So rule number one, your elements must always sit on some number of columns like we have here.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,940
We have these cards that are all sitting on their own columns.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,840
You may run into a case where text stretches way too much.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,980
We can move over here.

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,920
You can see that text stretches too much in this container and there's not enough breathing room in

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,880
between each other.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,190
And there's ways we can remedy this.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,930
So we'll just turn on the grid.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,140
We're going to we're going to just shrink this text.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,070
Remember when we spoke about creating frames within frames and creating grids within those frames?

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,020
Well, we can do that here and we can see that we create a little bit more breathing room.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,490
Between our grid items.

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,010
It's really powerful for moments like this.

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:14,370
And like I mentioned before, sitting on a grid, these three elements are going to be on four columns

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,400
each and these two are in half.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,790
And there is that sense of rhythm and uniformity.

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,640
Rule number two.

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,720
Your elements should never be left in the gutters.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,810
If we shrink this like this, that's in a gutter like that, you can see already things are starting

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,750
to look a bit off and.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,000
That's because we are not really adhering to our grid.

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,590
Things start to look squished or.

26
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,660
Just not even.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,730
So, remember, never leave anything within that gutter.

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,110
I mean, it defeats the whole purpose of the grid.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,110
Make sure your elements are in columns.

30
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,440
So let's just reverse what we did there.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,210
So it's Command Z all the way out.

32
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,010
Perfect.

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,700
Now this.

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,180
Just applies to the parent container.

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,740
Like I mentioned before, about creating frames over here and creating grids and frames over here.

36
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,060
This is just going to apply to the parent container.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,610
Within the parent container, we can create our own grid.

38
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,740
So we have a two column grid in here.

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,870
It's a little hard to see with baseline grid.

40
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,740
And this is that card that we saw originally and everything is adhering to this grid within here.

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,250
So there is uniformity within this container.

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,400
It doesn't necessarily adhere to the overall grid, it adheres to its own grid.

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,390
And these grids should be consistent across their own UI elements.

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
This comes in handy when you want to customize a card or content within it.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,320
And you know, like I said before, the overall grid may not accommodate you as well.

46
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,480
Our next rule is your outside column is not for padding.

47
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,930
I mean, just not how it works.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,310
It may be the width of your content, but it will have an outside margin, like I mentioned.

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,090
If your screen expands, you can fix the width of your grid.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,990
That's a discussion that you should probably have with your developers on how you want things to look

51
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:27,250
at certain sizes and breakpoints, but don't use your margins here and your columns as some sort of

52
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,970
padding.

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,650
You could do that if it's actually intentional, but it's just something that you should stick to as

54
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,580
much as possible.

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,510
So next rule is full bleed elements.

56
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,100
Now this little landing page header over here.

57
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,430
It bleeds right off of our grid.

58
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,740
It's going right into the margin.

59
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,440
And the reason for that is that they should go beyond your grid and stretch to the edge of your artboard.

60
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,820
So it's going to extend your right directly to the frame, and that's fine.

61
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,840
The content within is going to adhere to this.

62
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,960
Generally, people say like hero images or headers and footers don't necessarily adhere to your grid.

63
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:17,750
I like to keep the content within those things adhering to my 12 column grid at all times.

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,100
But the images, if you want them to be full bleed, I think it's best especially for communication

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,090
between yourself and your product team to just bleed them right across.

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,970
During implementation, this will go 100% with right across to your your screen and that's it.

67
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,610
You're pretty much good to go.

68
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,790
And you can go off and build your own grid for your own designs.

69
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,530
And I think a great thing to do is try and build a mobile grid for our app that we're trying to build

70
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,390
for habitual.

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,960
So have fun.

72
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,950
Just remember how fun.

73
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,480
I mean, it's easy to create those styles, like we said before, and follow these guidelines.
