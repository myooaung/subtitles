1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,510
Guess what?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,780
You have just found your first client.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,750
And this guy, his name is Bruno.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,970
He has a huge idea.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,510
They're going to create a new product to take on Amazon.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,560
You see, shopping on Amazon isn't the best.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:24,200
I mean, sure, you can find lots of stuff, but the whole experience design, there's room for improvement.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,290
And Bruno, that works at CATCo Corp., one of the fastest growing tech companies in the world.

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,930
Well, he wants to take on Amazon and build their own shopping experience.

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:42,940
And they found you as a designer to lead the charge, to design their product, their mobile and web

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,860
presence to take on Amazon.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,580
Now, this is the first part of any design project that you may have.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,820
It's this idea of meeting the client.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:01,720
You meet someone that needs your expertise, but you're taking this course because you're starting from

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,020
scratch or you already have some knowledge and you want to improve upon it now because everyone has

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,490
different skill levels.

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:15,850
With this course, we're going to assume you have already met the client and you're starting to work

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,280
right away, just like we have with Bruno.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,950
At the end of the course, we have some extra bits for you to show you how you may find and get your

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,850
first clients.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,660
But we also want to start with the actual practical designer things to get started on the course because

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,670
I know you're getting excited to learn.

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,750
So the first step that we're going to take is to learn the skills and have that dream portfolio by the

24
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,740
end of this course.

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:49,660
So we're going to start designing the product that Bruno wants and eventually have a finished design

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,200
system and portfolio so that when we come back to this idea of meeting a client, you already have the

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,140
portfolio and the skill set needed to start looking for your first clients, whether it's on a freelance

28
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,690
website or just an existing client.

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,110
Ray But here's a quick thing to get you started when meeting a client, the whole thing is about solving

30
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,110
their problems.

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,230
When you meet a client, can you solve their problems?

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,320
Are you the person that can take what they say and wow them?

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,460
Are you the expert that they have been looking for all along?

34
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,710
You see, people want somebody that makes their life easier, not harder.

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,770
By the way, you might be wondering something.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,310
Why are we saying product designer here?

37
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,970
Isn't this a web and mobile designer course?

38
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,040
Well, yeah, it is.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,850
But the idea of design and designing as we're going to find out throughout the course isn't necessarily

40
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,060
just about the web or just about mobile.

41
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Our technology is constantly evolving.

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,540
There's new platforms coming out all the time and a designer should be flexible.

43
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:09,380
Sure, we can just learn web development, but then what happens if we want to build a mobile app or

44
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,300
a VR app or any sort of product that can be on any platform?

45
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:22,610
So we want to describe this course as a product designer because you can design on any platform for

46
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,020
any product.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,860
So although we might use web design, mobile design, product design as a term, in the end, we want

48
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:38,930
to build the skill set so that you can design for any platform that are out there right now and also

49
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,250
future platforms.

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:50,450
So our job as designers is to understand the need of the client and create designs that they themselves

51
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,710
aren't able to do.

52
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:59,510
Now, Bruno wants to build this massive shopping experience online that can take on Amazon.

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,090
So how are we going to do that?

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:09,080
Well, let's dive in and let's start exploring the world of design, the processes and how we might

55
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,290
go about designing a beautiful product.
