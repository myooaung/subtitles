1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,560
So in other scenario I often find myself in is one word.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,120
They just come to you with a brand like you may be working on a product company and they only have the

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,310
brand and they have no typefaces necessarily chosen or there's really no knowledge around typefaces

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,870
and what typefaces to use.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,330
You may be working at a consultancy and a client comes in and has a brand and that's all they have.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,620
So in this scenario, what I would do is I would really think about what the brand is like, what are

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,530
the goals of the product, what are you trying to build?

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,420
What platform are you on?

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,350
Everything.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,690
So in our case, we have a client right here, a habitual and it's a nice little logo.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,230
I like it.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,550
It's really fun.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,180
It's.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,080
It's really modern.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,040
Let's zoom in here.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,370
I like the little smile over here on the bag.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,770
This typeface is Gilroy.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,910
Really nice typeface, really geometric, but it's more, I guess, used for display and it isn't necessarily

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,660
the best typeface for all types of applications, whether that's like using it for body copy, using

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,560
different buttons.

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,600
And I'm trying to look for a typeface that's going to help us build our application.

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,590
One thing I'm going to think about, though, is the client and the product that we're trying to build.

23
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,340
So I need to build a product that users are going to trust.

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,110
So, I mean, I'm going to avoid display typefaces that may be too funky or handwriting based typefaces

25
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,340
or script typefaces.

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,330
I think I'm going to stick with something a little more modern, probably a sans serif.

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,260
I want the content to be really clear.

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,890
I think like we're working with users, buying products or searching for products they need to be able

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,210
to read really quickly.

30
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,110
Buttons need to be really readable, legible, content prices, like all that kind of stuff.

31
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,260
We need to really take into account on what type of typeface is going to be really great for that.

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,340
That's definitely going to be in the back of my head.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,320
One other thing is I'm working on mobile, so I don't think we necessarily need more than one typeface

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,620
in this instance, especially for the type of product that we're building.

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,710
So I'm probably going to stick to one and that's totally fine.

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,730
And my goal here is to pick a typeface that is really versatile.

37
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,870
So it has enough visual contrast, it has enough font styles.

38
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,800
So let's jump right into Google fonts and I'll show you how it works.

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,620
So hey, welcome.

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,560
We're in Google Fonts right now, and this is a great site for getting free fonts.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,470
I mean, a variety of really high quality fonts, too.

42
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,710
So this is what I use all the time.

43
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,590
If I don't have like a paid font or I don't have a font within Figma Figma actually comes, there's

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,040
an option for you to actually have all the Google fonts preloaded in there.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,480
So that's great.

46
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,180
The only thing is this is probably a better way to test what fonts you may like and font styles.

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:03,580
So what I usually do here is I come to this page, I may type something like let's think of like a headline

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,920
that our client may have like find.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
The stuff.

50
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,330
That you love.

51
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,930
So I can already see, like, something like this is definitely not going to work, but I'm not going

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,720
to go through 993 families, which is it's a lot.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:30,190
I can bump up the pixels in terms of the typefaces over here that are being displayed.

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,230
I'd like to go into the categories.

55
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,980
And for this instance, like I said before, I'm going to go with a sans serif.

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Let's just select that.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,120
So now we're down to 300 families.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,790
We're going to do is I'm going to think about my font properties.

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,440
I want enough styles.

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,600
I don't want to have just one just because it's going to really limit us in terms of creating enough

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,950
contrast on screen.

62
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,380
So I think six plus is fine.

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,880
That may be even pushing it, but we'll figure this out.

64
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,680
The great thing about Google Fonts is so let's take Roboto.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,620
Roboto is like one of the most popular fonts.

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,630
You'll see this on Android a bunch.

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,190
So you'll see all the different font styles that they have.

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,810
You'll be able to.

69
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,670
Bring up the size and you can even select a style.

70
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,579
So if you want to stick to an individual style, this is great.

71
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,910
You can also look over here and you can download them from here.

72
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,800
You can also embed them.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,470
So if you're coding or you need to get it for your developer, like this is a great way to do that.

74
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,450
You can even get the import code.

75
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,010
So really great resource in order for getting all that kind of content.

76
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,430
What I'd like to do is.

77
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,540
I don't like to.

78
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Get all the different styles individually.

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,220
I'll just download the font in one shot and that just makes it so much easier.

80
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,300
If I download that, I'll see Roboto and I'll be in my downloads folder and I'll just kind of unzip

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,890
that.

82
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,610
I already have the fun, so I don't need to do this, but I'll just unzip that and click on those fonts

83
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,540
to add them and then restart Figma and it'll be right there.

84
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:10,670
So I'm going to go through a bunch of different types of typefaces over here and choose like I like

85
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,090
to choose around like five just to give me enough variety.

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,230
I'm definitely going to, I'm, I don't know if I'm going to choose open sounds.

87
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,460
I like lotto.

88
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,160
Lotto, whatever you want to call it.

89
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,900
This is a great one.

90
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,460
I mean, really legible.

91
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,440
And I like the different types of variation in in each letter form.

92
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,970
So let's just bring this up like, I like just like kind of like the soft edges here.

93
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,880
I think it kind of contrasts our brand just a little bit.

94
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,300
But, you know, it's also a really clear typeface.

95
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,040
So that's an option.

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,430
So I'm going to choose later.

97
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,920
So I'll just download it, say I already have it, but I'll download that.

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,840
What else is there?

99
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,370
Let's take a look.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,080
See Monstera.

101
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,040
It's a little too wide and I don't like that for like when you're trying to do copy because it just

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,420
stretches everything out.

103
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,190
Source Sense Pro is another great one, but I think it's a little too condensed.

104
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,710
You'll notice that it looks a little squished.

105
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,540
What else do we have here?

106
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:16,380
Poppins is a really nice one for just being geometric, but the problem I find with this is that let's

107
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,950
zoom in.

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,440
You know, all these thickened thins make things a little harder to read.

109
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,810
It's a cool find, like I've used it in the past.

110
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,600
What else do we have here?

111
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,530
Hmm?

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,470
We have a lot of different types.

113
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,710
Ooh.

114
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,460
I like.

115
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,990
I like cabinet a lot.

116
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,460
I think we can use cabinet.

117
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,360
I'm going to pick this one.

118
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
And I think there's enough variety here.

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,370
We may run into issues of contrast between different types of elements like headlines and body copy

120
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,300
or buttons.

121
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,090
I actually like having a lot, so I'm just going to.

122
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,240
Pick that one up.

123
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,070
So I'm going to download the family just to show you that it's being downloaded and what I have thus

124
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,640
far.

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,360
What else do you have here?

126
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,000
So Overpass is really interesting.

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,640
I remember our logo had a little kind of like slant.

128
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,320
So and I thought that was really interesting.

129
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,820
And maybe this can match it.

130
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,750
Maybe it can be like a closer variation.

131
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,230
So we'll pick that one up to.

132
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,710
I like Merriweather, but I think this is too close to, like, a sans serif with all the different

133
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,230
types of intricacies over here.

134
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,340
And the U.

135
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,330
The Y.

136
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,780
What else can we choose?

137
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,180
Inters.

138
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,000
Nice one.

139
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,400
Yeah.

140
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,420
Let's take a look.

141
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,370
And it has a lot of styles.

142
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,560
I think this is this is good.

143
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,560
I think Inter is a very safe typeface.

144
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,360
Kind of have like the vibes of like.

145
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,500
Kind of like Helvetica a bit, just in terms of like some of the letter forms.

146
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,130
So I think this is kind of safe, but.

147
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,810
We'll bring it on board and we'll take a look after.

148
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,030
What else?

149
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,030
I think we should probably grab, like, one more.

150
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,940
I want to go for something a little bit more geometric because I like how geometric the wordmark is

151
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,540
for our typeface in terms of like the habitual branding.

152
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,230
I like how it's really round.

153
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,490
Oh, there you go.

154
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,159
So this kind of looks like Futura Jost is a really nice one, too.

155
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,880
I think we're going to run into some issues of legibility just because if you look at the X height here.

156
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,220
It's really small, and that's usually one of the problems of these geometric types of fonts.

157
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,430
But I think it's something to try out of these really harsh too.

158
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:50,820
But.

159
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,610
Let's download it.

160
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,520
So what I'll do now is like I have a bunch of different typefaces down here.

161
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,870
I will extract them from the zip folder and I will bring them into Figma and jump right into Figma and

162
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,400
start playing around with them.

163
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,650
Now you don't have to limit yourself to five.

164
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,520
You can do a bunch.

165
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,350
I mean, you don't want to go overboard but make it manageable and try to think about the different

166
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:22,610
types of typefaces that are going to really work with your brand and that tone and the types of typefaces

167
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,960
that are actually going to work for the product you're trying to build.

168
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,190
So I'm thinking a lot about clarity.

169
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,530
I'm thinking a lot about making sure that there is a hierarchy between different things, because if

170
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,770
I think about the different types of content that I'm going to have to produce, there's titles for

171
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,540
products, there's prices.

172
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,320
There may be like little pills like or chips that say like sale.

173
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,420
There may be like some description copy.

174
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,550
So I mean, already in that little component, there are so many different type elements and I need

175
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,830
to make sure that there's enough contrast there.

176
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,750
So I'm going to jump into Figma and start playing around with these typefaces.
