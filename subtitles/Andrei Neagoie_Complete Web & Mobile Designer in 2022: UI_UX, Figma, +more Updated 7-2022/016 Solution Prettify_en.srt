00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,750
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,210
Let's take just 5 minutes to quickly make this website a little bit prettier.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:14,480
Just to show you how easy it is to customize a website once you have the layout done, I recommend a

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,690
step that I've mentioned multiple times.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,810
When you build a website, figure out your layout, make it responsive, and once that's done, the

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,850
rest is kind of fun.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,170
You just add nice CSS properties, some images to just pretty ify it.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:37,420
So in our case, I want to show you a website called well, --, X, Y, Z, and it's going to really

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:46,450
help you out because well, it gives you free design resources to use and they have fonts, illustrations,

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,860
mockups, UI kits, everything for free that you can use on your website.

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:01:00,280
In our case, we can use something like on draw over here that gives us a ton of MIT illustrated or

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,840
licensed illustrations.

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,630
So if I go to browse now, we see that we have a ton of images that we can use.

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:15,500
So in my case, I've downloaded one of these images and we're going to use it as our cover photo.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:24,170
So let's go back to our project and in my cover photo over here, instead of just having cover with

16
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,040
exclamation marks, I'll just have an image tag.

17
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,750
That will have a class of.

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:37,340
Cover a property that we're going to or cease class that we'll use.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,560
And it's going to link to the image that I just downloaded in my image is folder.

20
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,120
Again, this should already be in your starter file so that I gave to you.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,190
So if you look in that folder, you'll see that we have an image folder.

22
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,460
And from there we're going to grab the on draw dot.

23
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,610
JPEG.

24
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:09,020
If I save this and refresh it and make sure I finish that off with an ending bracket and I refresh and

25
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,860
this is a PNG that's refresh that's a lot better.

26
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,050
But boy, that's a big image.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,220
We can easily fix this by going to our style.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,070
Going to our cover and using the cover class that we've added to the image to just say that we want

29
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,640
the width to be well, we can say 100% that, but that might be too big.

30
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,810
I don't like it that big.

31
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,930
Let's do.

32
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,140
30 AM m if I refresh or m if I refresh, that's better.

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,870
But we want to get rid of this red background.

34
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,270
Now let's have everything in white.

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,030
It's going to go up to our zone.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,040
And we can just actually remove the red from here.

37
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,490
If I refresh.

38
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,240
Much better.

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,180
Now it looks a lot better.

40
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:03,780
All right.

41
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:12,750
So as we see, the image size isn't growing, which is good, but it looks nice and pretty as the cover

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,230
photo.

43
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,290
Another thing that I noticed is that when I scroll down, I want the header tab to be sticky.

44
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,880
That is to scroll with me.

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,180
And that's another common pattern that we'll see that's fairly easy to do.

46
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,860
We can just give the nav element a sticky class and this sticky class.

47
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,440
I can say that they'll have possession of fixed.

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,230
And a top of zero that is sort of top.

49
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:58,190
And if I refresh this, it will actually because of the position fixed, although it works now, it

50
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,450
messed up our width.

51
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,890
So we want to make sure that the width is always 100%.

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,990
So all we would do is at the end say with 100%.

53
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,880
Again, these three properties together is a common pattern that you'll see to make.

54
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,360
To make navigation sticky so that now when I scroll down, look at that.

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,840
Our navigation is nice and sticky.

56
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,900
Let's make that green navigation bar blue.

57
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,720
So I'll turn this into blue.

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,160
All right.

59
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,420
That looks a lot better.

60
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,520
What else?

61
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,290
We can change our font.

62
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,230
Let's say to something.

63
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,450
Prettier font family.

64
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,310
Let's just say Arial fire refresh.

65
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,650
All right.

66
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,720
That looks a little bit cleaner.

67
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,580
What else can we do here?

68
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,930
Well, just to finish it off, maybe we want to do something different when we hover over the zone.

69
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,430
Let's say that with the boxes, when we hover over them, I can just copy and paste this.

70
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,830
Let's make them tilt a little bit.

71
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,450
So I'll say box.

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,680
And instead of shadow or box shadow, we'll say transform.

73
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,090
And we'll just say that we want to rotate.

74
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,010
Say negative seven degrees.

75
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,440
If I save and refresh, look at that.

76
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,140
We have some grid systems that when we hover over them, they rotate seven degrees.

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,250
I mean, I wanted to demonstrate to you how fast we can convert a website to start looking good.

78
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,950
By no means is this perfect.

79
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:05,660
But by just changing a few properties, we've now gone from this to our final view.

80
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:15,560
And you can imagine how within a day of improving this website, making this a little bit prettier,

81
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,360
maybe you really like.

82
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,030
This website's cards that they have here.

83
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,210
So you can just inspect the element.

84
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,750
And perhaps just copy their CSS styles.

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,700
But there's a lot of flexibility here.

86
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:43,670
The important point, though, is the fact that you start with your layout using Flexbox and CSS grid.

87
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,400
And then it's really up to you and your creativity to design beautiful websites.

88
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,280
I hope that was fun.

89
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
I definitely had a lot of fun playing with CSS.

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,280
Great.

91
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,270
And Flexbox.

92
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,340
And I'll see you in the next video.

93
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,360
Bye bye.
