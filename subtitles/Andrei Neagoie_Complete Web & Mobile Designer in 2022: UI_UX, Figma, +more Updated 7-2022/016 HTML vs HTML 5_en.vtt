00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.850
Wow.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.800
Good job for still hanging in there.

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.220
It only gets more and more exciting from here.

4
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.960
We're just scratching the surface with the power that comes with being a web developer.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.630
But I want to quickly talk about HTML versus HTML five.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.380
I've mentioned this topic a few times, but just kind of brushed it off and told you, Yeah, this is

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.980
a HTML.

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.330
Yeah, this is a HTML five.

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:32.850
But I wanted to just take a break and quickly go over the basic concept of what HTML five is, if you

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.770
remember in our diagram.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.640
HTML when it first got started in 1989 to 1991, it wasn't as elaborate.

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.750
It didn't have as many features as it has now.

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.630
We want to make sure that all these browsers play nicely and understand our HTML rules.

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.470
So if you remember our friend Tim, our first web developer, the guy who created the World Wide Web,

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.640
has a governing body that establishes what a HTML should look like so that these individual browsers

16
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.570
can know how to code their browsers so that it reads HTML properly.

17
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.210
And obviously the web that we had in the nineties is very different than the one that we have now.

18
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.360
So there's a lot of new things that we need to update and some of those things are phones and we have

19
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.180
tablets and just overall, we need more power for HTML.

20
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.830
So HTML five was the evolution and there were many, many evolutions of HTML.

21
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:47.010
HTML five is the latest one where we try to add on features so that we can improve the user experience.

22
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.120
Now, what are some of those features?

23
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.310
Let's take a quick look at our good old friend W three schools.

24
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.430
One of the things that HTML5 wants to do is we want to make sure that it doesn't affect any old website.

25
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.539
If you remember our very first website from Tim, maybe in 1991.

26
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.000
Well, that still works to this day.

27
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.880
We visited it in the previous videos.

28
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.000
You can still visit websites from the nineties because we want to make sure that everything is backwards

29
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.730
compatible.

30
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.770
That's a fancy way of saying older versions are not obsolete.

31
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.610
But we also want to tack on these features and you can read on the website all the information of HTML

32
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.180
five and what it does and some of the things that it supports.

33
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.740
And it does get a little technical and we don't need to get into it too much.

34
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.860
But the one thing that I want to emphasize that it introduced this idea of semantic elements.

35
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.770
And what that means is they wanted to make websites more descriptive.

36
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.700
Search engines such as Google go on websites and they use these things called crawlers to look through

37
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.800
your website, these machines that are reading your HTML to understand what your website is, what the

38
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.200
topic about it is, so that they can rank it in search engines and HTML five semantic elements tries

39
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.620
to add a little bit more meaning for these robots so that when they encounter something, it makes a

40
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.430
little bit more sense.

41
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.500
So this is an example of some of these new tags that HTML five introduced, and let's show you a few

42
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.080
of them.

43
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.080
So for example, if we wanted to comment this out, we know how to do that already.

44
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.230
And a semantic element would maybe look like header.

45
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.400
Where we have the title H one, which is register.

46
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.660
And we close the header so that now the crawler knows that this is our header and maybe we have some

47
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.100
navigation links.

48
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:08.260
So now we can have a tags with our ref and we'll just say that it links to Google and then we close

49
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.220
the nav.

50
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.360
We only have one navigation link for now, but I just want to demonstrate quickly.

51
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.730
And finally we have.

52
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.410
A footer.

53
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.020
So within the footer we can add something like.

54
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.990
Website made with love.

55
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.170
And you can see over here that this even to a machine, if it understands what header means and NAV

56
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.890
means and photo means gives a lot more meaning to the webpage and it will have a better idea of how

57
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.290
the website is structured and where its your rank in their Google search results.

58
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.680
You can take your time and breathe through some of these tags and I do recommend that you visit this

59
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.560
website and go through some of the HTML intro.

60
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.170
You'll even see that if we click on input types.

61
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.850
So something that we visited already and we scroll to some of the attributes.

62
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.020
You'll see that there's some new HTML five.

63
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.420
They have these little icon over here that have been introduced.

64
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.050
So we're constantly expanding to make HTML better and better functionality.

65
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.970
You can see here min for example, we use that for password if you remember, specifies the minimum

66
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.170
value for an input field.

67
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:37.000
So if I set a min over here, then it makes sure that I enter the minimum amount of value.

68
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.010
But again, you can take a look at it yourself.

69
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:47.770
The issue with semantic web is that it's still fairly new, so you won't see as much.

70
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.860
Of this.

71
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.620
You will own some websites, but it's very hard to prove that ADE actually has good SEO performance

72
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.450
because it's still fairly early.

73
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.510
But just so you don't get surprised and you're aware of what's happening, it is something that you

74
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.290
might encounter.

75
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.280
But overall h html five tries to improve the performance of the web because we're constantly evolving.

76
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:25.880
And just like websites need to go from simple HTML text based websites to massive websites like Twitter

77
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.930
that you can post and talk to millions of people around the world where we need our Web technologies

78
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.130
to evolve with us.

79
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.930
I'll see you in the next one.

80
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.870
Bye bye.
