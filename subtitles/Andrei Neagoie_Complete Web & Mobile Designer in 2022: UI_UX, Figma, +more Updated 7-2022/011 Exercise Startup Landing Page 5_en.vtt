00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.700
All right, it's time to talk about layout.

2
00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, we already learned how well layout works in bootstrap, and we talked about why Bootstrap became

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.900
so popular.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.470
Now, don't worry.

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.220
Later on in the course, I'm going to introduce you to topics like CSS grid and actually talk about

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.180
really easy ways to do layout on a page.

7
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.130
But for now, we want us to use bootstrap because that's what we learned.

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.850
And I'm warning you, this is going to seem very overwhelming.

9
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.030
I want to show you how bootstrap does layout, because down the road when I introduce you to things

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.270
like CSS grid, you're going to see how much easier we have it now than we had maybe a few years ago.

11
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.660
But I still want you to learn how layout is done in bootstrap because you will encounter it throughout

12
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.440
your career.

13
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.570
Now, if you go to the layout section on the bootstrap documentation, you see over here that it has

14
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.450
some pretty good information.

15
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.910
We can look at the grids and we've already talked about how grid works with bootstrap.

16
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.340
Now the first thing we want to do is to have a container and then maybe some rows that we can use columns

17
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.970
on.

18
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.440
So if we go back to our page and we open up the index HTML file, the first thing I want to do around

19
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.870
the body and one thing I will do with my sublime text here is actually minimize the head tag here just

20
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.860
so we can see a little bit.

21
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.170
So I'm going to just click on this and look at that.

22
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.480
It's minimized so I can just focus on the body.

23
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.710
The first thing I want to do is say that I want to create a div with a class of container.

24
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.800
Just like that.

25
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.590
And then we'll close this.

26
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.450
Right over here.

27
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.710
So let's indent that properly.

28
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.990
Let's save and refresh.

29
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.440
All right.

30
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.240
We have everything in a container.

31
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.620
Next is that we want to ideally all of these things to be in a row.

32
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.640
So we want the H one, the air and the button to just be a row, one row that we have that is in the

33
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.840
center of the page.

34
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:15.820
So I'm just going to wrap this in a div and give it a class of row.

35
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.480
So once again, let's close the div.

36
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.730
And indent this again if I refresh.

37
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.900
Not much has changed.

38
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.430
We may have lost the air.

39
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.500
We'll get back to that in a second.

40
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
But we have a row now so that if I inspect, let's say a view.

41
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.300
Developer tools.

42
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.120
And I click on this inspect.

43
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.710
I see well these elements if I go over here and let's open this up, make this a little bit smaller,

44
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.680
we see that we have the body, we have the div, which is the container, and then we have the row right

45
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.070
here.

46
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.330
All right, let me close this.

47
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.050
Let's divide up these items into different sections.

48
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:15.010
We have the header element that we can use and this header element will contain the H one over here.

49
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.290
So we have the header.

50
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.510
And one thing that we can use with bootstrap is a class called.

51
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.670
Text center and text center.

52
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.520
As you might guess, if I refresh centers the text.

53
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.840
So that's great.

54
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.700
That's our header element.

55
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.630
And we also want to create another section here.

56
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.160
Let's call it section.

57
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.080
So this is a section element and this section element.

58
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.350
We'll also have the class.

59
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.570
Text Center.

60
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.210
So if I refresh.

61
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.160
There you go.

62
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.010
We got our HR horizontal line back and.

63
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.010
Hmm.

64
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.560
Why isn't this centered?

65
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.340
Let's inspect this and find out.

66
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.060
So I can open developer tools by pressing command option I or control option I if you're on a windows.

67
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.880
And let's look at the elements.

68
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.320
We have the container.

69
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.430
We have the row.

70
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.130
We have the header and then we have the section.

71
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.940
Hmm.

72
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.990
Now we see over here that these ones aren't taking up the full width as we would want of the container.

73
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.810
And we've seen this before with bootstrap, right?

74
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:45.110
We have to use this columns to tell it, hey, we want to contain or expand along the column.

75
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.330
And because Bootstrap uses a 12 grid system, we can just say in here and that the header we want the

76
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.790
column 12 grid and then for the section we want the column 12.

77
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.280
Great.

78
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.260
So if I refresh.

79
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.890
There you go.

80
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.570
Look at that.

81
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.820
If I go over here, I see that we have the row, we have the header, and then we have the text, which,

82
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.500
as you can see, contains.

83
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.430
The full amount of the container in the blue.

84
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.450
That's looking a lot better.

85
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.250
That's great.

86
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.070
Now, if I close this hour text and button, it's still at the top.

87
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.240
Ideally, it's in the middle of the image.

88
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.640
How can we fix this?

89
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
Now this part is really, really tricky.

90
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.860
If I actually search vertical alignment here.

91
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:50.390
You'll see that bootstrap has some vertical alignment options, but these ones are using inline and

92
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.280
light block and line table, which is actually not the recommended way.

93
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.590
Now, the way we're going to do this is we're going to use Flex.

94
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:09.570
And this is a new feature with Bootstrap because they're using the flex box utilities that we've learned

95
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.100
about.

96
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.840
Right.

97
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:20.880
So if I go over here, you can see that I can activate the flex box system by using the DX flex class.

98
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:30.570
So if I copy this and go to container and say dy flex if I refresh, all right, nothing happened because

99
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.970
we've just enabled flex box.

100
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.180
But now we want to make sure that we can place things vertically in the center.

101
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.400
And this if we scroll down is what we want right here a line items.

102
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.250
If we look over here, it's a line items center.

103
00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:04.340
So if I copy this, which is this one over here and we add a line items center if I refresh.

104
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.680
Hmm.

105
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.680
This isn't working.

106
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.610
And this is a little tricky.

107
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.590
And I'm showing you this just to understand how to debug things.

108
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.540
So let's say you just did this, and for some reason you don't understand why this isn't working on

109
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.800
the documentation page.

110
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.880
Clearly, it shows us that this should be working.

111
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.630
Well, we can inspect, so let's right click inspect.

112
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.870
And have a look at our HTML page.

113
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.020
We have the container and then the body.

114
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.740
Now you see here how everything is in the container.

115
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.890
And as a matter of fact, if we look at the container, we're actually aligning items in the center

116
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.490
because the container is actually not the full page.

117
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.100
It's only the top part, right?

118
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.450
It's just this part.

119
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.640
So here the container is not fully.

120
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.560
Covering the page.

121
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:08.040
So what we need to do, just like we have in body, if we look at style here.

122
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.510
You see how we have height of 100%.

123
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:18.890
All we need to do is tell the container that, Hey, I want you to span the entire height of the page.

124
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.600
And in bootstrap, we can do that by saying height 100.

125
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.450
Instead of adding the CSS style.

126
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.630
If I save this and refresh.

127
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.200
Look at that.

128
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:40.110
If I hover, you'll see that my container is now the full length of the page and our writing is right

129
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.740
in the middle.

130
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.340
If I scroll up or down, look at that.

131
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.780
It's adjusting properly.

132
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.610
Everything is centered.

133
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.100
That's great.

134
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.640
Now, don't worry if this takes you a long time to figure out.

135
00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:01.250
Sometimes it involves googling around figure things out, like it said later on in the CSS layout section

136
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.800
of the course.

137
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.730
I'll actually show you how to make this so much simpler.

138
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.300
Now, the last thing I want to do is, well, right here, I want to have a bit of space between the

139
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.890
writing and the button.

140
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.020
So what can we do here?

141
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:23.440
I want another section in between these two to hopefully buffer them away from each other so we can

142
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.900
create that fairly easily.

143
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:33.400
We can just add a new div and we'll give it a class here of Buffer that we'll have to write ourselves.

144
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:41.980
And this buffer class will be in between the header and then the horizontal line and the bun.

145
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:49.540
So let's also give this a column of 12 because we want to make sure that it covers the entire area.

146
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:55.210
But right now there's nothing if I right click here and inspect.

147
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.980
You'll see here that I have the buffer, but the buffer doesn't have anything.

148
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.460
It's completely empty because, well, there's nothing inside here.

149
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.290
But we can add a style, let's say dot buffer.

150
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.420
And this buffer will have a height of.

151
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:16.600
Hmm.

152
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.590
What should we say?

153
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.970
Well, if I do, let's say 50 pixels and I refresh.

154
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:23.560
Look at that.

155
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.110
I get a nice little buffer.

156
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:33.280
So now if I scroll over to Buffer, you see that I have a 50 pixel height buffer, but I always like

157
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.230
using RAM instead of pixels.

158
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.880
So let's do m, let's see what five ram means.

159
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.930
All right, that's good.

160
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.860
Maybe.

161
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.840
A little bit more.

162
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.390
Let's do ten REM.

163
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.480
Let's save and refresh.

164
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.080
All right.

165
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.740
That looks actually quite nice.

166
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.290
If I close this tab.

167
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.160
Open it up.

168
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.620
Yeah, look at that.

169
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.130
That looks really, really nice.

170
00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.830
And there we go.

171
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.420
We have our startup landing page right here.

172
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.020
Everything looks pretty nice, right?

173
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.660
And the way we've organized things seems pretty clean.

174
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.230
Our button is well when we hover.

175
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:12.820
Available.

176
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.950
But whenever I click on this button, nothing's happening.

177
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:26.890
Ideally, we have a new page that opens up so that we can enter or our customers can enter their emails.

178
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.550
And this is the exciting part that we're going to get to in the next video.

179
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.930
I'll see you in that one.

180
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.830
Bye bye.
