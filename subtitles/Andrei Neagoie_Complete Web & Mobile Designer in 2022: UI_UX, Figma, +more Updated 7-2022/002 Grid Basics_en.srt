1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,750
So before we can even jump into actually building it, let's talk about some of the basics that impact

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,200
all the different decisions surrounding sizing, measuring and spacing.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,940
The first thing base units.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,530
What is a base unit?

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,760
This is our starting point.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,960
This is ground zero.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,370
Let's define a base unit.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,420
Now, this is what defines what every single measurement will be.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:29,950
A multiple of why this makes our designs consistent, improves how we hand off to developers and reduces

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,350
the amount of decisions we need to make as a designer.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,810
So what should you set your base unit to?

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,160
I use an eight pixel base unit because it makes scaling for a variety of devices really easy.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,860
Most screen sizes are divisible by eight.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,870
It's also divisible by itself.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,000
Eight divided by two equals four.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,830
Eight divided by four equals two.

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,980
There are even four pixels, five pixels, six pixels, and even ten pixel increments.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,270
There is no wrong answer here.

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,950
Like I said, I like using pixels and spacing icons by four pixel half step.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:05,630
Right here we have an eight pixel base unit and you can see it spaced out to 16, 24, 32 and so on

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,650
and so forth.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,930
Up next is sizing.

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,160
Now, all UI elements should be measured in increments of our base unit.

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,470
This helps us with a bunch of things like clear alignment, consistency and hierarchy.

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,310
Let's take a look at the difference between the two here.

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,540
One is using an eight pixel base unit.

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,780
The other one isn't really using anything, and there's just no rhythm.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,710
You know, it may seem minuscule, but if I were checking out an A product or a website and I came across

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,470
a credit card input like this paired with all these different UI elements, I would think twice about

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,180
entering my information padding.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,630
This is the space between all of our elements and you guessed it, it is measured based off of our base

32
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,170
unit.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,380
This makes spacing consistent, readable to our users.

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,710
Think about this card over here.

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,640
All elements are spaced using increments from an apex or base unit.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,860
It creates uniformity.

37
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,270
We have 16 pixels on this side, 16 pixels over here.

38
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,320
We got 16 pixels here.

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,870
You see on this grid, on the bottom, these rows, which we'll get into soon, we've got four pixels,

40
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,280
four pixels, four pixels.

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,220
Next is layout.

42
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,240
So what do all these lines and boxes mean?

43
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,150
What are they?

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,400
These are some questions you may be asking.

45
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,260
Let's talk about the anatomy of a grid.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,780
All grids are made up of three key things columns, gutters and margins.

47
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,920
The first one is called let's cover that, our vertical blocks right here, that span left to right.

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,790
So right here on this page, we've got a little four column grid.

49
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:46,440
And generally the column width won't change, but the number of columns change from 12 on desktop,

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
maybe eight to tablet.

51
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,380
Some people like four on mobile.

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,240
I mean, you can use anything you want.

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,070
I like to use six on mobile because it gives me a flexibility to place three elements in a row on the

54
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,400
screen.

55
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,140
I even like to use eight on mobile.

56
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,340
Like I said, if you want to hang things off the screen, we'll see that later on.

57
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,230
But nothing is set in stone.

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,820
Gutters.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,540
This is the whitespace right here, right between columns.

60
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,570
They're dedicated, based off of your base units.

61
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,640
So some designs will increase that size as you scale up or decrease it as you scale down.

62
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,320
Other grids can stay fixed.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,550
It's not really set in stone.

64
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,170
So right over here, this is probably like a 16 pixel gutter based off of a pixel base unit.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,710
Margins are the whitespace between the edge of your column and the edge of your frame.

66
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,700
You can combine all these elements to build different types of grids.

67
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,820
The manuscript grid, we saw this before.

68
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,930
It kind of looks like a grid for a manuscript, right?

69
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,290
Well, it could be useful for defining margins and for large blocks of text.

70
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,760
This is the most popular one.

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,350
The column grid kind of looks like the grid you see today, kind of what we've shown off.

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,760
Now, these are the types of grids we mostly use and these columns are spaced evenly, and that is where

73
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,840
we start to align our content.

74
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,660
Most grids utilize 12 columns and you may be asking, well, why 12?

75
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:08,320
Well, 12 columns can be divided into halves, thirds, fourths and six.

76
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,630
This helps for designing for responsive screens, the modular grid.

77
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,170
This is a variation of the column grid we saw before.

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,170
You'll notice that they have both vertical and horizontal rows.

79
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,390
So we have vertical columns going left to right, horizontal rows and top to bottom.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,740
And this creates these modules that provide some additional options for single or larger box.

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,060
The baseline grid.

82
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,380
Now, this one's important.

83
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,910
You just want all the time as well.

84
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,190
I like to couple this with my column grid.

85
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,820
They consist of these horizontal rows that you see here from top to bottom, and these provide guidance

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,920
for typography and UI elements.

87
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,540
They create vertical rhythm.

88
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,930
And think of when you were in school and you used to write on a piece of paper.

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,850
Yeah, it's similar to that.

90
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,250
And yes, it's based off of your base unit.

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,920
I like to use a four pixel baseline grid.

92
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:11,780
Now placing typography on a baseline grid you use line height and this is that bounding box right around

93
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,500
your type.

94
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,790
So say your font size is something like 16 pixels.

95
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,870
You know, your line height could be something like 24 pixels.

96
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,940
We have maybe like a 40 pixel type set over here for the headline and our font size for the headline

97
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:34,020
and for the line height, we have something like 48 pixels, so multiply by eight and on that baseline

98
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,390
grid, so we got four pixel here for pixel here.

99
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,860
So we got eight pixel spacing between the top and the bottom here.

100
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,050
We got 12 between the sub header and the copy.

101
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,710
So this creates this vertical rhythm that really helps to create consistency throughout your whole piece.

102
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,690
Let's jump into responsive grids and figma.
