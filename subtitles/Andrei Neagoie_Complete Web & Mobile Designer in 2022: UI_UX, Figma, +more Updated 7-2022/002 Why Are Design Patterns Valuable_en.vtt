00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.830
So people often ask like, why are design patterns valuable?

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.260
Well, I mean, they solve a lot of the problems that we have the solution for.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.470
So people will naturally look for patterns.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.060
I mean, this is huge.

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.190
People are always looking for patterns.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.290
So when we think about when we arrive on a product, we have a good understanding of how things will

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.970
work.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.370
We often think we already know where to click.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.350
I mean, this is based on all our prior experiences dealing with other applications and the solutions

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.370
that they've used.

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.790
So you wouldn't necessarily go out there and create like an entirely new design pattern for something

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.370
that is kind of mainstream.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.180
When sites incorporate known patterns, users often have an easier time getting where they're going

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.930
or accomplishing their goals.

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.300
Some would argue that if we all use design patterns, our sites may look cookie cutter like.

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.950
But most designers will agree that there are significant benefits to following established patterns.

17
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:12.270
And then, you know, you can tweak them a tiny bit, which could be to match like your style and your

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.350
design system.

19
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.950
But the benefit would be to provide a more delightful user experience for your users.

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.620
Using standard design patterns reduces cognitive strain.

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.590
So if people are already familiar with how like objects on the interface will act, it's kind of saves

22
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
them the time from thinking about what they should be doing or what they should be doing next.

23
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.110
Reducing the need for people to actually think is so important if you'd like to keep them as users.

24
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.140
Also, I mean, designers also benefit from using patterns.

25
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
It saves us from constantly having to reinvent the wheel.

26
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.080
Like I mentioned before, engineers have kind of known this for a long time.

27
00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.230
They kind of have like these large repositories or open source code that have like large components

28
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.210
and they kind of can recycle them themselves.

29
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.720
They really depends on how they build their applications, but rewriting similar code from scratch is

30
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.100
going to take them way longer than necessarily copy and pasting and tweaking.

31
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.160
So designers who use design patterns can free up time for creating and tweaking, which is kind of like

32
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.150
the really fun part.

33
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.930
And that's why there's so valuable.
