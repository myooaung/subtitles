00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.850
So designing websites and apps, I mean, sounds pretty easy, right?

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.020
Everybody can do it.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:15.180
Well, not really, because when you first think about design, most people don't consider all the things

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.540
that go into designing a beautiful product.

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.740
Because when we talk about design, there's actually four key elements to designing, and specifically

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.620
for web and mobile designers.

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.430
The first part is graphic design.

8
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.280
This is the idea of using colors, color, theory, layout, typography, sketching, using fonts,

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.210
imagery.

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:52.440
It's the idea of telling a story to convey a specific feeling or to target a specific audience.

11
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.280
Graphic design is all about the visuals, but just knowing graphic design isn't enough.

12
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:09.600
But the next part is this idea of user experience or UX, because to be a good web and mobile designer,

13
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.270
you need to study user experience and user interface design.

14
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.770
So what is that?

15
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.200
It's the art and science of designing products that provide users with the best possible experience.

16
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.690
How can you make a user move through your product in an enjoyable way, in an easy flow?

17
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.720
It's all about understanding your customer.

18
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.670
Again, don't worry, because we're going to dive deep into these topics throughout the course.

19
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.590
The next part is conversion focused or goal conversion.

20
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.810
As a designer, you need to know how to design a product that drives the results that your clients want.

21
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.430
For example, Bruno hired you because he wants to be successful with his product.

22
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.060
So you need to design something that increases this convergence.

23
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.259
Convergence meaning that a user takes a desired action.

24
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.900
So your job is to motivate the visitors of your mobile app or a web app to take that desired action,

25
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.500
maybe sign up for a mailing list or buy a product.

26
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.440
And there's a science to go conversion.

27
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.710
And then finally, we've talked about this, but it's this idea of platform development, whether it's

28
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.500
on mobile or web, although some designers limit their work and don't focus on web development or mobile

29
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.460
app development.

30
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.770
Having at least a basic knowledge of how the platform you're designing for works.

31
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.780
For example, HTML and CSS on the web can be a really important skill and a really boosting skill to

32
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.710
be a top designer, which is why we've included in the course.

33
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.980
Now, these are the four main things that you need to learn, and we're going to learn to be a top designer

34
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.450
throughout all of these.

35
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.510
And something that we keep mentioning is this idea that you'll also need to be good at client and project

36
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.450
management, but we'll get to that later in the course.

37
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.900
Now, throughout the course, we're going to use all modern tools that top designers are using right

38
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.530
now.

39
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.560
But we're also going to link to some resources that you can use to help along your journey.

40
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.620
Now, we've already checked out the zero two Mastery Resources page where we have a bunch of resources

41
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.730
that you can use.

42
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.410
But here are some of my favorite ones that I recommend you check out.

43
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.890
The first one is good UI dot org and this is great for that goal conversion that I was talking about.

44
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:57.760
It actually tells you how you can improve your conversion on your designs by showing you a B tests.

45
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.550
So for example, Amazon discovers that showing structure, product detail is better.

46
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.680
So it actually shows you which design or which layout is better.

47
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.830
So they have a ton of these that they constantly post.

48
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.730
So you can learn about good patterns, good UI practices that you can use for your website.

49
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.190
The next one is awards dot com and this is great to get design inspirations and you can even search

50
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.030
for inspirations like different colors or different topics and get ideas for designs that you may want

51
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.690
to use.

52
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.910
Another one for inspiration is this one right here?

53
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.890
And this again shows off other people's portfolio, but can also be used as your inspiration.

54
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:55.410
Now, if you ever want to use icons in your products, well, I personally like using flat icon.

55
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.660
But if you're looking for a free version, there's also things like the Noun Project that give you beautiful

56
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.010
icons that you can use.

57
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.940
If you want images for your product, something like Unsplash.com is also great to use.

58
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.580
Now this is just scratching the surface.

59
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.270
There's a ton of resources that you can use, but the key is to remember we have a lot of resources

60
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.630
online as designers to develop our ideas, so don't get too intimidated.

61
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.250
You don't always have to start from scratch.

62
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.060
So as a designer, you can expect three things or three types of work environments.

63
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.980
One is a freelancer.

64
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.240
You're your own boss.

65
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.750
You have your own clients.

66
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.530
It involves a little bit more management on your time.

67
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.380
But again, you're your own boss.

68
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.700
Another scenario might be you're working at an agency.

69
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:55.860
An agency is a company that has a bunch of designers and developers, and they look for clients for

70
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.280
you.

71
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.570
And those clients talk through the agency so that you don't have to go looking for clients and the agency

72
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.240
just assigns you different projects, which is a great way for you to gain experience of working on

73
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.710
different types of projects.

74
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.850
And then finally, the last type of work you'll see is working what we call in-house.

75
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.130
We're working for an actual company, working for a product.

76
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.720
And you're the designer or a lead designer for a specific company.

77
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.900
As you can see, the world of a designer is vast.

78
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.910
There's lots to learn, but there's also lots of opportunities, which is why you're taking this course.

79
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.120
So enough Jabber, it's time for us to get started moving forward.

80
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:47.610
Daniel is going to show you the step by step process that we're going to take on this course, but also

81
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.400
for all your future projects.

82
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.830
Remember, the flow of the course is simple.

83
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.710
We start with a client and then we end with a portfolio for you to use on future projects, plus the

84
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.540
system in place for you to use moving forward for all future projects.

85
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.380
All right.

86
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.520
Let's get started.
