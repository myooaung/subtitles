Hello, everyone, and welcome.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.380
My name is Daniel and I'm going to be teaching you about web and mobile design and best practices while

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.090
also teaching you how to use figma.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.810
Along the way, you're going to learn a bunch of different things, everything from learning how to

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.220
design a UI to learning how to collaborate with others, to building design systems and prototypes.

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.930
It's going to be really great.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.930
Now, here we are on the Figma Web page.

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.020
Here.

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.840
You can learn a little bit more about Figma if you wanted to.

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.570
You can learn about things like design, prototyping, design systems, collaboration, everything.

11
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.440
You can even get downloads if you really want to download the actual desktop application, but if you

12
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.700
want it to work within the browser, you can do that as well.

13
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:59.260
Here you'll also learn about pricing and you really aren't going to need anything but the free starter

14
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.330
tier.

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.130
You won't need to use professional or organization in the future.

16
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.100
You will be on a design team and they'll have a paid plan for you to share design systems and stuff

17
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.820
like that.

18
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.830
But you won't need to worry about that right now.

19
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.020
Another very important part about Figma is the community.

20
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.540
There's thousands of files and templates that you can even download and duplicate.

21
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.130
There's plug ins that you can use and we're going to get into that later.

22
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.530
There's also things like events and live streams, best practices, education programs and user groups.

23
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.900
So buckle up.

24
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.460
We are going to sign up for Figma next and jump right in.

25
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.270
And I'm going to teach you how to use Figma from the ground up.
