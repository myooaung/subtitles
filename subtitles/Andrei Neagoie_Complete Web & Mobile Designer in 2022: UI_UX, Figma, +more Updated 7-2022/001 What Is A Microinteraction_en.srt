1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,080
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,300
So we are going to be talking about something super exciting.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,770
I know we talked about motion and micro interactions are next.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,010
Micro interactions are so important and they involve a lot of motion.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,130
Sometimes they are very subtle, usually they are very subtle, but micro interactions are very fun.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,910
And I'm going to show you what they are and why they're so important.

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,880
And we're going to jump into how we're going to create some of our own.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,620
So let's jump right in.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,740
So this is a micro interaction over here, just pulling to refresh and something is happening.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,270
Even just the interaction between this slider is a micro interaction.

11
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,850
So let me show you exactly what they are.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,970
So what is a micro interaction?

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,970
Despite being small, micro interactions have the power to make that experience, you know, much more

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,350
effective in human.

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,240
So let's take a look at the definition.

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,100
Now, if I had to define micro interactions, I would say that they're contained product moments that

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,810
are meant for a single use case.

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,080
And those little moments are a large part of all of our interactions daily.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,310
I mean, we need to think about the different things that we actually interact with.

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:20,270
So maybe every time you set your alarm, the sliding back and forth that is happening over here is a

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,650
micro interaction.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,970
How about checking your notifications?

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,960
That little pop up that may pop up when you have a notification and whatever app you're using is a micro

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,830
interaction.

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,690
What about adding to your cart?

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,890
If I was buying something at a store.

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,080
That is an interaction.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,190
That click the feedback that you get over there and what's happening on the screen.

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,430
So those are all little micro interactions.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,890
Micro interactions do a great job at communicating the tone of your brand.

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,460
This can go on to be part of your brand's signature moments.

32
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,160
I mean, one thing that I think about when I think about a brand that uses micro interactions to communicate

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,310
their tone, I think Facebook I know this is an example.

34
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,510
It's kind of overused, but the Facebook reactions are amazing.

35
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,780
I mean, just it kind of cracks me up.

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,590
They're really great.

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,050
The little subtle animations, when you click them, when you interact and hover over them to select

38
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,060
whether you like or you, you know, you love something or you're angry at something.

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,520
These little things, they all communicate the tone of the overall Facebook brand.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,450
And I really can't think of Facebook without these anymore, to be honest.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,590
So a micro interaction has structure.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,370
And I know it kind of sounds weird.

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,510
I mean, like you think, oh, they're just kind of like a little animation or something, but they

44
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,990
actually do have structure.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,730
And it came from den staffers, book micro interactions, designing with details.

46
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,170
So in order to create an effective micro interaction, there are four essential parts.

47
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,150
The first one is trigger.

48
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,460
The second one is rules.

49
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,630
Then there is feedback and then modes and loops.

50
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,670
So let's talk about that.

51
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,370
The first one being Trigger.

52
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,830
So we've seen this one already, but a trigger is this is what starts the micro interaction.

53
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,110
It can be like user initiated.

54
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:32,240
So in this case, user is actually just kind of swiping through something and there is some sort of

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,940
feedback happening there.

56
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,910
Or if I click a button and there's a checkmark or if I pull to refresh.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,860
So those are all user triggered.

58
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,390
But they can also be initiated by a product.

59
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,710
So that could be like a user getting notification.

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,750
So over here, like if I were to click something in the NAV or if I were to click something and I get

61
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,610
like a little maybe notification bubble that is system initiated.

62
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,160
These little clicks are all user initiated though.

63
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,130
So if we were to think of a little kind of bubble that would pop up, or if these animations were to

64
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,460
be happening when they want to get the user's feedback, that is a micro interaction and that is the

65
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,470
trigger like this.

66
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,600
So we see a little notification bubble.

67
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,230
That is a great just a great example of what system triggered micro interaction looks like.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,690
The second one is raw.

69
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,080
So this is the second piece of our structure over here.

70
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:37,980
And these really determine how micro interactions respond to a trigger while also defining what happens

71
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,450
during that interaction.

72
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:45,600
So I know I have an example here, but generally a rule isn't really seen by the user.

73
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,880
They're kind of the things that are happening in the background.

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,230
So when I click on this, this needs to fill there needs to be a little kind of ball underneath here

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,190
to replace the text.

76
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,580
Those are just the rules, the actual interaction that's happening.

77
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,750
That isn't necessarily the rule that is laid out, but that's just an example of what a rule could be.

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,480
The third is feedback.

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,130
So this tells the user what is actually happening during a micro interaction.

80
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:25,260
So think about inputting something that is invalid in an input field or having a successful input field.

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,140
Something is happening here.

82
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,560
I can see when I click the outline of the input is showing.

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,050
So that is giving me feedback that I am clicking.

84
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,750
The carrot is flickering, showing me that I need to actually enter something and when I enter something

85
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,500
wrong.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,370
I'm getting actual error feedback or success feedback.

87
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,640
The next is loops and modes.

88
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,870
These are kind of like the meta rules of a micro interaction and how it changes when it's used.

89
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,050
Like sometimes micro interactions won't necessarily change.

90
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:07,270
A good example is if you enter a password and a Google Chrome has saved your password, that is like

91
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,950
a micro interaction for kind of saving passwords and entering passwords over and over again.

92
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,260
And it changes over time based off of like the sites you visit and the data it collects.

93
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,590
Another example I have here is what happens if I'm talking to somebody and I'm inputting some text here

94
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,860
and it kind of pre fills the types of words that I've already said in the past of the sentences I've

95
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,950
already said in the past, and it allows me to kind of, you know, interact much more easily based

96
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,780
off of past conversations.

97
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,230
So that is an example of loops and modes.

98
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:47,530
So understanding the structure of micro interactions allows you to really design ones that make a difference.

99
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,090
But not every element can be a micro interaction.

100
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,420
I mean, there's a lot that can be and I'll go through some examples.

101
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,070
Scroll bars are definitely a micro interaction.

102
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,330
They use triggers, visual feedback to see the user kind of changing the location of the page.

103
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,820
So that is a scroll bar.

104
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,820
That is visual feedback of what is happening.

105
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,350
So that is a micro interaction.

106
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,690
Generally elements that aren't a micro interaction are static elements.

107
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,790
Static elements that are always static are not part of a micro interaction.

108
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,160
Flows that have multiple actions are also not necessarily part of a micro interaction.

109
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,530
So just keep that in mind.

110
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,080
I'll get into that a little more detail.

111
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,060
Alarms are micro interactions, so they are triggered by the system.

112
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,130
They can also be triggered by the user.

113
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,210
So right here a system is giving feedback to the user needs to get out of bed and walk away for something

114
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,230
to happen here.

115
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,140
So I'm guessing the alarm is really, really loud.

116
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,150
So that is a micro interaction based off of system trigger.

117
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:04,290
Now buttons can be part of micro interaction sometimes, so if there is no feedback when a user clicks

118
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,630
a button, then there really is no micro interaction.

119
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,980
So if I click a button and nothing happens to that button, that's not micro interaction.

120
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,770
But if I click this button, you can see that the actual state changes and other things will pop up

121
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,360
within this realm.

122
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,100
That is a micro interaction.

123
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,430
Things don't necessarily need to pop up, but you can see just a state change on the button.

124
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,470
What about pull to refresh?

125
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,550
Now, this is a micro interaction.

126
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,919
The user triggers this and they get visual feedback to that user action.

127
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,850
So I'm swiping down to get more data.

128
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,610
There is a feedback of the loader and that is a micro interaction.

129
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,210
Now swiping animations are also micro interaction.

130
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,640
So if I'm swiping in this case through movies.

131
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,320
That is a micro interaction.

132
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,120
Users trigger this.

133
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,470
They get feedback.

134
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,140
And that user has swiped an element.

135
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,150
What about notifications?

136
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,740
Those are also micro interactions.

137
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,940
So a system triggers a notification, it pops up.

138
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,640
I mean, it doesn't necessarily need to do this, but if it pops up here, that is a micro interaction

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,240
and it provides the user with feedback of a new notification.

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
Now there are other examples.

141
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,540
Of what micro interactions can be and what they can't be.

142
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,450
An example like is a video player.

143
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,540
So if we go back to thinking about a button, a video player has buttons, but an entire video player

144
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,640
is not a micro interaction.

145
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,260
The buttons within the video player, however, are if you're adjusting the volume, that is a tiny

146
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,340
micro interaction.

147
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,120
If you're pressing play on the video player, that is a micro interaction.

148
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,000
The video player itself, not so much.

149
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,870
Even gifts.

150
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,430
Gifts aren't micro interactions.

151
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:02,540
Those are just kind of images on loop and they don't necessarily adhere to system trigger or user triggered

152
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,500
behaviors.

153
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,080
So those would be micro interactions as well.

154
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,390
But all these different elements can be made into micro interactions if they are either triggered by

155
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,460
the user or triggered by the system and give a visual feedback to what is happening.

156
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,570
So remember, they need to follow that structure and that's it for what?

157
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,520
Our micro interactions.
