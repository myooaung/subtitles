1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,660
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,080
In this video, we're going to talk all about selectors.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,050
Let's go back to our home page here.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,720
We can look at our styles.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,220
So far we've only been selecting elements.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,330
But most likely we need something more than this.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,920
So let's go back to our example and look at what sort of selectors we can have.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:32,020
Let's say, for example, that we want the style that we have for the big home header to also apply

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,940
to our P tag.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,510
How can we do that?

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,130
Well, we can do something like this.

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,380
I save refresh?

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,300
Awesome.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,870
So that's a way of doing a selector and there's actually a whole bunch of things that we can do with

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,090
selectors and I create it for you, a nice little cheat sheet here that all attach after this lesson

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,980
and it references to really good resources that I recommend.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,130
One is the CSS tricks that I've already mentioned, and you can see over here all the selectors that

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:15,140
they have, they're not as many as they had with properties, and it's actually not as overwhelming

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,980
as you think.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,930
Probably about 30% of these are the ones that are used most of the time.

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:28,070
And we also have our good friend W three schools that lists a bunch of the selectors here.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,380
So let's go over a few things and understand the main selectors that we have.

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:40,250
So I've listed them off for you over here, but I want to point your attention to this line cascading

24
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,820
style sheets at the most basic level it indicates.

25
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,310
There you go.

26
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:46,760
Typo.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,410
It indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,570
And that's something that we've already discussed before.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,910
You remember the P tags.

30
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:02,860
So the order matters because we know that the CSS will read the last line and make sure that the color

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,670
is green.

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,060
So that's the most basic level.

33
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,990
But there's a few other things that we can do.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,430
So let's look at the selectors.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,150
The first one is class.

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,260
The class.

37
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,460
Will do something like this.

38
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,510
So let's say we want to add a few more attacks here.

39
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,640
And refresh.

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,330
Perfect.

41
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:32,490
We love the way everything looks, but ideally for the paragraphs, we want the border to be a slightly

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,270
different colour.

43
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,880
So what we can do is we can add something called class.

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,420
So the class property, we can give it any value we want.

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,370
Whatever we want to call it.

46
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,500
So let's call it web text.

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,480
Now we can copy and paste.

48
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,960
This class attribute.

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,100
To all the P tags.

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,720
And if I go back to my style, let's make this put it up a bit.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,030
I can now add period web text.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,010
And then from here you can see that it's highlighted green and we want the border to be five pixels

53
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,010
that green.

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,170
Save and refresh and look at that.

55
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:29,170
So class is a good way to select a group of elements and make sure that they all have the same styles

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,310
and we can add multiple ones so this one can be active.

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,630
And this adds a second class, which we can say.

58
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,510
Has.

59
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,210
The text color.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Red.

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,130
So if we save that, save this as well and refresh.

62
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,100
You can see over here that now this is red.

63
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,190
So class is very, very useful.

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,530
Let's look at the next one.

65
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,430
Let's drag this over here.

66
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,040
The next one is ID.

67
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:09,610
ID is similar to class, except for you can use the same ID only once.

68
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,000
So let's say that we want to group these p tags.

69
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,050
By wrapping them in a diff.

70
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,510
And you might remember this from the HTML section where we talked about this tag that is very, very

71
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:30,310
useful for CSS for occasions like this where we want to wrap something so I can do ID equals div one

72
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,910
and if I save this, I can now go back here.

73
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,810
And for an ID you want to do a hash sign div one and let's do background.

74
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,180
Blue, safe and fresh.

75
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,030
All right.

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,900
That looks absolutely hideous.

77
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,440
You know what?

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,750
I think this will look really, really good if it was if it had a bit of opacity.

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,940
So, again, we remember our G bar.

80
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,660
And if we want a blue, if you'll remember, it's red, green and blue.

81
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,720
So 255 And then we'll add opacity of, let's say 0.2.

82
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,570
We save that refresh.

83
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,140
All right.

84
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,700
That looks a lot better.

85
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,720
But now let's say we copy this and we want to add a second section.

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,740
Now, we would have to call this diff two.

87
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,570
Again, we want to make sure that the IDs are different, otherwise we break the rules.

88
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,840
Now, if I save this, we'll have something new.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,160
But no styles in this one.

90
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
We want to add a.

91
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,310
Different style for diff too.

92
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:46,960
So again, the selector of diff to we'll have let's say this one instead of blue has the background

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,200
red with opacity of 0.2.

94
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,850
Let's refresh and look at that.

95
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,460
Now looks say a lot better than it used to.

96
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:54,770
Okay.

97
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,220
Let's go back to a couple other ones.

98
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,170
So this is a star.

99
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,190
So the star, it's not used very often, but it symbolizes all elements.

100
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,340
So if I do and usually you'll see stars at the top, but if I do something like this, I can say that

101
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,610
we wanted to align everything and say a text, a line, and we want to do right.

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,590
If I save that and refresh now we see that this move to the right.

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,620
But this didn't.

104
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,860
And the reason is because, again, something called specificity, we're saying that, yep, I want

105
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,270
everything to be right.

106
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,680
But then as we go down the CSS, you'll see that we are saying H two and P, we want Tex line to be

107
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,070
center.

108
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,720
So these elements, instead of coming to the right, get to the center.

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,360
So just to prove to you that that's correct, if I comment this out, I save and refresh.

110
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,250
You see, everything moves to the right and let's refresh.

111
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,970
Perfect.

112
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,920
The next one is the element.

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,930
And this is something that we've already seen.

114
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,120
You can see over here we're selecting the element and then we're putting the property and values.

115
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,000
The next one is the element, comma, element, and that is just like we've done here before.

116
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,500
We want both H two and P to have these properties.

117
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,520
The next one, and this is a little bit tricky is element, space element.

118
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,370
And this is a little bit different than the top one because element's space element.

119
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,740
What it does.

120
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,610
I'll show you over here.

121
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,560
I save this and I refresh.

122
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,060
And.

123
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,570
Hmm.

124
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,250
What just happened here?

125
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,040
You'll see that now.

126
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,150
The text line of center does not apply to these paragraphs anymore.

127
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:56,690
And that's because this syntax of writing a selector means I want you to select all P's that are inside

128
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,420
H two.

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,900
So now even the H two is installed anymore because this says we only want the PS that are inside H two

130
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,710
and you'll see that we have nothing inside H two other than the text.

131
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,830
So if I do something like this home, home, home note I like that.

132
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,340
Okay.

133
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,680
Perfect.

134
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,540
I say that and I refresh.

135
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,280
You'll see that home gnome is added.

136
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,180
With these styles.

137
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,410
Let's look at the next one.

138
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,090
The next one is element greater than element.

139
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,730
So this one is a little tricky.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,929
So if I go like this and I refresh, nothing's changed.

141
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:48,200
But this says that I want you to select all P's, all paragraphs that have parent of H to.

142
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,610
So to show you exactly what that means, let's add this on our new line so you can see better.

143
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,810
If now within this pe if we do something like this where we wrap this and a div.

144
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,820
Like so and I refresh this the style.

145
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,630
Didn't get applied because it only wants peace.

146
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:21,840
So paragraphs that are parents of H two and this P is a his parent or her parent is the div Mr. and

147
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,650
Mrs. Div.

148
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,420
If we put this back to the way it was and refresh, you'll see that this time it works because it's

149
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,440
saying, Oh, PS inside of H2, which is the case.

150
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,390
Hopefully you're still with me.

151
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,910
This is as hard as selectors get.

152
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,270
So once you know these ones, honestly, you've covered 90% and nothing else will scare you.

153
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,070
Let's look at one more element plus element.

154
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:57,140
So this one, if I go element plus element and refresh what just happened.

155
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,130
This says select any P element that is exactly after an H2 element.

156
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,530
So what does that mean?

157
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,980
Well, we need to make it so that the p element.

158
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,010
Is.

159
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,030
Right after the two.

160
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:23,140
So if I go like this safe and refresh, you'll see that now we have our styles applied.

161
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,690
Let's look at a few more.

162
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,240
And like I said, these swans are probably the hardest.

163
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,220
These last ones are kind of fun.

164
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,590
So we have a hover.

165
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,730
So hover.

166
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,790
What that means is if I go over here and I put hover at the end.

167
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,580
This means that when I refresh, nothing happens.

168
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,860
But when I hover my mouse.

169
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,550
Look at that.

170
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,800
It changes the style to what we just wrote down over here.

171
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,380
This one's a pretty cool one, especially for buttons.

172
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,320
The next one, if we look over here, is last child and first child, and you might guess what that

173
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,890
means.

174
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,720
So a good way to demonstrate this is we want to use Web text.

175
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,320
So Web text, as if you remember, is all these little lower sims I can say in here.

176
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,090
Last child.

177
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,990
Refresh.

178
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,610
And only the last child of each Web text.

179
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:27,300
And you'll see here that there's two of them because it is selecting the last child, this one and this

180
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,660
one.

181
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,380
And then there's also a first child, which, as you can imagine, if I refresh.

182
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,190
So let's the first item.

183
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,470
And then finally, I wanted to show you one last thing that I don't recommend, but you might see it

184
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,340
in some code bases.

185
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,400
So I don't want you to be surprised when you come across it.

186
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,730
And that is this.

187
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:56,260
So I can add something like exclamation mark important here and you'll see again we get that nice highlighting.

188
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,130
An important means.

189
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,450
Let's see what happens here.

190
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,110
I refresh and everything just turned pink.

191
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,790
Even though this pea over here says I want the color green.

192
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:14,450
Important overrides any of the cascading style rules and says, Hey, I don't care what anybody else

193
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,050
says.

194
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,540
The pea is pink.

195
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,400
And you can see here why I don't recommend using this, because although you know for sure that the

196
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,510
tags will be pink if somebody else comes and starts working on your style sheet and maybe this is hundreds

197
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:35,300
of lines and they don't know that the important tag is there, they can be confused as to, Hey, how

198
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,770
come nothing's turning green?

199
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,610
I can play all around with the color here and nothing's happening.

200
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,250
And again, it breaks the rules of cascading style sheets, so you don't really want to use it.

201
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,610
But again, if you see it out in the wild, you won't be surprised this way.

202
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,040
The last thing I want to leave you with is the idea of specificity.

203
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,950
If this is your first time running into it, it might get a little confusing and you do need a bit of

204
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,210
time to get used to it.

205
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,330
But trust me, you'll get there.

206
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:10,790
It's just one of these things that everybody goes through and eventually you'll have an aha moment when

207
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,230
selectors win out in the cascade.

208
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,990
It depends on three things.

209
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,420
So the first thing is specificity and I have a resource here that really explains it well.

210
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,280
A simple way to think about this is how specific is your selector?

211
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,350
So this has a specificity score of here.

212
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:41,180
This has a little bit higher because it's more detailed, it's more nested, and this one is higher.

213
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,580
This one is even higher.

214
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,030
And you can see that it keeps going higher and higher.

215
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:54,290
So the more specific something is, the more likely it will win out and make sure that that is the style.

216
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,000
And there's actually a really fun specificity calculator.

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,320
It's really hard to say that word.

218
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,100
So if you click over here.

219
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,440
You can type in whatever you want.

220
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,690
So let's say a for example is just one point, but if I do lie, that's two.

221
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,110
And if I do a lie, that's even higher.

222
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:25,270
And if I do a it's even higher, but then I add an ID of food, you can see that IDs are even higher.

223
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:33,340
And then if I add another class list to Blue, you'll see that the specificity increases and you'll

224
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,700
see over here that inline styles is actually the highest.

225
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:46,420
So if you remember that is putting a style directly into a section that will always win out over others.

226
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:53,110
So you can play around with this and I will link to some of the resources that I have in the next section.

227
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,910
But again, this is something that it will be very specific.

228
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,870
Once you get to a certain problem, you can figure it out, but I hope that makes sense.

229
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,750
Let's go back over here to the last two things.

230
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,920
So the other thing was the importance.

231
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,250
Importance is, as I mentioned, this exclamation mark important.

232
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,720
So that always depends on what kind of styles the cascade gets.

233
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,220
And then finally it is the source order and that is let's go back to our index file.

234
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,700
If we had another stylesheet here, let's say we're importing another style sheet.

235
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,770
And if you remember, we have style two here that makes the H two color blue.

236
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,740
If I put this in save and let's go back to our website and refresh.

237
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:50,920
This turns blue because our browser reads this stylesheet and then reads this one, and because this

238
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,060
one happens after this, the later style gets added.

239
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,930
So if I switch this over here.

240
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,750
Then I save refresh and let's make sure that the H two has its own style.

241
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,240
So let's do h two.

242
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:11,330
So color red refresh, you'll see that this style wins out.

243
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,470
I'm going to leave this out for you in the next section.

244
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:22,430
You can play around with CSS and some of the selectors, but this is the hardest it's going to get.

245
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,760
And once you remember these rules, you're all set.

246
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,200
I'll see you in the next one.

247
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,040
Bye bye.
