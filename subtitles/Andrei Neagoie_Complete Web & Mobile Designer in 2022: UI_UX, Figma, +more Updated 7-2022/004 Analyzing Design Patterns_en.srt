1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,190
We're on to step number three.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,500
And over here we are on Amazon.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,220
Okay.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,280
Now, during this step, we're going to analyze the efficiency of each pattern and find out which pattern

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,790
matches our products needs.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,680
So in our example, our website abandonment during checkout is a big problem.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,190
Therefore, our goal is to pick a pattern that will help us retain users and help them actually complete

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,940
orders.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,050
So let's take a look at this.

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,640
So we have Amazon.

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,150
Okay.

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:36,710
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to select an item and I'm going to select buy now.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,630
And you can see it just kind of auto fills to my address if I want to sign in.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:52,850
But it also won't allow me to actually purchase the product without actually creating an Amazon account.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,410
So you'll need to enter your name, your email, your password and your password again.

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:04,430
So this probably works for a company as big as Amazon because they have such a huge following.

17
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,680
You have so many different products, but if our company or a product, if it doesn't have as many products

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,360
or as big as a following, I'm not sure if people would be that dedicated to actually do something similar,

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,880
and that's probably why we have the drop off rate to begin with.

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,700
So I'm not sure this is a type of pattern that we should be using, at least at this moment.

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,530
So let's move on to eBay.

22
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,160
So here's eBay.

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,690
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to select a product.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,570
Here we go.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,020
So what else do we have here?

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,960
So let's pick a video game.

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,290
So we have a video game over here.

28
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,710
And what we're going to do is we're just going to click Buy It Now.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,600
So interesting.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,030
They're popping up a quick modal that will actually allow you to purchase some sort of protection plan.

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,560
Oh, here it is.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,780
So now I can see whether I want to sign in to check out or I can check out his guest.

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,850
Let's see what that looks like when we check out as a guest.

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,240
So this is very interesting.

35
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,000
We can select all our different options.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,390
We can actually put in our shipping address if we want to check out his guest.

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,760
But we can also pay with PayPal.

38
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,180
So that's very interesting as well.

39
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:26,740
So it looks like our PayPal is an option and I'm not sure if this pattern is going to be good for us,

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,650
but maybe if we look at like PayPal and allowing people to actually click PayPal and fill in their address,

41
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,850
that could work.

42
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,700
I mean, we could possibly create an account around that.

43
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,620
Let's take a look at Etsy.

44
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,420
So Etsy is this handcrafted kind of commerce store.

45
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,400
You'll get a lot of like handmade goods.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,460
Let's shop custom jewelry over here.

47
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,920
Okay.

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,930
I'm just going to pick something random.

49
00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay, so we have a chain necklace, open up a new tab for us, and we are just going to select a style.

50
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,250
And add it to our basket.

51
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,070
Och.

52
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,640
So it brought us right into our shopping cart, which is really nice.

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,290
So if we want to proceed to checkout, we can already over here see like we can pay by PayPal, which

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,340
is very convenient.

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,920
You can do that really quickly.

56
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,600
Let's see what checkout has.

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,960
Och.

58
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:27,490
So we can continue as a guest or we can sign in register or we can actually have a social login.

59
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,290
So I kind of like this.

60
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,950
I like how they've made this much more prominent than the actual sign in.

61
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:40,540
So it's easier for users to actually do something like this rather than going through a whole sign in

62
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,280
or sign up.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,670
So what happens if you continue as a guest?

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,100
So you have to enter your delivery address.

65
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,270
And I guess this is where this gets a little bit harder for users and longer for users because you'll

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,810
have to keep on doing this.

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,600
So if we go back.

68
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,200
So my guess is it's much more easier to actually do a social login over here.

69
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,530
So very easy to kind of go through this flow.

70
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,980
You have multitude of options and I think this is something that I want to further analyze as well.

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:22,420
So if we take a look at the patterns that we've just kind of reviewed very quickly, I mean, there

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,640
are notable differences.

73
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,540
So for example, Amazon had that sign in Wall and I'm not sure like we're already kind of doing that

74
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,730
and I don't think that's going to be good for us.

75
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,920
There was the PayPal like guest checkout, which is very interesting.

76
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,550
There's different variations of that.

77
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,880
So it's kind of like a lazy sign up as well as like continue as a guest, which is very interesting.

78
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,570
But the problem is not all users have a PayPal account and doing that kind of lazy sign up requires

79
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,030
like them to go back and enter their shipping address over and over again.

80
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,770
I feel like social login is incredibly fast and convenient way to actually sign in.

81
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:07,300
So most internet users have accounts on popular social media platforms like Google, Facebook, and

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,340
even people on Apple devices.

83
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,750
This lets users fill in the absolute minimum of information and quickly proceed to checkout.

84
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:22,670
So let's say we picked social login to simplify our checkout process and to retain users.

85
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,630
So the final step for us would be to look at similar websites that kind of employ social login.

86
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:34,290
So I'm going to be taking a look at Cb2 or Crate and Barrel next because I believe they have a social

87
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,250
login as well.

88
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,590
So in the next section we're going to be dissecting the pattern.
