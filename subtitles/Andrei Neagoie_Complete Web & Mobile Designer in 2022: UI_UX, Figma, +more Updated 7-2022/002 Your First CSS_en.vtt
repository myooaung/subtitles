00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.310
It's time to flaunt your inner designer because we're about to learn some CSS.

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.440
To start off, I want to show you this website.

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.520
If you look at it.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.220
Well, it's it's quite, quite pretty.

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.840
Look at that.

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.050
That's really nice.

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.280
Now, hopefully in the future we can create something like this.

8
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.150
But I want to show you what this website will look like without CSIS.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.310
Here it is.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.490
Pretty impressive, right?

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.980
With just CSIS, you'll be able to create something like this.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.590
So let's get started, shall we?

13
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.670
I've created here for us a simple website.

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.500
Nothing that we haven't seen before.

15
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:57.260
You can see that I have created semantic tags with header nav, an unordered list that has some links.

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.930
ap2 and a P tag that's wrapped in another semantic tag called section.

17
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.810
So again, nothing crazy.

18
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.660
If I go to the about page, it's the exact same thing except for the about ally doesn't have an anchor

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.640
tag and then same with login.

20
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.720
So let's talk about CSIS.

21
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.630
The way that we would add CSIS to something like this is while we create a CSIS file.

22
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.770
So let's do that.

23
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.050
I'm going to create a new file that I'm going to save.

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.420
Let's call it style dot.

25
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.740
CSIS.

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.590
If I save that, you'll see at the bottom over here that sublime text now has CSS as the file type.

27
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.130
The rules with CSIS are very simple.

28
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:57.050
We essentially have a selector and then we have the squiggly brackets, and within it we put our property.

29
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.140
Semicolon and then value.

30
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.190
And then we have this special character as well at the end.

31
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.740
And that is pretty much CSIS.

32
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.580
You know this you can write CSIS just like a QML.

33
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.010
Just a couple of syntactic rules.

34
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.130
And once you get used to it, it's very, very simple.

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.370
But obviously this doesn't really mean anything.

36
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.560
So let's write actual code here.

37
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.050
I'm going to comment that out by again, doing command slash and sublime text.

38
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.830
You can see that the commenting is different than in HTML.

39
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.350
And let's say that we want to make this home text read.

40
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.930
The way we would do it is we want to select what's called the selector.

41
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.880
So here we want to say that the H two, we want that to be read.

42
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.720
So all I would say is h to curly brackets.

43
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.780
And then within here I want to say the property, I want to change the color to the value that is read.

44
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.150
So if I save that.

45
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.640
And refresh.

46
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.830
Well, nothing happens.

47
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.300
And that's obvious, right?

48
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.590
Because how does this file know that this file exists?

49
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.990
We have to link it somehow, and we do that in the head.

50
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.530
And we haven't talked too much about the tag element in the HTML section, but by now you can probably

51
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.770
tell that head just contains information about what the page needs.

52
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:35.840
Maybe not the stuff that we see on a web page other than the title, but meta tags and information that

53
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.070
we need for the website.

54
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.490
Okay.

55
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:48.940
So in here we can actually link to this style sheet that we call style dot CSS with a link tag.

56
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.250
And this link tag allows us to link this HTML file to something else.

57
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.410
And again, Sabine, Tex.

58
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.000
Has something very useful here.

59
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.140
If I hit tab.

60
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.750
Look at that.

61
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.170
It fills it for me.

62
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.040
These are the standard attributes that you'll see to link to CSS, so you just have to get used to it

63
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.430
and eventually it'll become second nature.

64
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.750
So we have our L here, which is the added attribute for relation.

65
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.339
It just specifies what relationship this link will have and we have the default stylesheet.

66
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.550
And then for the type, this is the media type.

67
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.190
We want to say that it's a text CSS file.

68
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.730
We're essentially telling HTML, hey, just a heads up, we're linking to a file here and in the ref.

69
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.810
This should be familiar.

70
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.000
We're going to link to style CSS.

71
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.050
So if I type in style dot CSS.

72
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.600
And safe.

73
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.920
Let's refresh.

74
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.020
Turns red.

75
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:56.720
And just to let you know that index.html is in the same folder as stylesheet CSS, we can check it over

76
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.090
here if I click on exercise.

77
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.200
You see that?

78
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.620
Yep.

79
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.710
I have style dot css with indexed html.

80
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.830
Perfect.

81
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.480
Okay.

82
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.310
Now, what if we also want to make the paragraph over here, the zipper color as well?

83
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.920
Well, again, we would do the selector and then we'll do color and let's do pink.

84
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.390
I save refresh and it's pink.

85
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.770
Hopefully you can see that.

86
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.950
You also see here that sublime text does some really nice coloring for us.

87
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.980
So if I, for example, I put a property that doesn't exist like a misspelled color, well, you see

88
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.110
that it doesn't highlight it properly with the blue color and you know that you've made a mistake.

89
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.390
Again, another great feature of sublime text.

90
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.010
So CC, what what does it actually stand for?

91
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.600
Well, it stands for cascading style sheets and style sheets that make sense that we're creating style

92
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.840
sheets.

93
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.640
But what does cascading mean?

94
00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:03.130
Well, cascading means that it always takes the selector that is at the end.

95
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.610
And that's simplified terms.

96
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.950
But I want to demonstrate for you what that means.

97
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.690
So let's say at the bottom over here, I do this again paragraph.

98
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.270
I want color to be green.

99
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.390
Well, if I save this, what do you think will happen?

100
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.520
Let's refresh and see.

101
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.850
It turns green.

102
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.020
And why is that?

103
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.270
Well, because it's cascading.

104
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.750
It's saying, okay, I'll set H to to red.

105
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.810
I'll set paragraph to pink.

106
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.190
And then it says, okay, I'll set P to green.

107
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:43.720
So you can see here, as it trickles down and cascades, it takes the last input that it receives for

108
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.890
a specific selector.

109
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.490
We'll get more into the cascading effects of CSS in a later video, but I want you to understand the

110
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.500
basic concept around it.

111
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.180
I also wanted to show you something cool that you can do with Chrome, and we did this in the first

112
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.570
couple of video series, but now you'll actually understand what it means.

113
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:09.680
So again, view developer, developer tools and from now on I'll be using this shortcut to open it and

114
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.030
you'll be able to do it as well.

115
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.020
And if you remember, we have our style tab.

116
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.450
And if we click on the style tab, we have the HTML on the left styles over here and nothing for the

117
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.320
styles.

118
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.140
But if I now go into my.

119
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.010
Home and I click on that.

120
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.930
It'll show you color red.

121
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.970
So Google Chrome allows us to see our CSS styles.

122
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.460
So I can even add stuff here and I could say background color.

123
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.550
Let's do black.

124
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:44.940
Look at that.

125
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.960
So this is a really good way to play with your website and add colors.

126
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.910
You can check and uncheck here.

127
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:57.060
And also, if you see something on a website that you really, really like, you can go to that element.

128
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.560
Let's let's try it off here.

129
00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.790
Let's go to.

130
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.290
Wait.

131
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.930
But why dot.com?

132
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.010
And let's say that we really, really want to know how.

133
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.280
This was me.

134
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.010
We can right click.

135
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:15.900
To inspect.

136
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.380
We'll take us exactly to that element.

137
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.360
And then we can see here some of the properties, the CSS properties that they've used.

138
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:25.910
And same here.

139
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.450
You can see that the background color is this and so on and so forth.

140
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:30.780
Okay.

141
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.100
Let's close that for now.

142
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.289
The last thing I want to leave you with is what if?

143
00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.260
Let's close this.

144
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.670
What if I also want the above page to have styles?

145
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.150
And same with the login page.

146
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:52.230
As you can see, there's no style for these ones, but we want the same thing for the about and login

147
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.770
page.

148
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.400
Well, as you can imagine, we copy the link tag.

149
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.270
And we go to about.

150
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.600
We link it on to here and then log in.

151
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.060
We can again link it here.

152
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:12.870
I save both of these files and now if I refresh and go to about look at that.

153
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.040
We have our styles.

154
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.240
And you may be wondering, well, what if I want different styles?

155
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.350
Maybe for the login.

156
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.940
I want this to be blue instead.

157
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.510
Well, we can actually create multiple style sheets.

158
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:33.150
So I can say, for example, let's create a new file and we'll call it style two dot CSS.

159
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.590
I save that.

160
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:39.270
And this time I'm going to say that I want my H to.

161
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.100
To have color blue.

162
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:53.330
I say that I go into my login HTML and now I'll make login reference the second stylesheet instead of

163
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:53.960
the first one.

164
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.510
So now if I refresh.

165
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:06.300
Log in is referencing our style to CSIS, but all the other ones are still referencing the old one.

166
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:13.650
Ally There is one last thing that I want to add, and that is that this is the common way of adding

167
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.460
styles.

168
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:20.230
But there is actually two other ways that you won't see as often, especially when you're starting off.

169
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.640
But I wanted to show it to you so that you're not surprised.

170
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.340
The first way of doing it is something called inline styles.

171
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:36.020
And this was the original way that we incorporate as styles into our HTML, and that is by specifying

172
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.220
within the element.

173
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.160
Let's say let's go with header over here.

174
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.410
We want to say style.

175
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:50.090
So it has a style attribute and then within here we can do background color.

176
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.340
Let's do green and refresh and we're at the about page right now.

177
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.930
We change that for index.html.

178
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.150
So let's go over here and look at that.

179
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:07.470
We have the green background and if you want to add more, again, we do color red.

180
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.160
Let's save and refresh and look at that.

181
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:18.360
The header has the color red and you'll see here that these ones are still purple because they are linked

182
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.280
tags and they have the default linking.

183
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.000
Okay.

184
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:31.230
So that's one way and the third and last way is in the head, you can actually create style tags and

185
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.120
then within these style tags.

186
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.160
You can enter CSS.

187
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.570
So if you just refresh here.

188
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.970
So we have a fresh, clean slate.

189
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:45.250
I can now say all the p tags or let's do ly this time.

190
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.660
So all the lists.

191
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.180
I want the list to have.

192
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:54.370
Background color of purple.

193
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.160
So find how.

194
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.840
Save this and refresh.

195
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.160
Everything is purple and that looks pretty yucky.

196
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:07.890
You can keep adding stuff on here and I can say color white, save, refresh.

197
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.410
And it changed the color to white.

198
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.330
Now you may be wondering, why don't we just do it like this?

199
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.240
This seems a lot simpler than linking to another CSS file.

200
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.520
Well, the reason is that for this website, everything is fairly small.

201
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.110
It's just a couple of lines of CSS.

202
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:31.360
But you can imagine with websites, as they get bigger and bigger, you'll have hundreds and hundreds

203
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.980
of lines of CSS.

204
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.810
And having one massive file will be very, very challenging to maintain.

205
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:44.800
You can also think of it as if you are working on an HTML and you also had a team of designers that

206
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.760
were working on a CSS file.

207
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:54.070
You want to have a separation where you have some team members working on the CSS and then some team

208
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.680
members working on the HTML.

209
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.070
And that is a concept called separation of concerns.

210
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.660
It's a fancy way of saying that everybody just worry about what they're good at.

211
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:11.590
So HTML just worry about text and CSS, just worry about styles.

212
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:17.290
This phrase separation of concerns is something that will encounter throughout later videos when we

213
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.210
get into JavaScript and react.

214
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:25.060
And it's a very, very important concept in web development and computer science in general.

215
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.620
So we will get back to that.

216
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.120
But you know that it'll be a phrase that will keep coming up.

217
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.410
So for now.

218
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.840
Let's delete this.

219
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.300
Let's keep things the way that we have it.

220
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.470
Let's refresh.

221
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.930
And in the next video, I'm going to show you a couple of CSS properties that are more exciting than

222
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.030
just color and background.

223
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.320
I'll see you in that one.

224
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.250
Bye bye.
