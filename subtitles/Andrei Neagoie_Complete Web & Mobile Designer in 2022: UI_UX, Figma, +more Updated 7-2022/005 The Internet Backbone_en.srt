1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,160
Hey there.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,170
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,530
All right.

4
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,420
A few thoughts so far.

5
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,050
Everything's been really, really cool.

6
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,960
Well, things aren't going to get a lot cooler.

7
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,650
We're going to be talking about the Internet backbone.

8
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,380
So we recognize this because I've been talking about it for the last couple of lessons, but some of

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,210
you may have had a question.

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,970
That is, what do the arrows mean?

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,620
I mean, it's kind of like magic, right?

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,610
I just told you that we send off the IP address to the servers.

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,500
The server responds with some files, but this is just magic.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,030
Like, what do these arrows mean?

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:40,570
So we're going to talk about that in this lesson, and we're going to do that with this really, really

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,120
fuzzy diagram that I found online from this website.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,810
It's not the clearest picture, but it actually has some really important things.

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,380
So I want to use that to demonstrate to you what the Internet backbone is.

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:58,180
So some of you know, the way we connect in our homes that are coffee shop or at work is we usually

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,930
have wi fi or maybe sometimes we still have people that are using Ethernet cables and connecting through

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,170
those.

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,600
But for now, let's just focus on the fact that we have a home and we have wi fi.

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,570
And this wi fi essentially gives us Internet from the router.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:20,830
You can see this little person over here working hard with a router next to him and this router is connected.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,200
All the way to something called a modem.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,630
And this is something that if you ever signed up for Internet or change providers, you most likely

27
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,020
had somebody come to your house and install something.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:41,060
And that's this box over here that essentially allows the ISP, the Internet service provider, this

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,750
big building over here, we remember that to connect to it.

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:55,430
So this modem has the signal towers that transmit signals of Google.com and it receives these messages.

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,730
And then this is why I pick this image just because I think it's incredible.

32
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:04,580
You see this wire that is connected all the way to the ISP and then the Internet service provider,

33
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,310
the ISP is connected to this magical blue cable that is the Internet backbone.

34
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,670
And something that's really important in this image is the fact that there is wi fi, which is over

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,820
the air, but at the end of the day, everything is kind of connected through cables.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,330
So some of you or many of you or all of you might be wondering, what the hell is this Internet backbone

37
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:29,660
thing?

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,170
Sounds cool, but this this kind of exo.

39
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,140
I found a really, really cool thing that we can do together.

40
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:42,680
I'll post this website in the notes after this lesson, but if you go over here, you actually see the

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,940
Internet backbone.

42
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,750
So let's say we're in Brazil and we wanted to search Google.com.

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:55,010
Well, from Brazil, from our home through wi fi, it connects to our router to our modem, and then

44
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,960
all the way to our Internet service provider.

45
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,720
Let's say it's Internet service providers over here.

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,930
And then through cables, it connects all the way to, let's say, at this point over here.

47
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,540
And let's say for now that the Google servers are located somewhere in Portugal over here.

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:18,680
Well, that signal of me looking for that IP address of Google and looking for those Google files is

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,410
going to go through this submarine cable.

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,610
Yeah, you heard that right.

51
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:30,620
It's a physical cable that goes at the bottom of the sea floor from Brazil all the way to Portugal,

52
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,270
where the Google servers are.

53
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:38,060
And then the Google server says, yep, I got those files, here they are and sends it all the way back.

54
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,980
Through the ISB all the way back to our house.

55
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:49,370
Isn't that cool, that there's physical cables that are connecting and creating this Internet?

56
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:57,230
So, you know, there are times where somebody destroys or something happens where these cable connections

57
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,650
are cut off and you sometimes lose Internet connection that way.

58
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:08,750
But yeah, the Internet backbone is literally just this network all over the world of connected cables

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,870
so that we can transfer these files all over the world.

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,750
And just to show you how insane this is, somebody from the optic project over here, I got this off

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:25,820
of Wikipedia mapped out and I believe this was in 2015, just 30% of the network.

62
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,330
And you can see over here that each one of these dots is an IP address.

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,740
So a computer that is connected to another computer that is connected to another computer.

64
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,630
And that's the Internet.

65
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:47,030
The Internet is just all these connected computers that are just transferring files between each other

66
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,560
and as Web developers.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,780
And this is the coolest thing.

68
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:57,830
And that's why I just think everybody should be a web developer, because it's so cool you're allowing

69
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,580
this to happen.

70
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,360
You're allowing this transferring of files from one computer to another, transferring knowledge from

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,540
Brazil to Portugal and all over the world.

72
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,490
And you get to be part of it.

73
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,950
You get to be part of this network and you get to evolve.

74
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,980
When this picture of the Internet came to me, I knew that this was the career for me, so hopefully

75
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,910
that gets you excited.

76
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,040
In the next section I'm going to show you something really cool.

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,010
Traceroute before we finish up the lesson and we get into the next sections, so hope that was cool.

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
See you in the next one.

79
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,630
Bye bye.
