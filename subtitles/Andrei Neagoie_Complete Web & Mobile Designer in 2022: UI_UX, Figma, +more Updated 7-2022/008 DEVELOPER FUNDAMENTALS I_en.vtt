00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.600
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.220
Good job.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.810
You've made it this far.

4
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.330
And you're probably asking yourself, Andre.

5
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.310
This has been really good, really informative.

6
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.480
But where's the coating?

7
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.760
I want to start building some websites and I know.

8
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.470
I know we'll get there, don't worry.

9
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.890
But without even realizing it, you just learned some really, really important fundamental skills and

10
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.390
something that will take you very, very far in the career of a web developer, because now you know

11
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.810
how to improve website performance without a single line of code.

12
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
And just so you know, we're going to get a little silly here.

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.080
We're actually going to make sure that you remember these fundamental skills every time throughout these

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.390
lessons, there's going to be chunks of very important lessons and to symbolize how important they are.

15
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.760
I'm going to get Jean-Claude van Dam's help.

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.950
So again, this is an important lesson.

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.340
This is an important, fundamental web developer concept.

18
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.280
So Jean-Claude Van Damme, how important is it?

19
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.520
Oh.

20
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.490
All right.

21
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.170
So as you can see, very important concept.

22
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.890
And what is it?

23
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.470
Well, like I said, without writing a single line of code, you now know how to improve a website's

24
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.950
performance.

25
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.300
So let's think about this.

26
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.710
There's three things.

27
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.610
We sang google.com.

28
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.750
We talked to Google servers and we get these files back.

29
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.070
So just looking at this and looking at what you've learned so far, what's one thing that would make

30
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.410
sure that this process would be fast?

31
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.790
Let's look at the first one.

32
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.950
I'm going to give you a second to think.

33
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.200
Hopefully you get it.

34
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.880
The first one is location of the server.

35
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.700
We saw how big the Internet backbone is.

36
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.250
So if the servers are really, really close to you, let's say you're in the states and the servers

37
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.970
are just a couple of kilometers away, that hop is going to be really, really fast versus if it's all

38
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.020
the way across the globe.

39
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.960
So location of the server is important and we'll talk about these and how big companies use these to

40
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.250
their advantage later on.

41
00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.900
So that makes sense.

42
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.520
Let's look at the next one.

43
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.310
So the next one is how many trips?

44
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.130
So hopefully, ideally, we just have one trip to the Google servers and Google servers.

45
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.530
Send us all the files that we need back.

46
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.560
But as we know, there's new pages, there's searches.

47
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.610
So this communication with Google is back and forth, back and forth.

48
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.500
And the less trips we have, the faster that we'll be able to get the files.

49
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.700
So how many trips and then finally size of files.

50
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.290
Again, if this HTML file or CSS file or JavaScript file is massive and it's 100 megabytes, well,

51
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.290
that's going to be a lot slower to transfer over the Internet than it is if it was just a couple of

52
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.980
kilobytes.

53
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.680
So there it is.

54
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.850
These three things are something that you'll take with you and you'll realize that every time you're

55
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.280
building an application or a website, you're going to be thinking about these things and these are

56
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.420
going to help you make sure that you have a performant fast website.

57
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.530
And we're going to take these with us as we go on throughout the course.

58
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.960
Talk to you soon.

59
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.660
Bye bye.
