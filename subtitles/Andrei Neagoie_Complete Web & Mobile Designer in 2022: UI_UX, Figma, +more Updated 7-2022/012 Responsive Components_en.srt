00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,930
The last tip I have when you're creating components is to always remember to use constraints, especially

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,780
if you're designing for responsive websites.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,650
So constraints allow you to control like resizing behavior.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm going to show you how this works and how we're going to fix this.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:24,320
But if I resize this, look at the label totally responsive and the input field.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,600
Now that is truly amazing.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,230
I love this, I love constraints and I'm going to teach you how to use them.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,060
So essentially they make resizing components so easy, I mean, for all types of situations and device

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,840
sizes.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,600
So easy way to do this is let's go back to our original input field.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,410
And if you look at the top, these are constraints over here.

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:49,860
Now.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,610
Right now, this means that if I resize this whole frame.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,810
I'll show you what happens.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,220
Nothing should happen.

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,020
The only thing that's going to be resized is the actual input text.

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,280
Because it has a constraint.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,680
Such a right, it's hard to see.

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:20,610
But what we should do is we should actually shift and select the right over here in left and right.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,870
You can also select in this little dropdown.

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,690
And what that means is when I start doing this.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,930
Are doing this.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,650
It's going to easily.

24
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,380
Be manipulated and it'll easily resize.

25
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,760
Now you saw the issue we were having over here.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,220
We have an issue with the icon, not necessarily resizing properly.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,780
So I'll show you how to fix that.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,750
So what we're going to do is we are going to go in here.

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,060
We're going to show our icon.

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,510
As you can tell, it's only left and top.

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,510
So it will move if the top frame.

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,400
Shifts, but we never really do that.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,860
So I don't think that's a big deal right now.

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,670
What we can do, though, is click right.

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,880
We don't want it to squish from left to right.

36
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,530
I'll show you what happens if we do click.

37
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,850
That's if we do.

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,990
Left and right over here, it's just going to squish.

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,470
But we want to do is make sure that it's kind of like sticky to that.

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,890
Right.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,980
So if we do that, there you go.

42
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,010
We fixed it.

43
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,140
And that's basically how our labels are set up as well.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,880
They set up in the exact same way the full label should be left and right.

45
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,260
The left side of the label will always be kind of sticky to the left.

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,020
And our description will always be sticky to the right.

47
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,060
You'll notice it over here, even though it's hidden.

48
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,370
And same with the icon.

49
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,290
So that will always be sticky there.

50
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,760
The input field.

51
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,580
This needs to be left in.

52
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,150
Right.

53
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,790
You can even do the same over here.

54
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,660
And it's already set.

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,800
So perfect.

56
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,010
Now, I'll show you some use cases for this.

57
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,450
So if I use, let's say.

58
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,390
Let's create an expiration date.

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,240
Uh.

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,570
We can use month month deejay.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,100
Yea.

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,460
Yea.

63
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,850
Yea.

64
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,600
Yea.

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,010
And we're not going to need an icon for this one.

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,980
So there you go.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:36,460
Now we see this a lot when we're entering like credit card details and stuff like that.

68
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,390
Let's just hide that.

69
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,050
There you go.

70
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,580
That's good.

71
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:49,410
Now, I remember before in one of the lessons we talked about, like how you should size icons based

72
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,270
off of how appropriate they are like a CV in terms of the content, you're only going to probably have

73
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,930
three digits.

74
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,780
So a full width input doesn't really make sense.

75
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,710
And what I would do is I would kind of bump it up here.

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,610
Bring it down.

77
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,280
Bring this input right beside it and look at that.

78
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,150
Like you can easily manipulate your inputs for the situation because of the constraints and it doesn't

79
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,279
affect this input over here at all.

80
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:23,250
So remember that when you're creating components, be very conscious of your constraints.

81
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,100
You can always go back and fix them, but that's always a pain.

82
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,800
So be conscious on how you're going to use these components.

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,570
Are they going to be resized often?

84
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,230
Do you plan on making different instances of them and creating new components that really does affect

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,830
how you kind of apply constraints as well, but especially for something like inputs that may get resized

86
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,380
throughout the like how they're used throughout the your application definitely apply constraints because

87
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,120
you can easily create.

88
00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:00,690
These responsive inputs, which look awesome and they're kind of so fun to use.

89
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,470
So that's how you use constraints when creating components.
