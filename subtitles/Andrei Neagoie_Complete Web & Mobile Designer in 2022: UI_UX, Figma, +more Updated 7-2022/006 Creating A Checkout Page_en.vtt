00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.600
Everyone is.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.890
So in our last video we touched upon like building a product page and we created something pretty quickly

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.660
and we did it really well.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.260
I think especially for a first pass, you're never going to nail it on the first try.

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.840
So I think we did really great here.

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.200
We have reviews, we have like all the product information.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.710
We have different ways to get them back into the product funnel and we have our navigation.

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.420
So I'm going to actually create a new frame and oops, I keep on doing that.

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.090
Do not know why.

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
Bad habit, I guess I really want to think about the cart.

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.790
Okay.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.830
So for the carts.

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.720
You know, maybe there are navigations there.

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.610
I mean, we could have it.

16
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.170
Actually, I don't know if we should have it, but let's just keep it for now.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.620
Well, we'll definitely iterate on this.

18
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.090
So if we have something in our cart, maybe we'll have, like, a notification so we can add something

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.080
small here.

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.700
Like Red.

21
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.930
I'm just going to throw this on top.

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.280
That's cool.

23
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.940
I love it.

24
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.840
You know, I often don't think, especially for something like this, I'm not sure if you like, you

25
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.500
need a badge that shows the amount of items in your card or anything like that.

26
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.280
But I think it's pretty cool to have like just a little notification or badge there that is just red

27
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.010
and it just reminds the user, Hey, you got something in your card, buddy, you should probably buy

28
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.370
it.

29
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.350
So for Cart, I'm going to give this a title.

30
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.310
I'm just going to call my cards.

31
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.880
So.

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.040
I'm going to call it my car.

33
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.190
And that is the title of the page right now.

34
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.410
Let's apply our grid just so we have something to work with.

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.660
Awesome.

36
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.230
So we have our cart title.

37
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.090
Okay, so let's think about the different types of things we're going to have in this car here.

38
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.750
We're going to have our items.

39
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.850
So we're going to take that.

40
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.770
Let's just copy that into here.

41
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.690
So we're going to have our items.

42
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.660
This is definitely going to I think it's going to be a little different.

43
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.990
So there won't be a heart at this point.

44
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.890
We want to get them into purchasing item as quickly as possible.

45
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.930
So probably like that.

46
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.060
Let's look at our icons.

47
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.210
Like maybe we'll get like a garbage can and I'll show you what I'm thinking right now.

48
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.160
Trash.

49
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.910
Okay.

50
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.650
We're about to go searching for that.

51
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.020
So, icons.

52
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.750
I'm looking for a garbage can, because what I do want to build is like a little add removed kind of

53
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.180
thing where they can add more items to their carts if they want to buy doubles or.

54
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.930
It really depends.

55
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.960
Some items you may want to buy more than one.

56
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.590
So.

57
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.130
There it is.

58
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.700
Garbage.

59
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.360
I love it.

60
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.620
Perfect.

61
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.020
Just going to detach this.

62
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.570
I'm going to remove the group.

63
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.710
So there's a garbage can and I want a plus button.

64
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.990
There's the minus button.

65
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.650
There's the plus button.

66
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.960
This isn't like that.

67
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.620
I'm going to detach this and break up the group shift command.

68
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.340
G will break up that group so that perfect ock.

69
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.230
I'm just turning off my grid so I can get a better look at this.

70
00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.860
So if there's one item, I think, like, we should just give them the option to add or remove that

71
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.520
item.

72
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.800
Let's just resize that.

73
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.100
I think like that's going to be fine for now.

74
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.890
Let's bold this.

75
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.180
So it's 16 bold.

76
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.970
Okay, so we have something here.

77
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.850
Oops.

78
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.550
So we're just going to align that and we can.

79
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.250
Okay.

80
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.100
So there's our product.

81
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.780
Maybe if we have a second product, look, looks like that.

82
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.470
And, you know, maybe we can.

83
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.650
Where's the remove?

84
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.700
Delete.

85
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.720
You could do something like this.

86
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.740
So if there's more than one product.

87
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.080
So these are the types of interactions I'm thinking about a lot, especially in the beginning.

88
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.750
It's better to start thinking about them earlier than later.

89
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.140
So perfect.

90
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.040
So there is our adding and removing.

91
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.870
Let's just group that for now grouping them, bringing them up.

92
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.750
So we have that.

93
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.830
I think we need some more information, maybe like total.

94
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.870
So we can just start grabbing some stuff here that we've used in the past.

95
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.410
Kurt.

96
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.420
Total.

97
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.480
And we're just going to shrink this.

98
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.790
Perfect.

99
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.720
I don't think this needs to be like 20.

100
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.820
It could be something smaller, like a 16 year old.

101
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.340
Let's get that perfect.

102
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.850
And and we can have the cart total on the right.

103
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.450
So it's going to be $75.

104
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.900
Okay.

105
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.430
You know, maybe there's like address information.

106
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.420
Here we go.

107
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.760
We have some address delivered to Leslie.

108
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.400
And the information.

109
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.420
So if you want to get some quick information, another great plugin is content real?

110
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.010
So let's just bring that up next.

111
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:43.100
You know, you can get names, you can get avatars, icons, so many different things.

112
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.520
You don't even need to sign in.

113
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.250
I'm just going to get an address.

114
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.810
There it is.

115
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:56.010
Just give me a random US address and that's perfect as we can bump down in size.

116
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.990
Maybe like a 12.

117
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.500
Maybe a 14.

118
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.460
A little hard to read.

119
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.800
So there we go.

120
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.460
We got an address easily.

121
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:13.460
And I think like that's pretty much it we're going to probably need let's think what else would we need?

122
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.560
We will need a button to check out.

123
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.800
So primary.

124
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.590
Okay.

125
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.660
Button.

126
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.070
There we go.

127
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.820
Uh, perfect.

128
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.120
So we are definitely thinking about like the hierarchy over here.

129
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.360
You know, my assumption right now is people want to see the items in their car and then maybe some

130
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.990
other items afterwards.

131
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.420
I'm not even sure if this is actually useful right now, but I think maybe it's good to like give them

132
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.860
a heads up of like, hey.

133
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.890
Is this you?

134
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.590
Is this who we're going to deliver to?

135
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.720
Maybe it's something worth checking out and we can ask our users what they expect.

136
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.610
And if it's something that kind of surprises them, maybe they'll like it, maybe they won't.

137
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.430
And we can definitely make changes based off of that.

138
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.280
So we have checkout.

139
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.850
We're going to definitely need this.

140
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.850
Some other things I'm thinking about also is like.

141
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.450
Some things I have been thinking about.

142
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.460
I don't know if I want to navigation in the card screen.

143
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:37.360
Maybe it's best to kind of like make a sticky checkout button rather than a navigation because we want

144
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.700
to get them checking out much more quicker.

145
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.970
So something we need to also explore.

146
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.320
Think we can even use this maybe like this screen.

147
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.080
This is another assumption of mine as well.

148
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.550
Like maybe if they don't want to check out right away, they're just looking at their cart.

149
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.060
Maybe there's another way to kind of push them into the funnel once again.

150
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:04.410
Okay.

151
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.260
So this is a basic card screen.

152
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.420
Like your card screen doesn't need to be complex.

153
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:15.500
It could just show just some images in terms of like the items that the user has purchased or has added

154
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.400
to their cart.

155
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.960
Definitely the total needs to be there and there needs to be some sort of button to push them into the

156
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.850
actual checkout process.

157
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.890
You know, this is all optional.

158
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.350
I'm not sure if this is actually useful.

159
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.630
Same with like this.

160
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.480
I'm not sure yet, but I've seen this a couple of times before, so I'm not sure exactly if these are

161
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.390
going to work, but we are definitely going to iterate based off of the type of feedback we get.

162
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:50.060
So I want you to kind of take a stab at the rest of the screens that you feel are really necessary,

163
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.970
things like car, things like a wish list, maybe what is a search look like when we wireframe it,

164
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.260
you know, have fun with it.

165
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.010
I mean, think about the different types of content that will be on each page.

166
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.600
Think about that hierarchy when you're actually laying it all out.

167
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.320
If you need a grid, it's so easy to create one, so go ahead and do that.

168
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.670
You don't necessarily need one, especially at this stage, but it helps keep things consistent in terms

169
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.560
of like when you're starting to think about laying it out and yeah, definitely just keep on building

170
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.110
those wireframes and test them.

171
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:29.840
Don't just stick with one set and then forget about it because I know that I'm going to have to change

172
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.110
this.

173
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.870
I've already accepted that fact because it is a fact.

174
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.780
I mean, we're definitely never going to get anything right on the first try.

175
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:41.660
So go out there, test your assumptions and make those changes and test again to ensure that you're

176
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.770
doing the right thing.

177
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.200
And that's it for wireframes.

178
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:51.950
I hope you all learned a lot and I hope you've seen like this component library will definitely speed

179
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.000
up your workflow.

180
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.030
So go out there and create some wireframes and have fun.
