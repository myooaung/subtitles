1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,920
Holy moly.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,200
Good job getting this far in the course.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,720
You should really, really be proud of yourself because we've learned a lot, and now we're going to

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,460
build something really exciting.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,010
We're going to build a startup landing page.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,870
A landing page like this that well is responsive.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,040
But most importantly, it has some text.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,100
It has a button.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,770
But check this out when you click on the button.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,090
It takes you to a form to sign up and collect email addresses.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:32,820
That's right.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,330
We're building a startup landing page.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,050
I'm going to show you how to do it step by step.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,820
And you can grab the starter files attached to this lesson because we're going to build this from scratch

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,400
and see how we can put something online that you can now share with your friends.

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,340
Next time you have a big startup idea.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,720
Let's get started.
