00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,490
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,890
So I want to get right into the foundation.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,650
So if you take a look at here, this is my color palette that I've built out.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,240
These types of things.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,510
We have to understand that design systems will continue to evolve with feedback that we get from users,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,740
from overall feedback that we get from different types of stakeholders.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,220
And generally our product will evolve over time.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,670
But what I've done here, you can see that I have a primary color palette which is like the primary

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,830
yellow, and I have a yellow that is just like a 20% version.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,780
So I've basically created these sections and I'll show you how I've even structured it.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,730
And you have this file as well.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,090
You'll see that I have these all in auto layout grids.

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,510
You have a color row and I have each individual color and then text and the color.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,110
So even within the text I have the name of the color, I have the hex value and I have the actual color.

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:11,930
Now what I've done here is once I pick the color, I'll go into my styles and I can create a new style

16
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,900
if I want to.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,550
I have a bunch of styles here already, and you've seen me do that a bunch of times already.

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,770
So this one is under the primary section.

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:27,950
I've also given myself a couple of secondary colors if I need them, which are a blue and a blue variant,

20
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,630
kind of like the yellow green and a green variant just like the yellow.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,060
One thing you don't want to do is give yourself way too many options.

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,330
I'm not saying that I will use all these variants.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,980
It helps to kind of have them, especially when you're building out an interface.

24
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,750
Now.

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,320
I'll show you how.

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,970
I'll use those in later videos.

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,780
Another thing that I've done as well is I've given myself accent colours.

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,080
Now, do I need them?

29
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,050
Maybe.

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,170
These accent colors will help us bright in different parts of the app.

31
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,120
So if we want to build like an animation with like confetti, like we can use a lot of different colors

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,720
like that.

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,860
And I don't see myself using these colors in many other instances, but you know, they're fun, playful

34
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,790
colors that we can use if we need to just inject some of that into the application when we want to.

35
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,770
And that's what I've done here.

36
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,410
I've created all these different accent colors and they're in my styles, my color styles over here.

37
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,690
So you'll see I have my primary secondary, I have my accents and I have my user interface colors as

38
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,290
well.

39
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,420
Now what are user interface colors?

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,390
And I mean, you can name them whatever you like.

41
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:44,630
I like to break these up into different sections because when I'm applying them to something and I'll

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,380
get into that as well, it's easier to pick that apart.

43
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,250
So if I have like a background that is white, I'm going to use the background white style, not just

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,900
the UI white style.

45
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,530
If I have an icon that's white, I'll probably use the white UI style.

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,550
If I have text that's white, I'll use the text white style.

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,040
So that's definitely the reason why I've decided to break these out and duplicate them.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,590
That is just so that we when we're using them, we have a lot more flexibility.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,410
Now, it might take a little bit more upfront work, but you'll have all these different styles to use

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,610
and you'll be able to easily swap out the ones that you intend to.

51
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,060
Instead of swapping out one UI color and affecting everything, you'll be able to pinpoint.

52
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:39,170
If I'm touching a button, I'll be able to just touch the text or the UI colors or the background colors

53
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,990
if I wanted to, and I'll show you how that works.

54
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:48,530
But what I've done here is I've taken out the grayscale palette and I've broken it into just different

55
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:48,980
increments.

56
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,950
So I have like a gray 100, which is basically like a block gray, 80, gray, 60, gray, 40, and

57
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,850
so on.

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,850
So this will give me a lot more to choose from when I'm using grayscale within our application.

59
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,540
In the background.

60
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,430
I've given myself a couple of different options, one being white and a nice little grey here.

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,180
And in the text section here, I've given myself a bunch of different options.

62
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,170
Now, when we spoke about accessibility, these colours may not be accessible and I may not use them,

63
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,230
but yellow can be accessible if we're using it over like a dark block or like an image.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,930
So I've given myself that option if I ever need it.

65
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,530
I've given myself definitely a green and red option for success and error colors when it comes to things

66
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,520
like forms.

67
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,640
And I've given myself a lot of variance in terms of scale because that is going to come in handy when

68
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,430
we're trying to distinguish like just create hierarchy within different text applications.

69
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,460
So title subheadings and so on.

70
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,420
So when you're building out a colour palette, or if you want to call this a colour system, remember

71
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,820
to give yourself enough variance, not too much.

72
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,650
You don't want to highlight 20 different grays.

73
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,630
I mean, that's going to muddy your design.

74
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:10,730
But I've given myself, you know, five variants of gray, and I probably use just the majority of the

75
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,720
time for text.

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,210
I'm using these three.

77
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,940
BLOCK is when I maybe need something that's really, really dark.

78
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,900
But I'll use mostly this to be my darkest, which is the great 80.

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,440
And if I want to create more hierarchy, I'll use something like a gray 60.

80
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,140
Then once we get into the 40 and 20, we have a little bit of diminishing returns because we just have

81
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,370
legibility issues.

82
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,400
So this is how I've laid out my color system.

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,360
And another thing is I've created it in a way where it just looks really nice.

84
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,030
If you can see over here, everything is spaced out like 40 pixels between each other.

85
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,890
Everything is even.

86
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,330
The borders are all very nice and spaced out perfectly.

87
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,180
So if you'll see if I change this like 50.

88
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,870
Left and right will be closer.

89
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,060
The horizontal spacing.

90
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,120
Will tighten up, but I've decided to just use 80.

91
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,830
Obviously a multiple of our base unit and I'll get into that next.

92
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,970
So that is how I've actually laid out our colours system.

93
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,510
And you'll notice that this is what it looks like when you're using your design system and when you're

94
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,060
using it elsewhere in other files.

95
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,970
So this is it.
