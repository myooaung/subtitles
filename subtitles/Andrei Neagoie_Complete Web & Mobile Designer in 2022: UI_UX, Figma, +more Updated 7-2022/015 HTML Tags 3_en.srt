00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,350
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,820
I'm excited to show you a few more tags before we get into some fun things that we can do with HTML

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,100
now and we can finish up the course.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,140
You may be wondering, Hey, what if maybe I'm working with a team and we're all working on the same

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:30,240
HTML file and I want to maybe have a comment in there to let them know that maybe here use get not post.

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:31,940
Let's capitalize.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,540
If we just do this the way it is, it's going to show up on the website.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,190
We just want it as a comment so that people who look at the code can see it without affecting the website.

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:54,180
Well, HTML has a way to comment and the way you do that is like this greater than sign, exclamation

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,840
mark.

11
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,820
Dash, dash.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,470
And then same on the other side without the exclamation mark.

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,180
Now that's kind of tedious to write and sublime text.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,690
You can do that by holding command slash.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,250
So command slash.

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,170
And you can do it that way.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:18,050
And if you have a Windows based laptop or computer, that is the Windows key and slash.

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,650
So that's how we write comments.

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,260
And if I save this and refresh.

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,170
Nothing shows up perfect.

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:37,590
And then the last two tags that I'm going to show you are the div tags for division and the span tags.

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,940
These tags are how can I say this useless right now?

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,760
And it's because they're used to divide content.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,910
So div you're going to see in a lot of web pages are used like this to let's say.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,440
Wrap.

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,510
The form.

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,680
So by doing this.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,010
Let's see if it does anything.

29
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,660
Nope.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,400
Everything looks the exact same.

31
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:16,430
But this is very powerful when we get into CSIS, because what this allows us to do is to divide up

32
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,250
our content.

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,870
Imagine if we had a registration form here, maybe another piece of content, maybe an image up here.

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:32,180
Div allows us to add styles and divide up the content into each different section so that each section

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,380
of our website can have its own little box.

36
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,570
So you're going to see this a lot in the CSS section, but for now, just keep that in mind.

37
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,800
So there's no surprises.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,410
Span is the same thing, except Span is a inline element.

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:00,350
So an inline element is different from a block element because with span we can just add it to a specific

40
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,260
line so we can do span.

41
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,740
And Span.

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,640
And again, this won't do anything if I refresh.

43
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,260
Nothing happens.

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,060
But now in line we can add some styles only to the first name and we can emphasize it.

45
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,570
So these are just tags that we can use as tools when we want to have a container, an invisible container

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:33,650
around a piece of element in our HTML that perhaps we want to add some style to or have some specific

47
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,790
functionality too.

48
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:42,110
So again, we're not going to worry about adding these to our current website, but I wanted to show

49
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,910
you that those do exist and we're going to encounter those in the CSS chapter.

50
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,650
That's it for now.

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,830
Talk to you soon.

52
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,480
Bye bye.
