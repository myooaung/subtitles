00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,860
Hello.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,960
I was a little bit excessive, but I'm very, very excited to start the course.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,460
So in this section, we're going to be talking about browsing the web.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,320
It's the first part in the How the Internet Works section.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
And some of you are thinking right now, whoa, whoa, whoa, Anjali, come on.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,020
I know how the Internet works.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,260
Let's get to the heavy, heavy technical stuff.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,090
But this is something that actually took me quite a few years to learn.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:34,360
And I see a lot of people just skimming the surface of this stuff without fully understanding how everything

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,880
works together, without having those foundations.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,890
It's actually very, very difficult to think about performance, optimizing your site and so on and

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,160
so on.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,600
So we're going to start off very, very basic and we're going to learn something that it took me many

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,380
years to learn.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,380
And once I figured this out, everything clicked.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,450
So just hang in there.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,170
Trust me.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,180
I promise you you'll learn something new in this section.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,790
And we're going to be talking about browsing the web.

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,180
We have over here a laptop and we have a web browser, let's say Google Chrome.

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,130
And we typically like to say go to Google and we're going to visit Google.

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:15,790
So we type in Google.com and well, what happens technically when we do that, when we enter Google.com,

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,400
we press enter on our keyboard, we ask a question, who's this Google.com fellow?

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,320
And that question gets asked all the way down to our ISP.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,650
ISP is internet service provider and I put a dollar sign up here.

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,370
Just so you know, those are the people that you pay so you can have Internet.

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,820
So if you're in the States, that's Cogeco, Verizon, if you're in Canada, that would be Bell or Rogers

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,930
or, you know, depending on your country, you have your big, big companies that make a lot of money

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,040
from Internet usage.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,800
So they get that request and they send that off to something called the DNS server.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,640
So domain name servers and we'll get into that later on in the course.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,260
So don't worry too much about it.

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:03,790
But essentially it's a phone book, a phone book that has the list of all these URLs like Google.com

34
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,730
and it has the addresses of them.

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,169
So exactly like a phone book.

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,789
They know where Google.com is.

37
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:15,670
So they say, hey, you know, I don't know Mr. Google.com personally, but I do know his address,

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,780
so you should go check him out.

39
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:24,010
So they send off that request back through the ISP and the website or the web browser.

40
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,160
Google Chrome in this case gets 170 2217 723 All right, cool.

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,720
But nothing showing up yet.

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,850
There's no there's no google.com.

43
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,110
I can't do any searches yet.

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:36,720
Okay.

45
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,110
We received what we call an IP address.

46
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,730
So think of this as something that every single computer has.

47
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,000
One, anything that's connected to the Internet has its own address.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,780
So the laptop that I'm working on right now has an IP address.

49
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,070
Your laptop or computer has an IP address.

50
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,110
So this IP address allows the Internet to work.

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,350
Essentially, it knows our location, our address.

52
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:06,560
So what we do now with Google.com, we know this IP address, the browser sends off another request

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,170
to the Google servers and it knows where the Google servers are because well, because we have this

54
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:19,970
address, so we go seek it out and you can think of servers as a computer is essentially my laptop could

55
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,250
be a server, your computer could be a server.

56
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:31,040
Servers are essentially computers that are sometimes in basements or in huge server farms, and they

57
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,640
have a piece of software running that just like at a restaurant where a server brings you food, it

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,240
knows how to send you files when you request for them.

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:49,310
So we send this off and the Google server say, Oh yeah, yeah, no problem, let me give you my HTML,

60
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,780
CSS and JavaScript and we'll get into what those are later on in the course.

61
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,360
But think of them as just text files.

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,210
There are text files that Google is going to send to the browser so we can have Google working.

63
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,460
So let me just minimize this and show you what it's doing.

64
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,940
So we're copying these files and Google Server saying, yeah, no problem, thanks for asking for Google.

65
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,990
Here it is.

66
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,790
And the web browser receives the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

67
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:26,360
So if we go to the next section, boom, we have Google.com and everything's working.

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,050
Now, that sounded like a whole bunch of stuff that happened in between.

69
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,360
And when we're on the internet, everything is quite fast.

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,360
But yeah, underneath the hood all of that is happening and it's crazy to think how fast everything

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,960
works.

72
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,760
Don't take my word for it.

73
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,680
Let's just check this process that I'm not just making stuff up for you.

74
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,610
If what we learned was correct technically.

75
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,950
We can skip this process, right?

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,730
I mean, if we know the address of Google, can we just you know.

77
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:07,770
Go into this directly and just instead of putting Google.com, just put in this in our search bar and

78
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,200
it automatically goes to the Google servers.

79
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,120
Well, let's try it out.

80
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,090
Let's let's open up Google here and.

81
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,260
Ooh, what a pretty picture.

82
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,750
All right, so we go to Google.com.

83
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,930
Nothing crazy here, and that's great.

84
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,170
But what if I instead of that, I put in the IP address.

85
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,620
So 172 there's no way I could remember this address.

86
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,840
So I've done this before and I press enter.

87
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,490
That Google.com.

88
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,420
So as you can see.

89
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm not lying.

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,120
It's what's happening.

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,340
The IP address gets sent to the Google servers.

92
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,750
Google's servers send us a few files so that we can finally load Google.com in the next section.

93
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,710
We're going to do something fun.

94
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,980
We're going to break a bit of Google and toy around with the website again to show you how cool all

95
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,210
of this technology is.

96
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,380
See you in the next one.

97
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,250
Bye bye.
