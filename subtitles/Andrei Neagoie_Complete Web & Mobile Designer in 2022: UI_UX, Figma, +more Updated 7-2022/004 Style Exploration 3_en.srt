1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,230
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,290
So in our last video, we talked about hierarchy and just style exploration for our cards.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,350
We did some very interesting stuff in terms of our image over here, even though we kind of admitted

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,340
to ourselves that this may not be a scalable feature, we also talked a lot about just typography in

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,640
the hierarchy that we have within our card.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,790
So we started working with what we wanted to be like in terms of what we wanted to be the main source

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,159
of like a user's attention.

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,260
So when I first come to this card, the first thing that pops to me is the actual price.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,150
I mean, stand out much more in comparison to like the product, the product name.

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,620
We also added just some description content over here.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,860
But as you can tell, there is a bunch of great hierarchy here in terms of color between something like

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,890
this, but also in terms of just size within elements.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,230
So I have a larger card here.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,440
The next thing I want to do is I want to think about like just user interests.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,150
So that's a big part of this current application that we're building for habitual.

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,220
So we haven't really touched upon that a lot and that's what I want to do next.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,850
So I'm just going to make sure that's affixed to the bottom.

18
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,010
Okay.

19
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,010
Let's just bring this just a little bit more.

20
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,350
So I'm kind of like, I'm digging this this style a bit.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,490
We may not go with this color in the background, even though it's pretty interesting, but let's think

22
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,920
about some other elements that we could build.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:46,810
I'm going to steal one of these elements, bring it out, and I'm going to have a section maybe called

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,190
like your interests.

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,070
And over here, I'm going to change that.

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,750
To like a more bolded.

27
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,120
Uh.

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,850
Well, did copy and I may have another that says like.

29
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,580
Seymour.

30
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,140
And I don't know if I have an underlined style.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:22,550
So when I'm creating these textiles, I may have underlined styles, I may have all that kind of stuff.

32
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,360
I do have a link.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,630
I think.

34
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,410
I do, yes.

35
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,610
Perfect.

36
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,090
I try to create like for different use cases.

37
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:37,430
I'm not too like strict, but I want to set some stuff up early just so it makes my life so easy.

38
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,350
And for that, I mean, we can maybe make that yellow.

39
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,780
I don't want to have our page exploding with color.

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,260
I want to keep things really simple because just the nature of our product.

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,100
Let's take a step back.

42
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,170
If we think about our product, there's a lot of images in terms of product images that could introduce

43
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,080
a bunch of color that we can't necessarily control.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,160
And if we start splashing color everywhere, it'll muddy down the experience.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,010
It'll make it really, really amateurish in a way, make it seem kind of childish.

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,390
So, you know, think about that when you're incorporating color.

47
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,280
I'm just kind of using like a dark yellow.

48
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,470
I know that's accessible.

49
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,100
So this shouldn't expand beyond here and this is fine where it currently is.

50
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,270
It's going to set the constraints on that and we're going to do is I'm just going to grip this in a

51
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,840
frame.

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:38,690
I like to keep things really neat while I'm designing, so that way I can reuse all of these types of

53
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,050
things.

54
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,810
So I've title and

55
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,540
link.

56
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,020
So this link is going to push them to like a new page, possibly

57
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,110
beautiful.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,930
Next one I'm going to do is I'm going to think about like your interest.

59
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,250
So I want a little kind of feature that maybe it has little cards in there where users can just like

60
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,780
maybe swipe through.

61
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,490
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create like a larger frame.

62
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,180
Okay.

63
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,520
And I'm just going to give it a radius of like ten pixels.

64
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:23,120
I want to give it a fill of, like, whites and an effect.

65
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,830
See, I have like I have shadows here built out as well, which is a great.

66
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,980
So we have large shadow.

67
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,580
Look at that.

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,180
Perfect.

69
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,250
So you can even make your effects shadows.

70
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,530
And we're going to get into all that much later.

71
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,200
This is just so it speeds up my workflow.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,920
It'll speed up your workflow.

73
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,290
Don't get married to anything too early, but we'll have something we can work with.

74
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,500
So that's really subtle, really beautiful.

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,290
The way that card just kind of pops up just a little bit.

76
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,630
We can start thinking about, do we want our elements to be really flat like this or do we want to actually

77
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,600
start building cards that have actual shadow?

78
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,230
So I know I'm mixing and matching a bit here and that's totally fine.

79
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:09,800
I mean, this is totally about exploring what our options are, but I want to start thinking about what

80
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,000
cards can look like as well.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,350
Like these types of cards.

82
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,400
It could translate to me building out this card differently in the future.

83
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,860
Okay, so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to give this an actual layout grid.

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,710
I don't think I have a layout grid for this, so I'm just going to create one from scratch and I'm going

85
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,440
to go to columns and just give it like three.

86
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:39,260
Three simple columns will have a margin of 16 pixels and gutter 16.

87
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,160
Okay.

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,850
Perfect.

89
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,990
And I'm just going to steal this.

90
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,420
Bring it into my frame.

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,650
So this can be like a little navigation that we can build.

92
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,250
So we have gaming.

93
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,950
I know we're kind of just defaulting to stuff like that, but it really helps.

94
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,100
Just to think about the different types of options we can have.

95
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:18,020
So if I think about this as a container, it can have multiple things like that.

96
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,480
Maybe tech is one of them.

97
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,990
Travel?

98
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,850
I don't know.

99
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:30,050
I'm just kind of spitballing here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually make this a frame

100
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:38,450
and call this like my nav, and we can do auto layout on it and we can space it by like 48 pixels so

101
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,270
we can have like a carousel thing going on here.

102
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Like, I can have another one that bleeds off, as you can tell.

103
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,260
Like I have a clipping content, so anything that bleeds off, it will show up.

104
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,910
So I have education.

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,750
So this is fine for just like a dynamic nav that we can swipe through.

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,480
We're going to make a line just to let the user know that, hey, you were on this line.

107
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,000
Sorry, this section.

108
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,840
Och.

109
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,230
And what we're going to do next is we're actually going to have some product images in here possibly.

110
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
Whoops.

111
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
That was too large.

112
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,940
So, you know, I'm probably just going to take this.

113
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,800
Make a copy of that.

114
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,540
Bring it into here.

115
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,140
Just to show you what it could look like.

116
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:44,160
So we're starting to think about like just like style from the perspective, just different types of

117
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,000
styles like we have like this full image instead of this.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,150
And I'm going to start to see like, you know, what do I like more?

119
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,250
What's something that I should probably take into account?

120
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,250
So we've been going with like price as the larger.

121
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,110
The larger element and we can stick with that.

122
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,960
I guess the more prominent element.

123
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,870
So we have product name.

124
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,590
What I'm going to do is I am going to just.

125
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,660
So.

126
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,690
Perfect.

127
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,180
And I'm just going to make sure that's there and this is not going to bleed be on that.

128
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,850
So this is going to be a frame.

129
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,059
I know there's a lot of frames, right?

130
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:43,419
And that's just so we keep things really clean and it helps us as we build fidelity, we can easily

131
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,220
edit all these different types of things.

132
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,620
Like once we start building our A design system, we can start thinking more about like, Oh, what

133
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,940
are the different types of elements we need?

134
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,900
What are the sizes?

135
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,600
Oh, I have this already built within a frame, so I can just pull this from that and just reuse and

136
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,850
make a much more consistent design.

137
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,060
So we got product details.

138
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,830
Beautiful.

139
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,190
Let's make that auto layout.

140
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,720
I mean, I like using auto layout.

141
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,190
You don't need to use all the layout.

142
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,300
Like in this case, we can probably get away with just, like, zero.

143
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,850
Um.

144
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,680
Okay, what else do we have here?

145
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,880
So we can even make this a frame?

146
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,910
We don't have to make it out of layout because it is adhering to our larger frames layout grid.

147
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,800
We can just call this x small card.

148
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,810
So we're starting to see like the details.

149
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,670
And I'm not having a description over here because it's way too small.

150
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,170
If there is a scale, then I have to think about what that looks like as well on this card.

151
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,820
So making sure this is centered.

152
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,190
This will be only affected by the left and this should only be affected by the right.

153
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,380
So if I start to move this.

154
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,610
Oops.

155
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:07,910
Interesting.

156
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,580
That's just because of the auto layout.

157
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,920
So that's another thing, although isn't necessarily responsive.

158
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,940
So keep that in mind.

159
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,090
I'm not worried because I'm using a mobile only.

160
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,610
So 16 pixels, perfect spacing.

161
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,820
And now we can actually start spacing the whole thing.

162
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,530
We can use auto oil for this whole thing if we wanted to.

163
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,710
So I'm actually going to.

164
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,060
To that.

165
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,670
I'm not going to actually use auto layout, but.

166
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,750
If I go up here and I hold a shift and down, I'm going to move in increments of four.

167
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,830
And I can just.

168
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,390
Easily position this so we have enough space.

169
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,060
Okay, so I'm going to turn off my grid because I can't really see what I've been doing.

170
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,830
So we're going to create hierarchy within this, this level of the that.

171
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,510
And as you can tell, like we started to create something really interesting here, like maybe this

172
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,040
is like a your interest card.

173
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,150
And what happens here is that for each of your interests, they'll provide like the top three products,

174
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,830
so you can just swipe through.

175
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,710
So very interesting feature that we built and I'm starting to like this kind of exploration in terms

176
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,710
of very nice, subtle shadow of the card.

177
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,290
I may actually go back to this card and update that.

178
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,710
This probably needs like maybe a light stroke.

179
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,410
What we can do here is just add that.

180
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:00,900
Um.

181
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,770
Perfect.

182
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,870
And maybe we can even think about, like, what the background could look like.

183
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,710
I mean, right now, it's standard white.

184
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,350
What happens if I just add, like, a light grey like that?

185
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,500
Things look a little differently.

186
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,680
What happens if I, like, add like a gradient?

187
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,540
So different things to think about.

188
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,760
I think White's perfectly fine right now, and that's how you create, like, just a little feature

189
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,040
from scratch, but also just kind of building upon your style exploration that we have here.

190
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,440
We can start seeing, okay, this may work.

191
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,630
I actually may like these images.

192
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,610
This is the right amount of hierarchy and I'll probably go back and test with users on this to see if

193
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,170
this interaction makes sense.

194
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,450
Like, are they swiping on the whole card?

195
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,300
Are they swiping on these little, little things?

196
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,730
And then have what is this interaction look like?

197
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,200
Is it confusing for them?

198
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,880
But that's how you kind of start to build that level of fidelity.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,760
We're going to keep on doing that in our next video.
