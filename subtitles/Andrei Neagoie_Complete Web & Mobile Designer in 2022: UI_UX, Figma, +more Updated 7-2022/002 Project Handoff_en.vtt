00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.410
Let's talk about the designer handoff or working with developers.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.450
Now, the traditional way that designers would work with developers was in what we call a silo.

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.270
That is, a designer would just work by themselves.

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.560
And then once they're done, they just hand off the designs to a developer.

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.040
And the developer just had to create these pixel perfect products based on those designs.

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.710
Now, this process isn't always the best, mainly because there's a lack of communication between developers

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.500
and designers.

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.700
Ideas can be really shared between one another.

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.030
Maybe a designer is the only one that talks to the client, and the developer has no idea what the client

10
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.630
wants.

11
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.000
So it is more and more common to see designers work much more collaboratively with developers working

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.739
in teams, maybe with product managers, with developers, with Scrum masters, so that everybody works

13
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.400
together to complete this cycle that we see here.

14
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.570
And because we always have this post launch phase where we have to iterate and learn and constantly

15
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.830
improve the product.

16
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.180
Now for a developer, it's really, really hard to go from design to actually building the product using

17
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.830
something like a programming language.

18
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:35.560
Now, at the same time, a designer might wonder why this developer can't do something that they have

19
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.220
designed.

20
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.690
Or why this developer created something that is different or slightly different than what they designed.

21
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.130
So the key to a successful designer developer handoff is as a designer to always keep the developer

22
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.790
in mind.

23
00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:00.070
So as a designer, it's actually good for you to speak with developers and design things based on what

24
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.230
can technically be done.

25
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.150
Design effectively for the platform that you're building in.

26
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.010
A developer should know enough about design theory to collaborate and have a mutual language that both

27
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.270
can speak together.

28
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:23.800
This idea of mutual understanding and respect is the key to collaboration because at the end of the

29
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.790
day, you're working together to solve a problem for a user.

30
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.860
So by you as a designer, learning what a developer has to do, you're going to be a lot better at communicating

31
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.380
with developers and vice versa, which is why we've included in the upcoming sections how HTML, CSS

32
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.070
works, how you might be able to put a website online so that when you work closely with a developer,

33
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:59.620
as you should, you're able to understand what they do, how they work, but also gives you that flexibility

34
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.660
to potentially build your own products, be your own designer and developer.

35
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.940
Now, personally, I love this quote and not sure who said it.

36
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.390
I've modified it a little bit, but this is generally just good advice when working with anybody.

37
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.790
Always design as if the person who ends up maintaining your work will be a violent psychopath.

38
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.800
Who knows where you live?

39
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:33.870
It's always important to think about who you're working with and who you're designing for so that everybody

40
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.280
ends up happy.

41
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.440
So let's learn a little bit about the Web development world in the next couple of sections.
