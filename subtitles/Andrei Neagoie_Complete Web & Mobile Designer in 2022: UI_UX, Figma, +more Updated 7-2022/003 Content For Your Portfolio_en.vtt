00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.510
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.550
So we just spoke briefly about exporting our designs, showing off our beautiful design work and stuff

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.300
like that.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.560
But really, that's not what's going to get you a job.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
People are going to hire you as a UX, UI designer, product design, whatever you want to call that

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.090
position.

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
They want to hire you for your brain, not just because you can create beautiful designs, but because

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
you can think through different types of problems and come up with great solutions.

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.330
Now, what's the best way to show that it's through an actual website or a portfolio site that you can

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.140
hand off after an interview or before an interview or during an interview?

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890
It's the best way for you to get yourself a position.

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.470
And when you show off your work on your website or your portfolio, you don't want to just show imagery.

13
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.570
You want to talk about what you did on that specific project.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.330
What was the problem, maybe the type of research that you conducted your process?

15
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.600
I can't stress how important process is.

16
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.510
If you just showed how you got to the end, nobody's going to hire you for a good position.

17
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.470
People really want to know what you did in order to get to the end.

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
So let's take a look at a bunch of different portfolio sites that I have here that are actually done

19
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.370
really well.

20
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.050
I mean, you'll notice that this one over here by Vandana is very, very simple.

21
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.130
She's a senior product designer at Spotify and literally only three projects she's chosen.

22
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.340
And if you look at them, they're not flashy, really.

23
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.800
I mean, there's nothing really crazy going on here, but you can tell there's different types of interactions

24
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.830
that she wants to talk about, different types of problems she wants to talk about.

25
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.310
And she's kind of broken them up into these things that we call a case studies.

26
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.450
And that is the approach that I definitely would take and I have taken in the past.

27
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.950
And it's been incredibly successful for me and it's been incredibly successful for colleagues I've worked

28
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.880
with in the past.

29
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.770
So let's jump right in.

30
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.990
So as you can tell, it's very simple portfolio website only work and about we have up here, if we

31
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.759
go into like reading this case study, we're going to jump right in.

32
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.490
We can see like what date it was, the name of the case study.

33
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.920
You see how they've kind of like laid out all the different types of kind of components that they've

34
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.120
designed over here.

35
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.900
I don't know what this means yet, but it's very kind of visually interesting.

36
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.570
So they have this big statement over here providing feedback like markups and commenting is a key use

37
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.830
case for collaboration.

38
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.840
But this functionality was limited in box.

39
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.380
How could we increase engagement and promote the feedback loop in box?

40
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.600
I led the redesign to extend our feature set to allow users to create annotations.

41
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.050
So already right off the bat, she's told us what the problem is.

42
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.170
What she's planning to do with her kind of role is.

43
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.240
So she's the lead and sole designer for discovery, research, design, animation and testing.

44
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.280
She's also listed the entire team.

45
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.010
So if people want to kind of maybe reach out to these people afterwards, but it also gives credit.

46
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.600
It shows that, you know, projects we rarely kind of work on them alone, even though you may be the

47
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.290
sole designer.

48
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.800
There's so many other people on that project that kind of lend their hand.

49
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.020
And it's good to give credit where credit is due.

50
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.310
If a developer came up with a solution and you help them get there, that's perfect.

51
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.770
Or maybe you want to mention that you and the developer really worked closely to build empathy across

52
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.720
the team for your user base.

53
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.380
So, I mean, this really kind of lets the person know who's viewing this that you're a team player,

54
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.440
you have a certain role within that product team and they know exactly what you've done on this project,

55
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.650
not just showing them like a screenshot like this and expecting one of us or the viewer to kind of come

56
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.400
up with that.

57
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.950
So we have a little quick animation here, just showcasing the interactions that are happening, which

58
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.610
is really nice.

59
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.390
So you can do that with any type of screen recorder like screen flow.

60
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.400
You can even use like a figma to help record this and you can cut that down with something like screen

61
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.880
flow.

62
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.670
So once again, you have like the problem statement and then she starts to write about it a little bit

63
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.830
more in depth and she's showing different portions of her solution and with a little annotations on

64
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.850
the bottom, just explaining the actual annotation that she came up with.

65
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.500
So here we go once again, just talking about creating annotation.

66
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.019
We have different types of annotations.

67
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.340
So this is a really, really good way to show off a case study.

68
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.680
Once again, we also have research exploring all that kind of stuff.

69
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.230
Process.

70
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.040
We dive deep into the general way that she iterated and got from point a all the way to like maybe point

71
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.610
B.

72
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.430
Over here.

73
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.610
So this is really a great way to show that, you know, you didn't just jump straight to high fidelity

74
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.010
or just didn't settle on one solution.

75
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.360
You had a solution.

76
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.160
And you kind of worked on it.

77
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.940
This is another perfect example of that.

78
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.570
You have your V one and the reasons they didn't work and then you got eventually to an MVP that you

79
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.200
were happy with.

80
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.820
If you could see like look at this V one all the way to the MVP, how lots has changed.

81
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.580
And she showed me what exactly went wrong with each type of prototype and how she kept on iterating

82
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.270
or to get to the MVP and then eventually over time to the final.

83
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.060
So this is definitely an amazing, amazing way to show off your work.

84
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.090
It's really in-depth.

85
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.760
It shows me that you were thinking about a lot of different things here and not just about beautiful

86
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.570
designs.

87
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.310
So here's cost controls in she's a product designer or I'm not sure if it's a she or he, but there

88
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.880
a product designer currently working on a developer experience at Stripe.

89
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.660
So another big company, once again, not a lot of projects.

90
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.400
There's several projects here.

91
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.940
They have an archive, but their big projects are at the top.

92
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.670
So let's go into I think it's pronounced Cujo, the Internet security like this nice little gift going

93
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.230
on over here.

94
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.590
So let's go right into here.

95
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.650
And one thing you'll notice with these websites, they're very simple.

96
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.800
So once again, like the role, maybe a little bit of the problem use case around this the results.

97
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.090
So this person is an actual product designer where they're also developing possibly physical products.

98
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.230
So this is for the Cujo app.

99
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.670
And once again, just going through what is happening with this application, what they plan to do with

100
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.760
it, they have these screenshots using like just the mock ups just to kind of help represent and better

101
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.020
display their work.

102
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.630
And once again, like sometimes some things are out of mockups.

103
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.520
I mean, it doesn't really matter what you choose.

104
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.270
But one thing I really like is there's kind of taking me through their process.

105
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.730
They're taking me through the flow here.

106
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.320
So also bringing out their design system a bit more and explaining the reasoning behind that.

107
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.830
And easy way to get through another project.

108
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.390
We'll go through one more.

109
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.610
This is Ryan Scott.

110
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.410
So Ryan Scott is another designer who worked for some pretty big companies.

111
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:15.310
Here we have Airbnb, DoorDash, like, look, once again, they're just giving you a really quick understanding

112
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.570
of the project.

113
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.330
It doesn't have to be like crazy with their interactions.

114
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.590
As you can tell, these people are really established or really good in their field.

115
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.540
They don't need to sell you on crazy interactions on their website.

116
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.650
Nobody really does.

117
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.190
Your work should really do the talking for you.

118
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.070
So.

119
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.380
They have something simple here.

120
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.270
And if you're really into writing like on something like medium, people often kind of post their articles

121
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.230
and what they're doing.

122
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.220
If you have talks that you want to kind of showcase, you can do that here as well.

123
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.310
So we'll just pick on one project here.

124
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.360
So big statement over here, setting Airbnb up for its next decade of growth.

125
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.320
So it just said something like mobile experience for Airbnb.

126
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.380
Like, That's cool.

127
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.410
I mean, that's a big name, but tell me a little bit more.

128
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.450
Get me excited about what I'm about to see.

129
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.250
So a nice placement of an image.

130
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.940
We have the challenge statement, his approach.

131
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.530
So like this one's even broken down to the way he specifically approached everything.

132
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.750
We have some solutions here.

133
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.360
So a simpler, unified checkout flow.

134
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.490
And like I said, designers don't need to be crazy flashy.

135
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.500
They don't need to be like, Oh, this world.

136
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.070
I mean, at the end of the day, designers need to be functional and they need to solve a problem.

137
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.990
And there's a reason why so many people use certain types of apps, because it's just that they make

138
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.710
their interactions and their micro interactions really, really delightful.

139
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.260
They make the designs really easy to use.

140
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.450
They aren't bogged down by certain things.

141
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.919
So this is an example of that.

142
00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:47.040
So we have the old iOS approach, the old mobile web approach, and then this is the new approach entirely.

143
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.290
So really simple.

144
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:56.140
And that's what I really want to showcase here, is that all these people, they have all these different

145
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.670
types of projects they want to showcase and they aren't necessarily showing like 40 different projects

146
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:07.150
that are showing one, two or three and they're showing like real work, not glorified work or anything

147
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.100
like that that's kind of like propped up.

148
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:15.790
And like just for visual aesthetics, they're actually showing you their entire process, what was before

149
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.320
and what you replaced it with.

150
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.280
They're even showing their figma components here that they've created for like a design system.

151
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.160
So I mean, they're actually showing you their their process.

152
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.220
And what I really liked over here, especially with this one, is just showing the versions and the

153
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.060
building up of that, showing you that they had something before.

154
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.130
And over time, over the course of a project, through feedback and iteration, they finally got to

155
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.550
like an MVP that they launched and then iterated on to get their final.

156
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:47.590
So when you approach a case study, don't think about it as just showing off like beautiful work.

157
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.790
Show off your process.

158
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.920
Tell me the challenge of the project.

159
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.360
Tell me your role in the project.

160
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.570
Tell me your approach, your process.

161
00:09:54.580 --> 00:10:00.820
Tell me how you got to certain solutions and maybe tell me what the old solutions look like, why this

162
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.630
one is better.

163
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.890
Show me the research.

164
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.060
I want to know everything.

165
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.560
I want to know what you did.

166
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.490
That will give me a good understanding that, hey, this person is very thoughtful, they're incredibly

167
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.300
thoughtful designer.

168
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.740
They're thinking about everything.

169
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.180
They're showing me everything.

170
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.430
They are thinking about all the different types of ways that this solution can be successful.

171
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:25.030
So go out there, create great content for your portfolio website, and just be very mindful of the

172
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:30.280
type of things that you put on there, because this kind of stuff is incredibly powerful for somebody

173
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.800
who comes in for like a design position.

174
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.760
I would definitely hire somebody like this, even if the design's not necessarily beautiful because

175
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.900
you can teach that kind of stuff.

176
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.330
That's all very trendy and it's all trend based, but you can't really like teach somebody to be really

177
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.790
passionate about very successful solution.

178
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:52.090
You can teach somebody that, but it takes a long time and this is just very, very, very thorough

179
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.660
work.

180
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.080
So be very thoughtful as a designer.
