00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.540
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.010
So you'll notice I have a little color palette over here.

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.750
Seems to be pretty minimal.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.370
And we're going to get into how we can expand upon this in a second.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.050
But I just want to talk about a couple of different situations that I run into when I'm working with

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.760
clients or a product team, you know, sometimes the client will approach me with an established color

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.480
system.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.250
In this scenario, we should always understand that product and the guidelines that come with it.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
There may be some strict limitations that we need to follow, but sometimes we have room for improvement.

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.380
The first scenario is that we have a very strict color palette like this any size of company.

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.250
I personally encounter both large and small companies that have pretty strict color palettes.

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.770
Some are great and extensive enough for digital products, and I find that's pretty rare.

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.540
Others not so much.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.850
So the first thing I like to do is to dive into that color palette, ask myself some questions Do I

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.990
have enough here?

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
Can I add some shades or some variations of the existing color palette?

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.950
The first thing to do is to go to your client and chat about what you can do to extend this palette.

18
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.110
Most times, clients will agree to expand the palette if it is truly needed, especially if you need

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.240
some variation within the product you're designing.

20
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.990
So let's see how we can come up with some neutrals for this palette over here.

21
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.970
Now, neutrals can be used for a variety of things.

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.200
Think like backgrounds.

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.510
We touched upon alternate colors for text and we can see how much of a difference that made when we

24
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.970
were creating our own monochromatic color palette.

25
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.830
So let's jump in here and we're going to see how we can expand this.

26
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.170
So let's just open up this frame just a little bit more.

27
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.980
The first thing I like to do is start with my primary color.

28
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.180
Actually, let's just bring this in the middle right here.

29
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.440
We'll often do.

30
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.800
Let's just make this a little smaller.

31
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.570
So I know they're kind of secondary.

32
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.580
You know, maybe I'll stick with the same hue and just adjust like saturation just to give myself enough

33
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.600
variety.

34
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.620
So maybe I'll use that color.

35
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.949
I could probably use that for like banners or secondary colors.

36
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.740
You know, it's just a lighter saturation than the primary.

37
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.220
I can also.

38
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.290
Get a little bit lighter here.

39
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.190
You can already see that we are starting to expand it a bit.

40
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.810
If I wanted to, I can actually start to think about, you know, just like changing that just a bit.

41
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.680
And now we're starting to get into an analogous color scheme.

42
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.780
And I find that often if you really talk to your clients and you have a good communication with them.

43
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.510
You can really kind of convince them to just expand their palette.

44
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.490
Just if it really benefits them.

45
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.360
So I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to keep on going just a bit.

46
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.430
I'm going to actually go a little bit to yellow.

47
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.160
That's nice.

48
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.440
And we can even go all the way to red if we want.

49
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.490
It's actually a lot of experimentation.

50
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.620
So don't be afraid to kind of just go in, tinker with your colors a bit to see if you can bring a little

51
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.720
more variety to your interface if it needs it.

52
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.100
You don't need to go super far.

53
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.750
Like, as you can see, I'm just kind of trailing off the path a bit just to provide myself enough variation.

54
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.340
Actually, let's just go here.

55
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.900
We're just going to duplicate that.

56
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.220
So we have, like, a block.

57
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.550
And what we can do is we can kind of just give ourselves some gray.

58
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.840
We don't need to necessarily.

59
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.000
We can actually use the same tint.

60
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.870
Whoops.

61
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.390
I intend to block just a bit.

62
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.510
If you notice, like this is really, really great.

63
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.880
But if we just go a little bit over to the orange, it starts to get a little bit more warmer.

64
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.090
So this gives us a little bit more variation.

65
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.640
And you can just move your way up.

66
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.959
Give yourself a couple of grays to work with.

67
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.600
So that way you're not necessarily stuck.

68
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.580
It happened to me, especially when I was first starting out, you know, just using a strict pallet

69
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.050
and just getting stuck and not necessarily knowing what to do.

70
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:45.210
You who you essentially have a pretty bad scenario of having like just like an oversaturated user interface

71
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.630
that's really distracting.

72
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.510
If I think about how like the use case is, like, I think like this could be used for like icon and

73
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.320
some text.

74
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.150
Maybe this is for darker text.

75
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.780
You know, you don't always want to display your copy in like a black.

76
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.150
So, I mean, this could this black could probably I mean, we don't even need to use black, to be

77
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.780
honest.

78
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.310
Let me just tint.

79
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.900
You can even use like a darker gray if we really want to create some contrast.

80
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.290
So these could be used for things like backgrounds or card backgrounds, could be used for like icon

81
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.740
and text.

82
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.940
Like I mentioned, if we want to create a little bit more contrast between our copy.

83
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.230
You know, something like this could be used, like for banners on our website, if it is a website.

84
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.950
It's good to just have some, some accents.

85
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.410
So I would say these would be like your accent colors and these would be like primary colors that you

86
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.980
go to.

87
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.780
And if you need to add a little bit more kind of spice, you know, you can bring these in if you want.

88
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.390
And you always have your trusty white if you need it, which would probably be your background color

89
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:56.080
on most pages, as you can see, like you can easily expand your color palette if you need to.

90
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.210
I mean, follow the color schemes if your client allows you to kind of add more colors that deviate

91
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.560
a bit from that palette.

92
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.800
But as you can tell, this is the primary palette.

93
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.690
And all I've done was reduce the saturation over here, get it closer to a very lighter orange.

94
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:19.690
I also started moving the hue around and provided a couple of accents if I really needed to create more

95
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.700
contrast within the UI.

96
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.380
Super easy to do.

97
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.770
Remember to sit down and have a conversation with your client.

98
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.470
You can go ahead and start doing this and present it to them, but make sure that your arguments for

99
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.330
doing this are very sound because some clients may not be as receptive as others.

100
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.550
But make sure that you drive the point home that the reason you're doing this is to give yourself more

101
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.280
flexibility when you're working within designs.

102
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.150
Go out there, try maybe pulling an existing color palette from a website, you know, try maybe like

103
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:58.450
a site like IMDB or an app like that, or maybe like Facebook, pull just the primary colors and you

104
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.220
can even expand upon that and see what else you can come up with next.

105
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.390
We're going to create our very own color palette for our own client, habitual.
